<text>Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular humanist, social democrat, and statesman who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century. Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India&#x27;s independence in 1947, he served as the country&#x27;s first prime minister for 16 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India&#x27;s arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, he wrote books such as &quot;Letters from a Father to His Daughter&quot; (1929), &quot;An Autobiography&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Discovery of India&quot; (1946), that have been read around the world.

The son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England—at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually became interested in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi, who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.

Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections and form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s decision to join the war without consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee&#x27;s Quit India Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned, and for a time, the organisation was suppressed. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi&#x27;s call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. Under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Muslim League had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections, but the League won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted as a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim prime minister of India in September 1946, with the League joining his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.

Upon India&#x27;s independence on 15 August 1947, Nehru gave a critically acclaimed speech, &quot;Tryst with Destiny&quot;; he was sworn in as the Dominion of India&#x27;s prime minister and raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi. On 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, Nehru became the Republic of India&#x27;s first prime minister. He embarked on an ambitious economic, social, and political reform programme. Nehru promoted a pluralistic multi-party democracy. In foreign affairs, he led the establishment the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the Cold War. Under Nehru&#x27;s leadership, the Congress dominated national and state-level politics and won elections in 1951, 1957 and 1962. He died in office from a heart attack in 1964. His birthday is celebrated as Children&#x27;s Day in India.

== Early life and career (1889–1912) ==
=== Birth and family background ===

Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India to mother Swarup Rani née Thussu (1868–1938) and father Motilal Nehru (1861–1931). Both parents belonged to the community of Kashmiri Pandits, or brahmins originally from the Kashmir valley. Motilal, a self-made barrister of wealth, served as president of the Indian National Congress in 1919 and 1928. Swarup Rani, raised in a family settled in Lahore, was Motilal&#x27;s second wife, the first having died in childbirth. Jawaharlal was the firstborn. Two sisters followed, the elder of which, Vijaya Lakshmi, became the first female president of the United Nations General Assembly. The younger, Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer, authoring several books on her brother.

=== Childhood ===

Nehru described his childhood to be &quot;sheltered and uneventful&quot;. He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege, which included life in the mansion Anand Bhavan in Allahabad. He was educated at home by private governesses and tutors. One of these was an Irishman, Ferdinand T. Brooks, who was interested in theosophy. The Irish Home Rule and Indian Home Rule leaguer Annie Besant initiated Jawaharlal into the Theosophical Society at age thirteen. However, his interest in theosophy was not enduring, and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor. Nehru was to write: &quot;For nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways, he influenced me greatly&quot;.

Nehru&#x27;s theosophical interests induced him to study the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. According to B. R. Nanda, these scriptures were Nehru&#x27;s &quot;first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]...[They] provided Nehru the initial impulse for [his] long intellectual quest which culminated...in &quot;The Discovery of India&quot;.&quot;

=== Youth ===

Nehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, &quot;[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm. ...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind. ... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe.&quot; Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where he was nicknamed &quot;Joe&quot;, G. M. Trevelyan&#x27;s Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit, influenced him greatly. He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: &quot;Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind, India and Italy got strangely mixed together.&quot;

=== Graduation ===
Nehru went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in natural science in 1910. During this period, he studied politics, economics, history and literature with interest. The writings of Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of his political and economic thinking.

After completing his degree in 1910, Nehru moved to London and studied law at the Inner Temple (one of the four Inns of Court to which English barristers must belong). During this time, he continued to study Fabian Society scholars including Beatrice Webb. He was called to the Bar in 1912.

=== Legal practice ===

After returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and tried to settle down as a barrister. His father was one of the wealthiest barristers in British India, with a monthly income exceeding Rs. 10,000 (£850). Although Nehru was expected to inherit the family&#x27;s lucrative practice, he had little interest in his profession, and relished neither the practice of law nor the company of lawyers. His involvement in nationalist politics was to gradually replace his legal practice. In 1945-46, he was a member of the INA Defence Committee during the INA Trials, putting on a barrister&#x27;s gown and appearing in court after over twenty-five years.

== Nationalist movement (1912–1939) ==

=== Civil rights and home rule: 1912–1919 ===
Nehru&#x27;s father, Motilal, was an important moderate leader of the Indian National Congress. The moderates believed British rule was modernising, and sought reform and more participation in government in cooperation with British authorities. However, Nehru sympathised with the Congress radicals, who promoted Swaraj, Swadesh, and boycott. The two factions had split in 1907. After returning to India in 1912, Nehru attended the annual session of the Congress at Patna. The Congress was then considered a party of moderates and elites dominated by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Nehru was disconcerted by what he saw as &quot;very much an English-knowing upper-class affair&quot;. However, Nehru agreed to raise funds for the ongoing Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa. In 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who came from a Kashmiri Pandit family settled in Delhi. Their only daughter, Indira, was born in 1917. Kamala gave birth to a son in 1924, but the baby lived for only a few days.

The influence of moderates declined after Gokhale died in 1915. Several nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to voice a demand for Swaraj or self-governance. Besant and Tilak formed separate Home Rule Leagues. Nehru joined both groups, but he worked primarily with Besant, with whom he had a very close relationship since childhood. He became the secretary of Besant&#x27;s Home Rule League. In June 1917, the British government arrested Besant. The Congress and other organisations threatened to launch protests if she was not freed. The government was forced to release Besant in September, but the protestors successfully negotiated further concessions.

=== Non-cooperation and afterwards: 1919–1929 ===
Nehru met Gandhi for the first time in 1916 at the Lucknow session of the Congress, but he had been then dissuaded by his father from being drawn into Gandhi&#x27;s satyagraha politics. 1919 marked the beginning of a strong wave of nationalist activity and subsequent government repression that included the Jallianwala Bagh killings. Motilal Nehru lost his belief in constitutional reform, and joined his son in accepting Gandhi&#x27;s methods and paramount leadership of the Congress. In December 1919, Nehru&#x27;s father was elected president of the Indian National Congress in what is regarded as &quot;the first Gandhi Congress&quot;. During the non-cooperation movement launched by Gandhi in 1920, Nehru played an influential role in directing political activities in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) as provincial Congress secretary. He was imprisoned on 6 December 1921 on charges of anti-governmental activities, marking the first of eight periods of detention between 1921 and 1945, lasting over nine years in all. In 1923, Nehru was imprisoned in Nabha, a princely state, when he went there to see the struggle that was being waged by the Sikhs against the corrupt Mahants. He was released after his sentence was unconditonally suspended by the British administration under the criminal procedure code. By 1923, Nehru had emerged as a national figure of some stature. He was elected general secretary of the Congress, president of the United Provinces Congress, and mayor of Allahabad all in the same year.

The non-cooperation movement was halted in 1922 as a result of the Chauri Chaura incident. Nehru&#x27;s two-year term as general secretary ended after 1925, and earlier that year he resigned as mayor of Allahabad due to his disillusionment with municipal politics. In 1926, Nehru left for Europe with his wife and daughter to seek treatment for his wife&#x27;s tuberculosis diagnosis. While in Europe, he was invited to attend the Congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels, Belgium. The meeting was called to coordinate and plan a common struggle against imperialism. Nehru represented India and was elected to the Executive Council of the League against Imperialism which was born at this meeting. He made a statement in favour of complete independence for India. Nehru&#x27;s stay in Europe included a visit to the Soviet Union, which sparked his interest in Marxism and socialism. Appealed by its ideas but repelled by some of its tactics, he never completely agreed with Karl Marx&#x27;s ideas. However, from that time on, the benchmark of his economic view remained Marxist, adapted, where necessary, to Indian circumstances. After returning to India in December 1927, Nehru was elected to another two-year term as Congress general secretary.

=== Declaration of independence ===
Nehru was one of the first leaders to demand that the Congress Party should resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British Empire. The Madras session of Congress in 1927, approved his resolution for independence despite Gandhi&#x27;s criticism. At that time, he formed the Independence for India League, a pressure group within the Congress. In 1928, Gandhi agreed to Nehru&#x27;s demands and proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant Dominion status to India within two years. If the British failed to meet the deadline, the Congress would call upon all Indians to fight for complete independence. Nehru was one of the leaders who objected to the time given to the British—he pressed Gandhi to demand immediate actions from the British. Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one. The British rejected demands for Dominion status in 1929. Nehru assumed the presidency of the Congress party during the Lahore session on 29 December 1929 and introduced a successful resolution calling for complete independence. Nehru drafted the Indian Declaration of Independence, which stated:

We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities for growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence.

At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of the public attending the ceremony was asked if they agreed with it, and the majority of people were witnessed raising their hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26 January as Independence Day. Congress volunteers, nationalists, and the public hoisted the flag of India publicly across India. Plans for mass civil disobedience were also underway.

After the Lahore session of the Congress in 1929, Nehru gradually emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi stepped back into a more spiritual role. Although Gandhi did not explicitly designate Nehru as his political heir until 1942, as early as the mid-1930s, the country saw Nehru as the natural successor to Gandhi. In 1929, Nehru had already drafted the &quot;Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy&quot; resolution that set the government agenda for an independent India. The resolution was ratified in 1931 at the Karachi session chaired by Vallabhbhai Patel.

=== Salt March: 1930 ===
Nehru and most of the Congress leaders were ambivalent initially about Gandhi&#x27;s plan to begin civil disobedience with a &quot;satyagraha&quot; aimed at the British salt tax. After the protest had gathered steam, they realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, &quot;It seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released&quot;. He was arrested on 14 April 1930 while on a train from Allahabad to Raipur. Earlier, after addressing a huge meeting and leading a vast procession, he had ceremoniously manufactured some contraband salt. He was charged with breach of the salt law and sentenced to six months of imprisonment at Central Jail.

He nominated Gandhi to succeed him as the Congress president during his absence in jail, but Gandhi declined, and Nehru nominated his father as his successor. With Nehru&#x27;s arrest, the civil disobedience acquired a new tempo, and arrests, firing on crowds and lathi charges grew to be ordinary occurrences.

==== Salt satyagraha success ====
The salt satyagraha (&quot;pressure for reform through passive resistance&quot;) succeeded in attracting world attention. Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly recognised the legitimacy of the claims by the Congress party for independence. Nehru considered the salt satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi, and felt its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:

Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses. ... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance. ... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole. ... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi&#x27;s leadership, must have the credit for it.

=== In prison 1930–1935 ===
On 11 October 1930, Nehru&#x27;s detention ended, but he was back in jail in less than ten days for resuming the presidency of the banned Congress. On 26 January 1931, Nehru and other prisoners were released early by Lord Irwin, who was negotiating with Gandhi. His father died on 6 February 1931. Nehru was back in jail on 26 December 1931 after violating court orders not to leave Allahabad while leading a &quot;no-rent&quot; campaign to alleviate peasant distress. On 30 August 1933, Nehru was released from prison, but the government soon moved to detain him again. On 22 December 1933, the Home Secretary sent a memo to all local governments in India:

The Government of India regard him [Nehru] as by far the most dangerous element at large in India, and their view is that the time has come, in accordance with their general policy of taking steps at an early stage to prevent attempts to work up mass agitation, to take action against him.

He was arrested in Allahabad on 12 January 1934. In August 1934, he was briefly released for eleven days to attend to his wife&#x27;s ailing health. In October, he was allowed to see her again, but he turned down an early release conditional on withdrawing from politics for the duration of his sentence.

=== Congress president, provincial elections: 1935–1939 ===

In September 1935, Nehru&#x27;s wife, Kamala, became terminally ill while receiving medical treatment in Badenweiler, Germany. Nehru was released from prison early on compassionate grounds, and moved his wife to a sanatorium in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she died on 28 February 1936. While in Europe, Nehru learned that he was elected as Congress president for the coming year. He returned to India in March 1936 and led the Congress response to the Government of India Act 1935. He condemned the Act as a &quot;new charter of bondage&quot; and a &quot;machine with strong brakes but no engine&quot;. He initially wanted to boycott the 1937 provincial elections, but agreed to lead the election campaign after receiving vague assurances about abstentionism from the party leaders who wished to contest. Nehru hoped to treat the election campaign as a mass outreach programme.

During the campaign, Nehru was elected to another term as Congress president. The election manifesto, drafted largely by Nehru, attacked both the Act and the Communal Award that went with it. He campaigned against the Muslim League, and argued that Muslims could not be regarded as a separate nation. The Congress won most general seats, and the Muslim League fared poorly with Muslim electorates. After the elections, Nehru drafted a resolution against taking office, but there were many Congress leaders who wanted to assume power under the 1935 Act. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) under Gandhi passed a compromise resolution that authorised office acceptance, but reiterated that the fundamental objective of the Congress was the destruction of the 1935 Act.

Nehru was more popular than before with the public, but he found himself isolated at the CWC meetings due to the anti-socialist orientation of its membership. Gandhi had to personally intervene when a group of CWC members and Nehru threatened to resign and counter-resign their posts over disagreements. He became discontented with his role, especially after the death of his mother in January 1938. In February 1938, he did not stand for re-election as president, and was succeeded by Subash Chandra Bose. He left for Europe in June, stopping on the way at Alexandria, Egypt. While in Europe, Nehru became very concerned with the possibility of another world war. At that time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India&#x27;s place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a free country. After returning to India in December 1938, Nehru accepted Bose&#x27;s offer to head the Planning Commission. In February 1939, he became president of the All India States Peoples Conference (AISPC), which was leading popular agitations in princely states. Nehru was not directly involved in the events that split the Congress during the Bose presidency, and unsuccessfully attempted to mediate.

== Nationalist movement (1939–1947) ==

When World War II began, Viceroy Linlithgow unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. Nehru hurried back from a visit to China, announcing that, in a conflict between democracy and fascism, &quot;our sympathies must inevitably be on the side of democracy, ... I should like India to play its full part and throw all her resources into the struggle for a new order&quot;.

After much deliberation, the Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would co-operate with the British but on certain conditions. First, Britain must give an assurance of full independence for India after the war and allow the election of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution; second, although the Indian armed forces would remain under the British Commander-in-chief, Indians must be included immediately in the central government and given a chance to share power and responsibility. When Nehru presented Lord Linlithgow with these demands, he chose to reject them. A deadlock was reached: &quot;The same old game is played again,&quot; Nehru wrote bitterly to Gandhi, &quot;the background is the same, the various epithets are the same and the actors are the same and the results must be the same&quot;.

On 23 October 1939, the Congress condemned the Viceroy&#x27;s attitude and called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest, but Jinnah declined.

=== Civil disobedience, Lahore Resolution, August Offer: 1940 ===

In March 1940, Muhammad Ali Jinnah passed what came to be known as the Pakistan Resolution, declaring that, &quot;Muslims are a nation according to any definition of a nation, and they must have their homelands, their territory and their State.&quot; This state was to be known as Pakistan, meaning &#x27;Land of the Pure&#x27;. Nehru angrily declared that &quot;all the old problems ... pale into insignificance before the latest stand taken by the Muslim League leader in Lahore&quot;. Linlithgow made Nehru an offer on 8 October 1940, which stated that Dominion status for India was the objective of the British government. However, it referred neither to a date nor a method to accomplish this. Only Jinnah received something more precise: &quot;The British would not contemplate transferring power to a Congress-dominated national government, the authority of which was denied by various elements in India&#x27;s national life&quot;.

In October 1940, Gandhi and Nehru, abandoning their original stand of supporting Britain, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Nehru was arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi stated:

Some say Jawaharlal and I were estranged. It will require much more than a difference of opinion to estrange us. We had differences from the time we became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor. After spending a little more than a year in jail, Nehru was released, along with other Congress prisoners, three days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

=== Japan attacks India, Cripps&#x27; mission, Quit India: 1942 ===

When the Japanese carried their attack through Burma (now Myanmar) to the borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced with this new military threat, decided to make some overtures to India, as Nehru had originally desired. Prime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. As soon as he arrived, he discovered that India was more deeply divided than he had imagined. Nehru, eager for a compromise, was hopeful; Gandhi was not. Jinnah had continued opposing the Congress: &quot;Pakistan is our only demand, and by God, we will have it,&quot; he declared in the Muslim League newspaper &quot;Dawn&quot;. Cripps&#x27; mission failed as Gandhi would accept nothing less than independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter&#x27;s refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled.

In 1942, Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Most of the Congress working committee including Nehru, Abdul Kalam Azad, and Sardar Patel were incarcerated at the Ahmednagar Fort until 15 June 1945.

=== In prison 1943–1945 ===

During the period when all the Congress leaders were in jail, the Muslim League under Jinnah grew in power. In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North-West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority—only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim-dominated provinces except Punjab under Jinnah&#x27;s control, the concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah&#x27;s power and prestige were waning.

A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died had been laid on the shoulders of the province&#x27;s Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah&#x27;s meetings, once counted in thousands, soon numbered only a few hundred. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. His prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There, he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan—but not in so many words. Jinnah demanded that the exact words be used. Gandhi refused and the talks broke down. Jinnah, however, had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of the Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms.

=== Cabinet mission, Interim government 1946–1947 ===

Nehru and his colleagues were released prior to the arrival of the British 1946 Cabinet Mission to India to propose plans for the transfer of power. The agreed plan in 1946 led to elections to the provincial assemblies. In turn, the members of the assemblies elected members of the Constituent Assembly. Congress won the majority of seats in the assembly and headed the interim government, with Nehru as the prime minister. The Muslim League joined the government later with Liaquat Ali Khan as the Finance member.

== Prime Minister of India (1947–1964) ==

Nehru served as prime minister for 16 years, initially as the interim prime minister, then from 1947 as the prime minister of the Dominion of India and then from 1950 as the prime minister of the Republic of India.

=== Republicanism ===

Nehru showed his concern for the princely states of South Asia since 1920s. During his Presidential Address at the Lahore session in 1929, Nehru had declared that, &quot;The Indian States cannot live apart from the rest of India and their rulers must, unless they accept their inevitable limitations, go the way of others like them.&quot;

In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings. In May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon were more conciliatory towards the princes, and as the men charged with integrating the states, were successful in the task. During the drafting of the Indian constitution, many Indian leaders (except Nehru) were in favour of allowing each princely state or covenanting state to be independent as a federal state along the lines suggested originally by the Government of India Act 1935. But as the drafting of the constitution progressed, and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape, it was decided that all the princely states/covenanting states would merge with the Indian republic.

In 1963, Nehru brought in legislation making it illegal to demand secession and introduced the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution which makes it necessary for those running for office to take an oath that says &quot;I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India&quot;.

=== Independence, Dominion of India: 1947–1950 ===
The period before independence in early 1947 was impaired by outbreaks of communal violence and political disorder, and the opposition of the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who were demanding a separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

==== Independence ====

He took office as the prime minister of India on 15 August and delivered his inaugural address titled &quot;Tryst with Destiny&quot;.

Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.

==== Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi: 1948 ====

On 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot while he was walking in the garden of Birla House on his way to address a prayer meeting. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha party, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan. Nehru addressed the nation by radio:

Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me but for millions and millions in this country.

Yasmin Khan argued that Gandhi&#x27;s death and funeral helped consolidate the authority of the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period—the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr&#x27;s ashes with millions participating in different events. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the Congress party&#x27;s control and suppress all religious paramilitary groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi&#x27;s death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and helped them to understand the need to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence for the Indian people. In later years, there emerged a revisionist school of history which sought to blame Nehru for the partition of India, mostly referring to his highly centralised policies for an independent India in 1947, which Jinnah opposed in favour of a more decentralised India.

==== Integration of states and Adoption of New Constitution: 1947–1950 ====
The British Indian Empire, which included present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, was divided into two types of territories: the provinces of British India, which were governed directly by British officials responsible to the Viceroy of India; and princely states, under the rule of local hereditary rulers who recognised British suzerainty in return for local autonomy, in most cases as established by a treaty. Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union under Nehru and Sardar Patel. Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal and Bilaspur, became separate provinces. The Government of India Act 1935 remained the constitutional law of India the pending adoption of a new Constitution.
In December 1946, Nehru moved the Objectives Resolution. This resolution, upon Nehru&#x27;s suggestion, ultimately turned into the Preamble to the Constitution of India. The preamble is considered to be the spirit of the constitution. The new Constitution of India, which came into force on 26 January 1950 (Republic Day), made India a sovereign democratic republic. The new republic was declared to be a &quot;Union of States&quot;.

=== Election of 1952 ===

After the adoption of the constitution on 26 November 1949, the Constituent Assembly continued to act as the interim parliament until new elections. Nehru&#x27;s interim cabinet consisted of 15 members from diverse communities and parties. The first elections to Indian legislative bodies (National parliament and State assemblies ) under the new constitution of India were held in 1952. The Congress party under Nehru&#x27;s leadership won a large majority at both state and national levels.

===Prime Minister: 1952–1957===
In December 1953, Nehru appointed the States Reorganisation Commission to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines. Headed by Justice Fazal Ali, the commission itself was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission. Govind Ballabh Pant, who served as Nehru&#x27;s home minister from December 1954, oversaw the commission&#x27;s efforts. The commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India&#x27;s states.

Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as &quot;states&quot;s. A new type of entity, the &quot;union territory&quot;, replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state. Nehru stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism, refusing to reorganise states on either religious or ethnic lines.

=== Subsequent elections: 1957, 1962 ===
In the 1957 elections, under Nehru&#x27;s leadership, the Indian National Congress easily won a second term in power, taking 371 of the 494 seats. They gained an extra seven seats (the size of the Lok Sabha had been increased by five) and their vote share increased from 45.0% to 47.8%. The INC won nearly five times more votes than the Communist Party, the second-largest party.

In 1962, Nehru led the Congress to victory with a diminished majority. The numbers who voted for the Communist and socialist parties grew, although some right-wing groups like Bharatiya Jana Sangh also did well.

=== 1961 annexation of Goa ===

After years of failed negotiations, Krishna Menon ordered the Indian Army to invade Portuguese-controlled Portuguese India (Goa) in 1961, after which Nehru formally annexed it to India. It increased the popularity of both in India, but he was criticised by the communist opposition in India for the use of military force.

=== Sino-Indian War of 1962 ===

From 1959, in a process that accelerated in 1961, Nehru adopted the &quot;Forward Policy&quot; of setting up military outposts in disputed areas of the Sino-Indian border, including 43 outposts in territory not previously controlled by India. China attacked some of these outposts, and the Sino-Indian War began, which India lost. The war ended with China announcing a unilateral ceasefire and with its forces withdrawing to 20 kilometres behind the line of actual control of 1959.

The war exposed the unpreparedness of India&#x27;s military, which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the much larger Chinese Army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government&#x27;s insufficient attention to defence. In response, defence minister V. K. Krishna Menon resigned and Nehru sought US military aid. Nehru&#x27;s improved relations with the US under John F. Kennedy proved useful during the war, as in 1962, the president of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) Ayub Khan was made to guarantee his neutrality regarding India, threatened by &quot;communist aggression from Red China&quot;. India&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies, was also seemingly validated. Nehru would continue to maintain his commitment to the non-aligned movement, despite calls from some to settle down on one permanent ally.

The unpreparedness of the army was blamed on Defence Minister Menon, who &quot;resigned&quot; from his government post to allow for someone who might modernise India&#x27;s military further. India&#x27;s policy of weaponisation using indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under Nehru, completed by his daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over rival Pakistan in 1971. Toward the end of the war, India had increased her support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. Nehru ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained &quot;Tibetan Armed Force&quot; composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.

=== Popularity ===


To date, Nehru is considered the most popular prime minister, winning three consecutive elections with around 45% of the vote. A Pathé News archive video reporting Nehru&#x27;s death remarks &quot;Neither on the political stage nor in moral stature was his leadership ever challenged&quot;. In his book &quot;Verdicts on Nehru&quot;, Ramachandra Guha cited a contemporary account that described what Nehru&#x27;s 1951–52 Indian general election campaign looked like:

Almost at every place, city, town, village or wayside halt, people had waited overnight to welcome the nation&#x27;s leader. Schools and shops closed; milkmaids and cowherds had taken a holiday; the kisan and his helpmate took a temporary respite from their dawn-to-dusk programme of hard work in field and home. In Nehru&#x27;s name, stocks of soda and lemonade sold out; even water became scarce ... Special trains were run from out-of-the-way places to carry people to Nehru&#x27;s meetings, enthusiasts travelling not only on footboards but also on top of carriages. Scores of people fainted in milling crowds.

In the 1950s, Nehru was admired by world leaders such as British prime minister Winston Churchill, and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. A letter from Eisenhower to Nehru, dated 27 November 1958, read:

Universally you are recognised as one of the most powerful influences for peace and conciliation in the world. I believe that because you are a world leader for peace in your individual capacity, as well as a representative of the largest neutral nation...

In 1955, Churchill called Nehru, the light of Asia, and a greater light than Gautama Buddha. Nehru is time and again described as a charismatic leader with a rare charm.

== Vision and governing policies ==

Nehru is credited with having prevented civil wars in India. Nehru convincingly succeeded in secularism and religious harmony, increasing the representation of minorities in government.

However, the reign of Nehru witnessed a slow economic growth rate known as the Nehruvian rate of growth. Some experts contribute his socialist policies to a slow GDP growth rate of India until economic liberalism.

=== Economic policies ===


Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector. He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies. Nehru&#x27;s vision of an egalitarian society was &quot;a co-operative ideal, a one world ideal, based on social justice and economic equality&quot;. In 1928, Nehru had affirmed that &quot;Our economic programme must aim at the removal of all economic inequalities&quot;. Later in 1955, he declared that &quot;I also want a classess society in India and the world.&quot; He identified his concept of economic freedom with the country&#x27;s economic development and material advancement.

The policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India&#x27;s industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with assistance from the Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. The industry grew 7.0% annually between 1950 and 1965—almost trebling industrial output and making India the world&#x27;s seventh-largest industrial country. Nehru&#x27;s critics, however, contended that India&#x27;s import substitution industrialisation, which continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. India&#x27;s share of world trade fell from 1.4% in 1951–1960 to 0.5% between 1981 and 1990. However, India&#x27;s export performance is argued to have shown actual sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in 1951–1960 to 7.6% in 1971–1980.

GDP and GNP grew 3.9 and 4.0% annually between 1950 and 1951 and 1964–1965. It was a radical break from the British colonial period, but the growth rates were considered anaemic at best compared to other industrial powers in Europe and East Asia. India lagged behind the miracle economies (Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy). However, this mixed development strategy allowed native industrialisation to gain ground. While India&#x27;s economy grew faster than both the United Kingdom and the United States, low initial income and rapid population increase meant that growth was inadequate for any sort of catch-up with rich income nations. India saw significant improvements in health, literacy and life expectancy since its independence.

=== Agriculture policies ===
Under Nehru&#x27;s leadership, the government attempted to develop India quickly by embarking on agrarian reform and rapid industrialisation. A successful land reform was introduced that abolished giant landholdings, but efforts to redistribute land by placing limits on landownership failed. Attempts to introduce large-scale cooperative farming were frustrated by landowning rural elites, who formed the core of the powerful right-wing of the Congress and had considerable political support in opposing Nehru&#x27;s efforts. Agricultural production expanded until the early 1960s, as additional land was brought under cultivation and some irrigation projects began to have an effect. The establishment of agricultural universities, modelled after land-grant colleges in the United States, contributed to the development of the economy. These universities worked with high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, initially developed in Mexico and the Philippines, that in the 1960s began the Green Revolution, an effort to diversify and increase crop production. At the same time, a series of failed monsoons would cause serious food shortages, despite the steady progress and an increase in agricultural production.

=== Social policies ===
==== Education ====
Nehru was a passionate advocate of education for India&#x27;s children and youth, believing it essential for India&#x27;s future progress. His government oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology. Nehru also outlined a commitment in his five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India&#x27;s children. For this purpose, Nehru oversaw the creation of mass village enrolment programs and the construction of thousands of schools. Nehru also launched initiatives such as the provision of free milk and meals to children to fight malnutrition. Adult education centres and vocational and technical schools were also organised for adults, especially in the rural areas.

====Hindu code bills and marriage laws====
Under Nehru, the Indian Parliament enacted many changes to Hindu law through the Hindu code bills to criminalise caste discrimination and increase the legal rights and social freedoms of women. The Nehru administration saw such codification as necessary to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying the nation. They succeeded in passing four Hindu code bills in 1955–56: the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Those who practise Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism are categorised as Hindus under the jurisdiction of the Code Bill.

Nehru specifically wrote Article 44 of the Indian constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy which states: &quot;The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.&quot; The article has formed the basis of secularism in India. However, Nehru has been criticised for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, he allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. In the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Nehru prohibited Muslim personal law. This resulted from the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.

While Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he passed the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, demonstrating how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and keep the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act, polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim personal law. Divorce would be governed by secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in civil law.

==== Language policy ====
The Constituent assembly debated the question of national language between 1946 and 1949. Within the assembly there were two blocs, pro-Hindi and anti-Hindi. The pro-Hindi bloc was further divided between supporters of Hindustani led by Nehru, and supporters of Modern Standard Hindi based on Sanskrit. The anti-Hindi bloc was generally in favour of promoting English to an official status. Nehru stated that &quot;We must have our own language...but English must continue to be a most important language in India which large numbers of people learn and learn perhaps compulsorily&quot;. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official rather than national language of India in 1950, with English continuing as an associate official language for 15 years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The Hindi-Hindustani debate was resolved through a compromise that the official language would be called Hindi, with a directive clause that while Sanskrit would be the primary source of vocabulary, the traditional Hindustani vocabulary would also be supported. Claims of other Indian languages were upheld through the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

Efforts by the Indian government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were unacceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, which wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism that future administrations might not honour his assurances. The Congress government headed by Indira Gandhi eventually amended the Official Languages Act in 1967 to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current &quot;virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism&quot; of the Indian Republic.

=== Foreign policy ===
Throughout his long tenure as the prime minister, Nehru also held the portfolio of External Affairs. His idealistic approach focused on giving India a leadership position in nonalignment. He sought to build support among the newly independent nations of Asia and Africa in opposition to the two hostile superpowers contesting the Cold War.

==== The Commonwealth ====

After independence, Nehru wanted to maintain good relations with Britain and other British Commonwealth countries. As prime minister of the Dominion of India, he acquiesced only after Krishna Menon&#x27;s redrafting of the 1949 London Declaration, under which India agreed to remain within the Commonwealth of Nations after becoming a republic in January 1950, and to recognise the British monarch as a &quot;symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. The other nations of the Commonwealth recognised India&#x27;s continuing membership of the association.

==== Non-aligned movement ====

On the international scene, Nehru was an opponent of military action and military alliances. He was a strong supporter of the United Nations, except when it tried to resolve the Kashmir question. He pioneered the policy of non-alignment and co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. The term &quot;non-alignment&quot; was coined earlier by V. K. Krishna Menon at the United Nations in 1953 and 1954. India recognised the People&#x27;s Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with Taiwan). Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in the west&#x27;s conflict with Korea. He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950 and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.

Nehru was a key organiser of the Bandung Conference of April 1955, which brought 29 newly independent nations together from Asia and Africa, and was designed to galvanise the nonalignment movement under Nehru&#x27;s leadership. He envisioned it as his key leadership opportunity on the world stage, where he would bring together emerging nations. He was one of the key participants of the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia.

==== Defence and nuclear policy ====
While averse to war, Nehru led the campaigns against Pakistan in Kashmir. He used military force to annexe Hyderabad in 1948 and Goa in 1961. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated:We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi...but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defence methods and a well-equipped army, navy, and air force.&quot;

Nehru entrusted Homi J. Bhabha, a nuclear physicist, with complete authority over all nuclear-related affairs and programs and answerable only to the prime minister.

Many hailed Nehru for working to defuse global tensions and the threat of nuclear weapons after the Korean War (1950–1953). He commissioned the first study of the effects of nuclear explosions on human health and campaigned ceaselessly for the abolition of what he called &quot;these frightful engines of destruction&quot;. He also had pragmatic reasons for promoting de-nuclearization, fearing a nuclear arms race would lead to over-militarisation that would be unaffordable for developing countries such as his own.

==== Defending Kashmir ====
At Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s urging, in 1948, Nehru had promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under the auspices of the UN. Kashmir was a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, the two have gone to war over it in 1947. However, as Pakistan failed to pull back troops in accordance with the UN resolution, and as Nehru grew increasingly wary of the UN, he declined to hold a plebiscite in 1953. His policies on Kashmir and the integration of the state into India were frequently defended before the United Nations by his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches.

In 1953, Nehru orchestrated the ouster and arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the prime minister of Kashmir, whom he had previously supported but was now suspected of harbouring separatist ambitions; Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad replaced him.

Menon was instructed to deliver an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India&#x27;s stand on Kashmir in 1957; to date, the speech is the longest ever delivered in the United Nations Security Council, covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, reportedly concluding with Menon&#x27;s collapse on the Security Council floor. During the filibuster, Nehru moved swiftly and successfully to consolidate Indian power in Kashmir (then under great unrest). Menon&#x27;s passionate defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his base of support in India and led to the Indian press temporarily dubbing him the &quot;Hero of Kashmir&quot;. Nehru was then at the peak of his popularity in India; the only (minor) criticism came from the far right.

==== China ====

In 1954, Nehru signed with China the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known in India as the Panchsheel (from the Sanskrit words, &quot;panch&quot;: five,&quot; sheel&quot;: virtues), a set of principles to govern relations between the two states. Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954, which recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. They were enunciated in the preamble to the &quot;Agreement (with the exchange of notes) on Trade and Intercourse between Tibet Region of China and India&quot;, which was signed at Peking on 29 April 1954. Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the relations between the two countries regarding the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and South Tibet. By 1957, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had also persuaded Nehru to accept the Chinese position on Tibet, thus depriving Tibet of a possible ally, and of the possibility of receiving military aid from India. The treaty was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in China–India relations, and more generally as norms of relations between states. They became widely recognised and accepted throughout the region during the premiership of Indira Gandhi and the three-year rule of the Janata Party (1977–1980). Although the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, Nehru&#x27;s foreign policy suffered from increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and his decision to grant asylum to the 14th Dalai Lama.

==== United States ====
In 1956, Nehru criticised the joint invasion of the Suez Canal by the British, French, and Israelis. His role, both as Indian prime minister and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides while vigorously denouncing Anthony Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US President Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America&#x27;s clout at the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. During the Suez crisis, Nehru&#x27;s right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.

== Assassination attempts and security ==

There were various assassination attempts on Nehru. The first attempt was made during partition in 1947 while he was visiting the North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) in a car. The second attempt came from Baburao Laxman Kochale, a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller, near Nagpur in 1955. The third attempt was a plot by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1955. The fourth attempt took place in Bombay in 1956, and the fifth was a failed bombing attempt on train tracks in Maharashtra in 1961. Despite threats to his life, Nehru despised having too much security around him and did not like to disrupt traffic because of his movements.

== Death ==

Nehru&#x27;s health began declining steadily in 1962. In the spring of 1962, he was affected with a viral infection over which he spent most of April in bed. In the next year, through 1963, he spent months recuperating in Kashmir. Some writers attribute this dramatic decline to his surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War, which he perceived as a betrayal of trust. Upon his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964, he was feeling quite comfortable and went to bed at about 23:30 as usual. He had a restful night until about 06:30. Soon after he returned from the bathroom, Nehru complained of pain in the back. He spoke to the doctors who attended to him for a brief while, and almost immediately he collapsed. He remained unconscious until he died at 13:44. His death was announced in the Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964; the cause of death was believed to be a heart attack. Draped in the Indian national Tri-colour flag, the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed for public viewing. &quot;Raghupati Raghava Rajaram&quot; was chanted as the body was placed on the platform. On 28 May, Nehru was cremated in accordance with Hindu rites at the Shantivan on the banks of the Yamuna, witnessed by 1.5 million mourners who had flocked into the streets of Delhi and the cremation grounds.

US President Lyndon B. Johnson remarked on his death:-

History has already recorded his monumental contribution to the molding of a strong and independent India. And yet, it is not just as a leader of India that he has served humanity. Perhaps more than any other world leader he has given expression to man&#x27;s yearning for peace. This is the issue of our age. In his fearless pursuit of a world free from war he has served all humanity.

Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the future Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev remarked:-

The name of Jawaharal Nehru enjoyed the tremendous respect and love of the Soviet people, who knew him as a tested and wise leader of the Indian people&#x27;s struggle for national independence and the rebirth of their country, and as an active fighter against colonialism. Jawaharal Nehru is known as an outstanding statesman of modern times who devoted his entire life to the struggle for strengthening friendship and cooperation among peoples and for the progress of humanity. He was a passionate fighter for peace in the world and an ardent champion of principles of peaceful coexistence of states. He was the inspirer of the nonalignment policy promoted by the Indian Government. This reasonable policy won India respect and, due to it, India is now occupying a worthy place in the international arena.

Countries such as Egypt, Cambodia, Nepal, Kuwait, Bhutan, Kingdom of Sikkim, Nepal, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Uganda, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India and others declared national mourning over the death of Nehru.

Nehru&#x27;s death left India with no clear political heir to his leadership. Lal Bahadur Shastri later succeeded Nehru as the prime minister.

The death was announced to the Indian parliament in words similar to Nehru&#x27;s own at the time of Gandhi&#x27;s assassination: &quot;The light is out.&quot; India&#x27;s future prime minister and then a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh Atal Bihari Vajpayee famously delivered Nehru an acclaimed eulogy. After Nehru&#x27;s death, Vajpayee made a speech in the Rajya Sabha, hailing Nehru as Bharat Mata&#x27;s &quot;favourite prince&quot; and likened him to the Hindu god Rama.

==Positions held==
== Key cabinet members and associates ==
Nehru served as the prime minister for eighteen years, first as interim prime minister during 1946–1947 during the last year of the British Raj and then as prime minister of independent India from 15 August 1947 to 27 May 1964.

V. K. Krishna Menon (1896–1974) was a close associate of Nehru, and was described as the second most powerful man in India during Nehru&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. From the inception of Nehru&#x27;s prime ministry, Menon carefully selected Lord Mountbatten as the only suitable candidate and presented him as such to Labour through Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee, who promptly appointed him the last Viceroy. the early governance and partition ultimately reduced to Mountbatten, Nehru, Menon, V.P. Menon, Sardar Patel, and an adamant Jinnah. Under Nehru, he served as India&#x27;s high commissioner to the UK, ambassador to Ireland, ambassador-at-large and plenipotentiary, UN ambassador, minister without portfolio, &quot;de facto&quot; Foreign minister, and Union minister of defence. He was significantly involved in the annexation of Goa. He resigned after the debacle of the 1962 China War but remain a close friend of Nehru.

B. R. Ambedkar, the law minister in the interim cabinet, also chaired the Constitution Drafting Committee.

Vallabhbhai Patel served as home minister in the interim government. He was instrumental in getting the Congress party working committee to vote for partition. He is also credited with integrating many princely states of India. Patel was a long-time comrade to Nehru but died in 1950, leaving Nehru as the unchallenged leader of India until his own death in 1964.

Syama Prasad Mukherjee served as the first Minister for Industry and Supply in the first ministry of Nehru. After resigning from the cabinet, he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1951, the forefunner of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Maulana Azad was the First Minister of Education in the Indian government Minister of Human Resource Development (until 25 September 1958, Ministry of Education). His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India.

Jagjivan Ram became the youngest minister in Nehru&#x27;s Interim Government of India, a labour minister and also a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, where, as a member of the Dalit caste, he ensured that social justice was enshrined in the Constitution. He went on to serve as a minister with various portfolios during Nehru&#x27;s tenure and in Shastri and Indira Gandhi governments.

Morarji Desai was a nationalist with anti-corruption leanings but was socially conservative, pro-business, and in favour of free enterprise reforms, as opposed to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s socialistic policies. After serving as chief minister of Bombay State, he joined Nehru&#x27;s cabinet in 1956 as the finance minister of India. he held that position until 1963 when he along with other senior ministers in the Nehru cabinet resigned under the Kamaraj plan.The plan, as proposed by Madras Chief Minister K.Kamaraj, was to revert government ministers to party positions after a certain tenure and vice versa. With Nehru&#x27;s age and health failing in the early 1960s, Desai was considered a possible contender for the position of Prime Minister. Later Desai alleged that Nehru used the Kamaraj Plan to remove all possible contenders &#x27;from the path of his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Desai succeeded Indira Gandhi as the prime minister in 1977 when he was selected by the victorious Janata alliance as their parliamentary leader.

Govind Ballabh Pant (1887–1961) was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and later a pivotal figure in the politics of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and in the Indian Government. Pant served in Nehru&#x27;s cabinet as Union home minister from 1955 until his death in 1961. As home minister, his chief achievement was the re-organisation of states along linguistic lines. He was also responsible for the establishment of Hindi as the official language of the central government and a few states. During his tenure as the home minister, Pant was awarded the Bharat Ratna.

C. D. Deshmukh was one of five members of the Planning Commission when it was constituted in 1950 by a cabinet resolution. Deshmukh succeeded John Mathai as the Union Finance Minister in 1950 after Mathai resigned in protest over the transfer of certain powers to the Planning Commission. As finance minister, Deshmukh remained a member of the Planning Commission. Deshmukh&#x27;s tenure—during which he delivered six budgets and an interim budget—is noted for the effective management of the Indian economy and its steady growth which saw it recover from the impacts of the events of the 1940s. During Deshmukh&#x27;s tenure, the State Bank of India was formed in 1955 through the nationalisation and amalgamation of the Imperial Bank with several smaller banks. He accomplished the nationalisation of insurance companies and the formation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India through the Life Insurance Corporation of India Act, 1956. Deshmukh resigned over the Government&#x27;s proposal to move a bill in Parliament bifurcating Bombay State into Gujarat and Maharashtra while designating the city of Bombay a Union territory.

In the years following independence, Nehru frequently turned to his daughter Indira Gandhi for managing his personal affairs. Indira moved into Nehru&#x27;s official residence to attend to him and became his constant companion in his travels across India and the world. She would virtually become Nehru&#x27;s chief of staff. Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the president of the Congress. In that capacity, she was instrumental in getting the Communist-led Kerala State Government dismissed in 1959. Indira was elected as Congress party president in 1959, which aroused criticism for alleged nepotism, although Nehru had actually disapproved of her election, partly because he considered that it smacked of &quot;dynasticism&quot;; he said, indeed it was &quot;wholly undemocratic and an undesirable thing&quot;, and refused her a position in his cabinet. Indira herself was at loggerheads with her father over policy; most notably, she used his oft-stated personal deference to the Congress Working Committee to push through the dismissal of the Communist Party of India government in the state of Kerala, over his own objections. Nehru began to be embarrassed by her ruthlessness and disregard for parliamentary tradition and was &quot;hurt&quot; by what he saw as an assertiveness with no purpose other than to stake out an identity independent of her father.

== Religious and personal beliefs ==
Described as a Hindu agnostic, and styling himself as a &quot;scientific humanist&quot;, Nehru thought that religious taboos were preventing India from moving forward and adapting to modern conditions: &quot;No country or people who are slaves to dogma and dogmatic mentality can progress, and unhappily our country and people have become extraordinarily dogmatic and little-minded.&quot;

As a humanist, Nehru considered that his afterlife was not in some mystical heaven or reincarnation but in the practical achievements of a life lived fully with and for his fellow human beings: &quot;...Nor am I greatly interested in life after death. I find the problems of this life sufficiently absorbing to fill my mind,&quot; he wrote. In his Last Will and Testament, he wrote: &quot;I wish to declare with all earnestness that I do not want any religious ceremonies performed for me after my death. I do not believe in such ceremonies, and to submit to them, even as a matter of form, would be hypocrisy and an attempt to delude ourselves and others.&quot;

In his autobiography, he analysed Abrahamic and Indian religions and their impact on India. He wanted to model India as a secular country; his secularist policies remain a subject of debate mainly by the Hindutva proponents.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1948, Nehru was conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Mysore. He later received honorary doctorates from the University of Madras, Columbia University, and Keio University. The Hamburg University had awarded Nehru two honorary degrees of the Faculties of Law and Agriculture.

In 1955, Nehru was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour. President Rajendra Prasad awarded him the honour without taking advice from the Prime Minister and added that &quot;I am taking this step on my own initiative&quot;.

In 1970, he was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Council Prize.

== Legacy ==

Jawaharlal Nehru, next to Mahatma Gandhi, is regarded as the most significant figure of the Indian independence movement that successfully ended British rule over the Indian subcontinent. He is also noted for contributing in the independence of other countries like Libya, Indonesia and others.

As India&#x27;s first Prime minister and external affairs minister, Nehru played a major role in shaping modern India&#x27;s government and political culture along with the sound foreign policy. He is praised for creating a system providing universal primary education, reaching children in the farthest corners of rural India. Nehru&#x27;s education policy is also credited for the development of world-class educational institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Indian Institutes of Technology, and the Indian Institutes of Management.

Following the independence, Nehru popularised the credo of &#x27;unity in diversity&#x27; and implemented it as state policy. This proved particularly important as post-Independence differences surfaced since British withdrawal from the subcontinent prompted regional leaders to no longer relate to one another as allies against a common adversary. While differences in culture and, especially, language threatened the unity of the new nation, Nehru established programs such as the National Book Trust and the National Literary Academy which promoted the translation of regional works of literatures between languages and organised the transfer of materials between regions. In pursuit of a single, unified India, Nehru warned, &quot;Integrate or perish.&quot;

Called an &quot;architect of India&quot;, he is widely recognised as the greatest figure of modern India after Mahatma Gandhi. On the occasion of his first death anniversary in 1965, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Lal Bahadur Shastri and others described Nehru as the greatest figure of India after Gandhi.

Writing in 2005, Ramachandra Guha wrote that while no other Indian prime minister was ever close to the challenges that Nehru dealt with and if Nehru had died in 1958 then he would be remembered as the greatest statesman of the 20th century. However, in recent years, Nehru&#x27;s reputation has seen re-emergence and he is credited for keeping India together contrary to predictions of many that the country was bound to fall apart.

=== Commemoration ===

In his lifetime, Jawaharlal Nehru enjoyed an iconic status in India and was generally admired across the world for his idealism and statesmanship. The honorific &quot;Pandit&quot;, meaning &quot;Wise One&quot;, has been applied before his name since his lifetime. Nehru&#x27;s ideals and policies continue shaping the Congress Party&#x27;s manifesto and core political philosophy. His birthday, 14 November is celebrated in India as &quot;Bal Divas&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Day&quot;) in recognition of his lifelong passion and work for the welfare, education and development of children and young people. Children across India remember him as &quot;Chacha Nehru&quot; (&quot;Uncle Nehru&quot;). Nehru remains a popular symbol of the Congress Party which frequently celebrates his memory. People often emulate his style of clothing, especially the Gandhi cap and the Nehru jacket. Nehru&#x27;s preference for the sherwani ensured it continues to be considered formal wear in North India today.

Many public institutions and memorials across India are dedicated to Nehru&#x27;s memory. The Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi is among the most prestigious universities in India. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port near the city of Mumbai is a modern port and dock designed to handle a huge cargo and traffic load. Nehru&#x27;s residence in Delhi is preserved as the Teen Murti House now has the Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library, and one of five Nehru Planetariums that were set in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Allahabad and Pune. The complex also houses the offices of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, established in 1964 under the chairmanship of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, then president of India. The foundation also gives away the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fellowship, established in 1968. The Nehru family homes at Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan are also preserved to commemorate Nehru and his family&#x27;s legacy. In 1997, Nehru was voted as the greatest Indian since independence in &quot;India Today&quot;″ poll. In 2012, he ranked number four in &quot;Outlook&quot;″s poll of The Greatest Indian. In 2010, he ranked among Britannica&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Most Influential World Leaders of All Time&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
There have been many documentaries about Nehru&#x27;s life, and he has been portrayed in fictionalised films. The canonical performance is probably that of Roshan Seth, who played him three times: in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;, Shyam Benegal&#x27;s 1988 television series &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;, based on Nehru&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of India&quot;, and in a 2007 TV film entitled &quot;The Last Days of the Raj&quot;. Benegal directed the 1984 documentary film, &quot;Nehru&quot;, covering his political career. Indian film director Kiran Kumar made a film about Nehru titled &quot;Nehru: The Jewel of India&quot; in 1990 starring Partap Sharma in the titular role. In Ketan Mehta&#x27;s film &quot;Sardar&quot;, Benjamin Gilani portrayed Nehru. &quot;Naunihal&quot; (), a 1967 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Raj Marbros, follows Raju, an orphan, who believes that Jawaharlal Nehru is his relative and sets out to meet him.

Similarly, in the 1957 film &quot;Ab Dilli Dur Nahin&quot; () by Amar Kumar, Rattan, a young boy, travels to Delhi and seeks to avert the death sentence of his wrongly convicted father by asking Prime Minister Nehru for help. Another 1957 English language short documentary &quot;Our Prime Minister&quot; was produced, compiled and directed by Ezra Mir, who also directed &quot;Three Weeks in the Life of Prime Minister Nehru&quot; in 1962. Girish Karnad&#x27;s historical play, &quot;Tughlaq&quot; (1962) is an allegory about the Nehruvian era. It was staged by Ebrahim Alkazi with the National School of Drama Repertory at Purana Qila, Delhi in the 1970s and later at the Festival of India, London in 1982.

== Writings ==
Nehru was a prolific writer in English who wrote &quot;The Discovery of India&quot;, &quot;Glimpses of World History&quot;, &quot;An Autobiography&quot; (released in the United States as &quot;Toward Freedom&quot;,) and &quot;Letters from a Father to His Daughter&quot;, all written in jail. &quot;Letters&quot; comprised 30 letters written to his daughter Indira Priyadarshani Nehru (later Gandhi) who was then 10 years old and studying at a boarding school in Mussoorie. It attempted to instruct her about natural history and world civilisations.

Nehru&#x27;s books have been widely read. &quot;An Autobiography&quot;, in particular, has been critically acclaimed. John Gunther, writing in &quot;Inside Asia&quot;, contrasted it with Gandhi&#x27;s autobiography: The Mahatma&#x27;s placid story compares to Nehru&#x27;s as a cornflower to an orchid, a rhyming couplet to a sonnet by MacLeish or Auden, a water pistol to a machine gun. Nehru&#x27;s autobiography is subtle, complex, discriminating, infinitely cultivated, steeped in doubt, suffused with intellectual passion. Lord Halifax once said that no one could understand India without reading it; it is a kind of &#x27;Education of Henry Adams,&#x27; written in superlative prose—hardly a dozen men alive write English as well as Nehru ...

Michael Brecher, who considered Nehru to be an intellectual for whom ideas were important aspects of Indian nationalism, wrote in &quot;Political Leadership and Charisma: Nehru, Ben-Gurion, and Other 20th-Century Political Leaders&quot;: Nehru&#x27;s books were not scholarly, nor were they intended to be. He was not a trained historian, but his feel for the flow of events and his capacity to weave together a wide range of knowledge in a meaningful pattern give to his books qualities of a high order. In these works, he also revealed a sensitive literary style. ... &quot;Glimpses of World History&quot; is the most illuminating on Nehru as an intellectual. The first of the trilogy, &quot;Glimpses&quot;, was a series of thinly connected sketches of the story of mankind in the form of letters to his teenage daughter, Indira, later prime minister of India. ... Despite its polemical character in many sections and its shortcomings as an impartial history, &quot;Glimpses&quot; is a work of great artistic value, a worthy precursor of his noble and magnanimous &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

Michael Crocker thought &quot;An Autobiography&quot; would have given Nehru literary fame had the political fame eluded him:It is to his years in prison that we owe his three main books, ... Nehru&#x27;s writings illustrate a cerebral life, and a power of self-discipline, altogether out of the ordinary. Words by the million bubbled up out of his fullness of mind and spirit. Had he never been prime minister of India he would have been famous as the author of the &quot;Autobiography&quot; and the autobiographical parts of &quot;The Discovery of India&quot;. &quot;An Autobiography&quot;, at least with some excisions here and there, is likely to be read for generations. ... There are, for instance, the characteristic touches of truism and anticlimax, strange in a man who could both think and, at his best, write so well ...

Nehru&#x27;s speech &quot;Tryst with Destiny&quot; was rated by the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to be among the great speeches of the 20th century. Ian Jack wrote in his introduction to the speech: Dressed in a golden silk jacket with a red rose in the buttonhole, Nehru rose to speak. His sentences were finely made and memorable—Nehru was a good writer; his Discovery of India stands well above the level reached by most politician-writers. ... The nobility of Nehru&#x27;s words—their sheer sweep—provided the new India with a lodestone that was ambitious and humane. Post-colonialism began here as well as Indian democracy, which has since outlived many expectations of its death.

<doc id="16245" wikidata="Q1514" url="?curid=16245" title="Janis Joplin">
<text>Janis Lyn Joplin (January 19, 1943 – October 4, 1970) was an American singer and songwriter. One of the most iconic and successful rock performers of her era, she was noted for her powerful mezzo-soprano vocals, as well as her &quot;electric&quot; stage presence.

In 1967, Joplin rose to prominence following an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, where she was the lead singer of the then little-known San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the and then the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She performed at the 1969 Woodstock festival and on the &quot;Festival Express&quot; train tour. Five singles by Joplin reached the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including a cover of the Kris Kristofferson song &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, which posthumously reached number one in March 1971. Her most popular songs include her cover versions of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, &quot;Down on Me&quot;, &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, and &quot;Summertime&quot;, as well as her original song &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, which was her final recording.

Joplin died of a heroin overdose in 1970, at the age of 27, after releasing three albums (two with Big Brother and the Holding Company and one solo album). A second solo album, &quot;Pearl&quot;, was released in January 1971, three months after her death. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Joplin number 28 on its 2008 list of the &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, dropping to number 78 in the 2023 list. NPR dubbed Joplin as the &quot;Queen of Rock&quot; and named her one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot;. As of 2013, she remains one of the top-selling vocalists in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certifications of 18.5 million albums sold.

== Early life ==

Janis Lyn Joplin was born in Port Arthur, Texas, on , to Dorothy Bonita East (1913–1998), a registrar at a business college, and her husband, Seth Ward Joplin (1910–1987), an engineer at Texaco. She had two younger siblings, Laura and Michael. The family attended First Christian Church of Port Arthur, a church belonging to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination.

Her parents felt that Janis needed more attention than their other children. As a teenager, Joplin befriended a group of outcasts, one of whom had albums by blues artists Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Lead Belly, which Joplin later credited with influencing her decision to become a singer. She began singing blues and folk music with friends at Thomas Jefferson High School. In high school, she was a classmate of Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Jimmy Johnson. Joplin stated that she was ostracized and bullied in high school. As a teen, she became overweight and suffered from acne, leaving her with deep scars that required dermabrasion. Other kids at high school would routinely taunt her and call her names like &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;freak&quot;, &quot;nigger lover&quot;, or &quot;creep&quot;. She said, &quot;I was a misfit. I read, I painted, I thought. I didn&#x27;t hate niggers.&quot;

Joplin graduated from high school in 1960 and attended Lamar State College of Technology in Beaumont, Texas, during the summer and later the University of Texas at Austin (UT), though she did not complete her college studies. The campus newspaper, &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, ran a profile of her in the issue dated July 27, 1962, headlined &quot;She Dares to Be Different.&quot; The article began, &quot;She goes barefooted when she feels like it, wears Levis to class because they&#x27;re more comfortable, and carries her autoharp with her everywhere she goes so that in case she gets the urge to break into song, it will be handy. Her name is Janis Joplin.&quot; While at UT she performed with a folk trio called the Waller Creek Boys with her strong mezzo-soprano vocals, and frequently socialized with the staff of the campus humor magazine &quot;The Texas Ranger&quot;. According to Freak Brothers cartoonist Gilbert Shelton, who befriended her, she used to sell &quot;The Texas Ranger&quot;, which contained some of Shelton&#x27;s early comic books, on the campus.

== Career ==
=== 1962–1965: Early recordings ===
Joplin cultivated a rebellious manner and styled herself partly after her female blues heroines and partly after the Beat poets. Her first song, &quot;What Good Can Drinkin&#x27; Do&quot;, was recorded on tape in December 1962 at the home of a fellow University of Texas student. She left Texas in January 1963, &quot;Just to get away,&quot; she said, &quot;because my head was in a much different place&quot;, hitchhiking with her friend Chet Helms to North Beach, San Francisco. Still in San Francisco in 1964, Joplin and future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen recorded a number of blues standards, which incidentally featured Kaukonen&#x27;s wife Margareta using a typewriter in the background. This session included seven tracks: &quot;Typewriter Talk&quot;, &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot;, &quot;Kansas City Blues&quot;, &quot;Hesitation Blues&quot;, &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot;, &quot;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Long Black Train Blues&quot;, and was released long after Joplin&#x27;s death as the bootleg album &quot;The Typewriter Tape&quot;.

In 1963, Joplin was arrested in San Francisco for shoplifting. During the two years that followed, her drug use increased and she acquired a reputation as a &quot;speed freak&quot; and occasional heroin user. She also used other psychoactive drugs and was a heavy drinker throughout her career; her favorite alcoholic beverage was Southern Comfort. In May 1965, Joplin&#x27;s friends in San Francisco, noticing the detrimental effects on her from regularly injecting methamphetamine—she was described as &quot;skeletal&quot; and &quot;emaciated&quot;— persuaded her to return to Port Arthur. During that month, her friends threw her a bus-fare party so she could return to her parents in Texas. Five years later, Joplin told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine writer David Dalton the following about her first stint in San Francisco: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have many friends and I didn&#x27;t like the ones I had.&quot;

Back in Port Arthur in the spring of 1965, after Joplin&#x27;s parents noticed her weight of , she changed her lifestyle. She avoided drugs and alcohol, adopted a beehive hairdo, and enrolled as an anthropology major at Lamar University in nearby Beaumont, Texas. Her sister Laura said in a 2016 interview that social work was her major during her year at Lamar. During her time at Lamar University, she commuted to Austin to sing solo, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. One of her performances was at a benefit by local musicians for Texas bluesman Mance Lipscomb, who was suffering with ill health. Joplin became engaged to Peter de Blanc in the fall of 1965. She had begun a relationship with him toward the end of her first stint in San Francisco. Now living in New York where he worked with IBM computers, he visited her to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Joplin and her mother began planning the wedding. De Blanc, who traveled frequently, ended the engagement soon afterward.

In 1965 and 1966, Joplin commuted from her family&#x27;s Port Arthur home to Beaumont, Texas, where she had regular sessions with a psychiatric social worker named Bernard Giarritano at a counseling agency that was funded by the United Fund, which, after her death, changed its name to the United Way. Interviewed by biographer Myra Friedman after his client&#x27;s death, Giarritano said Joplin had been baffled by how she could pursue a professional career as a singer without relapsing into drugs, and her drug-related memories from immediately prior to returning to Port Arthur continued to frighten her. Joplin sometimes brought an acoustic guitar with her to her sessions with Giarritano, and people in other offices within the building could hear her singing. Giarritano tried to reassure her that she did not have to use narcotics to succeed in the music business. She also said that if she were to avoid singing professionally, she would have to become a keypunch operator, as she had done a few years earlier, or a secretary, and then a wife and mother, and she would have to become similar to all the other women in Port Arthur. Approximately a year before Joplin joined Big Brother and the Holding Company, she recorded seven studio tracks with her acoustic guitar. Among the songs she recorded were her original composition of &quot;Turtle Blues&quot; and an alternate version of &quot;Cod&#x27;ine&quot; by Buffy Sainte-Marie. These tracks were later released as an album in 1995, titled &quot;This is Janis Joplin 1965&quot;.

=== 1966–1969: Big Brother and the Holding Company ===
In 1966, Joplin&#x27;s bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, which had gained some renown among the nascent hippie community in Haight-Ashbury. She was recruited to join the group by Chet Helms, a promoter who was managing Big Brother and with whom she had hitchhiked from Texas to San Francisco a few years earlier. Helms sent his friend Travis Rivers to find her in Austin, Texas, where she had been performing with her acoustic guitar, and to accompany her to San Francisco. At that time, she gave her parents the impression Austin was her final destination and it was the location of the rock band she was joining. Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966. Her first public performance with them was at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. Soon after that, her parents received a letter from her, and that was how they learned she was in San Francisco, not Austin.

In June 1966, Joplin was still strict about drug use and when he shared an apartment with Travis Rivers upon their arrival in San Francisco, she made him promise that using needles would not be allowed there. When bandmate Dave Getz accompanied her from a rehearsal to her home, Rivers was not there, but &quot;two or three&quot;, according to Getz&#x27; recollection 25 years later, guests whom Rivers had invited were in the process of injecting drugs. &quot;One of them was about to tie off,&quot; recalled Getz. &quot;&quot;Janis went nuts!&quot; I had never seen anybody explode like that. She was screaming and crying and Travis walked in. She screamed at him: &#x27;We had a pact! You promised me! There wouldn&#x27;t be any of that in front of me!&#x27; I was over my head and I tried to calm her down. I said, &#x27;They&#x27;re just doing mescaline,&#x27; because that&#x27;s what I thought it was. She said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t understand! I can&#x27;t see that! I just can&#x27;t stand to see that!&#x27;&quot;

A San Francisco concert from that summer (1966) was recorded and released on the 1984 album &quot;Cheaper Thrills&quot;. Joplin had a short relationship and longer friendship with founding member Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan. The band went to Chicago for a four-week engagement in August 1966, then found itself stranded after the promoter ran out of money when its concerts did not attract the expected audience levels, and he was unable to pay them. In the unfortunate circumstances the band signed with Bob Shad&#x27;s record label Mainstream Records; recordings for the label took place in Chicago in September, but these were not satisfactory, and the band returned to San Francisco, continuing to perform live, including at the Love Pageant Rally. The band recorded two tracks, &quot;Blindman&quot; and &quot;All Is Loneliness&quot;, in Los Angeles, and these were released by Mainstream as a single that did not sell well. After playing at a happening in Stanford in early December 1966, the band traveled back to Los Angeles to record ten tracks between December 12 and 14, 1966, produced by Bob Shad, which appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album in August 1967. In late 1966, Big Brother switched managers from Chet Helms to Julius Karpen. Janis Joplin and Big Brother performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, Allen Ginsberg, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple. In early 1967, Joplin met Country Joe McDonald of the group Country Joe and the Fish. The pair lived together as a couple for a few months in her Lyon Street apartment. A driver&#x27;s license, issued to Joplin in 1967, shows her residence as 122 Lyon Street No. 3, in San Francisco. Joplin and Big Brother played at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, as well as in Seattle, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; the Psychedelic Supermarket in Boston, Massachusetts; and the Golden Bear Club in Huntington Beach, California.
The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company&quot;, was released by Mainstream Records in August 1967, shortly after the group&#x27;s breakthrough appearance in June at the Monterey Pop Festival. Two tracks, &quot;Coo Coo&quot; and &quot;The Last Time&quot;, were released separately as singles, while the tracks from the previous single, &quot;Blindman&quot; and &quot;All Is Loneliness&quot;, were added to the remaining eight tracks. When Columbia Records took over the band&#x27;s contract and re-released the album, they included &quot;Coo Coo&quot; and &quot;The Last Time&quot;, and put &quot;featuring Janis Joplin&quot; on the cover. The debut album spawned four minor hits sung by Joplin including &quot;Down on Me&quot;, a traditional song arranged by Joplin, &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, &quot;Call On Me&quot; and &quot;Coo Coo&quot;. All but one of the tracks of their next album &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; were recorded in the studio with only &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; actually recorded in front of a paying audience. The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song &quot;Turtle Blues&quot;. &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; produced popular hits with &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Summertime&quot;. Together with the premiere of the documentary film &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on December 26, 1968, the album launched Joplin as a star. &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart eight weeks after its release, and was number one for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks.

===1969–1970: Solo career===

====1969====
After splitting from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius &quot;Snooky&quot; Flowers, as well as former Big Brother and the Holding Company guitarist Sam Andrew and future Full Tilt Boogie Band bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the Stax-Volt rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays. By early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day () although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of &quot;I Got Dem Ol&#x27; Kozmic Blues Again Mama!&quot; Gabriel Mekler, who produced the album, kept her away from drugs and her drug-using friends during the record&#x27;s production. Joplin&#x27;s appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in theaters, in multiple documentaries. &quot;Janis&quot;, which was reviewed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on March 21, 1975, shows Joplin arriving in Frankfurt by plane. The film &quot;Janis&quot; includes interviews with Joplin in Stockholm and from her visit to London, for her gig at Royal Albert Hall. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book about her ongoing use of narcotics, particularly when she was outside the United States. On the episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; that was telecast in the United States on the night of July 18, 1969, Joplin and her band performed &quot;Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)&quot; as well as &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;.
Released in September 1969, the &quot;Kozmic Blues&quot; album was certified gold later that year but did not match the success of &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;. Reviews of the new group were mixed. Some music critics, including Ralph J. Gleason of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a &quot;drag&quot; and Joplin should &quot;scrap&quot; her new band and &quot;go right back to being a member of Big Brother ... (if they&#x27;ll have her).&quot; Other reviewers, such as reporter Carl Bernstein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer&#x27;s magic. Bernstein&#x27;s review said that Joplin &quot;has finally assembled a group of first-rate musicians with whom she is totally at ease and whose abilities complement the incredible range of her voice.&quot; Columbia Records released &quot;Kozmic Blues&quot; as a single, which peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and a live rendition of &quot;Raise Your Hand&quot; was released in Germany and became a top ten hit there. Containing other hits like &quot;Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, and &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;, &quot;I Got Dem Ol&#x27; Kozmic Blues Again Mama!&quot; reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 soon after its release.

Joplin performed at Woodstock starting at approximately 2:00 a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. Joplin had informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. Joplin was flown by helicopter with the pregnant Joan Baez and Baez&#x27;s mother to the festival site. During the helicopter ride, she saw the enormous crowd and instantly became extremely nervous and giddy, as Baez recalled. Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin spent some of that time shooting heroin and drinking alcohol with Caserta in a tent. Joplin pulled through, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;. Pete Townshend, who performed with the Who later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said in his 2012 memoir, &quot;She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn&#x27;t at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she&#x27;d consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.&quot; Janis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00 a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash during their performance. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker&#x27;s van and witnessed Hendrix&#x27;s close-of-show performance, according to Baez&#x27;s memoir &quot;And a Voice to Sing With&quot; (1989).

Joplin was unhappy with her performance, however, and her singing was not included, by her own insistence, in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for &quot;&quot; (although the 25th anniversary director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Woodstock&quot; includes her performance of &quot;Work Me, Lord&quot;). Joplin was arrested for using &quot;vulgar and indecent language&quot; on November 16, 1969, at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa, Florida after yelling &quot;Don&#x27;t fuck with those people!&quot; toward police officers doing crowd control, for which she was found guilty and fined $200 plus court costs. In addition to Woodstock and her Tampa concert, in 1969 Joplin had problems at Madison Square Garden. Her publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman said, after Joplin&#x27;s death, she had witnessed a duet Joplin sang with Tina Turner during the opening act (Ike and Tina Turner) for a Rolling Stones concert at the Garden on Thanksgiving Day. Friedman said Joplin was &quot;so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.&quot; An audio recording of the duet exists online. During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot. For part of this concert she was joined onstage by Johnny Winter and Paul Butterfield. Joplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to &quot;every note [she sang] with &#x27;Is she gonna make it?&#x27; in their eyes.&quot;

====January–July 1970====
At the time of the June 1970 interview with Dalton, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield. In February 1970, Joplin traveled to Brazil, where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites (wife of songwriter Nick Gravenites), who had designed Janis&#x27;s stage costumes from 1967 to 1969. In Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at Rio Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites&#x27; snapshots they &quot;look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: &quot;I&#x27;m going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don&#x27;t have to be on stage twelve months a year. I&#x27;ve decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.&quot; Amburn added in 1992, &quot;Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn&#x27;t into drugs.&quot; When Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in Larkspur, California. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin&#x27;s refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him. Prior to beginning a summer tour with a newly formed band, she performed in final appearances with Big Brother in a reunion at the Fillmore West, in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included on &quot;Joplin in Concert&quot; released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at Winterland, where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.

Around this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the Full Tilt Boogie Band. The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with Ronnie Hawkins and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she had with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;my&quot; band. Finally it&#x27;s &quot;my&quot; band!&quot; In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a Hells Angels event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics. She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the Hells Angels at a venue in San Rafael, California on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew. Andrew&#x27;s web site quotes him as saying, &quot;This will be the first time that Janis&#x27; old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge.&quot;

According to Joplin&#x27;s biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people. The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of $240 to perform. Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it. Gravenites described her singing as &quot;stupendous&quot;, according to Amburn. Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: &quot;She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-colored feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hells Angels party/&lt;wbr&gt;concert in San Rafael). By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.

====July–October 1970====
From June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside Buddy Guy, The Band, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Ten Years After, the Grateful Dead, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Eric Andersen, and Ian &amp; Sylvia. They played concerts in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Calgary. Footage of her performance of &quot;Tell Mama&quot; in Calgary became an MTV video in the early 1980s. Among Joplin&#x27;s last public appearances were two broadcasts of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. In her June 25, 1970, appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion. When asked if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates &quot;laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state&quot;. On July 11, 1970, Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company both performed at the same concert in the San Diego Sports Arena, which was decades later renamed the Valley View Casino Center. Joplin sang with Full Tilt Boogie and appeared briefly onstage with Big Brother without singing, according to a July 13 review of the concert in the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;. On August 7, 1970, a tombstone—jointly paid for by Joplin and Juanita Green, who as a child had done housework for Bessie Smith—was erected at Smith&#x27;s previously unmarked grave. The lead paragraph of the AP story said Joplin and Green had &quot;shared the cost of a stone for the &#x27;Empress of the Blues,&#x27;&quot; but, according to publicist/biographer Myra Friedman, the two women never met, though Joplin had frequently cited her as a musical influence. During this time, she first performed &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, a song partially inspired by a Michael McClure poem, that she had composed with fellow musician and friend Bob Neuwirth a very short time earlier. According to Myra Friedman&#x27;s account, Joplin performed two shows at the Capitol Theatre, the first of which was attended by actors Geraldine Page and her husband Rip Torn. Between the shows, at a &quot;gin mill&quot; [Friedman&#x27;s words] close to this concert venue, Joplin and Neuwirth penned the lyrics to the song and she performed it at the second show, according to Friedman.

Neuwirth was quoted by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2015: &quot;Around 7 p.m., after the Capitol sound check, we had a couple of hours to kill before [acts that opened for Joplin] Seatrain and Runt finished their sets. So the four of us [Joplin, Neuwirth, Geraldine Page, Rip Torn] walked to a bar about three minutes away called Vahsen&#x27;s [at 30 Broad Street in Port Chester].&quot; While in Vahsen&#x27;s, &quot;Janis came up with words for the first verse. I was in charge of writing them down on bar napkins with a ballpoint pen. She came up with the second verse [for &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;], too, about a color TV. I suggested words here and there, and came up with the third verse—about asking the Lord to buy us a night on the town and another round.&quot; Joplin&#x27;s last public performance with the Full Tilt Boogie Band took place on August 12, 1970, at the Harvard Stadium in Boston. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; gave the performance a positive, front-page review, despite the fact that Full Tilt Boogie had performed with makeshift amplifiers after their regular sound equipment was stolen in Boston. Joplin attended her high school reunion on August 14, accompanied by Neuwirth, road manager John Cooke, and sister Laura, but it was reportedly an unhappy experience for her. Joplin denigrated Port Arthur and the classmates who had humiliated her a decade earlier.
Joplin checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood on August 24, 1970, near Sunset Sound Recorders, where she began rehearsing and recording her album. During the sessions, Joplin continued a relationship with Seth Morgan, a 21-year-old UC Berkeley student, cocaine dealer, and future novelist who had visited her new home in Larkspur in July and August. She and Morgan were engaged to be married in early September, although he visited Sunset Sound Recorders for just eight of Joplin&#x27;s many rehearsals and sessions. During late August, September, and early October 1970, Joplin and her band rehearsed and recorded a new album in Los Angeles with producer Paul A. Rothchild, best known for his lengthy relationship with The Doors. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was enough usable material to compile an LP. The posthumous &quot;Pearl&quot; (1971) became the biggest-selling album of her career and featured her biggest hit single, a cover of Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster&#x27;s &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; (Kristofferson had previously been one of Joplin&#x27;s lovers, though the song was taught to her by Neuwirth). The opening track, &quot;Move Over&quot;, was written by Joplin, reflecting the way that she felt men treated women in relationships.

Peggy Caserta claimed in her book, &quot;Going Down With Janis&quot; (1973), that she and Joplin had decided mutually in April 1970 to stay away from each other to avoid enabling each other&#x27;s drug use. Caserta, a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant and owner of &quot;Mnasidika&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;levistrauss/haight-st&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first clothing boutiques in the Haight Ashbury, said in the book that by September 1970, she was smuggling cannabis throughout California and had checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel because it attracted drug users. During Joplin&#x27;s stay at the Landmark, she learned of Caserta&#x27;s presence at the Landmark from a heroin dealer who made deliveries there. Joplin begged Caserta for heroin, and when Caserta refused to provide it, Joplin reportedly admonished her by saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t think if you can get it, I can&#x27;t get it.&quot; Joplin&#x27;s publicist Myra Friedman was unaware during Joplin&#x27;s lifetime that this had happened. Later, while Friedman was working on her book &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, she determined that the time frame of the Joplin-Caserta encounter was one week before Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s death. Within a few days, Joplin became a regular customer of the same heroin dealer who had been supplying Caserta.

====September-October 1970====
Joplin&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman and his assistant/publicist Friedman had staged an intervention with Joplin the previous winter while Joplin was in New York. Grossman and Friedman knew during Joplin&#x27;s lifetime that her friend Caserta, whom Friedman met during the New York sessions for &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; and on later occasions, used heroin. Friedman assumed Caserta had been out of Joplin&#x27;s life for a while and never visited California. When Joplin was not at Sunset Sound Recorders, she liked to drive her Porsche over the speed limit &quot;on the winding part of Sunset Blvd.&quot;, according to a statement made by her attorney Robert Gordon in 1995 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Friedman wrote that the only Full Tilt Boogie member who rode as her passenger, Ken Pearson, often hesitated to join her, though he did on the night she died. He was not interested in using hard drugs. On September 26, 1970, Joplin recorded vocals for &quot;Half Moon&quot; and &quot;Cry Baby&quot;. The session ended with Joplin, organist Ken Pearson, and drummer Clark Pierson making a special one-minute recording as a birthday gift to John Lennon with the Dale Evans composition &quot;Happy Trails&quot; as part of the greeting.

On October 1, 1970, Joplin completed her last recording, &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, which was recorded in a single take. On Saturday, October 3, Joplin visited Sunset Sound Recorders to listen to the instrumental track for Nick Gravenites&#x27;s song &quot;Buried Alive in the Blues&quot;, which the band had recorded earlier that day. She and Paul Rothchild agreed she would record the vocal the following day. Sometime on Saturday, she learned that her boyfriend Seth Morgan had met other women at a Marin County, California, restaurant, and invited them to her home. People at Sunset Sound Recorders overheard Joplin expressing anger about Morgan, as well as joy about the progress of the sessions. Joplin and Ken Pearson later left the studio together and she drove him in her Porsche to the West Hollywood landmark called Barney&#x27;s Beanery where they met Bennett Glotzer, a business partner of Joplin&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman. After midnight, she drove Ken Pearson and the male fan to the Landmark where she and Pearson were staying in separate rooms and prepared to part in the lobby of the Landmark, when she expressed a fear, possibly in jest, that he and the other Full Tilt Boogie musicians might decide to stop making music with her; they then separated and went to their rooms.

====Death====
On Sunday evening, October 4, 1970, Joplin was found dead on the floor of her room at the Landmark Motor Hotel by her road manager and close friend John Byrne Cooke. Alcohol was present in the room. Newspapers reported that no other drugs or paraphernalia were present. According to a 1983 book authored by Joseph DiMona and Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, evidence of narcotics was removed from the scene by a friend of Joplin and later put back after the person realized that an autopsy was going to reveal that narcotics were in her system. The book adds that prior to Joplin&#x27;s death, Noguchi had investigated other fatal drug overdoses in Los Angeles where friends believed they were doing favors for decedents by removing evidence of narcotics, then they &quot;thought things over&quot; and returned to put back the evidence. Noguchi performed an autopsy on Joplin and determined the cause of death to be a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol.

John Byrne Cooke believed Joplin had obtained heroin much more potent than what she and other L.A. heroin users had received on previous occasions, as was indicated by overdoses of several of her dealer&#x27;s other customers during the same weekend. Her death was ruled accidental.
Both Peggy Caserta, Joplin&#x27;s close friend, and Seth Morgan, Joplin&#x27;s fiancé, failed to meet Joplin on Oct. 2, the Friday immediately before her death; Joplin had been expecting both of them to keep her company that night. According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened neither of her friends came to the Landmark as promised. During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not call to explain why she failed to show up. Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to dial the Landmark Motel switchboard, only to learn that Joplin had instructed the desk clerk not to accept any incoming calls for her after midnight. Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within the 24 hours before her death, but little is known about that call. She used a phone at Sunset Sound Recorders where her colleagues (&quot;there were perhaps twenty to twenty-five people present,&quot; wrote biographer Myra Friedman) noticed that whatever Morgan said to her made her very angry.

Peggy Caserta has insisted Joplin&#x27;s death was not an accidental overdose, but rather a result of a head gash suffered after the &quot;hourglass heel&quot; of her slingback sandal caught in the shag carpet, causing her to lose her balance. Caserta did concede, however, that drugs and/or alcohol may have played a role in hastening Joplin&#x27;s death that night. Joplin was cremated at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles, and her ashes were scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean.

==Personal life==
Joplin&#x27;s significant relationships with men included ones with Peter de Blanc, Country Joe McDonald (who wrote the song &quot;Janis&quot; at Joplin&#x27;s request), David (George) Niehaus, Kris Kristofferson, and Seth Morgan (from July 1970 until her death, at which time they were allegedly engaged). She also had relationships with women. During her first stint in San Francisco in 1963, Joplin met and briefly lived with Jae Whitaker, a woman whom she had met while playing pool at the bar Gino &amp; Carlo in North Beach. Whitaker broke off their relationship because of Joplin&#x27;s hard drug use and sexual relationships with other people. Whitaker was first identified by name in connection with Joplin in 1999, when Alice Echols&#x27; biography &quot;Scars of Sweet Paradise&quot; was published.

Joplin had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta. They first met in November 1966 when Big Brother performed at The Matrix in San Francisco. Caserta was one of 15 people in the audience; at the time, she ran &quot;Mnasidika&quot;, a clothing boutique in the Haight Ashbury. Approximately a month after the concert, Joplin visited Caserta&#x27;s boutique and said she could not afford to buy a pair of $5 jeans for sale, asking to make a 50 cent down payment. Caserta was amazed such a talented singer could not afford $5, and gave Joplin a pair for free. Their friendship was platonic for more than a year. Before it became romantic, Caserta was in love with Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, and sometime during the first half of 1968 traveled from San Francisco to New York to be with him. He did not want a serious relationship, and Joplin sympathized with Caserta&#x27;s disappointment. The &quot;Woodstock&quot; concert film includes 37 seconds of Joplin and Caserta walking together before they reached the tent where Joplin waited for her turn to perform. By the time the festival took place in August 1969, both were intravenous heroin addicts.

According to Caserta&#x27;s book &quot;Going Down With Janis&quot;, which Caserta has since disowned, Joplin introduced her to her boyfriend Seth Morgan in Joplin&#x27;s room at the Landmark Motor Hotel on September 29, 1970. Caserta &quot;had seen him around&quot; in San Francisco but had not met him. At some point, an agreement was made for a threesome to take place the following Friday, although Caserta later said she immediately abandoned the idea once she realized it was Morgan who would be with Joplin. Morgan made alternate plans, believing Caserta would be with Joplin that evening. Each one was unaware the other had bowed out. The day after Joplin introduced Caserta to Morgan, Caserta saw Joplin briefly when Caserta accommodated her new Los Angeles friend, 19-year-old Debbie Nuciforo. Nuciforo was an aspiring rock drummer who wanted to meet Joplin and was high on heroin at the time. The meeting of the three women was reportedly brief and unpleasant. Caserta suspected the reason for Joplin&#x27;s foul mood was that Morgan had abandoned her earlier that day after having spent less than 24 hours with her.

Caserta did not see nor communicate by phone with Joplin again, although she later claimed she had tried to reach Joplin at the Landmark Motor Hotel and Sunset Sound Recorders. Caserta and Morgan lost touch with each other; each had independently made plans for Friday, October 2. Joplin mentioned her disappointment over both friends bailing out of their &quot;ménage à trois&quot; to her drug dealer on Saturday while he was selling her the dose of heroin that killed her, as Caserta later learned from the dealer. Biographer Myra Friedman commented in her original version of &quot;Buried Alive&quot; (1973):
Given the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one&#x27;s own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin&#x27;s] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in Beaumont, Texas in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], &quot;diffused&quot; -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women. Were she so simple as the lesbians wished her to be or so free as her associates imagined!

Kim France reported in her May 2, 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; article, &quot;Nothin&#x27; Left to Lose&quot; : &quot;Once she became famous, Joplin cursed like a truck driver, did not believe in wearing undergarments, was rarely seen without her bottle of Southern Comfort and delighted in playing the role of sexual predator.&quot; On July 11, 1970, Joplin made a revealing statement about her sexuality to her friend Richard Hundgen, the Grateful Dead&#x27;s San Francisco-based road manager, whom she had known since 1966. When Joplin and Hundgen were offstage during a San Diego gig for both Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company, she said the following that he later repeated to Myra Friedman:
I hear a rumor that somebody in San Francisco is spreading stories that I&#x27;m a dyke. You go back there and find out who it is and tell them that Janis says she&#x27;s gotten it on with a couple of thousand cats in her life and a few hundred chicks and see what they can do with &quot;that&quot;!

Joplin&#x27;s body art, with a wristlet and a small heart on her left breast by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, marked an early moment in the popular culture&#x27;s acceptance of tattoos as art. Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, which often included colored streaks and accessories such as scarves, beads and feathers.

==Legacy==
===Legacy in the 1970s===
Joplin&#x27;s death in October 1970 at age 27 stunned her fans and shocked the music world, especially when coupled with the deaths of Canned Heat singer Alan Wilson a month earlier, and rock icon Jimi Hendrix 16 days earlier, both aged 27. All three musicians performed at the two biggest rock festivals of the 1960s: Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock. (This would later cause some people to attribute significance to the death of musicians at the age of 27, as celebrated in the &quot;27 Club&quot;.) Music historian Tom Moon wrote that Joplin had &quot;a devastatingly original voice&quot;, music columnist Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Joplin as an artist was &quot;overpowering and deeply vulnerable&quot; and author Megan Terry said that Joplin was the female version of Elvis Presley in her ability to captivate an audience. Joplin was noted for her powerful mezzo-soprano vocals with a distinctive rock and roll rasping vocal quality, as well as her &quot;electric&quot; stage presence. Her most popular songs include her cover versions of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, &quot;Down on Me&quot;, &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, and &quot;Summertime&quot;, as well as her original song &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, which was her final recording.

A book about Joplin by her publicist Myra Friedman titled &quot;Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin&quot; (1973) was excerpted in many newspapers. At the same time, Peggy Caserta&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Going Down With Janis&quot; (1973), attracted much attention; its provocative title is a reference to Caserta&#x27;s claim that she had engaged in oral sex with Joplin while they were high on heroin in September 1970. The description provided by Dan Knapp, Caserta&#x27;s co-author whom she denounced decades later, repelled many people in 1973 when few books or filmed interviews of Joplin or her loved ones were accessible to the public. Joplin&#x27;s bandmate Sam Andrew described Caserta as &quot;halfway between a groupie and a friend&quot; in an interview with writer Ellis Amburn. Soon after the 1973 publication of &quot;Going Down With Janis&quot;, Joplin&#x27;s friends learned that graphic descriptions of sexual acts and intravenous drug use were not the only portions of the book that would haunt them.

According to Kim Chappell, a close friend of Caserta and Joplin, Caserta&#x27;s book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer whom she had described in detail in her book, including the make and model of his car. According to Amburn, in 1973, a &quot;carful of dope dealers&quot; visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar that Caserta had been frequenting. Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar, stated: &quot;I was stabbed because, when Peggy&#x27;s book came out, her dealer, the same one who&#x27;d given Janis her last fix, didn&#x27;t like it that he was referred to and was out to get Peggy. He couldn&#x27;t find her, so he went for her lover. When they realized who I was, they felt that my death would also hit Peggy, and so they stabbed me.&quot; Despite being &quot;stabbed three times in the chest, puncturing both lungs,&quot; Chappell eventually recovered.

According to Joplin&#x27;s biographers, Caserta was among many friends of Joplin who did not become clean and sober until a long time after Joplin&#x27;s death, while others died from overdoses. Although the wife of Big Brother guitarist James Gurley, who was Joplin&#x27;s close friend, died from a heroin overdose in 1969, devastating Joplin, Gurley himself did not become clean and sober until 1984. Caserta survived &quot;a near-fatal OD in December 1995&quot;, wrote Alice Echols. On January 13, 2000, Caserta appeared during a segment about Joplin on &quot;20/20&quot;. In 2018, Caserta denounced &quot;Going Down With Janis&quot; as the pornographic fantasy of Dan Knapp, her co-author, and largely unreliable. During that year, the public had its first access to her own story via a memoir she co-wrote with Maggie Falcon titled &quot;I Ran into Some Trouble&quot;. It describes a long, friendly relationship with Joplin that only occasionally featured sexuality.

The Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; song &quot;Pearl&quot; (1971), from their album &quot;People Like Us&quot;, was a tribute to Joplin. Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Chelsea Hotel#2&quot; (1974) is about Joplin. Lyricist Robert Hunter has commented that Jerry Garcia&#x27;s &quot;Birdsong&quot;, from his first solo album, &quot;Garcia&quot; (1972), is about Joplin and the end of her suffering through death. Mimi Farina&#x27;s composition &quot;In the Quiet Morning&quot;, most famously covered by Joan Baez on her album &quot;Come from the Shadows&quot; (1972), was a tribute to Joplin. Another song by Baez, &quot;Children of the Eighties&quot;, mentioned Joplin. A Serge Gainsbourg-penned French language song by English singer Jane Birkin, &quot;Ex fan des sixties&quot; (1978), references Joplin along with other disappeared &quot;idols&quot;, such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones and Marc Bolan. When Joplin was alive, Country Joe McDonald released a song called &quot;Janis&quot; on his band&#x27;s album &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die&quot; (1967). In her memoir &quot;Just Kids&quot;, Patti Smith mentions writing a song for Joplin and singing it to her one night at the Chelsea Hotel, where both were living at the time. The song, called &quot;Lullaby (I Was Working Real Hard)&quot;, was never recorded by Joplin but eventually appeared on Smith&#x27;s Live At The Bottom Line, a performance from 1975.

The film &quot;The Rose&quot; (1979) is loosely based on Joplin&#x27;s life. Originally planned to be titled &quot;Pearl&quot;—Joplin&#x27;s nickname and the title of her last album—the film was fictionalized after her family declined to allow the producers the rights to her story. Bette Midler won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture—Female and earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.

===Legacy in 1980s and 1990s===
In 1988, on what would have been Joplin&#x27;s 45th birthday, the Janis Joplin Memorial, with an original gold, multi-image sculpture of Joplin by Douglas Clark, was dedicated during a ceremony in Port Arthur, Texas. In 1992, the first major biography of Joplin in two decades, &quot;Love, Janis&quot;, authored by her younger sister Laura Joplin, was published. In an interview, Laura stated that Joplin enjoyed being on the &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot;, that Joplin had difficulties with some, but not all, people at Thomas Jefferson High School and that Joplin enthusiastically talked about Woodstock with her parents and siblings during a visit to their Texas home a few weeks after she had performed at the festival.

In 1995, Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, she received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In November 2009, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum honored her as part of its annual American Music Masters Series; among the artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum exhibition are Joplin&#x27;s scarf and necklaces, her psychedelically painted 1965 Porsche 356 Cabriolet and a sheet of LSD blotting paper designed by Robert Crumb, designer of the &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; cover. Also in 2009, Joplin was the honoree at the Rock Hall&#x27;s American Music Master concert and lecture series. In the late 1990s, the musical play &quot;Love, Janis&quot; was created and directed by Randal Myler, with input from Janis&#x27; younger sister Laura and Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, with an aim to take it to Off-Broadway. Opening in the summer of 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim, played to packed houses and was held over several times.

===Legacy after 2010===
In 2013 Washington&#x27;s Arena Stage featured a production of &quot;A Night with Janis Joplin&quot;, starring Mary Bridget Davies in which Joplin performs a concert for the audience while telling stories of her past inspirations, including those of Odetta and Aretha Franklin. The production transferred to Broadway, then went on tour in 2016. In August 2024 the Tony-nominated musical opened at London&#x27;s Peacock Theatre with Davies again in the lead role.

On November 4, 2013, Joplin was awarded with the 2,510th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the music industry. Her star is located at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of Musicians Institute. On August 8, 2014, the U.S. Postal Service revealed a commemorative stamp honoring Joplin as part of its Music Icons stamp series during a first-day-of-issue ceremony at the Outside Lands Music Festival at Golden Gate Park. Among the memorabilia Joplin left behind is a Gibson Hummingbird guitar. In 2015, the biographical documentary film &quot;&quot;, directed by Amy J. Berg and narrated by Cat Power, was released. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critics&#x27; Pick. 

After &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Joplin number 46 on its 2004 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and number 28 on its 2008 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, she was then re-ranked in 2023; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; then ranked Joplin at number 78 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. Also in 2023, NPR dubbed Joplin as the &quot;Queen of Rock&quot; and named her one of the &quot;50 Great Voices&quot;. As of 2013, she remains one of the top-selling vocalists in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certifications of 18.5 million albums sold.

==Influence==
Joplin had a profound influence on many singers. Pink said about Joplin: &quot;She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn&#x27;t culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie.&quot; In a tribute performance on her Try This Tour, Pink called Joplin &quot;a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn&#x27;t!&quot;

==Discography==
Joplin recorded four albums in her four-year career. The first two albums were recorded with and credited to Big Brother and the Holding Company; the later two were recorded with different backing bands and released as solo albums. Posthumous releases have included previously unreleased studio and live material.

<text>Jan van Melle (11 February 1887 – 8 November 1953) was the pen name of a Dutch-born South African writer. His real name was Johannes van Melle.

Van Melle was born in Goes. He arrived in South Africa in 1906, and after a short sojourn in the Netherlands East Indies, settled in South Africa permanently in 1913. He worked as a teacher in many rural schools and soon started to publish in both Dutch and the newly emerging Afrikaans language.

Van Melle&#x27;s best known work is the novel &quot;Bart Nel&quot;, a classic of Afrikaans literature. It tells the tale of a farmer whose indomitable spirit allows him to survive the destruction and loss of his farm in wartime and being abandoned by his wife and family.

<text>John Fink (born February 11, 1940) is an American film and television actor.

He is known for his roles in two &quot;Batman&quot; movies, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), and his other film credits include &quot;Loving&quot; (1970), &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; (1972), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1972), &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case&quot; (1976), &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990), &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Client&quot; (1994). He has also had minor roles in &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, and various other series since the 1970s.

While he was billed as a supporting actor in the 1978 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; pilot, a majority of his scenes were cut mainly because those scenes dealt with Serina&#x27;s (Jane Seymour) &quot;space cancer&quot; B-story which had been excised from the final cut.

<text>Jacques-Yves Cousteau, (, , ; 11 June 191025 June 1997) was a French naval officer, oceanographer, filmmaker and author. He co-invented the first successful open-circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), called the Aqua-Lung, which assisted him in producing some of the first underwater documentaries.

Cousteau wrote many books describing his undersea explorations. In his first book, &quot;The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure&quot;, Cousteau surmised the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. The book was adapted into an underwater documentary called &quot;The Silent World&quot;. Co-directed by Cousteau and Louis Malle, it was one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to document the ocean depths in color. The film won the 1956 at the Cannes Film Festival and remained the only documentary to do so until 2004 (when &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; received the award). It was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957.

From 1966 to 1976, he hosted &quot;The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau&quot;, a documentary television series, presented on American commercial television stations. A second documentary series, &quot;The Cousteau Odyssey&quot;, ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, Gironde, France, to Daniel and Élisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Collège Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the École navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. However, an automobile accident, which broke both his arms, cut short his career in naval aviation. The accident forced Cousteau to change his plans to become a naval pilot, so he then indulged his passion for the ocean.

In Toulon, where he was serving on the &quot;Condorcet&quot;, Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles, predecessors of modern swimming goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935–1938) and in the USSR (1939).

On 12 July 1937, he married Simone Melchior, his business partner, with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940–1979). His sons took part in the adventures of the &quot;Calypso&quot;. In 1991, six months after his wife Simone&#x27;s death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son, Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982, during Cousteau&#x27;s marriage to his first wife).

===Early 1940s: innovation of modern underwater diving===
The years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940, the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Megève, where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places—for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: &quot;Par dix-huit mètres de fond&quot; (&quot;18 meters deep&quot;), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands in Var, with Philippe Tailliez and Frédéric Dumas, using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer Léon Vèche, an engineer of Arts and Measures at the Naval College.

In 1943, they made the film &quot;Épaves&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks&quot;), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and Émile Gagnan. When making &quot;Épaves&quot;, Cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film, but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width, intended for a make of child&#x27;s camera, and cemented them together to make long reels.

Having kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa &quot;Baobab&quot; at Sanary (Var) was opposite Admiral Darlan&#x27;s villa &quot;Reine&quot;), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, a &quot;pen anti-semite&quot; who edited the collaborationist newspaper &quot;Je suis partout&quot; (&quot;I am everywhere&quot;) and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954.

During the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the Aqua-Lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, &quot;The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure&quot; (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by Commander Yves le Prieur. Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator, invented in 1942 by Émile Gagnan. In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype Aqua-Lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible.

===Late 1940s: GERS and &quot;Élie Monnier&quot;===
In 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film &quot;Épaves&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks&quot;) to Admiral Lemonnier, who gave them the responsibility of setting up the GRS (&quot;Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines&quot;, Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon. A little later it became the GERS (&quot;Groupe d&#x27;Études et de Recherches Sous-Marines&quot;, Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (&quot;Commandement des Interventions Sous la Mer&quot;, Undersea Interventions Command), and finally the CEPHISMER (&quot;Centre Expert Plongée Humaine et Intervention Sous la Mer&quot;, Expert Centre for Human Diving and Undersea Intervention). In 1947, Chief Petty Officer Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an Aqua-Lung, while attempting a new depth record to 120 m with the GERS near Toulon.
In 1948, between missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests, Cousteau undertook a first campaign in the Mediterranean on board the sloop &quot;Élie Monnier&quot;, with Philippe Tailliez, Frédéric Dumas, Jean Alinat and the scenario writer Marcel Ichac. The small team also undertook the exploration of the Roman wreck of Mahdia (Tunisia). It was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving, opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology. Cousteau and Marcel Ichac brought back from there the Carnets diving film (presented and preceded with the Cannes Film Festival 1951).

Cousteau and the &quot;Élie Monnier&quot; then took part in the rescue of Professor Jacques Piccard&#x27;s bathyscaphe, the FNRS-2, during the 1949 expedition to Dakar. Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the FNRS-3.

The adventures of this period are told in the two books &quot;The Silent World&quot; (1953, by Cousteau and Dumas) and &quot;Plongées sans câble&quot; (1954, by Philippe Tailliez).

===1950–1970s===
In 1949, Cousteau left the French Navy.

In 1950, he founded the French Oceanographic Campaigns (FOC), and leased a ship called &quot;Calypso&quot; from Thomas Loel Guinness for a symbolic one franc a year. Cousteau refitted the &quot;Calypso&quot; as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming. He also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, in particular at Grand-Congloué (1952).

With the publication of his first book in 1953, &quot;The Silent World&quot;, Cousteau correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. He reported that his research vessel, the &quot;Élie Monier&quot;, was heading to the Straits of Gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them. Cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait, and the porpoises followed for a few minutes, then diverged toward mid-channel again. It was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay, even if the humans did not. Cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like sonar, which was a relatively new feature on submarines.

In 1954, Cousteau conducted a survey of Abu Dhabi waters on behalf of British Petroleum. Among those accompanying him was Louis Malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company. Cousteau won the at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956 for &quot;The Silent World&quot; co-produced with Malle. In 1957, Cousteau took over as leader of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. Afterward, with the assistance of Jean Mollard, he made a &quot;diving saucer&quot; SP-350, an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of 350 meters. The successful experiment was quickly repeated in 1965 with two vehicles which reached 500 meters.

In 1957, he was elected as director of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. He directed Précontinent, about the experiments of diving in saturation (long-duration immersion, houses under the sea), and was admitted to the United States National Academy of Sciences.

He was involved in the creation of Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques and served as its inaugural president from 1959 to 1973.

Cousteau also took part in inventing the &quot;SP-350 Denise Diving Saucer&quot; in 1959 which was an invention best for exploring the ocean floor, as it allowed one to explore on solid ground.

In October 1960, a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the Mediterranean Sea by the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique (CEA). The CEA argued that the dumps were experimental in nature, and that French oceanographers such as Vsevolod Romanovsky had recommended it. Romanovsky and other French scientists, including Louis Fage and Jacques Cousteau, repudiated the claim, saying that Romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount. The CEA claimed that there was little circulation (and hence little need for concern) at the dump site between Nice and Corsica, but French public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the CEA atomic energy scientists. The CEA chief, Francis Perrin, decided to postpone the dump. Cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support. The train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks, and it was sent back to its origin.
In the 1960s, Cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater &quot;villages&quot;; the projects were named Precontinent I, Precontinent II and Precontinent III. Each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water, and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the sea floor. The projects are best known as Conshelf I (1962), Conshelf II (1963), and Conshelf III (1965). The names &quot;Precontinent&quot;, and &quot;Continental Shelf Station&quot; (Conshelf) were used interchangeably by Cousteau.

A meeting with American television companies (ABC, Métromédia, NBC) created the series &quot;The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau&quot;, with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving dress intended to give the films a &quot;personalized adventure&quot; style. This documentary television series ran for 10 years from 1966 to 1976. A second documentary series, &quot;The Cousteau Odyssey&quot;, ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations.

In 1970, he wrote the book &quot;The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea&quot; with his son Philippe. In this book, Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip shark as &quot;the most dangerous of all sharks&quot;.

In December 1972, two years after the volcano&#x27;s last eruption, The Cousteau Society was filming &quot;Voyage au bout du monde&quot; on Deception Island, Antarctica, when Michel Laval, &quot;Calypso&quot;″s second in command, was struck and killed by a rotor of the helicopter that was ferrying between &quot;Calypso&quot; and the island.

In 1973, along with his two sons and Frederick Hyman, he created the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life, Frederick Hyman being its first President.

In 1975, John Denver released the tribute song &quot;Calypso&quot; on his album &quot;Windsong&quot;, and on the B-side of his hit song &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. &quot;Calypso&quot; became a hit on its own and was later considered the new A-side, reaching No. 2 on the charts.
In 1976, Cousteau located the wreck of HMHS &quot;Britannic&quot;, which had sunk on the 21st November 1916 after striking a mine in the Kea Channel, the 3rd and final of the three liners &amp; the younger sister to the RMS Olympic and RMS Titanic. He also found the wreck of the French 17th-century ship-of-the-line &quot;La Therese&quot; in coastal waters of Crete.

In 1977, together with Peter Scott, he received the UN International Environment prize.

On 28 June 1979, while the &quot;Calypso&quot; was on an expedition to Portugal, his second son Philippe, his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since 1969, died in a PBY Catalina flying boat crash in the Tagus river near Lisbon. Cousteau was deeply affected. He called his eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side. This collaboration lasted 14 years.

===1980–1990s===
From 1980 to 1981, he was a regular on the animal reality show &quot;Those Amazing Animals&quot;, along with Burgess Meredith, Priscilla Presley, and Jim Stafford.
In 1980, Cousteau traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, &quot;Cries from the Deep&quot; and &quot;St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea&quot;.

From 1982 to 1984, Cousteau released a series of films on the Amazon with TBS.

In 1985, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from U.S. President Ronald Reagan. He also released &quot;Cousteau/Mississippi&quot;, which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Special.

From 1986 to 1992, Cousteau released &quot;Rediscovery of the World&quot;, also with TBS.

On 24 November 1988, he was elected to the Académie française, chair 17, succeeding Jean Delay. His official reception under the cupola took place on 22 June 1989, the response to his speech of reception being given by Bertrand Poirot-Delpech. After his death, he was replaced by Érik Orsenna on 28 May 1998.

In June 1990, the composer Jean Michel Jarre paid homage to the commander by entitling his new album &quot;Waiting for Cousteau&quot;. He also composed the music for Cousteau&#x27;s documentary &quot;Palawan, the last refuge&quot;.

On 2 December 1990, his wife, Simone Cousteau died of cancer. Six months later, in June 1991, in Paris, Jacques-Yves Cousteau remarried to Francine Triplet, with whom he had a relationship since the early 1980s and two children, Diane (born in 1980) and Pierre-Yves (born in 1982). Francine Cousteau currently continues her husband&#x27;s work as the head of the Cousteau Foundation and Cousteau Society. From that point, the relations between Jacques-Yves and his elder son, who is 8 years older than Francine, worsened.

In November 1991, Cousteau gave an interview to the &quot;UNESCO Courier&quot;, in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease. Widely quoted on the Internet are these two paragraphs from the interview: &quot;What should we do to eliminate suffering and disease? It&#x27;s a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run. If we try to implement it we may jeopardize the future of our species...It&#x27;s terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn&#x27;t even say it. But the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable&quot;.

In 1992, he was invited to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations&#x27; International Conference on Environment and Development, and then he became a regular consultant for the UN and the World Bank.

In 1993, a brief biography, as well as an introduction by Cousteau was featured in interactive educational software program Undersea Adventure, developed by former game developer Knowledge Adventure.

In 1995, Cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son Jean-Michel, who was advertising the &quot;Cousteau Fiji Islands Resort&quot; in the South Pacific, to prevent him from using the Cousteau name for business purposes in the United States. This resulted in Jean-Michel Cousteau being ordered by the court to not encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father&#x27;s non-profit endeavours.

On 11 January 1996, &quot;Calypso&quot; was rammed and sunk in the port of Singapore by a barge. The &quot;Calypso&quot; was refloated and towed home to France.

=== Religious views ===
Archbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger celebrated his funeral Mass at Notre-Dame in Paris. In his homily he stated, &quot;Without betraying any confidences, Father Carré told me of his respect for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. He discovered in him a man of prayer whom he accompanied in his last months of his life, giving him, through the sacraments of the Church, the strength of his passage towards eternity.&quot;

In a chapter entitled &quot;The Holy Scriptures and the Environment&quot; in the posthumous work &quot;The Human, the Orchid, and the Octopus&quot;, he is quoted as stating that &quot;The glory of nature provides evidence that God exists&quot;.

=== Opinion on recreational fishing ===
Cousteau said that just because fish are cold-blooded does not mean they do not feel pain, and that recreational fishermen only say so to reassure their conscience.

==Death and legacy==
Jacques-Yves Cousteau died of a heart attack on 25 June 1997 in Paris, two weeks after his 87th birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-André-de-Cubzac, his birthplace. An homage was paid to him by the town by naming the street which runs out to the house of his birth &quot;rue du Commandant Cousteau&quot;, where a commemorative plaque was placed.

Cousteau&#x27;s legacy includes more than 120 television documentaries, more than 50 books, and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members.

Cousteau liked to call himself an &quot;oceanographic technician&quot;. He was, in reality, a sophisticated showman, teacher, and lover of nature. His work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans.

His work also created a new kind of scientific communication, criticized at the time by some academics. The so-called &quot;divulgationism&quot;, a simple way of sharing scientific concepts, was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting.

His Oceanographic Museum in Monaco, and perhaps even he himself, has been identified as introducing the &quot;Killer Algae&quot; &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot;, which are negatively affecting the Mediterranean&#x27;s ecosystem.

The Cousteau Society and its French counterpart, &quot;l&#x27;Équipe Cousteau&quot;, both of which Jacques-Yves Cousteau founded, are still active today. The Society is currently attempting to turn the original &quot;Calypso&quot; into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel, the &quot;Calypso II&quot;.

In 2007, the International Watch Company introduced the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph &quot;Cousteau Divers&quot; Special Edition. The timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of Cousteau&#x27;s Calypso research vessel. Having developed the diver&#x27;s watch, IWC offered support to The Cousteau Society. The proceeds from the timepieces&#x27; sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved in conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs.

Fabien Cousteau, the grandson of Jacques Cousteau, is in the process of constructing a community of ocean flooring analysis stations, called Proteus, off Curaçao at a depth of about 20 m in a marine-protected area. Aquanauts could reside and work in these underwater habitats. Front-end engineering has started in 2022 with the habitat planned for the sea bottom in 2025.

In October 1997, an underwater plaque honoring Jacques Cousteau was placed in the underwater dive park off Casino Point in Avalon, California. In November 2020, due to deterioration, the plaque was replaced.

<text>John Philippe Rushton (December 3, 1943 – October 2, 2012) was a Canadian psychologist and author. He taught at the University of Western Ontario until the early 1990s, and became known to the general public during the 1980s and 1990s for research on race and intelligence, race and crime, and other purported racial correlations.

Rushton&#x27;s work has been heavily criticized by the scientific community for the questionable quality of its research, with many academics arguing that it was conducted under a racist agenda. From 2002 until his death, he served as the head of the Pioneer Fund, an organization founded in 1937 to promote eugenics, which has been described as racist and white supremacist in nature, and as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also published articles in and spoke at conferences organized by the white supremacist magazine &quot;American Renaissance&quot;.

Rushton was a Fellow of the Canadian Psychological Association and a onetime Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 2020, the Department of Psychology of the University of Western Ontario released a statement stating that &quot;much of [Rushton&#x27;s] research was racist&quot;, was &quot;deeply flawed from a scientific standpoint&quot;, and &quot;Rushton&#x27;s legacy shows that the impact of flawed science lingers on, even after qualified scholars have condemned its scientific integrity.&quot; As of 2021, Rushton has had six research publications retracted for being scientifically flawed, unethical, and not replicable, and for advancing a racist agenda despite contradictory evidence.

==Early life and education==
Rushton was born in Bournemouth, England. During his childhood, he emigrated with his family to South Africa, where he lived from age four to eight (1948–1952). His father was a building contractor and his mother came from France. The family moved to Canada, where Rushton spent most of his teen years. He returned to England for university, receiving a B.Sc. in psychology from Birkbeck College at the University of London in 1970, and, in 1973, his Ph.D. in social psychology from the London School of Economics for work on altruism in children. He continued his work at the University of Oxford until 1974.

==Later life and career==
Rushton taught at York University in Canada from 1974 to 1976 and the University of Toronto until 1977. He moved to the University of Western Ontario and was made full professor (with tenure) in 1985. He received a D.Sc. from the University of London in 1992. His controversial research has sparked political debates, and Ontario Premier David Peterson called Rushton a racist. In 2005, &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; described Rushton as the most famous university professor in Canada.

He published more than 250 articles and six books, including two on altruism, and one on scientific excellence, and co-authored an introductory psychology textbook. He was a signatory of the opinion piece &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence.&quot;

Rushton died of cancer on October 2, 2012, at the age of 68.

==Work and opinions==

===Genetic similarity theory===
Early in his career, Rushton did research on altruism. He theorized a heritable component in altruism and developed &quot;Genetic Similarity Theory&quot;, which is an extension of W.D. Hamilton&#x27;s theory of kin selection. It holds that individuals tend to be more altruistic to individuals who are genetically similar to themselves even if they are not kin, and less altruistic, and sometimes outwardly hostile, to individuals who are less genetically similar. Rushton describes &quot;ethnic conflict and rivalry&quot; as &quot;one of the great themes of historical and contemporary society&quot;, and suggests that this may have its roots in the evolutionary impact on individuals from groups &quot;giving preferential treatment to genetically similar others&quot;. According to Rushton: &quot;the makeup of a gene pool [i.e., a human population&#x27;s total reservoir of alternative genes] causally affects the probability of any particular ideology being adopted&quot;.

Articles in a 1989 issue of &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot; criticized the theory. Judith Anderson said his work was based on statistically flawed evidence, John Archer and others said that Rushton failed to understand and misapplied the theory of kin selection, Judith Economos said that Rushton&#x27;s analysis was speculative, that he failed to define the concept of altruistic behavior in a way that it can become manifest, and that he failed to show any plausible mechanism by which members of a species can detect the &quot;altruism gene&quot; in other members of the species. Steven Gangestad criticized Rushton&#x27;s theory for not being compelling in terms of its attractiveness as an explanatory model. C.R. Hallpike said Rushton&#x27;s theory failed to take into account that many other traits, ranging from age, sex, social and political group membership, are observably more important in predicting altruistic behavior between non-kin than genetic similarity. John Hartung criticized Rushton for failing to conduct an adequate control group study and for ignoring contradictory evidence.

Littlefield and Rushton (1984) examined degree of bereavement among parents after the death of a child. They found that children perceived as more physically similar to their parents were grieved for more intensely than less similar children. Russell, Wells, and Rushton (1985) reanalyzed several previous studies on similarities between spouses and concluded there is higher similarity on the more heritable characteristics. In 1988 Rushton examined blood group genes and found that sexually interacting couples had more similar blood group genes than randomly paired individuals.

===Race and intelligence===
Rushton spent much of his career arguing that average IQ differences between racial groups are due to genetic causes, a view that was controversial at the time and is now broadly rejected by the scientific consensus. His research areas included studying brain size and the effects of racial admixture.

In a 2020 statement, his former department at the University of Western Ontario stated: &quot;Rushton&#x27;s works linking race and intelligence are based on an incorrect assumption that fuels systemic racism, the notion that racialized groups are concordant with patterns of human ancestry and genetic population structure.&quot; Furthermore, they stated that Rushton&#x27;s work on the topic is &quot;characterized by a complete misunderstanding of population genetic measures, including fundamental misconceptions about the nature of heritability.&quot;

===Application of &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory to race===

Rushton&#x27;s book &quot;Race, Evolution, and Behavior&quot; (1995) attempted to use &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory to explain what he described as an evolutionary scale of characteristics indicative of nurturing behavior in which East Asian people consistently averaged high, black people low, and white people in the middle. He first published this theory in 1984. Rushton argued that East Asians and their descendants average a larger brain size, greater intelligence, more sexual restraint, slower rates of maturation, and greater law abidingness and social organization than do Europeans and their descendants, whom he argued average higher scores on these measures than Africans and their descendants. He hypothesized that &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory explains these differences.

Rushton&#x27;s application of &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory to explain differences among racial groups has been widely criticized. Differential K theory in particular was described in a 2020 statement by Rushton&#x27;s former department at Western Ontario University as &quot;thoroughly debunked.&quot;

One of his many critics is the evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves, who has done extensive testing of the &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory with species of Drosophila flies. Graves argues that not only is &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory considered to be virtually useless when applied to human life history evolution, but Rushton does not apply the theory correctly, and displays a lack of understanding of evolutionary theory in general. Graves also says that Rushton misrepresented the sources for the biological data he gathered in support of his hypothesis, and that much of his social science data was collected by dubious means. Other scholars have argued against Rushton&#x27;s hypothesis on the basis that the concept of race is not supported by genetic evidence about the diversity of human populations, and that his research was based on folk taxonomies.

Later studies by Rushton and other researchers have argued that there is empirical support for the theory, though these studies too have been criticized.

Psychologist David P. Barash observed that &quot;r&quot;- and &quot;K&quot;-selection may have some validity when considering the so-called demographic transition, whereby economic development characteristically leads to reduced family size and other &quot;K&quot; traits. &quot;But this is a pan-human phenomenon, a flexible, adaptive response to changed environmental conditions ... Rushton wields &quot;r&quot;- and &quot;K&quot;-selection as a Procrustean bed, doing what he can to make the available data fit ... Bad science and virulent racial prejudice drip like pus from nearly every page of this despicable book.&quot;

===Dimensional structure of personality===
Beginning in 2008, Rushton researched the structure of personality. Over about a dozen papers, he argued that variation in personality can be explained by variation in a single underlying &quot;general factor&quot;, similar to the g factor of psychometrics.

===Opinions===
In 2009 Rushton spoke at the &quot;Preserving Western Civilization&quot; conference in Baltimore. It was organized by Michael H. Hart for the stated purpose of &quot;addressing the need&quot; to defend &quot;America&#x27;s Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity&quot; from immigrants, Muslims, and African Americans. The Anti-Defamation League described the conference attendees as &quot;racist academics, conservative pundits and anti-immigrant activists&quot;.

==Reception==

===Press coverage===
Rushton prompted controversy for years, attracting coverage from the press as well as comments and criticism by scientists of his books and journal articles.

First-year psychology students who took Rushton&#x27;s classes said that he had conducted a survey of students&#x27; sexual habits in 1988, asking &quot;such questions as how large their penises are, how many sex partners they have had, and how far they can ejaculate&quot;. First-year psychology students at the University of Western Ontario are required &quot;to participate in approved surveys as a condition of their studies. If they choose not to, they must write one research paper. Also, many students feel subtle pressure to participate in order not to offend professors who may later be grading their work. However, if a study is not approved, these requirements do not apply at all.&quot; For his failing to tell students they had the option not to participate in his studies without incurring additional work, the university barred Rushton for two years from using students as research subjects. He had tenure at UWO.

In a 2005 &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; article, Rushton stated that the public perceives disproportionately negative effects caused by black residents &quot;in every bloody city in Canada where you have black
people.&quot; In the same article, Rushton suggested that equalizing outcomes across groups was &quot;impossible&quot;. The Southern Poverty Law Center called the piece &quot;yet another attack&quot; by Rushton, and it criticized those who published his work and that of other &quot;race scientists&quot;.

===Academic opinion===
====Favorable====
In a 1991 work, the Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson (one of the two co-founders of the &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory which Rushton uses) was quoted as having said about him:

Three years after the publication of Wilson&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;&quot;, Rushton had already begun a long correspondence with Wilson. The letters became particularly extensive between 1987 and 1995 (Wilson&#x27;s letters have now been archived by the Library of Congress). After Wilson&#x27;s death at the end of 2021, historians of science Mark Borrello and David Sepkoski have reassessed how Wilson&#x27;s thinking on issues of race and evolution was influenced by Rushton.

In a 1995 review of Rushton&#x27;s &quot;Race, Evolution, and Behavior&quot;, anthropologist and population geneticist Henry Harpending expressed doubt as to whether all of Rushton&#x27;s data fit the &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; model he proposed, but nonetheless praised the book for its proposing of a theoretical model that makes testable predictions about differences between human groups. He concludes that &quot;Perhaps there will ultimately be some serious contribution from the traditional smoke-and-mirrors social science treatment of IQ, but for now Rushton&#x27;s framework is essentially the only game in town.&quot; In their 2009 book &quot;The 10,000 Year Explosion&quot;, Harpending and Gregory Cochran later described Rushton as one of the researchers to whom they are indebted.

The psychologists Arthur Jensen, Hans Eysenck, Richard Lynn, Linda Gottfredson and Thomas Bouchard had a high opinion of Rushton&#x27;s &quot;Race, Evolution and Behavior&quot;, describing Rushton&#x27;s work as rigorous and impressive. However, many of these researchers are themselves controversial and they all received money from the Pioneer Fund, which had funded much of Rushton&#x27;s work when these reviews were written.

Some criminologists who study the relationship between race and crime regard Rushton&#x27;s &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; theory as one of several possible explanations for racial disparities in crime rates. Others, such as the criminologist Shaun L. Gabbidon, think that Rushton has developed one of the more controversial biosocial theories related to race and crime; he says that it has been criticized for failing to explain all of the data and for its potential to support racist ideologies. The criminologist Anthony Walsh has defended Rushton, claiming that none of Rushton&#x27;s critics has supplied data indicating anything other than the racial gradient he identifies, and that it is unscientific to dismiss Rushton&#x27;s ideas on the basis of their political implications.

====Unfavorable====
On 22 June 2020, the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario issued a statement regarding their former faculty member, which read in part:
Also in 2020, Andrew Winston summarized Rushton&#x27;s scholarly reception as follows: &quot;Rushton&#x27;s work was heavily criticized by psychologists, evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, and geneticists for severe scientific inadequacies, fundamental errors, inappropriate conceptualization of race, inappropriate statistical comparisons, misuse of sources, and serious logical errors and flaws.&quot;

In 1989, geneticist and media personality David Suzuki criticized Rushton&#x27;s racial theories in a live televised debate at the University of Western Ontario. He said: &quot;There will always be Rushtons in science, and we must always be prepared to root them out&quot;. At the same occasion, Rushton rejected believing in racial superiority, saying &quot;we&#x27;ve got to realize that each of these populations is perfectly, beautifully adapted to their own ancestral environments&quot;.

Also in 1989, Michael Lynn published a paper in the &quot;Journal of Research in Personality&quot; criticizing a study by Rushton &amp; Bogaert that had been published in the same journal two years earlier. Lynn cited four reasons he considered Rushton &amp; Bogaert&#x27;s study to be flawed: 

Marvin Zuckerman, psychology professor of the University of Delaware, criticized Rushton&#x27;s research on methodological grounds, observing that more variation exists in personality traits within racial groups than between them and arguing that Rushton selectively cited data from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.

Critical psychologist Thomas Teo argued that Rushton&#x27;s &quot;substantial success and influence in the discipline&quot; and use of &quot;accepted usage of empirical mainstream methods&quot; pointed to broader problems in academic psychology.

Biologist Garland E. Allen argued in 1990 that Rushton &quot;selectively cites and misrepresents his sources to support his conclusions. Far from being an &#x27;honest attempt&#x27; to follow the Truth wherever it leads, Rushton seems to be putting a ring through Truth&#x27;s nose and leading it toward his own barn...He has used, abused, distorted, and in some cases virtually falsified his sources.&quot;

According to Charles Lane, in 1988, Rushton conducted a survey at the Eaton Centre mall in Toronto, where he paid 50 whites, 50 blacks, and 50 Asians to answer questions about their sexual habits. Because he did not clear his survey and proposed to pay for answers with the university committee at UWO, the administration reprimanded Rushton, calling his transgression &quot;a serious breach of scholarly procedure&quot;, said University President, George Pederson.

A 1993 study reanalyzed data from a study Rushton had published on the relationship between race and crime and found no strong relationship between the two.

Rushton&#x27;s work was criticized in the scholarly literature; he generally responded, sometimes in the same journal. In 1995, in the &quot;Journal of Black Studies&quot;, Zack Cernovsky wrote: &quot;some of Rushton&#x27;s references to scientific literature with respects to racial differences in sexual characteristics turned out to be references to a nonscientific semi-pornographic book and to an article by Philip Nobile in the &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine&#x27;s Forum.&quot;

In 1995, two researchers published a review and meta-analysis concluding that racial differences in behavior were accounted for entirely by environmental factors, which contradicts Rushton&#x27;s evolutionary theory for the origin of such differences.

Anti-racism activist Tim Wise criticized Rushton&#x27;s application of &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; selection theory to crime rates and IQ, charging that Rushton ignored things such as systematic/institutional discrimination, racial profiling, economic disparities and unequal access to judicial defense in his attempt to apply &quot;r&quot;/&quot;K&quot; Theory and IQ theories to explain racial disparities in American crime rates. He also criticized Rushton and others like him of ignoring things like white-collar crime rates, 

The biological anthropologist C. Loring Brace criticized Rushton in his 1996 review of the book, &quot;Race, Evolution, and Behavior&quot; (1996):
Robert Sussman, an evolutionary anthropologist and the editor-in-chief of &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;, explained why the journal did not accept ads for Rushton&#x27;s 1998 book:

In 2000, after Rushton mailed a booklet on his work to psychology, sociology, and anthropology professors across North America, Hermann Helmuth, a professor of anthropology at Trent University, said: &quot;It is in a way personal and political propaganda. There is no basis to his scientific research.&quot; Rushton responded, &quot;It&#x27;s not racist; it&#x27;s a matter of science and recognizing variation in all groups of people.&quot;

From 2002, Rushton was the president of the Pioneer Fund. Tax records show that in 2002 his Charles Darwin Research Institute was awarded $473,835, or 73% of the fund&#x27;s total grants that year. The Southern Poverty Law Center, an American civil rights organization, characterizes the Pioneer Fund as a hate group. Rushton had spoken on eugenics several times at conferences of the &quot;American Renaissance&quot; magazine, a monthly white supremacist magazine, in which he had also published a number of general articles.

Rushton published articles on the website VDARE, which advocates for reduced immigration into the United States. Stefan Kühl wrote in his book, &quot;The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism&quot; (2002), that Rushton was part of the revival in the 1980s of public interest in scientific racism.

William H. Tucker, a professor of psychology and expert on the history of scientific racism, observed in 2002:
A 2003 study in &quot;Evolution and Human Behavior&quot; found no evidence to support Rushton&#x27;s hypothesized relationship between race and behavior.

In 2005, Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote an article for &quot;Psychology, Public Policy, and Law&quot; noting that Rushton ignored evidence that failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy. He did not change his position on this matter for 30 years. Rushton replied in the same issue of the journal.

In a paper for the &quot;International Journal of Selection and Assessment&quot; in 2006, Steven Cronshaw and colleagues wrote that psychologists need to critically examine the science used by Rushton in his &quot;race-realist&quot; research. Their re-analysis of the validity criteria for test bias, using data reported in the &quot;Rushton et al.&quot; paper, led them to conclude that the testing methods were biased against Black Africans. They disagree with other aspects of Rushton&#x27;s methodology, such as his use of non-equivalent groups in test samples. Rushton responded in the next issue of the journal. He said why he believed his results were valid, and why he thought the criticisms incorrect.

Scott McGreal (2012) in &quot;Psychology Today&quot; criticized the science of Rushton&#x27;s &quot;Race Differences in Sexual Behavior: Testing an Evolutionary Hypothesis&quot;. He cited Weizmann, Wiener, Wiesenthal, &amp; Ziegle, which argued that Rushton&#x27;s theory relied on flawed science. McGreal faulted Rushton and his use of Nobile&#x27;s penis size study.

On 17 June 2020, academic publisher Elsevier announced it was retracting an article that Rushton and Donald Templer had published in 2012 in the Elsevier journal &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot;. The article falsely claimed that there was scientific evidence that skin color was related to aggression and sexuality in humans.

On 24 December 2020, the academic journal &quot;Psychological Reports&quot; retracted two Rushton articles about intelligence and race. Review of the articles, which were originally published in the 1990s, &quot;found that the research was unethical, scientifically flawed, and based on racist ideas and agenda&quot;. On 23 August 2021, it retracted three more.

<text>Juliana Hatfield (born July 27, 1967) is an American musician and singer-songwriter from the Boston area. She was formerly a member of the indie rock bands Blake Babies, Some Girls, and The Lemonheads. Hatfield also fronted her own band, The Juliana Hatfield Three, alongside bassist Dean Fisher and drummer Todd Philips, which was active in the mid-1990s and again in the mid-2010s. With The Juliana Hatfield Three, she achieved her best-charting work, including the critically acclaimed album &quot;Become What You Are&quot; (1993), which featured the singles &quot;My Sister&quot; (1993) and &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;.

She has performed and recorded as a solo artist and as one-half of Minor Alps with Matthew Caws of Nada Surf. In 2014, she reformed The Juliana Hatfield Three and announced the release of the album &quot;Whatever, My Love&quot; in 2015.

In 2016, she collaborated with Paul Westerberg under the moniker The I Don&#x27;t Cares to release the album &quot;Wild Stab&quot;. She later released an album of original work titled &quot;Weird&quot; (2019), along with three albums of cover songs: &quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John&quot; (2018), &quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police&quot; (2019), and &quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO&quot; (2023).

== Early life ==
Hatfield was born in Wiscasset, Maine, to Phillip M. Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former fashion editor for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. She grew up in Duxbury, Massachusetts, near Boston. Despite recording a song titled &quot;My Sister,&quot; Hatfield has no sisters but does have two brothers.

Her father claimed that their family descended from the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield–McCoy feud following the Civil War. He also served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War.

Hatfield attended Duxbury High School in Duxbury, Massachusetts. She first enrolled at Boston University before transferring to Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 2012, she attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where she completed a year-long post-baccalaureate certificate program in painting.

== Music career ==
=== First bands and solo album ===
Hatfield developed a love for rock music during the 1970s after a babysitter introduced her to the Los Angeles punk rock band X, an experience she described as life-changing. She was also drawn to the music of more mainstream artists, including Olivia Newton-John and The Police.

While still attending Berklee College of Music in 1986, Hatfield formed the band Blake Babies with John Strohm and Freda Love. The band released four albums between 1987 and 1991, gaining critical recognition from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, as well as local radio airplay and press coverage. They also received label support from Mammoth Records in North Carolina. Blake Babies disbanded in 1992 but briefly reunited in 2001 to release another album.

After Blake Babies disbanded, Hatfield joined The Lemonheads as their bassist, replacing founding member Jesse Peretz. She played on their breakthrough 1992 album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray.&quot; After about a year, she left the band but returned in 1993 as a guest vocalist on several tracks of &quot;Come on Feel the Lemonheads&quot;.

In 1992, Hatfield released her debut solo album, &quot;Hey Babe&quot;.

=== The Juliana Hatfield Three ===

Her commercial breakthrough came in 1993 when she formed the band The Juliana Hatfield Three. Along with her high-school friend Dean Fisher on bass and former Bullet LaVolta drummer Todd Philips, she handled lead vocals and lead guitar duties. The band released the album &quot;Become What You Are&quot; and two hit singles, &quot;My Sister&quot; and &quot;Spin the Bottle.&quot;

&quot;My Sister&quot; was inspired by Hatfield&#x27;s older brother&#x27;s girlfriend, Maggie Rafferty, who lived with the family while Hatfield was in high school. Hatfield enjoyed Rafferty&#x27;s eclectic record collection and was also introduced to live music, as Rafferty took her to see the Del Fuegos and the Violent Femmes, which inspired Hatfield to form a band.

&quot;Spin the Bottle&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994). Hatfield also made the cover of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine.

Hatfield was profiled in several girls&#x27; magazines, most notably &quot;Sassy,&quot; where she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. Reflecting on this period, she said, &quot;I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn&#x27;t earned it yet.&quot; In 1992, she gained notoriety for revealing in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Vox&quot;, she expressed surprise at the reaction to her &#x27;outing&#x27;: &quot;I think there are a lot of people out there who don&#x27;t care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beefcake hunky guys and scantily clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn&#x27;t care about sex in a magazine that&#x27;s full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke.&quot;

Over the years, Hatfield&#x27;s virginity became a recurring theme in her press coverage, often accompanied by speculation that she had lost it to The Lemonheads&#x27; leader, Evan Dando, who referred to her as his &quot;friend and sometimes girlfriend.&quot; In 2006, Hatfield sent a letter to &quot;The Weekly Dig&quot; in response to writer Debbie Driscoll&#x27;s scathing review of Soul Asylum&#x27;s latest album, &quot;The Silver Lining&quot;. Kevin Dean from the newspaper responded by bringing up the subject of Hatfield losing her virginity to Dando. Hatfield fired back at Dean for bringing up her sex life, clarifying that she and Dando never had sex, and revealing that it was actually Spike Jonze to whom she had lost her virginity. She later admitted that she lost her virginity at 26 and was &quot;damn ready.&quot;

=== Return to solo career ===

The Juliana Hatfield Three remained together only through 1994. By 1995, Hatfield had returned to solo status and released the album &quot;Only Everything&quot;, in which she &quot;turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun.&quot; One reviewer described it as &quot;a fun, engaging pop album.&quot; The album produced another alternative radio hit for Hatfield with &quot;Universal Heartbeat.&quot; In the video, Hatfield portrayed a demanding aerobics instructor. Before the tour for &quot;Only Everything&quot;, she released Phillips and hired Jason Sutter on drums, Ed Slanker on guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. However, two weeks into the tour, she canceled it due to depression.

In her memoir, Hatfield writes that she was suffering from depression severe enough to be suicidal. She disagreed with the decision to avoid talking about her depression. The drummer was replaced by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act.

In 1996, Hatfield traveled to Woodstock, New York, where she recorded tracks for &quot;God&#x27;s Foot&quot;, which was intended to be her fourth solo album (or third, if &quot;Become What You Are&quot;—recorded with The Juliana Hatfield Three—is not counted). The album was planned for release in 1997. After three unsuccessful attempts to satisfy Atlantic Records&#x27; requests for a single, she asked to be released from her contract. The label agreed but retained the rights to the songs recorded during these sessions. &quot;Mountains of Love&quot; and &quot;Fade Away&quot; were later released on a greatest hits collection titled &quot;Gold Stars&quot;, while &quot;Can&#x27;t Kill Myself&quot; was made available for download on Hatfield&#x27;s website. The remaining tracks surfaced on bootlegs, which she disapproved of, and she has rarely performed them live.

In 1997, Hatfield toured with Lilith Fair, an all-female rock festival co-founded by singer Sarah McLachlan.

After the experience of &quot;God&#x27;s Foot&quot; and being freed from her label obligations, Hatfield recorded the EP &quot;Please Do Not Disturb&quot; for the independent label Bar/None. Produced by Hatfield, the album featured drummer Todd Phillips, guitarists Ed Slanker and Mike Leahy, and bassist Mikey Welsh of Weezer. The EP included &quot;Trying Not to Think About It,&quot; a tribute to her friend and deceased musician Jeff Buckley.

Almost as a reaction to the seemingly endless studio sessions surrounding &quot;God&#x27;s Foot&quot;, Hatfield recorded the album &quot;Bed&quot; in 1998 in just six days. About the album, she said on her website, &quot;It sounds as raw as I felt. It has no pretty sheen. The mistakes and unattractive parts were left in, not erased. Just like my career. Just like life.&quot;

In 2000, Hatfield released &quot;Beautiful Creature&quot;. However, this album left the rockier side of her musical personality unexpressed, so she simultaneously released &quot;Juliana&#x27;s Pony: Total System Failure&quot; with Zephan Courtney and Mikey Welsh. She described the latter album as &quot;a loud release of tension&quot; with &quot;lots of long sloppy guitar solos. And no love songs... a not-at-all attractive reaction to the ugly side of humanity, specifically American culture.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Beautiful Creature&quot; &quot;a collection of plaintive demos&quot; and &quot;Juliana&#x27;s Pony&quot; &quot;chock-a-block with punk guitar missives.&quot; &quot;Juliana&#x27;s Pony: Total System Failure&quot; was panned by some critics who preferred the more acoustic &quot;Beautiful Creature&quot;. On &quot;Beautiful Creature&quot;, Hatfield worked with musician Davíd Garza, who co-produced much of the album. Wally Gagel, a producer for Sebadoh and Tanya Donelly, helped Hatfield record her most electronica-influenced songs, &quot;Cool Rock Boy&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Rush Me,&quot; which added texture to the otherwise acoustic album.

In 2002, Hatfield released &quot;Gold Stars 1992–2002: The Juliana Hatfield Collection&quot;. The compilation included singles from her solo albums, two songs from the unreleased &quot;God&#x27;s Foot&quot;, a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart,&quot; and new songs.

In 2004, Hatfield released &quot;In Exile Deo&quot;, an attempt at a more commercial sound with input from producers and engineers who had worked with Pink and Avril Lavigne. Hatfield co-produced the album with David Leonard, receiving co-production credits on &quot;Jamie&#x27;s in Town&quot; and the bright rocker &quot;Sunshine.&quot; Critics praised the album, with some calling it her best work since the start of her solo career.

=== Ye Olde Records ===
In contrast, the 2005 album &quot;Made in China&quot; was recorded in Bellows Falls, Vermont, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was released on her own record label, Ye Olde Records. The album had a much rawer feel, with Hatfield playing instruments alongside the band Unbusted and other contributors. For the first time, Hatfield also played drums on at least one track.

John Doe of the band X described the album as &quot;a frighteningly dark and beautiful record filled with stark, angular, truly brutal songs and guitars. This is surely a &#x27;Woman Under the Influence,&#x27; though I&#x27;m not sure of what.&quot; Reviews were mixed, with some appreciating the lo-fi sound while others viewed it as slackness.

The release of &quot;Made in China&quot; marked the beginning of a trend where Hatfield licensed her music, selling it via her website and through a distribution deal with Red Eye.

In December 2005, Hatfield toured the United States with the band X, whom she had idolized during her teenage years.

In 2006, Hatfield released her first live album, &quot;The White Broken Line: Live Recordings.&quot; The album featured performances from her tour with X and was her third release on her record label.

Hatfield&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;How to Walk Away&quot;, was released on August 19, 2008, on Ye Olde Records. The album&#x27;s heartfelt exploration of the breakup of a relationship resonated with critics, who gave it largely positive reviews, with some hailing it as her best album since &quot;In Exile Deo&quot;.

Hatfield returned two years later with her tenth studio album, &quot;Peace &amp; Love,&quot; which was released on Ye Olde Records on February 16, 2010. The album&#x27;s composition, arrangement, performance, production, engineering, and mixing were all credited solely to Hatfield. The album received mixed reviews, with several critics complaining that its low-key, moody nature worked against the potential of the songs.

In October 2010, Hatfield and Evan Dando played two sold-out acoustic live shows together at The Mercury Lounge in New York. The following month, the duo played sold-out shows in Allston. This tour was followed by five dates on the American East Coast in January 2011.

=== PledgeMusic ===

In April 2011, Hatfield announced her intention to work on a new album via the fan-funding platform PledgeMusic. Fan response was enthusiastic, exceeding 400% of the original project cost. The album was initially going to be titled &quot;Speeches Delivered to Animals and Plants&quot;, referencing a passage in the John Irving novel &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, but Hatfield later changed it to &quot;There&#x27;s Always Another Girl.&quot; The new title referred to a song on the album of the same name, which she had written as a defense of Lindsay Lohan after watching her film &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot;.

&quot;There&#x27;s Always Another Girl&quot; was released on August 30, 2011, independently on her Ye Olde Records label. However, a downloadable version was made available to contributors a month earlier, on July 27, which was Juliana&#x27;s birthday. The album has received mostly positive reviews from critics.

On August 28, 2012, Juliana Hatfield released a covers album titled &quot;Juliana Hatfield&quot; on her Ye Olde Records label. The album features covers of songs originally performed by The Who, Liz Phair, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Ryan Adams, I Blame Coco, and Led Zeppelin.

In December 2014, &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; named her track &quot;Needle in the Hay,&quot; a cover of Elliott Smith&#x27;s song, as No. 10 on its list of the &quot;20 Best Cover Songs of 2014.&quot; The review described the cover as &quot;a more upbeat, approachable take on Smith&#x27;s disparate, wrought-iron classic. But even though it now employs bass, drums, tambourine, and synth, the song stays true to the sorrowful, tension-riddled original.&quot; Also that month, &quot;SPIN Magazine&quot; named the cover one of the &quot;40 Best 2014 Songs by 1994 Artists,&quot; where it ranked No. 36. The review noted, &quot;The tempo&#x27;s a bit quicker, and she double-tracks herself for the song&#x27;s entirety. But the (tasteful) inclusion of chintzy drum programming and mellotron cleverly point to Smith&#x27;s eventual creative direction.&quot;

=== Reformation of The Juliana Hatfield Three ===
In 2014, The Juliana Hatfield Three reunited two decades after it disbanded. Hatfield used PledgeMusic to raise funds for the new album, &quot;Whatever, My Love&quot;, the trio&#x27;s first since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Become What You Are&quot;. Hatfield explained, &quot;We haven&#x27;t totally reinvented the wheel or anything,&quot; adding that the tracks feature &quot;stuff I am sort of known for, I guess. But I am a lot more confident now than I was then with the first album. And I had more fun recording this one.&quot; The twelve tracks for &quot;Whatever, My Love&quot; were recorded at Nuthouse Recording in Hoboken, New Jersey, with Beaujour and Hatfield co-producing. The lead single, &quot;If I Could,&quot; was released in December 2014 and premiered in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. That month, the album was made available for pre-order on American Laundromat Records, with an announced release date of February 17, 2015. The band also announced a U.S. tour throughout February, visiting cities on both coasts and in the Midwest, with stops at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City and The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles.

In late December 2014, &quot;Stereogum&quot; named the album &quot;one of their most anticipated albums of 2015,&quot; and on January 4, 2015, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; listed it as &quot;one of the 50 most anticipated albums of 2015.&quot; On January 9, 2015, Hatfield was featured on Nylon.com, which wrote that the upcoming album came across as &quot;unforced, and with its sly lyrics and mega-hooky coffeehouse-grunge aesthetic.&quot; The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Ordinary Guy,&quot; premiered on &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; on January 14, 2015.

=== Recent collaborations and solo work ===
In 2015, Hatfield and Paul Westerberg announced that they had formed a new group called the I Don&#x27;t Cares. They released the album &quot;Wild Stab&quot; in 2016.

Since then, Hatfield has released a number of solo albums, including two albums of cover songs—&quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John&quot; (2018) and &quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police&quot; (2019)—and three albums of original work: &quot;Pussycat&quot; (2017), &quot;Weird&quot; (2019), and &quot;Blood&quot; (2021).

In 2019, Hatfield hinted that her next covers album would focus on the work of an American artist, having already covered an Australian (Olivia Newton-John) and an English band (The Police). In an interview for the book &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, Hatfield revealed that she was considering R.E.M. for her next covers album installment. However, the follow-up ended up being Electric Light Orchestra. The album, &quot;Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO&quot;, was released on November 17, 2023.

== Musical style ==
=== Style and influences ===
From her work with the Blake Babies to the present, Hatfield&#x27;s music has alternated between heavy, rocking tunes and gentler, more melodic or folk-oriented songs. She has stated that in the 1990s, she briefly tried smoking cigarettes in hopes of giving her voice a rougher quality but eventually reconciled herself with her distinctive vocal style.

Hatfield&#x27;s musical influences are diverse, ranging from punk bands like X, The Stooges, and The Replacements to more folk-oriented rock artists like Neil Young, whose songs the Blake Babies frequently covered in live shows. Her work has also intersected with contemporaneous indie rock bands such as Dinosaur Jr. and The Lemonheads, whose members are also her friends.

From an early age, she has had a particular love for melodic pop music. In a 1998 interview, she stated, &quot;I just always liked pop music and really good melodies and major chords. That&#x27;s just the type of music that comes naturally to me.&quot; In a 1993 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Hatfield mentioned that her enthusiasm for the pop group Wilson Phillips apparently contributed, at least in part, to the breakup of the Blake Babies.

=== Lyrics ===
Hatfield describes herself as very shy and somewhat of a loner, stating that &quot;happy lyrics don&#x27;t come naturally to me.&quot; She has characterized her music and songwriting as a form of therapy, providing an outlet that helps her navigate difficult times and depression.

== Collaborations ==
Hatfield has also recorded with The Lemonheads, living for a time with Evan Dando in Boston&#x27;s college neighborhood of Allston. She has contributed backing vocals to recordings by Belly, Giant Sand, Susanna Hoffs, Aimee Mann, and Mary Lou Lord. In 1999, she teamed up with Dando to record Gram Parsons&#x27;s song &quot;$1,000 Wedding&quot; for the compilation &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;.

=== Some Girls ===
In 2001, Hatfield joined Freda Love and Heidi Gluck (of The Pieces and The Only Children) to form the trio Some Girls, performing alongside her solo work. The group has toured the United States twice and released two albums, serving as an outlet for Hatfield&#x27;s more lighthearted material. Their first album, &quot;Feel It&quot;, was released by Koch Records in 2003, featuring the lead single &quot;Necessito,&quot; a funky affirmation of the power of music sung in a mix of English and Spanish. Some Girls&#x27; second album, &quot;Crushing Love&quot;, was released in July 2006.

=== Frank Smith ===
In 2007, Hatfield signed the Boston (now Austin)-based band Frank Smith to her record label, Ye Olde Records. In addition to releasing their 2007 album &quot;Heavy Handed Peace and Love&quot;, she recorded an EP with the band titled &quot;Sittin&#x27; in a Tree&quot;. Produced by Frank Smith&#x27;s Aaron Sinclair, the EP features banjos, pedal steel, and other instruments typically associated with country music.

=== Minor Alps ===
Hatfield and Matthew Caws of Nada Surf formed a band called Minor Alps, releasing their first album, &quot;Get There&quot;, on October 29, 2013, via Barsuk Records.

Julie Gayet appears in the music video for Minor Alps&#x27; song &quot;Waiting for You.&quot;

=== The I Don&#x27;t Cares ===
Hatfield and Paul Westerberg formed The I Don&#x27;t Cares, releasing Wild Stab on January 22, 2016, via Dry Wood Records.

== Writing and acting ==
Beyond her musical accomplishments, Hatfield has guest-starred on several television shows, including &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; as a lunch lady and the 1994 Christmas episode of the cult classic &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; as a deceased homeless girl who becomes an angel. During the mid-1990s, she was a staple on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; alternative music program and performed on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 1995.

On March 25, 2008, Hatfield began her own blog through her website titled &quot;An Arm and A Leg&quot;. The blog lasted about a year before being removed. Each week, or thereabouts, she revealed the influences behind one of her songs.

Hatfield briefly appeared on an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; titled &quot;Surprise,&quot; which aired on June 19, 1996. Instead of being interviewed, she simply said &quot;uhh&quot; and was then zapped by Zorak.

Hatfield released the book &quot;When I Grow Up: A Memoir&quot; on September 22, 2008.

==Personal life==
Hatfield has been a vegetarian for many years. She has been open about her struggles with depression, anorexia, and disordered eating.

She briefly dated musician and collaborator Ryan Adams in 2008.

In 2006, she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she continues to live.

<text>On November 29, 1983, a memorandum of agreement was set up between Israel and the United States regarding political, military and economic cooperation. Part of the agreement was for a Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) as a high-level planning forum to discuss and implement combined planning, joint exercises, and logistics. The JPMG is co-chaired by the director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. The JPMG meets biannually, alternating between Israel and the United States.

The JPMG was originally intended to discuss means of countering Soviet involvement in the Middle East. But more recently the concern has been over the spread of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles.

==History==
Military relations between the United States and Israel improved under the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration sought to build an &quot;anti-Soviet strategic consensus in the Middle East.&quot; At the time, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon signed a memorandum of understanding in 1981 &quot;establishing a framework for continued consultation and cooperation to enhance&quot; national security. This agreement led to the establishment of the Joint Political Military Group, which has since met regularly to &quot;address&quot; foreign military sales to Israel, joint exercises and simulations, and logistical arrangements. Joint air and sea exercises started in 1984.

===Present status===
As part of the agreement, the United States and Israel meet twice a year to honor the obligations of the memorandum of understanding. In 2001 an annual &quot;inter-agency strategic dialogue&quot; including representatives from all areas of defense and intelligence was created.

<text>John William Polidori (7 September 1795 – 24 August 1821) was a British writer and physician. He is known for his associations with the Romantic movement and credited by some as the creator of the vampire genre of fantasy fiction. His most successful work was the short story &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819), the first published modern vampire story. Although the story was at first erroneously credited to Lord Byron, both Byron and Polidori affirmed that the author was Polidori.

== Family ==
John William Polidori was born on 7 September 1795 in Westminster, the eldest son of Gaetano Polidori, an Italian political émigré scholar, and his wife Anna Maria Pierce, an English governess. He had three brothers and four sisters.

His sister Frances Polidori married the exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti, and thus Polidori, posthumously, became the uncle of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, and Christina Georgina Rossetti. William Michael Rossetti published Polidori&#x27;s journal in 1911.

== Biography ==
John Polidori was one of the earliest pupils at the recently established Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire from 1804. In 1810 he went up to the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a thesis on sleepwalking and received his degree as a doctor of medicine on 1 August 1815, at the age of 19.

In 1816, which became known as the Year Without a Summer, Polidori entered Lord Byron&#x27;s service as his personal physician and accompanied him on a trip through Europe. Publisher John Murray offered Polidori 500 English pounds to keep a diary of their travels, which Polidori&#x27;s nephew William Michael Rossetti later edited. At the Villa Diodati, a house Byron rented by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, the pair met with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, her husband-to-be, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their companion (Mary&#x27;s stepsister) Claire Clairmont.

One night in June after the company had read aloud from &quot;Fantasmagoriana&quot;, a French collection of German horror tales, Byron suggested they each write a ghost story. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote &quot;A Fragment of a Ghost Story&quot; and wrote down five ghost stories recounted by Matthew Gregory &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis, published posthumously as the &quot;Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories) and on Return to England, 1816&quot;, the journal entries beginning on 18 August 1816. Mary Shelley worked on a tale that would later evolve into &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Byron wrote (and quickly abandoned) a fragment of a story, &quot;A Fragment&quot;, featuring the main character Augustus Darvell, which Polidori used later as the basis for his own tale, &quot;The Vampyre&quot;, the first published modern vampire story in English.

Polidori&#x27;s conversation with Percy Bysshe Shelley on 15 June 1816, as recounted in &quot;The Diary&quot;, is regarded as the origin or genesis of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. They discussed &quot;the nature of the principle of life&quot;: &quot;June 15 - ... Shelley etc. came in the evening ... Afterwards, Shelley and I had a conversation about principles — whether man was to be thought merely an instrument.&quot;

Dismissed by Byron, Polidori travelled in Italy and then returned to England. His story, &quot;The Vampyre&quot;, which featured the main character Lord Ruthven, was published in the April 1819 issue of &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; without his permission. Whilst in London he lived on Great Pulteney Street in Soho. Much to both his and Byron&#x27;s , &quot;The Vampyre&quot; was released as a new work by Byron. Byron&#x27;s own vampire story &quot;Fragment of a Novel&quot; or &quot;A Fragment&quot; was published in 1819 in an attempt to clear up the confusion, but, for better or worse, &quot;The Vampyre&quot; continued to be attributed to him.

Polidori&#x27;s long, Byron-influenced theological poem &quot;The Fall of the Angels&quot; was published anonymously in 1821.

== Death ==
John Polidori died at his father&#x27;s London house on 24 August 1821, weighed down by depression and gambling debts. Despite conjecture from his family that he died by suicide by means of prussic acid, the coroner gave a verdict of death by natural causes.

== Works ==
=== Plays ===
* &quot;Cajetan&quot;, a play (1816)
* &quot;Boadicea&quot;, a play (1816)

=== Poems ===
* &quot;Ximenes, the Wreath and Other Poems&quot; (1819)
*&quot;The Fall of the Angels: A Sacred Poem&quot; (1821)

=== Novellas ===

* &quot;The Vampyre: A Tale&quot; (1819) - a text that is &quot;often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism&quot;.
* &quot;Ernestus Berchtold; or, The Modern Oedipus: A Tale&quot; (1819)

=== Non-fiction ===
* &quot;A Medical Inaugural Dissertation which deals with the disease called Oneirodynia, for the degree of Medical Doctor&quot;, Edinburgh (1815)
* &quot;The Diary of Dr. John William Polidori&quot; (1816, published posthumously in 1911)
* &quot;On the Punishment of Death&quot; (1816)
* &quot;An Essay Upon the Source of Positive Pleasure&quot; (1818)
* &quot;Sketches Illustrative of the Manners and Costumes of France, Switzerland and Italy&quot; (1821)

== Posthumous editions ==
His sister Charlotte transcribed Polidori&#x27;s diaries, but censored &quot;peccant passages&quot; and destroyed the original. Based only on the transcription, &quot;The Diary of John Polidori&quot; was edited by William Michael Rossetti and first published in 1911 by Elkin Mathews (London). Reprints of this book, &quot;The Diary of Dr. John William Polidori, 1816, relating to Byron, Shelley, etc.&quot;, was published by Folcroft Library Editions (Folcroft, PA) in 1975, and by Norwood Editions (Norwood, PA) in 1978. A new edition of &quot;The Diary of John William Polidori&quot; was reprinted by Cornell University in 2009.

== Legacy ==
=== Memorials ===
A memorial plaque on John Polidori&#x27;s home at 38 Great Pulteney Street was unveiled on 15 July 1998 by the Italian Ambassador, Paolo Galli.

=== Appearances in other media ===
==== Film ====
Multiple films have depicted John Polidori, and the genesis of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Vampyre&quot; stories in 1816:
*&quot;Gothic&quot; (1986), directed by Ken Russell, with Timothy Spall as Polidori 
*&quot;Haunted Summer&quot; (1988), directed by Ivan Passer, with Alex Winter as Polidori 
*&quot;Remando al viento&quot; (1988; English title: &quot;Rowing with the Wind&quot;) directed by Gonzalo Suárez
*&quot;Mary Shelley&quot; (2017), directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour

Additionally, Polidori&#x27;s name was used for fictional characters in the following films:
*&quot;&quot; (1973), a television movie featuring a character named Dr. Polidori
*&quot;Vampires vs. the Bronx&quot; (2020), a film featuring a character named Frank Polidori

==== Literature ====
*Polidori appears as one of several minor characters killed off by Frankenstein&#x27;s creature in Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s novel &quot;The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein&quot;.
*Polidori is a central character in Federico Andahazi&#x27;s novel &quot;The Merciful Women&quot; (&quot;Las Piadosas&quot; in the original Argentine edition). In it, he receives &quot;The Vampyre&quot; written by the fictional character of Annette Legrand, in exchange for some &quot;favours&quot;.
*Polidori appears as a character in Howard Brenton&#x27;s play &quot;Bloody Poetry&quot; (though for some reason Brenton calls him William.)
*Polidori is a prominent character and the catalyst in events in Brooklyn Ann&#x27;s historical paranormal romance novel, &quot;Bite Me, Your Grace&quot;.
*Polidori is a central character in Emmanuel Carrère&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Gothic Romance&quot; (&quot;Bravoure&quot; in the original French edition), which, amongst other things, presents a fictionalised account of the events of 1816.
*Polidori appears as a character in Susanna Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot;.
*Polidori appears as an enemy of Lord Byron (who is a vampire) in Tom Holland&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord of the Dead&quot;.
*Polidori is also the &#x27;hero&#x27; of the novel &quot;Imposture&quot; (2007) by Benjamin Markovits.
*Polidori is also the central character in Derek Marlowe&#x27;s novel &quot;A Single Summer With L. B.&quot;, which presents an account (fictionalised) of the summer of 1816.
*Polidori appears as a minor and unsympathetic character in the Tim Powers&#x27; horror novel &quot;The Stress of Her Regard&quot; (1989), in which Polidori does not write about vampires but becomes directly involved with them. In Powers&#x27; sequel (of sorts), &quot;Hide Me Among the Graves&quot; (2012), Polidori is a vampire and a central villain menacing the novel&#x27;s protagonists, his nieces and nephews in the Rossetti family.
*Paul West&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord Byron&#x27;s Doctor&quot; (1989) is a recreation, and ribald fictionalization, of Polidori&#x27;s diaries. West depicts him as a literary groupie whose attempts to emulate Byron eventually unhinge and destroy him.
*(2013): Polidori is a prominent character in P.J. Parker&#x27;s internationally acclaimed historic fiction &quot;Fire on the Water: A Companion to Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot;
*(2019): P.J. Parker&#x27;s historic fiction &quot;Origin of the Vampyre&quot; pulls back the shroud of mystery surrounding the publication of Polidori&#x27;s novel.
*(2011): In Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of London&quot; and the other Peter Grant books, Polidori is often cited as a source of information about the supernatural.

==== Opera ====
*Polidori functions as narrator in John Mueter&#x27;s one-act opera &quot;Everlasting Universe&quot; and has a speaking role in several scenes.

==== Musical Theatre ====
*In the musical Monsters of the Villa Diodati, Polidori is a featured character, along with Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and Claire Claremont. The musical, written in 2014, was originally produced by Creative Cauldron at ArtSpace Falls Church in 2015. This atmospheric production reveals the origin story of two legendary Gothic monsters, John Polidori&#x27;s The Vampyre and Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein, while exploring their creators&#x27; own inner monsters.

==== Television ====
*In the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;, which featured Lord Byron, one of the series regulars, Methos, serves as a stand-in for Polidori. Methos, who was immortal, was Byron&#x27;s mentor, friend, and physician, and experienced the same events as the real Polidori did on that (in)famous night.
*In the stop-motion animated series &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenhole&quot;, Polidori is a regular character portrayed as the immortal lab assistant of Dr. Victor Frankenstein.
*Polidori was mentioned in the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; episode &quot;Ritual&quot;.
*Dr. John Polidori (portrayed by John O&#x27;Hurley) was the antagonist of the fifth season &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode, &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot;.
* Polidori was also portrayed by Noah McLaughlin in the 2016 web series &quot;A Ungenial Summer&quot;, which fictionalized the events of the summer of 1816 in the modern day. In this version, Polidori serves as a personal assistant to Lord Byron, rather than physician.
* In the episode of CBBC children&#x27;s television show Horrible Histories entitled Staggering Storytellers, Polidori was portrayed by Jalaal Hartley in the sketch about the original of his story, &quot;The Vampyre&quot; and Mary Shelley&#x27;s (portrayed by Jessica Ransom) story &quot;Frankenstein&quot; while at Lord Byron&#x27;s Villa Diodati in Switzerland.
* Polidori is portrayed by Maxim Baldry in the 2020 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Haunting of Villa Diodati&quot;, which depicts him as a sleepwalker.

<text>A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is usually not meant to be interpreted literally. It usually takes the form of a story, often with dialogue, and ends in a punch line, whereby the humorous element of the story is revealed; this can be done using a pun or other type of word play, irony or sarcasm, logical incompatibility, hyperbole, or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition:

It is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. In the case of riddle jokes or one-liners, the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humour—the shaggy dog story is an example of an anti-joke; although presented as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a punchline. Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is in the form of a joke. Some humorous forms which are &quot;not&quot; verbal jokes are: involuntary humour, situational humour, practical jokes, slapstick and anecdotes.

Identified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist André Jolles, jokes are passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet.

Stand-up comics, comedians and slapstick work with comic timing and rhythm in their performance, and may rely on actions as well as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying &quot;A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny&quot;.

== History in print==
Jokes do not belong to refined culture, but rather to the entertainment and leisure of all classes. As such, any printed versions were considered ephemera, i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. Many of these early jokes deal with scatological and sexual topics, entertaining to all social classes but not to be valued and saved.

Various kinds of jokes have been identified in ancient pre-classical texts. The oldest identified joke is an ancient Sumerian proverb from 1900 BC containing toilet humour: &quot;Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband&#x27;s lap.&quot; Its records were dated to the Old Babylonian period and the joke may go as far back as 2300 BC. The second oldest joke found, discovered on the Westcar Papyrus and believed to be about Sneferu, was from Ancient Egypt : &quot;How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish.&quot; The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known oldest jokes in the world. This is a comic triple dating back to 1200 BC Adab. It concerns three men seeking justice from a king on the matter of ownership over a newborn calf, for whose birth they all consider themselves to be partially responsible. The king seeks advice from a priestess on how to rule the case, and she suggests a series of events involving the men&#x27;s households and wives. The final portion of the story (which included the punch line), has not survived intact, though legible fragments suggest it was bawdy in nature.

Jokes can be notoriously difficult to translate from language to language; particularly puns, which depend on specific words and not just on their meanings. For instance, Julius Caesar once sold land at a surprisingly cheap price to his lover Servilia, who was rumoured to be prostituting her daughter Tertia to Caesar in order to keep his favour. Cicero remarked that &quot;conparavit Servilia hunc fundum tertia deducta.&quot; The punny phrase, &quot;tertia deducta&quot;, can be translated as &quot;with one-third off (in price)&quot;, or &quot;with Tertia putting out.&quot;

The earliest extant joke book is the &quot;Philogelos&quot; (Greek for &quot;The Laughter-Lover&quot;), a collection of 265 jokes written in crude ancient Greek dating to the fourth or fifth century AD. The author of the collection is obscure and a number of different authors are attributed to it, including &quot;Hierokles and Philagros the &quot;grammatikos&quot;&quot;, just &quot;Hierokles&quot;, or, in the &quot;Suda&quot;, &quot;Philistion&quot;. British classicist Mary Beard states that the &quot;Philogelos&quot; may have been intended as a jokester&#x27;s handbook of quips to say on the fly, rather than a book meant to be read straight through. Many of the jokes in this collection are surprisingly familiar, even though the typical protagonists are less recognisable to contemporary readers: the absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad breath. The &quot;Philogelos&quot; even contains a joke similar to Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Dead Parrot Sketch&quot;.

During the 15th century, the printing revolution spread across Europe following the development of the movable type printing press. This was coupled with the growth of literacy in all social classes. Printers turned out Jestbooks along with Bibles to meet both lowbrow and highbrow interests of the populace. One early anthology of jokes was the &quot;Facetiae&quot; by the Italian Poggio Bracciolini, first published in 1470. The popularity of this jest book can be measured on the twenty editions of the book documented alone for the 15th century. Another popular form was a collection of jests, jokes and funny situations attributed to a single character in a more connected, narrative form of the picaresque novel. Examples of this are the characters of Rabelais in France, Till Eulenspiegel in Germany, Lazarillo de Tormes in Spain and Master Skelton in England. There is also a jest book ascribed to William Shakespeare, the contents of which appear to both inform and borrow from his plays. All of these early jestbooks corroborate both the rise in the literacy of the European populations and the general quest for leisure activities during the Renaissance in Europe.

The practice of printers using jokes and cartoons as page fillers was also widely used in the broadsides and chapbooks of the 19th century and earlier. With the increase in literacy in the general population and the growth of the printing industry, these publications were the most common forms of printed material between the 16th and 19th centuries throughout Europe and North America. Along with reports of events, executions, ballads and verse, they also contained jokes. Only one of many broadsides archived in the Harvard library is described as &quot;1706. Grinning made easy; or, Funny Dick&#x27;s unrivalled collection of curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and eccentric jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, &amp;c. With many other descriptions of wit and humour.&quot; These cheap publications, ephemera intended for mass distribution, were read alone, read aloud, posted and discarded.

There are many types of joke books in print today; a search on the internet provides a plethora of titles available for purchase. They can be read alone for solitary entertainment, or used to stock up on new jokes to entertain friends. Some people try to find a deeper meaning in jokes, as in &quot;Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar... Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes&quot;. However a deeper meaning is not necessary to appreciate their inherent entertainment value. Magazines frequently use jokes and cartoons as filler for the printed page. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; closes out many articles with an (unrelated) joke at the bottom of the article. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was first published in 1925 with the stated goal of being a &quot;sophisticated humour magazine&quot; and is still known for its cartoons.

== Telling jokes ==
Telling a joke is a cooperative effort; it requires that the teller and the audience mutually agree in one form or another to understand the narrative which follows as a joke. In a study of conversation analysis, the sociologist Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling of a single joke. &quot;This telling is composed, as for stories, of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences … the preface [framing], the telling, and the response sequences.&quot; Folklorists expand this to include the context of the joking. Who is telling what jokes to whom? And why is he telling them when? The context of the joke-telling in turn leads into a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who engage in institutionalised banter and joking.

=== Framing: &quot;Have you heard the one…&quot; ===
Framing is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. &quot;Have you heard the one…&quot;, &quot;Reminds me of a joke I heard…&quot;, &quot;So, a lawyer and a doctor…&quot;; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows. Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in &quot;this is no joking matter&quot; or &quot;this is no time for jokes&quot;.

The performance frame serves to label joke-telling as a culturally marked form of communication. Both the performer and audience understand it to be set apart from the &quot;real&quot; world. &quot;An elephant walks into a bar…&quot;; a person sufficiently familiar with both the English language and the way jokes are told automatically understands that such a compressed and formulaic story, being told with no substantiating details, and placing an unlikely combination of characters into an unlikely setting and involving them in an unrealistic plot, is the start of a joke, and the story that follows is not meant to be taken at face value (i.e. it is non-bona-fide communication). The framing itself invokes a play mode; if the audience is unable or unwilling to move into play, then nothing will seem funny.

=== Telling ===
Following its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.

The narrative always contains a protagonist who becomes the &quot;butt&quot; or target of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes within the culture. It also enables researchers to group and analyse the creation, persistence and interpretation of joke cycles around a certain character. Some people are naturally better performers than others; however, anyone can tell a joke because the comic trigger is contained in the narrative text and punchline. A joke poorly told is still funny, unless errors or omissions make the intended relationship between the narrative and the punchline unintelligible.

=== Punchline ===
The punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline/response is elucidated by Victor Raskin in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour. Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. &quot;The punchline is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.&quot; To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to both be compatible with the joke text and opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin&#x27;s linguistic theory to include &quot;two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution.&quot; He explains that &quot;… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.&quot; In the case of a joke, that resolution generates laughter.

This is the point at which the field of neurolinguistics offers some insight into the cognitive processing involved in this abrupt laughter at the punchline. Studies by the cognitive science researchers Coulson and Kutas directly address the theory of script switching articulated by Raskin in their work. The article &quot;Getting it: Human event-related brain response to jokes in good and poor comprehenders&quot; measures brain activity in response to reading jokes. Additional studies by others in the field support more generally the theory of two-stage processing of humour, as evidenced in the longer processing time they require. In the related field of neuroscience, it has been shown that the expression of laughter is caused by two partially independent neuronal pathways: an &quot;involuntary&quot; or &quot;emotionally driven&quot; system and a &quot;voluntary&quot; system. This study adds credence to the common experience when exposed to an off-colour joke; a laugh is followed in the next breath by a disclaimer: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s bad…&quot; Here the multiple steps in cognition are clearly evident in the stepped response, the perception being processed just a breath faster than the resolution of the moral/ethical content in the joke.

=== Response ===
Expected response to a joke is laughter. The joke teller hopes the audience &quot;gets it&quot; and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an &quot;understanding test&quot; between individuals and groups. If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do &quot;get it&quot; and do not laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a joke told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same joke overheard in a women&#x27;s lavatory. A joke involving toilet humour may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same joke will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the joke remains the same, however, it is more or less appropriate depending on the current context.

=== Shifting contexts, shifting texts ===

The context explores the specific social situation in which joking occurs. The narrator automatically modifies the text of the joke to be acceptable to different audiences, while at the same time supporting the same divergent scripts in the punchline. The vocabulary used in telling the same joke at a university fraternity party and to one&#x27;s grandmother might well vary. In each situation, it is important to identify both the narrator and the audience as well as their relationship with each other. This varies to reflect the complexities of a matrix of different social factors: age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political views, religion, power relationships, etc. When all the potential combinations of such factors between the narrator and the audience are considered, then a single joke can take on infinite shades of meaning for each unique social setting.

The context, however, should not be confused with the function of the joking. &quot;Function is essentially an abstraction made on the basis of a number of contexts&quot;. In one long-term observation of men coming off the late shift at a local café, joking with the waitresses was used to ascertain sexual availability for the evening. Different types of jokes, going from general to topical into explicitly sexual humour signalled openness on the part of the waitress for a connection. This study describes how jokes and joking are used to communicate much more than just good humour. That is a single example of the function of joking in a social setting, but there are others. Sometimes jokes are used simply to get to know someone better. What makes them laugh, what do they find funny? Jokes concerning politics, religion or sexual topics can be used effectively to gauge the attitude of the audience to any one of these topics. They can also be used as a marker of group identity, signalling either inclusion or exclusion for the group. Among pre-adolescents, &quot;dirty&quot; jokes allow them to share information about their changing bodies. And sometimes joking is just simple entertainment for a group of friends.

== Relationships ==

The context of joking in turn leads to a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who take part in institutionalised banter and joking. These relationships can be either one-way or a mutual back and forth between partners. Joking relationships were first described by anthropologists within kinship groups in Africa. But they have since been identified in cultures around the world, where jokes and joking are used to mark and reinforce appropriate boundaries of a relationship.

== Electronic ==
The advent of electronic communications at the end of the 20th century introduced new traditions into jokes. A verbal joke or cartoon is emailed to a friend or posted on a bulletin board; reactions include a replied email with a :-) or LOL, or a forward on to further recipients. Interaction is limited to the computer screen and for the most part solitary. While preserving the text of a joke, both context and variants are lost in internet joking; for the most part, emailed jokes are passed along verbatim. The framing of the joke frequently occurs in the subject line: &quot;RE: laugh for the day&quot; or something similar. The forward of an email joke can increase the number of recipients exponentially.

Internet joking forces a re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They are no longer only defined by physical presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace. &quot;The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with&quot;. This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, &quot;that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event … flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh maimings and new collective tragedies&quot;. This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an &quot;active folkloric space&quot; with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.

A study by the folklorist Bill Ellis documented how an evolving cycle was circulated over the internet. By accessing message boards that specialised in humour immediately following the 9/11 disaster, Ellis was able to observe in real-time both the topical jokes being posted electronically and responses to the jokes. Access to archived message boards also enables us to track the development of a single joke thread in the context of a more complicated virtual conversation.

== Joke cycles ==

A joke cycle is a collection of jokes about a single target or situation which displays consistent narrative structure and type of humour. Some well-known cycles are elephant jokes using nonsense humour, dead baby jokes incorporating black humour, and light bulb jokes, which describe all kinds of operational stupidity. Joke cycles can centre on ethnic groups, professions (viola jokes), catastrophes, settings (…walks into a bar), absurd characters (wind-up dolls), or logical mechanisms which generate the humour (knock-knock jokes). A joke can be reused in different joke cycles; an example of this is the same Head &amp; Shoulders joke refitted to the tragedies of Vic Morrow, Admiral Mountbatten and the crew of the Challenger space shuttle. These cycles seem to appear spontaneously, spread rapidly across countries and borders only to dissipate after some time. Folklorists and others have studied individual joke cycles in an attempt to understand their function and significance within the culture.
Joke cycles circulated in the recent past include:
=== Tragedies and catastrophes ===

As with the 9/11 disaster discussed above, cycles attach themselves to celebrities or national catastrophes such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the death of Michael Jackson, and the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. These cycles arise regularly as a response to terrible unexpected events which command the national news. An in-depth analysis of the Challenger joke cycle documents a change in the type of humour circulated following the disaster, from February to March 1986. &quot;It shows that the jokes appeared in distinct &#x27;waves&#x27;, the first responding to the disaster with clever wordplay and the second playing with grim and troubling images associated with the event…The primary social function of disaster jokes appears to be to provide closure to an event that provoked communal grieving, by signalling that it was time to move on and pay attention to more immediate concerns&quot;.

=== Ethnic jokes ===

The sociologist Christie Davies has written extensively on ethnic jokes told in countries around the world. In ethnic jokes he finds that the &quot;stupid&quot; ethnic target in the joke is no stranger to the culture, but rather a peripheral social group (geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic) well known to the joke tellers. So Americans tell jokes about Polacks and Italians, Germans tell jokes about Ostfriesens, and the English tell jokes about the Irish. In a review of Davies&#x27; theories it is said that &quot;For Davies, [ethnic] jokes are more about how joke tellers imagine themselves than about how they imagine those others who serve as their putative targets…The jokes thus serve to center one in the world – to remind people of their place and to reassure them that they are in it.&quot;

=== Absurdities and gallows humour ===
A third category of joke cycles identifies absurd characters as the butt: for example the grape, the dead baby or the elephant. Beginning in the 1960s, social and cultural interpretations of these joke cycles, spearheaded by the folklorist Alan Dundes, began to appear in academic journals. Dead baby jokes are posited to reflect societal changes and guilt caused by widespread use of contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s. Elephant jokes have been interpreted variously as stand-ins for American blacks during the Civil Rights Era or as an &quot;image of something large and wild abroad in the land captur[ing] the sense of counterculture&quot; of the sixties. These interpretations strive for a cultural understanding of the themes of these jokes which go beyond the simple collection and documentation undertaken previously by folklorists and ethnologists.

== Classification systems ==
As folktales and other types of oral literature became collectables throughout Europe in the 19th century (Brothers Grimm et al.), folklorists and anthropologists of the time needed a system to organise these items. The Aarne–Thompson classification system was first published in 1910 by Antti Aarne, and later expanded by Stith Thompson to become the most renowned classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. Its final section addresses anecdotes and jokes, listing traditional humorous tales ordered by their protagonist; &quot;This section of the Index is essentially a classification of the older European jests, or merry tales – humorous stories characterized by short, fairly simple plots. …&quot; Due to its focus on older tale types and obsolete actors (e.g., numbskull), the Aarne–Thompson Index does not provide much help in identifying and classifying the modern joke.

A more granular classification system used widely by folklorists and cultural anthropologists is the Thompson Motif Index, which separates tales into their individual story elements. This system enables jokes to be classified according to individual motifs included in the narrative: actors, items and incidents. It does not provide a system to classify the text by more than one element at a time while at the same time making it theoretically possible to classify the same text under multiple motifs.

The Thompson Motif Index has spawned further specialised motif indices, each of which focuses on a single aspect of one subset of jokes. A sampling of just a few of these specialised indices have been listed under other motif indices. Here one can select an index for medieval Spanish folk narratives, another index for linguistic verbal jokes, and a third one for sexual humour. To assist the researcher with this increasingly confusing situation, there are also multiple bibliographies of indices as well as a how-to guide on creating your own index.

Several difficulties have been identified with these systems of identifying oral narratives according to either tale types or story elements. A first major problem is their hierarchical organisation; one element of the narrative is selected as the major element, while all other parts are arrayed subordinate to this. A second problem with these systems is that the listed motifs are not qualitatively equal; actors, items and incidents are all considered side-by-side. And because incidents will always have at least one actor and usually have an item, most narratives can be ordered under multiple headings. This leads to confusion about both where to order an item and where to find it. A third significant problem is that the &quot;excessive prudery&quot; common in the middle of the 20th century means that obscene, sexual and scatological elements were regularly ignored in many of the indices.

The folklorist Robert Georges has summed up the concerns with these existing classification systems: It has proven difficult to organise all different elements of a joke into a multi-dimensional classification system which could be of real value in the study and evaluation of this (primarily oral) complex narrative form.

The General Theory of Verbal Humour or GTVH, developed by the linguists Victor Raskin and Salvatore Attardo, attempts to do exactly this. This classification system was developed specifically for jokes and later expanded to include longer types of humorous narratives. Six different aspects of the narrative, labelled Knowledge Resources or KRs, can be evaluated largely independently of each other, and then combined into a concatenated classification label. These six KRs of the joke structure include:
# Script Opposition (SO) references the script opposition included in Raskin&#x27;s SSTH. This includes, among others, themes such as real (unreal), actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible).
# Logical Mechanism (LM) refers to the mechanism which connects the different scripts in the joke. These can range from a simple verbal technique like a pun to more complex LMs such as faulty logic or false analogies.
# Situation (SI) can include objects, activities, instruments, props needed to tell the story.
# Target (TA) identifies the actor(s) who become the &quot;butt&quot; of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes of ethnic groups, professions, etc.
# Narrative strategy (NS) addresses the narrative format of the joke, as either a simple narrative, a dialogue, or a riddle. It attempts to classify the different genres and subgenres of verbal humour. In a subsequent study Attardo expands the NS to include oral and printed humorous narratives of any length, not just jokes.
# Language (LA) &quot;…contains all the information necessary for the verbalization of a text. It is responsible for the exact wording …and for the placement of the functional elements.&quot;

As development of the GTVH progressed, a hierarchy of the KRs was established to partially restrict the options for lower-level KRs depending on the KRs defined above them. For example, a lightbulb joke (SI) will always be in the form of a riddle (NS). Outside of these restrictions, the KRs can create a multitude of combinations, enabling a researcher to select jokes for analysis which contain only one or two defined KRs. It also allows for an evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of jokes depending on the similarity of their labels. &quot;The GTVH presents itself as a mechanism … of generating [or describing] an infinite number of jokes by combining the various values that each parameter can take. … Descriptively, to analyze a joke in the GTVH consists of listing the values of the 6 KRs (with the caveat that TA and LM may be empty).&quot; This classification system provides a functional multi-dimensional label for any joke, and indeed any verbal humour.

== Joke and humour research ==
Many academic disciplines lay claim to the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately, there are enough jokes, good, bad and worse, to go around. The studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines bring to mind the tale of the blind men and an elephant where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety. This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself. It requires a &quot;multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry&quot; to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.

=== Psychology ===

Sigmund Freud was one of the first modern scholars to recognise jokes as an important object of investigation. In his 1905 study &quot;Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious&quot; Freud describes the social nature of humour and illustrates his text with many examples of contemporary Viennese jokes. His work is particularly noteworthy in this context because Freud distinguishes in his writings between jokes, humour and the comic. These are distinctions which become easily blurred in many subsequent studies where everything funny tends to be gathered under the umbrella term of &quot;humour&quot;, making for a much more diffuse discussion.

Since the publication of Freud&#x27;s study, psychologists have continued to explore humour and jokes in their quest to explain, predict and control an individual&#x27;s &quot;sense of humour&quot;. Why do people laugh? Why do people find something funny? Can jokes predict character, or vice versa, can character predict the jokes an individual laughs at? What is a &quot;sense of humour&quot;? A current review of the popular magazine &quot;Psychology Today&quot; lists over 200 articles discussing various aspects of humour; in psychological jargon, the subject area has become both an emotion to measure and a tool to use in diagnostics and treatment. A new psychological assessment tool, the Values in Action Inventory developed by the American psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman includes humour (and playfulness) as one of the core character strengths of an individual. As such, it could be a good predictor of life satisfaction. For psychologists, it would be useful to measure both how much of this strength an individual has and how it can be measurably increased.

A 2007 survey of existing tools to measure humour identified more than 60 psychological measurement instruments. These measurement tools use many different approaches to quantify humour along with its related states and traits. There are tools to measure an individual&#x27;s physical response by their smile; the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is one of several tools used to identify any one of multiple types of smiles. Or the laugh can be measured to calculate the funniness response of an individual; multiple types of laughter have been identified. It must be stressed here that both smiles and laughter are not always a response to something funny. In trying to develop a measurement tool, most systems use &quot;jokes and cartoons&quot; as their test materials. However, because no two tools use the same jokes, and across languages this would not be feasible, how does one determine that the assessment objects are comparable? Moving on, whom does one ask to rate the sense of humour of an individual? Does one ask the person themselves, an impartial observer, or their family, friends and colleagues? Furthermore, has the current mood of the test subjects been considered; someone with a recent death in the family might not be much prone to laughter. Given the plethora of variants revealed by even a superficial glance at the problem, it becomes evident that these paths of scientific inquiry are mined with problematic pitfalls and questionable solutions.

The psychologist has been very active in the research of humour. He has collaborated with the linguists Raskin and Attardo on their General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) classification system. Their goal is to empirically test both the six autonomous classification types (KRs) and the hierarchical ordering of these KRs. Advancement in this direction would be a win-win for both fields of study; linguistics would have empirical verification of this multi-dimensional classification system for jokes, and psychology would have a standardised joke classification with which they could develop verifiably comparable measurement tools.

=== Linguistics ===
&quot;The linguistics of humor has made gigantic strides forward in the last decade and a half and replaced the psychology of humor as the most advanced theoretical approach to the study of this important and universal human faculty.&quot; This recent statement by one noted linguist and humour researcher describes, from his perspective, contemporary linguistic humour research. Linguists study words, how words are strung together to build sentences, how sentences create meaning which can be communicated from one individual to another, and how our interaction with each other using words creates discourse. Jokes have been defined above as oral narratives in which words and sentences are engineered to build toward a punchline. The linguist&#x27;s question is: what exactly makes the punchline funny? This question focuses on how the words used in the punchline create humour, in contrast to the psychologist&#x27;s concern (see above) with the audience&#x27;s response to the punchline. The assessment of humour by psychologists &quot;is made from the individual&#x27;s perspective; e.g. the phenomenon associated with responding to or creating humor and not a description of humor itself.&quot; Linguistics, on the other hand, endeavours to provide a precise description of what makes a text funny.

Two major new linguistic theories have been developed and tested within the last decades. The first was advanced by Victor Raskin in &quot;Semantic Mechanisms of Humor&quot;, published 1985. While being a variant on the more general concepts of the incongruity theory of humour, it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. The Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour (SSTH) begins by identifying two linguistic conditions which make a text funny. It then goes on to identify the mechanisms involved in creating the punchline. This theory established the semantic/pragmatic foundation of humour as well as the humour competence of speakers.

Several years later the SSTH was incorporated into a more expansive theory of jokes put forth by Raskin and his colleague Salvatore Attardo. In the General Theory of Verbal Humour, the SSTH was relabelled as a Logical Mechanism (LM) (referring to the mechanism which connects the different linguistic scripts in the joke) and added to five other independent Knowledge Resources (KR). Together these six KRs could now function as a multi-dimensional descriptive label for any piece of humorous text.

Linguistics has developed further methodological tools which can be applied to jokes: discourse analysis and conversation analysis of joking. Both of these subspecialties within the field focus on &quot;naturally occurring&quot; language use, i.e. the analysis of real (usually recorded) conversations. One of these studies has already been discussed above, where Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in telling a single joke. Discourse analysis emphasises the entire context of social joking, the social interaction which cradles the words.

=== Folklore and anthropology ===
Folklore and cultural anthropology have perhaps the strongest claims on jokes as belonging to their bailiwick. Jokes remain one of the few remaining forms of traditional folk literature transmitted orally in western cultures. Identified as one of the &quot;simple forms&quot; of oral literature by André Jolles in 1930, they have been collected and studied since there were folklorists and anthropologists abroad in the lands. As a genre they were important enough at the beginning of the 20th century to be included under their own heading in the Aarne–Thompson index first published in 1910: Anecdotes and jokes.

Beginning in the 1960s, cultural researchers began to expand their role from collectors and archivists of &quot;folk ideas&quot; to a more active role of interpreters of cultural artefacts. One of the foremost scholars active during this transitional time was the folklorist Alan Dundes. He started asking questions of tradition and transmission with the key observation that &quot;No piece of folklore continues to be transmitted unless it means something, even if neither the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be.&quot; In the context of jokes, this then becomes the basis for further research. Why is the joke told right now? Only in this expanded perspective is an understanding of its meaning to the participants possible.

This questioning resulted in a blossoming of monographs to explore the significance of many joke cycles. What is so funny about absurd nonsense elephant jokes? Why make light of dead babies? In an article on contemporary German jokes about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Dundes justifies this research: A stimulating generation of new humour theories flourishes like mushrooms in the undergrowth: Elliott Oring&#x27;s theoretical discussions on &quot;appropriate ambiguity&quot; and Amy Carrell&#x27;s hypothesis of an &quot;audience-based theory of verbal humor (1993)&quot; to name just a few.

In his book &quot;Humor and Laughter: An Anthropological Approach&quot;, the anthropologist Mahadev Apte presents a solid case for his own academic perspective. &quot;Two axioms underlie my discussion, namely, that humor is by and large culture based and that humor can be a major conceptual and methodological tool for gaining insights into cultural systems.&quot; Apte goes on to call for legitimising the field of humour research as &quot;humorology&quot;; this would be a field of study incorporating an interdisciplinary character of humour studies.

While the label &quot;humorology&quot; has yet to become a household word, great strides are being made in the international recognition of this interdisciplinary field of research. The International Society for Humor Studies was founded in 1989 with the stated purpose to &quot;promote, stimulate and encourage the interdisciplinary study of humour; to support and cooperate with local, national, and international organizations having similar purposes; to organize and arrange meetings; and to issue and encourage publications concerning the purpose of the society&quot;. It also publishes &quot;&quot; and holds yearly conferences to promote and inform its speciality.

=== Physiology of laughter ===

In 1872, Charles Darwin published one of the first &quot;comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture&quot; (Laughter). In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrate the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of gelotology (from the Greek &quot;&quot;, meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of laughter and its effects on the body from both a psychological and physiological perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laughter, humour being just one of them. The other six causes of laughter listed are social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling. As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.

=== Computational humour ===
Computational humour is a new field of study which uses computers to model humour; it bridges the disciplines of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a joke. Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead, they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.

More sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the SSTH / GTVH humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a &quot;large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker&quot;. These scripts extend much further than the lexical definition of a word; they contain the speaker&#x27;s complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.

Further development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an ontological semantic natural language processing system. It is only &quot;the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well&quot;. Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway. As this field grows in both understanding and methodology, it provides an ideal testbed for humour theories; the rules must firstly be clearly defined in order to write a computer program around a theory.

<text>Jacob Armstead Lawrence (September 7, 1917 – June 9, 2000) was an American painter known for his portrayal of African-American historical subjects and contemporary life. Lawrence referred to his style as &quot;dynamic cubism&quot;, an art form popularized in Europe which drew great inspiration from West African and Meso-American art. For his compositions, Lawrence found inspiration in everyday life in Harlem. He brought the African-American experience to life using blacks and browns juxtaposed with vivid colors. He also taught and spent 16 years as a professor at the University of Washington.

Lawrence is among the best known twentieth-century African-American painters, known for his modernist illustrations of everyday life as well as narratives of African-American history and historical figures. At the age of 23 he gained national recognition with his 60-panel &quot;The Migration Series&quot;, which depicted the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. The series was purchased jointly by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Lawrence&#x27;s works are in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Reynolda House Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Northwest Art. His 1947 painting &quot;The Builders&quot; hangs in the White House.

== Biography ==
===Early years===

Jacob Lawrence was born September 7, 1917, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where his parents had migrated from the rural south. They divorced in 1924. His mother put him and his two younger siblings into foster care in Philadelphia. When he was 13, he and his siblings moved to New York City, where he reconnected with his mother in Harlem. Lawrence was introduced to art shortly after that when their mother enrolled him in after-school classes at an arts and crafts settlement house in Harlem, called Utopia Children&#x27;s Center, in an effort to keep him busy. The young Lawrence often drew patterns with crayons. In the beginning, he copied the patterns of his mother&#x27;s carpets.
After dropping out of school at 16, Lawrence worked in a laundromat and a printing plant. He continued with art, attending classes at the Harlem Art Workshop, taught by the noted African-American artist Charles Alston. Alston urged him to attend the Harlem Community Art Center, led by the sculptor Augusta Savage. Savage secured a scholarship to the American Artists School for Lawrence and a paid position with the Works Progress Administration, established during the Great Depression by the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lawrence continued his studies as well, working with Alston and Henry Bannarn, another Harlem Renaissance artist, in the Alston-Bannarn workshop. He also studied at Harlem Art Workshop in New York in 1937. Harlem provided crucial training for the majority of Black artists in the United States. Lawrence was one of the first artists trained in and by the African-American community in Harlem. Throughout his lengthy artistic career, Lawrence concentrated on exploring the history and struggles of African Americans.

The &quot;hard, bright, brittle&quot; aspects of Harlem during the Great Depression inspired Lawrence as much as the colors, shapes, and patterns inside the homes of its residents. &quot;Even in my mother&#x27;s home,&quot; Lawrence told historian Paul Karlstrom, &quot;people of my mother&#x27;s generation would decorate their homes in all sorts of color... so you&#x27;d think in terms of Matisse.&quot; He used water-based media throughout his career. Lawrence started to gain some notice for his dramatic and lively portrayals of both contemporary scenes of African-American urban life as well as historical events, all of which he depicted in crisp shapes, bright, clear colors, dynamic patterns, and through revealing posture and gestures.

=== Career ===

At the very start of his career he developed the approach that made his reputation and remained his touchstone: creating series of paintings that told a story or, less often, depicted many aspects of a subject. His first were biographical accounts of key figures of the African diaspora. He was just 21 years old when his series of 41 paintings of the Haitian general Toussaint L’Ouverture, who led the revolution of the slaves that eventually gained independence, was shown in an exhibit of African-American artists at the Baltimore Museum of Art. This was followed by a series of paintings of the lives of Harriet Tubman (1938–39) and Frederick Douglass (1939–40). His early work involved general depictions of everyday life in Harlem and also a major series dedicated to African-American history (1940–1941).

His teacher Charles Alston assesses Lawrence&#x27;s work in an essay for an exhibition at the Harlem YMCA 1938:
On July 24, 1941, Lawrence married the painter Gwendolyn Knight, also a student of Savage. She helped prepare the gesso panels for his paintings and contributed to the captions for the paintings in his multi-painting works.

==== &quot;The Migration Series&quot; ====
Lawrence completed the 60-panel set of narrative paintings entitled &quot;Migration of the Negro&quot; or &quot;And the Migrants Kept Coming&quot;, now called the &quot;Migration Series&quot;, in 1940–41. The series portrayed the Great Migration, when hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved from the rural South to the urban North after World War I. Because he was working in tempera, which dries rapidly, he planned all the paintings in advance and then applied a single color wherever he was using it across all the scenes to maintain tonal consistency. Only then did he proceed to the next color. The series was exhibited at the Downtown Gallery in Greenwich Village, which made him the first African-American artist represented by a New York gallery. This brought him national recognition. Selections from this series were featured in a 1941 issue of &quot;Fortune&quot;. The entire series was purchased jointly and divided by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which holds the odd-numbered paintings, and New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, which holds the even-numbered. 

Another biographical series of twenty-two panels devoted to the abolitionist John Brown followed in 1941–42. When these pairings became too fragile to display, Lawrence, working on commission, recreated the paintings as a portfolio of silkscreen prints in 1977.

In 1943, Howard Devree, wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that Lawrence in his next series of thirty images had &quot;even more successfully concentrated his attention on the many-sided life of his people in Harlem&quot;. He called the set &quot;an amazing social document&quot; and wrote:
==== World War II ====
In October 1943, during the Second World War, Lawrence was drafted into the United States Coast Guard and served as a public affairs specialist with the first racially integrated crew on the USCGC &quot;Sea Cloud&quot;, under Carlton Skinner. He continued to paint and sketch while in the Coast Guard, documenting the experience of war around the world. He produced 48 paintings during this time, all of which have been lost. He achieved the rank of petty officer third class.

====Lost works====
In October and November 1944, MoMA exhibited all 60 migration panels plus 8 of the paintings Lawrence created aboard the &quot;Sea Cloud&quot;. He posed, still in his uniform, in front of a sign that read: &quot;Jacob Lawrence, The Migration Series and Works Created in the US Coast Guard&quot;. The Coast Guard sent the eight paintings to exhibits around the United States. In the disorder and personnel changes that came with demobilization at the end of the war they went missing.

==== Post-war ====
In 1945, he was awarded a fellowship in the fine arts by the Guggenheim Foundation.
In 1946, Josef Albers recruited Lawrence to join the faculty of the summer art program at Black Mountain College.

Returning to New York, Lawrence continued to paint but grew depressed; in 1949, he checked himself into Hillside Hospital in Queens, where he remained for eleven months. Painting there, he produced his Hospital Series: works that were uncharacteristic of him in their focus of his subjects&#x27; emotional states as inpatients.

Between 1954 and 1956 Lawrence produced a 30-panel series called &quot;Struggle: From the History of the American People&quot; that depicted historical scenes from 1775 to 1817. The series, originally planned to include sixty panels, ranges from references to current events like the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings and relatively obscure or neglected aspects of American history, like a woman, Margaret Cochran Corbin, in combat or the wall built by unseen enslaved Blacks that protected the American forces at the Battle of New Orleans. Rather than traditional titles, Lawrence labeled each panel with a quote. He titled a panel depicting Patrick Henry&#x27;s famous speech with the less well-known passage: &quot;Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.&quot; A panel depicting an African American slave revolt is titled with the words of a man who sued for emancipation from slavery in 1773: &quot;We have no property! We have no wives! No children! We have no city! No country!&quot; The fraught politics of the mid-1950s prevented the series from finding a museum purchaser, and the panels had been sold to a private collector who re-sold them as individual works. Three panels (Panels 14, 20 and 29) are lost, and three others were only located in 2017, 2020, and 2021. 

The Brooklyn Museum of Art mounted a retrospective exhibition of Lawrence&#x27;s work in 1960. In 1969, he was among 200 Black artists in a premier show sponsored by the Philadelphia School District and the Pennsylvania Civic Center Museum. The show featured some of the top names in the country, including Ellen Powell Tiberino, Horace Pippin, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, Barbara Bullock, Jacob Lawrence, Benny Andrews, Roland Ayers, Romare Bearden, Avel de Knight, Barkley Hendricks, Paul Keene, Raymond Saunders, Louis B. Sloan, Ed Wilson, Henry Ossawa Tanner and Joshua Johnson.

==== Publications ====
Lawrence illustrated several works for children. &quot;Harriet and the Promised Land&quot; appeared in 1968 and used the series of paintings that told the story of Harriet Tubman. It was listed as one of the year&#x27;s best illustrated books by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and praised by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;The author&#x27;s artistic talents, sensitivity and insight into the black experience have resulted in a book that actually creates, within the reader, a spiritual experience.&quot; Two similar volumes based on his John Brown and Great Migration series followed. Lawrence created illustrations for a selection of 18 of Aesop&#x27;s Fables for Windmill Press in 1970, and the University of Washington Press published the full set of 23 tales in 1998.

==== Teaching and late works ====
Lawrence taught at several schools after his first stint teaching at Black Mountain College, including the New School for Social Research, the Art Students League, Pratt Institute, and the Skowhegan School. He became a visiting artist at the University of Washington in 1970 and was professor of art there from 1971 to 1986. He was graduate advisor there to lithographer and abstract painter James Claussen.

Shortly after moving to Washington state, Lawrence did a series of five paintings on the westward journey of African-American pioneer George Washington Bush. These paintings are now in the collection of the State of Washington History Museum.

He undertook several major commissions in this part of his career. In 1980, he completed &quot;Exploration&quot;, a 40-foot-long mural made of porcelain on steel, comprising a dozen panels devoted to academic endeavor. It was installed in Howard University&#x27;s Blackburn Center. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;enormously sophisticated yet wholly unpretentious &quot; and said:
Lawrence produced another series in 1983, eight screen prints called the &quot;Hiroshima Series&quot;. Commissioned to provide full-page illustrations for a new edition of a work of his choice, Lawrence chose John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (1946). He depicted in abstract visual language several survivors at the moment of the bombing in the midst of physical and emotional destruction.

Lawrence&#x27;s painting &quot;Theater&quot; was commissioned by the University of Washington in 1985 and installed in the main lobby of the Meany Hall for the Performing Arts.

In the early 1990s Lawrence was commissioned to paint the &quot;Events in the Life of Harold Washington&quot; mural in Chicago&#x27;s Harold Washington Library.

===Last years and death===
The Whitney Museum of American Art produced an exhibition of Lawrence&#x27;s entire career in 1974, as did the Seattle Art Museum in 1986.

In 1999, he and his wife established the Jacob and Gwendolyn Lawrence Foundation for the creation, presentation and study of American art, with a particular emphasis on work by African-American artists. It represents their estates and maintains a searchable archive of nearly a thousand images of their work.

Lawrence continued to paint until a few weeks before his death from lung cancer on June 9, 2000, at the age of 82.

== Legacy ==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of America&#x27;s leading modern figurative painters&quot; and &quot;among the most impassioned visual chroniclers of the African-American experience.&quot; Shortly before his death he stated: &quot;...for me, a painting should have three things: universality, clarity and strength. Clarity and strength so that it may be aesthetically good. Universality so that it may be understood by all men.&quot;

A retrospective exhibition of Lawrence&#x27;s work, planned before his death, opened at the Phillips Collection in May 2001 and travelled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Fine Arts, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. The exhibit was meant to coincide with the publication of &quot;Jacob Lawrence: Paintings, Drawings, and Murals (1935-1999), A Catalogue Raisonne&quot;. His last commissioned public work, the mosaic mural &quot;New York in Transit&quot; made of Murano glass was installed in October 2001 in the Times Square subway station in New York City.

In 2005, &quot;Dixie Café&quot;, a 1948 brush-and-ink drawing by Lawrence, was selected to suggest The Civil Rights Act of 1964 in a U.S. postage stamp panel commemorating milestones of the Civil Rights Movement. The stamp sheet was called &quot;To Form A More Perfect Union.&quot;

In May 2007, the White House Historical Association purchased Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Builders&quot; (1947) at auction for $2.5 million. The painting has hung in the White House Green Room since 2009.

The Seattle Art Museum offers the Gwendolyn Knight and Jacob Lawrence Fellowship, a $10,000 award to &quot;individuals whose original work reflects the Lawrences&#x27; concern with artistic excellence, education, mentorship and scholarship within the cultural contexts and value systems that informed their work and the work of other artists of color.&quot;
The Jacob Lawrence Gallery at the University of Washington School of Art + Art History + Design offers an annual Jacob Lawrence Legacy Residency.

His work is in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Phillips Collection, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery of Art and Reynolda House Museum of American Art, the Art Institute Chicago, the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Minnesota Museum of American Art, the Savannah College of Art and Design Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, the Birmingham Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Musei Vaticani, the Paul G.

<text>James Maitland Stewart (May 20, 1908 – July 2, 1997) was an American actor and military aviator. Known for his distinctive drawl and everyman screen persona, Stewart&#x27;s film career spanned 80 films from 1935 to 1991. With the strong morality he portrayed both on and off the screen, he epitomized the &quot;American ideal&quot; in the mid-twentieth century. In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked him third on its list of the greatest American male actors. He received numerous honors including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1980, the Kennedy Center Honor in 1983, as well as the Academy Honorary Award and Presidential Medal of Freedom, both in 1985.

Born and raised in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Stewart started acting while at Princeton University. After graduating, he began a career as a stage actor making his Broadway debut in the play &quot;Carry Nation&quot; (1932). He landed his first supporting role in &quot;The Murder Man&quot; (1935) and had his breakthrough in Frank Capra&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938). Stewart went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the George Cukor romantic comedy &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), &quot;Harvey&quot; (1950) and &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959).

Stewart played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in movies directed by Anthony Mann, including &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953), and by Alfred Hitchcock in &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956), and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958). Stewart also starred in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952), &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965) as well as the Western films &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962), and &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964).

With his private pilot&#x27;s skills, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II seeking combat duty and rose to be deputy commanding officer of the 2nd Bombardment Wing and commanding the 703d Bombardment Squadron from 1941 to 1947. He later transferred to the Air Force Reserve, and held various command positions until his retirement in 1968 as a brigadier general. Stewart remained unmarried until his 40s and was dubbed &quot;The Great American Bachelor&quot; by the press. In 1949, he married former model Gloria Hatrick McLean. They had twin daughters, and he adopted her two sons from her previous marriage. The marriage lasted until Gloria&#x27;s death in 1994. Stewart died of a pulmonary embolism three years later.

==Early life and education ==

James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, the eldest child and only son born to Elizabeth Ruth (née Jackson; 1875–1953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1872–1962). Stewart had two younger sisters, Mary (1912–1977) and Virginia (1914–1972). He was of Scottish and Ulster-Scots ancestry. The Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations. Stewart&#x27;s father ran the family business, the J. M. Stewart and Company Hardware Store, which he hoped Stewart would take over as an adult after attending Princeton University, as was the family tradition. Raised a Presbyterian by his deeply religious father, Stewart was a devout churchgoer for much of his life.

Stewart&#x27;s mother was a pianist, and music was an important part of family life. When a customer at the store was unable to pay his bill, Stewart&#x27;s father accepted an old accordion as payment. Stewart learned to play the instrument with the help of a local barber. His accordion became a fixture offstage during his acting career. A shy child, Stewart spent much of his time after school in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawings, and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. He attended the Wilson Model School for primary school and junior high school. He was not a gifted student and received average to low grades. According to his teachers, this was not from a lack of intelligence, but due to being creative and having a tendency to daydream.

Stewart began attending Mercersburg Academy prep school in the fall of 1923, because his father did not believe he would be accepted into Princeton (his father was a member of the class of 1898) if he attended public high school. At Mercersburg, Stewart participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. He was a member of the track team (competing as a high jumper under coach Jimmy Curran), the art editor of the school yearbook, a member of the glee club, and a member of the John Marshall Literary Society. To his disappointment, he was relegated to the third-tier football team due to his slender physique. Stewart also made his first onstage appearance at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play &quot;The Wolves&quot; in 1928. During summer breaks, he returned to Indiana, working first as a brick loader and then as a magician&#x27;s assistant. Due to scarlet fever that turned into a kidney infection, he had to take time out from school in 1927, which delayed his graduation until 1928. He remained passionate about aviation, with his interest enhanced by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s first solo transatlantic flight, but abandoned visions of becoming a pilot when his father steered him towards Princeton.

Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932, majoring in architecture and becoming a member of the Princeton Charter Club. He excelled academically but also became attracted to the school&#x27;s drama and music clubs, including the Princeton Triangle Club. Upon his graduation in 1932, he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies in architecture for his thesis on an airport terminal design, but chose instead to join University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company performing in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod.

==Career==
===1932–1937: Theater and early film roles===

Stewart performed in bit parts in the University Players&#x27; productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932. The company&#x27;s directors included Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, and Charles Leatherbee, and amongst its other actors were married couple Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan, who became Stewart&#x27;s close friends. At the end of the season, Stewart moved to New York with his Players friends Logan, Myron McCormick, and newly single Henry Fonda. Along with McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of &quot;Carry Nation&quot; and a few weeks later – again with McCormick – appeared as a chauffeur in the comedy &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;, in which he had a walk-on line. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented, &quot;Mr. James Stewart&#x27;s chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause.&quot; Following the seven-month run of &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;, Stewart took a stage manager position in Boston, but was fired after frequently missing his cues. Returning to New York, he then landed a small part in &quot;Spring in Autumn&quot; and a role in &quot;All Good Americans&quot;, where he was required to throw a banjo out of the window. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded.&quot; Both plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies.

Stewart was convinced to continue acting when he was cast in the lead role of &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;, playing a soldier who becomes the subject of a yellow fever experiment. It premiered at the Martin Beck Theater in March 1934. Stewart received unanimous praise from the critics, but the play proved unpopular with audiences and folded by June. During the summer, Stewart made his film debut with an unbilled appearance in the Shemp Howard comedy short &quot;Art Trouble&quot; (1934), filmed in Brooklyn, and acted in summer stock productions of &quot;We Die Exquisitely&quot; and &quot;All Paris Knows&quot; at the Red Barn Theater on Long Island. In the fall, he again received excellent reviews for his role in &quot;Divided by Three&quot; at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, which he followed with the modestly successful &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot; and the critical failure &quot;A Journey by Night&quot; in spring 1935.

Soon after &quot;A Journey by Night&quot; ended, Stewart signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), orchestrated by talent scout Bill Grady, who had been tracking Stewart&#x27;s career since seeing him perform in Princeton. His first Hollywood role was a minor appearance in the Spencer Tracy vehicle &quot;The Murder Man&quot; (1935). His performance was largely ignored by critics, although the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, remembering him in &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;, called him &quot;wasted in a bit that he handles with characteristically engaging skill&quot;. MGM did not see leading-man material in Stewart, described by biographer Michael D. Rinella as a &quot;lanky young bumpkin with a hesitant manner of speech&quot;. During this time, his agent Leland Hayward decided that the best path for him would be through loan-outs to other studios.

Stewart had only a small role in his second MGM film, the hit musical &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1936), but it led to his casting in seven other films within one year, including &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; and &quot;After the Thin Man&quot;. He also received crucial help from his University Players friend Margaret Sullavan, who campaigned for him to be her leading man in &quot;Next Time We Love&quot;, a Universal romantic comedy filmed right after &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. Sullavan rehearsed extensively with him, boosting his confidence and helping him incorporate his mannerisms and boyishness into his screen persona. &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; was a box-office success and received mostly positive reviews, leading Stewart to be noticed by critics and MGM executives. &quot;Time&quot; stated that &quot;the chief significance of [the film] in the progress of the cinema industry is likely to reside in the presence in its cast of James Stewart&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;a welcome addition to the roster of Hollywood&#x27;s leading men&quot;.

Stewart followed &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; with supporting roles in two commercially successful romantic comedies, &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936) with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy and &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1936). In both, he played the betrayed boyfriend of the leading lady, portrayed by Jean Harlow and Janet Gaynor, respectively. Both films garnered him some good reviews. After an appearance in the short subject &quot;Important News&quot; (1936), Stewart had his first top-billed role in the low-budget &quot;B&quot; movie &quot;Speed&quot; (1936), in which he played a mechanic and speed driver competing in the Indianapolis 500. The film was a critical and commercial failure, although Frank Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Mr. Stewart [and the rest of the cast] perform as pleasantly as possible.&quot;

Stewart&#x27;s last three film releases of 1936 were all box-office successes. He had only a bit part in &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot;, but a starring role in the musical &quot;Born to Dance&quot; with Eleanor Powell. His performance in the latter was not well-received: &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that his &quot;singing and dancing will (fortunately) never win him a song-and-dance-man classification&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;his singing and dancing [...] rather painful on their own&quot;, although it otherwise found Stewart aptly cast in an &quot;assignment [that] calls for a shy youth&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s last film to be released in 1936, &quot;After the Thin Man&quot;, features a shattering emotional climax rendered by Stewart. Kate Cameron of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that he &quot;has one grand scene in which he demonstrates most effectively that he is something more than a musical comedy juvenile&quot;.

For his next film, the romantic drama &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; (1937), Stewart was loaned to 20th Century-Fox to play a Parisian sewer worker in a remake of Frank Borzage&#x27;s silent classic released a decade earlier. He and co-star Simone Simon were miscast, and the film was a critical and commercial failure. William Boehnel of the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; called Stewart&#x27;s performance emotionless, and Eileen Creelman of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; wrote that he made little attempt to look or sound French. Stewart&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Last Gangster&quot; (1937) starring Edward G. Robinson, was also a failure, but it was followed by a critically acclaimed performance in &quot;Navy Blue and Gold&quot; (1937) as a football player at the United States Naval Academy. The film was a box-office success and earned Stewart the best reviews of his career up to that point. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;the ending leaves us with the conviction that James Stewart is a sincere and likable triple-threat man in the [MGM] backfield&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; called his performance &quot;fine&quot;.

=== 1938–1941: Leading man ===
Despite good reviews, Stewart was still a minor star, and MGM remained hesitant to cast him in leading roles, preferring to loan him out to other studios. After a well-received supporting part in &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot; (1938), he was loaned to RKO to act opposite Ginger Rogers in the romantic comedy &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot; (1938). The production was shut down for months in 1937 as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness, during which he was hospitalized. RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually the project was canceled. However, Rogers&#x27; success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again. Stewart was recast in &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot; at Rogers&#x27; insistence and due to his performance in &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot;. It was a critical and commercial success, and showed Stewart&#x27;s talent for performing in romantic comedies; &quot;The New York Herald&quot; called him &quot;one of the most knowing and engaging young actors appearing on the screen at present&quot;.

Stewart&#x27;s third film release of 1938, the First World War drama &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot;, saw him collaborate again with Margaret Sullavan. In his performance, Stewart drew upon his own feelings of unrequited love towards Sullavan, who was married to his agent, Leland Hayward. Although the film was otherwise well-received, critics were mixed about Stewart. Bland Johaneson of the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; compared him to Stan Laurel in this melodramatic film, and &quot;Variety&quot; called his performance unfocused.
Stewart became a major star when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to play the lead role in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938) opposite Jean Arthur. Stewart played the son of a banker who falls in love with a woman from a poor and eccentric family. Capra had recently completed several well-received films and was looking for a new type of leading man. He had been impressed by Stewart&#x27;s role in &quot;Navy Blue and Gold&quot; (1937). According to Capra, Stewart was one of the best actors ever to hit the screen, understood character archetypes intuitively, and required little directing. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film was also critically successful, but while &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the performances of Stewart and Arthur garnered &quot;much of the laughs&quot;, most of the critical acclaim went to Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold.

In contrast to the success of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot;, Stewart&#x27;s first three film releases of 1939 were all commercial disappointments. In the melodrama &quot;Made for Each Other&quot; (1939), he shared the screen with Carole Lombard. Stewart blamed its directing and screenwriting for its poor box-office performance. Regardless, the film received favorable reviews, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; writing that Stewart and Lombard were &quot;perfectly cast in the leading roles&quot;. The other two films, &quot;The Ice Follies of 1939&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot;, were critical failures.
In Stewart&#x27;s fourth 1939 film, he worked with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. Stewart played an idealist thrown into the political arena. It garnered critical praise and became the third-highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;The Nation&quot; stated &quot;[Stewart] takes first place among Hollywood actors...Now he is mature and gives a difficult part, with many nuances, moments of tragic-comic impact.&quot; Later, critic Andrew Sarris qualified Stewart&#x27;s performance as &quot;lean, gangling, idealistic to the point of being neurotic, thoughtful to the point of being tongue-tied&quot;, describing him as &quot;particularly gifted in expressing the emotional ambivalence of the action hero&quot;. Stewart won the New York Film Critics Circle award and received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Stewart&#x27;s last screen appearance of 1939 came in the Western &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, in which he portrayed a pacifist lawman alongside Marlene Dietrich, a saloon girl who falls in love with him. It was critically and commercially successful. &quot;TIME&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;James Stewart, who had just turned in the top performance of his cinematurity as Jefferson Smith in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, turns in as good a performance or better as Thomas Jefferson Destry.&quot; Between films, Stewart had begun a radio career and had become a distinctive voice on the &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.

Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films in 1940. The Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedy &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; starred them as co-workers who cannot stand each other but unknowingly become romantic pen-pals. It received good reviews and was a box-office success in Europe, but failed to find an audience in the US, where less-gentle screwball comedies were more popular. Director Lubitsch assessed it to be the best film of his career, and it has been regarded highly by later critics, such as Pauline Kael and Richard Schickel.

The drama &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot;, directed by Frank Borzage, featured Sullavan and Stewart as lovers caught in turmoil upon Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. It was one of the first blatantly anti-Nazi films to be produced in Hollywood, but according to film scholar Ben Urwand, &quot;ultimately made very little impact&quot; as it did not show the persecution experienced by Jews or name that ethnic group. Despite being well received by critics, it failed at the box office. Ten days after filming &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot;, Stewart began filming &quot;No Time for Comedy&quot; (1940) with Rosalind Russell. Critics complimented Stewart&#x27;s performance; Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Stewart &quot;the best thing in the show&quot;, yet the film was again not a box-office success.

Stewart&#x27;s final film to be released in 1940 was George Cukor&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, in which he played an intrusive, fast-talking reporter sent to cover the wedding of a socialite (Katharine Hepburn) with the help of her ex-husband (Cary Grant). The film became one of the largest box-office successes of the year and received widespread critical acclaim. &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; stated that &quot;Stewart...contributes most of the comedy to the show...In addition, he contributes some of the most irresistible romantic moments.&quot; His performance earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category for Best Actor, beating out Henry Fonda, for whom he had voted and with whom he had once roomed, both almost broke, in the early 1930s in New York. Stewart himself assessed his performance in &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; to be superior and believed the academy was recompensing for not giving him the award the year prior. Moreover, Stewart&#x27;s character was a supporting role, not the male lead. He gave the Oscar to his father, who displayed it at his hardware store alongside other family awards and military medals.

Stewart next appeared in two comedies—&quot;Come Live with Me&quot; (1941), which paired him with Hedy Lamarr, and &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot; (1941), featuring Paulette Goddard—that were both box-office failures. Stewart considered the latter to be the worst film of his career. His last film before military service was the musical &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; (1941), which co-starred Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner. It was a critical failure, but also one of the best box-office performers of the year.

===1941–1947: Military service===
Stewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the United States Army to fight in World War II. His family had deep military roots: both of his grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, and his father had served during both the Spanish–American War and World War I. After first being rejected for low weight in November 1940, he enlisted in February 1941. As an experienced pilot, he reported for induction as a private in the Air Corps on March 22, 1941. Soon to be 33 years old, he was over the age limit for Aviation Cadet training—the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers—and therefore applied for an Air Corps commission as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942.
After enlisting, Stewart made no new commercial films, although he remained under contract to MGM. His public appearances were limited to engagements for the Army Air Forces. The Air Corps scheduled him on network radio with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, and on the radio program &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot;, a celebration of the United States Bill of Rights, which was broadcast a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Stewart also appeared in a First Motion Picture Unit short film, &quot;Winning Your Wings&quot;, to help recruit airmen. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1942, it appeared in movie theaters nationwide beginning in late May 1942 and resulted in 150,000 new recruits.

Stewart was concerned that his celebrity status would relegate him to duties behind the lines. After spending over a year training pilots at Kirtland Army Airfield in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he appealed to his commander and in November 1943 was sent to England as part of the 703d Bomb Squadron to fly B-24 Liberators. He was based initially at RAF Tibenham, before moving to RAF Old Buckenham.

Stewart was promoted to major following a mission to Ludwigshafen, Germany, on January 7, 1944. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions as deputy commander of the 2nd Bombardment Wing, the French Croix de Guerre with palm, and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. Stewart was promoted to full colonel on March 29, 1945, becoming one of the few Americans to ever rise from private to colonel in only four years. At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was the presiding officer of the court martial of a pilot and navigator who accidentally bombed Zurich, Switzerland.

Stewart returned to the United States in early fall 1945. He continued to play a role in reserve of the Army Air Forces after the war and was also one of the 12 founders of the Air Force Association in October 1945. Stewart eventually transferred to the reserves of the United States Air Force after the Army Air Forces split from the Army in 1947. During active-duty periods, he served with the Strategic Air Command and completed transition training as a pilot on the B-47 and B-52.

Stewart was first nominated for promotion to brigadier general in February 1957; however, his promotion was initially opposed by Senator Margaret Chase Smith. At the time of the nomination, the &quot;Washington Daily News&quot; noted: &quot;He trains actively with the Reserve every year. He&#x27;s had 18 hours as first pilot of a B-52.&quot; On July 23, 1959, Stewart was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in American military history. During the Vietnam War, he flew as a non-duty observer in a B-52 on an Arc Light bombing mission in February 1966. He served for 27 years, officially retiring from the Air Force on May 31, 1968, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 60. Upon his retirement, he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. Stewart rarely spoke about his wartime service but did appear in an episode of the British television documentary series &quot;The World at War&quot; (1974), commenting on the disastrous 1943 mission against Schweinfurt, Germany.

=== 1946–1949: Early post-war films ===
After his experiences in the war, Stewart considered returning to Pennsylvania to run the family store. His former agent, Leland Hayward, had also left the talent business in 1944 after selling his roster of stars, including Stewart, to Music Corporation of America (MCA). Stewart decided not to renew his MGM contract and instead signed a deal with MCA. He later stated that he was given a new beginning by Frank Capra, who asked him to star in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), the first postwar film for both of them. Stewart played George Bailey, an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles. Driven to suicide on Christmas Eve, he is led to reassess his life by Clarence Odbody, an &quot;angel, second class&quot;, played by Henry Travers. During filming, Stewart experienced doubts about his abilities and continued to consider retiring from acting.

Although &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Stewart&#x27;s third Best Actor nomination, it received mixed reviews and was only a moderate success at the box office, failing to cover its production costs. Several critics found the movie too sentimental, although Bosley Crowther wrote that Stewart did a &quot;warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war&quot;, and President Harry S. Truman concluded that &quot;If [my wife] and I had a son we&#x27;d want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart [in this film].&quot; In the decades since its release, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; has grown to define Stewart&#x27;s film persona and is widely considered a Christmas classic, and according to the American Film Institute, is one of the 100 best American movies ever made. Andrew Sarris stated that Stewart&#x27;s performance was underappreciated by critics of the time, who could not see &quot;the force and fury&quot; of it, and considered his proposal scene with Donna Reed, &quot;one of the most sublimely histrionic expressions of passion&quot;. Stewart later named the film his personal favorite out of his filmography.

In the aftermath of &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&quot;, Capra&#x27;s production company went into bankruptcy, while Stewart continued to have doubts about his acting abilities. His generation of actors was fading, and a new wave of actors, including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean, would soon remake Hollywood. Stewart returned to making radio dramas in 1946; he continued this work between films until the mid-1950s. He also made a comeback on Broadway to star in Mary Coyle Chase&#x27;s &quot;Harvey&quot; in July 1947, replacing the original star Frank Fay for the duration of his vacation. The play had opened to nearly universal praise in 1944 and told the story of Elwood P. Dowd, a wealthy eccentric, whose best friend is an invisible man-sized rabbit and whose relatives are trying to get him committed to a mental asylum. Stewart gained a following in the unconventional play, and although Fay returned to the role in August, they decided that Stewart would take his place again the next summer. Stewart&#x27;s only film to be released in 1947 was the William A. Wellman comedy &quot;Magic Town&quot;, one of the first films about the new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received both commercially and critically.

Stewart appeared in four new film releases in 1948. &quot;Call Northside 777&quot; was a critically acclaimed film noir, while the musical comedy &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot;, in which Stewart and Henry Fonda played jazz musicians in an ensemble cast, was a critical and commercial failure. The comedy &quot;You Gotta Stay Happy&quot;, which paired Stewart with Joan Fontaine, was the most successful of his post-war films up to that point. &quot;Rope&quot;, in which Stewart played the idolized teacher of two young men who commit murder to show their supposed superiority, began his collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock. Shot in long &quot;real-time&quot; takes, Stewart felt pressure to be flawless in his performance; the added stress led to him sleeping very little and drinking more heavily. &quot;Rope&quot; received mixed reviews, and Andrew Sarris and Scott Eyman have later called him miscast in the role of a Nietzsche-loving philosophy professor. The film&#x27;s screenwriter Arthur Laurents also stated that &quot;the casting of [Stewart] was absolutely destructive. He&#x27;s not sexual as an actor.&quot;

Stewart found success again with &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; (1949), playing baseball champion Monty Stratton opposite June Allyson. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1949 and was well received by the critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;&quot;The Stratton Story&quot; was the best thing that has yet happened to Mr. Stewart in his post-war film career...he gives such a winning performance that it is almost impossible to imagine any one else playing the role.&quot; Stewart&#x27;s other 1949 release saw him reunited with Spencer Tracy in the World War II film &quot;Malaya&quot; (1949). It was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews.

=== 1950–1959: Collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann ===

In the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career renewal as the star of Westerns and collaborated on several films with director Anthony Mann. The first of these was the Universal production &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), which Stewart agreed to do in exchange for being cast in a screen adaptation of &quot;Harvey&quot;. It also marked a turning point in Hollywood, as Stewart&#x27;s agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an innovative deal with Universal, in which Stewart would receive no fee in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Stewart was also granted authority to collaborate with the studio on casting and hiring decisions. Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, significantly more than his usual fee, and other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying studio system.

Stewart chose Mann to direct, and the film gave him the idea of redefining his screen persona through the Western genre. In the film, Stewart is a tough, vengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle that is stolen and passes through many hands, until the showdown between him and his brother. &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; became a box-office success upon its summer release and earned Stewart rave reviews. He also starred in another successful Western that summer, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950), which featured him as an ex-soldier and Native American agent making peace with the Apache.

Stewart&#x27;s third film release of 1950 was the comedy &quot;The Jackpot&quot;; it received critical acclaim and was commercially successful, but was a minor film in his repertoire and has largely been forgotten by contemporary critics and fans. In December 1950, the screen adaptation of &quot;Harvey&quot; was released, directed by Henry Koster and with Stewart reprising his stage role. With critics comparing his performance with Fay&#x27;s, Stewart&#x27;s performance as well as the film itself received mixed reviews. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;so darling is the acting of James Stewart [...] and all the rest that a virtually brand-new experience is still in store for even those who saw the play&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; called him &quot;perfect&quot; in the role. John McCarten of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; stated that although he &quot;doesn&#x27;t bring his part to the battered authority of Frank Fay...he nevertheless succeeds in making plausible the notion that Harvey, the rabbit, would accept him as a pal.&quot; Stewart later stated that he was dissatisfied with his performance, stating, &quot;I played him a little too dreamily, a little too cute-cute.&quot; Despite the film&#x27;s poor box office performance, Stewart received his fourth Academy Award nomination as well as his first Golden Globe nomination. Similar to &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Harvey&quot; achieved popularity later, after frequent television showings.

Stewart appeared in only one film released in 1951, playing a scientist in Koster&#x27;s British production &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, which was one of the first airplane disaster films ever made. Filmed in England, it became a box office success in the United Kingdom, but failed to attract audiences in the United States. Stewart took a small supporting role as a troubled clown in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952), which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Critics were curious why Stewart had taken such a small, out-of-character role; he responded that he was inspired by Lon Chaney&#x27;s ability to disguise himself while letting his character emerge. In the same year, Stewart starred in a critically and commercially failed biopic, &quot;Carbine Williams&quot; (1952), and continued his collaboration with Mann in &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952), which was a commercial and critical success.Stewart followed &quot;Bend of the River&quot; with four more collaborations with Mann in the next two years. &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Far Country&quot; (1954) were successful with audiences and developed Stewart&#x27;s screen persona into a more mature, ambiguous, and edgier presence. The films featured him as troubled cowboys seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers, and outlaws; a man who knows violence first-hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the Westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. In addition, Stewart starred in the Western radio show &quot;The Six Shooter&quot; for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954. He and Mann also collaborated on films outside the Western genre such as &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), the latter a critically acclaimed biopic in which he starred opposite June Allyson. It earned Stewart a BAFTA nomination and continued his portrayals of &#x27;American heroes&#x27;.

Stewart&#x27;s second collaboration with Hitchcock, the thriller &quot;Rear Window&quot;, became the eighth highest-grossing film of 1954. Hitchcock and Stewart also formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film. Stewart portrayed a photographer, loosely based on Robert Capa, who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg and comes to believe that he has witnessed a murder. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart had to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart&#x27;s acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and repressed desires. Although most of the initial acclaim for &quot;Rear Window&quot; was directed towards Hitchcock, critic Vincent Canby later described Stewart&#x27;s performance in it as &quot;grand&quot; and stated that &quot;[his] longtime star status in Hollywood has always obscured recognition of his talent.&quot; 1954 was a landmark year in Stewart&#x27;s career in terms of audience success, and he topped &quot;Look&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the most-popular movie stars, displacing rival Western star John Wayne.

Stewart continued his successful box-office run with two collaborations with Mann in 1955. &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; paired him again with June Allyson in a Cold War. Stewart took a central role in its development, using his experiences from the air force. Despite criticism for the dry, mechanistic storyline, it became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1955. Stewart&#x27;s final collaboration with Mann in the Western genre, &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot;, one of the first Westerns to be shot in CinemaScope, was well received by the critics and audiences alike. Following his work with Mann, Stewart starred opposite Doris Day in Hitchcock&#x27;s remake of his earlier film &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956). The film was another success. Even though critics preferred the first version, Hitchcock himself considered his remake superior.

Stewart&#x27;s next film, Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957), saw him star as his young adulthood hero, Charles Lindbergh. It was a big-budget production with elaborate special effects for the flying sequences, but received only mixed reviews and did not earn back its production costs. Stewart ended the year with a starring role in the Western &quot;Night Passage&quot; (1957), which had originally been slated as his ninth collaboration with Mann. During the pre-production, a rift developed between Mann and writer Borden Chase over the script, which Mann considered weak. Mann decided to leave the film and never collaborated with Stewart again. James Neilson replaced Mann, and the film opened in 1957 to become a box-office flop. Soured by this failure, Stewart avoided the genre and would not make another Western for four years.

Stewart&#x27;s collaboration with Hitchcock ended the following year with &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), in which he starred as an acrophobic former policeman who becomes obsessed with a woman (Kim Novak) he is shadowing. Although &quot;Vertigo&quot; has later become considered one of Hitchcock&#x27;s key works and was ranked the greatest film ever made by the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll in 2012, it was met with unenthusiastic reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release. Regardless, several critics complimented Stewart for his performance, with Bosley Crowther noting, &quot;Mr. Stewart, as usual, manages to act awfully tense in a casual way.&quot;

Hitchcock blamed the film&#x27;s failure on Stewart being too old to convincingly be Novak&#x27;s love interest: he was fifty years old at the time and had begun wearing a silver hairpiece in his movies. Consequently, Hitchcock cast Cary Grant in his next film, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), a role Stewart wanted; Grant was four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger. Stewart&#x27;s second 1958 film release, the romantic comedy &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), also paired him with Kim Novak, with Stewart later echoing Hitchcock in saying that he was miscast as 25-year-old Novak&#x27;s romantic partner. The film and Stewart&#x27;s performance received poor reviews and resulted in a box office failure. However, according to film scholar David Bingham, by the early 1950s, &quot;Stewart&#x27;s personality was so credible and well-established&quot;, that his choice of role no longer affected his popularity.

Stewart ended the decade with Otto Preminger&#x27;s realistic courtroom drama &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959) and the crime film &quot;The FBI Story&quot; (1959). The former was a box office success despite its explicit dealing with subjects such as rape, and garnered good reviews. Stewart received critical acclaim for his role as a small-town lawyer involved in a difficult murder case; Bosley Crowther called it &quot;one of the finest performances of his career&quot;. Stewart won his first BAFTA, a Volpi Cup, a New York Film Critics Circle Award, and a Producers Guild of America Award, as well as earned his fifth and final Academy Award nomination for his performance. &quot;The FBI Story&quot;, in which Stewart portrayed a Depression-era FBI agent, was less well received by critics and was commercially unsuccessful. Despite its commercial failure, the film marked the close of the most commercially successful decade of Stewart&#x27;s career. According to Quigley&#x27;s annual poll, Stewart was one of the top money-making stars for ten years, appearing in the top ten in 1950, 1952–1959, and 1965. He topped the list in 1955.

=== 1960–1970: Westerns and later career ===

Stewart opened the new decade by starring in the war film &quot;The Mountain Road&quot; (1960). To his surprise, it was a box office failure, despite his claims that it was one of the best scripts he&#x27;d ever read. He began a new director collaboration with John Ford, making his debut in his films in the Western &quot;Two Rode Together&quot; (1961), which had thematic echoes of Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot;. The same year, he also narrated the film &quot;X-15&quot; for the USAF. Stewart was considered for the role of Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, but he turned it down, concerned that the story was too controversial.

Stewart and Ford&#x27;s next collaboration was &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962). A classic psychological Western, the picture was shot in black-and-white film noir style at Ford&#x27;s insistence, with Stewart as an East Coast attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (Lee Marvin) in a small frontier town. The complex film initially garnered mixed reviews but became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades. Stewart was billed above John Wayne in posters and the trailers, but Wayne received top billing in the film itself. Stewart, Wayne, and Ford also collaborated for a television play that same year, &quot;Flashing Spikes&quot; (1962), for ABC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, albeit featuring Wayne billed with a television pseudonym, &quot;Michael Morris&quot;, (also used for Wayne&#x27;s brief appearance in the John Ford-directed episode of the television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; titled &quot;The Colter Craven Story&quot;) for his lengthy cameo. Next, Stewart appeared as part of an all-star cast—including Henry Fonda and John Wayne—in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, a Western epic released in the United States in early 1963. The film went on to win three Academy Awards and reap massive box-office figures.

In 1962, Stewart signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. The first two of these films reunited him with director Henry Koster in the family-friendly comedies &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot; (1962) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara and &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1963), which were both box-office successes. The former received moderately positive reviews and won Stewart the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival; the latter was panned by the critics. Stewart then appeared in John Ford&#x27;s final Western, &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964), playing a white-suited Wyatt Earp in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie. The film failed domestically and was quickly forgotten.

In 1965, Stewart was given his first honorary award for his career, the Cecil B. DeMille Award. He appeared in three films that year. The Fox family-comedy &quot;Dear Brigitte&quot; (1965), which featured French actress Brigitte Bardot as the object of Stewart&#x27;s son&#x27;s infatuation, was a box-office failure. The Civil War film &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1965) was a commercial success with strong anti-war and humanitarian themes. &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965) continued Stewart&#x27;s series of aviation-themed films; it was well-received critically, but a box-office failure.

For the next few years, Stewart acted in a series of Westerns: &quot;The Rare Breed&quot; (1966) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara, &quot;Firecreek&quot; (1968) with Henry Fonda, &quot;Bandolero!&quot; (1968) with Dean Martin, and &quot;The Cheyenne Social Club&quot; (1970) with Henry Fonda again. In 1968, he received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Stewart returned on Broadway to reprise his role as Elwood P. Dowd in &quot;Harvey&quot; at the ANTA Theatre in February 1970; the revival ran until May. He won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance for it.

=== 1971–1997: Television and semi-retirement ===
In 1971, Stewart starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot;. He played a small-town college professor whose adult son moves back home with his family. Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and poor ratings. His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama &quot;Fools&#x27; Parade&quot;, was more positively received. Robert Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful&quot;. For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City in 1972.
Stewart returned to television in &quot;Harvey&quot; for NBC&#x27;s Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 1972 and then starred in the CBS mystery series &quot;Hawkins&quot; in 1973. Playing a small-town lawyer investigating mysterious cases—similar to his character in &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;—Stewart won a Golden Globe for his performance. Nevertheless, &quot;Hawkins&quot; failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with &quot;Shaft&quot;, which had a starkly conflicting demographic, and was canceled after one season. Stewart also periodically appeared on Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, &quot;Jimmy Stewart and His Poems&quot; (1989).

After performing again in &quot;Harvey&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London in 1975, Stewart returned to films with a major supporting role in John Wayne&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976), playing a doctor giving Wayne&#x27;s gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. By this time, Stewart had a hearing impairment, which affected his ability to hear his cues and led to him repeatedly flubbing his lines; his vanity would not allow him to admit this or to wear a hearing aid. Stewart was offered the role of Howard Beale in &quot;Network&quot; (1976) but refused it due to its explicit language. Instead, he appeared in supporting roles in the disaster film &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977) with Jack Lemmon, the remake of &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978) with Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe, and the family film &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot; (1978). Despite mixed reviews, &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; was a box-office success, but the two other films were commercial and critical failures. Harry Haun of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote in his review of &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; that it was &quot;really sad to see James Stewart struggle so earnestly with material that just isn&#x27;t there&quot;. Stewart made a memorable cameo appearance on the final episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in March 1978, surprising Burnett, a lifelong Stewart fan.

Stewart&#x27;s final live-action feature film was the critically panned Japanese film &quot;The Green Horizon&quot; (1980), directed by Susumu Hani. Stewart took the role because the film promoted wildlife conservation and allowed his family to travel with him to Kenya. In the 1980s, Stewart semi-retired from acting. He was offered the role of Norman Thayer in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981) but turned it down because he disliked the film&#x27;s father-daughter relationship; the role went instead to his friend, Henry Fonda. Stewart filmed two television movies in the 1980s: &quot;Mr. Krueger&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (1980), produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and &quot;Right of Way&quot; (1983), an HBO drama that co-starred Bette Davis. He also made an appearance in the historical miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; in 1986 and did voiceover work for commercials for Campbell&#x27;s Soups in the 1980s and 1990s. Stewart&#x27;s last film performance was voicing the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the animated movie &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot; (1991).

Stewart remained in the public eye due to his frequent visits to the White House during the Reagan administration. The re-release of Hitchcock films gained him renewed recognition, with &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; praised by film critics. Stewart also received several honorary film industry awards at the end of his career: an American Film Institute Award in 1980, a Silver Bear in 1982, Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, an Academy Honorary Award in 1985, and National Board of Review and Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x27;s Chaplin Award in 1990. The honorary Oscar was presented by former co-star Cary Grant &quot;for his 50 years of memorable performances, for his high ideals both on and off the screen, with respect and affection of his colleagues&quot;. In addition, Stewart received the highest civilian award in the US, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, &quot;for his contributions in the fields of the arts, entertainment and public service&quot;, in 1985.

=== Posthumous work ===
In December 2023, meditation app Calm announced that Stewart would be the latest narrator for its Sleep Story series, with an AI-generated voice of the actor reading an original story &quot;It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story&quot;. The project uses AI voice-cloning technology from Respeecher, and was conducted with the consent of Stewart&#x27;s family and his estate.

==Personal life==

===Romantic relationships===
As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart&#x27;s life.

They met while they were both performing for the University Players; he was smitten, and invited her on a date. Unfortunately for Stewart, she regarded him as a close friend and co-worker, so they never began a romantic relationship. Though Sullavan was always aware of his feelings, Stewart never directly revealed them. Sullavan loved Stewart, but not romantically. Rather, she felt protective and maternal towards him.

The director of &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot;, H. C. Potter, suggested they might have married had Stewart been more forthcoming with his feelings. Instead, Sullavan became his acting mentor in Hollywood. According to director Edward H. Griffith, she &quot;made [him] a star&quot; by co-starring with him in four films: &quot;Next Time You Love&quot; (1936), &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot; (1938), &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940).

Stewart did not marry until his forties, which attracted a significant amount of contemporary media attention; gossip columnist Hedda Hopper called him the &quot;Great American Bachelor&quot;. Regardless, he had several romantic relationships prior to marriage. After being introduced by Henry Fonda, Stewart and Ginger Rogers enjoyed a relationship in 1935, while Fonda was dating Rogers&#x27; good friend Lucille Ball.

During production of &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot; (1938), Stewart dated actress Norma Shearer for six weeks. Afterward, he dated Loretta Young, but she wanted to settle down and Stewart did not.

While filming &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939), Stewart had an affair with his co-star Marlene Dietrich, who was married at the time. Dietrich allegedly became pregnant, but it was quickly terminated. Stewart ended their relationship after the filming was completed. Hurt by Stewart&#x27;s rejection, she barely mentioned him in her memoir and waved him off as a one-time affair.

He dated Olivia de Havilland in the late 1930s and early 1940s and even proposed marriage to her, but she rejected the proposal, as she believed he was not ready to settle down. She ended the relationship shortly before he began his military service, as she had fallen in love with director John Huston.

===War career as pilot (1941–1946)===
A licensed civilian pilot, Stewart enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces early in 1941, undertaking military flight training and becoming a commissioned officer and USAAF pilot. In January 1944 in the rank of captain, he was assigned to the 453rd Bombardment Group, 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force operating out of East Anglia, England as a bomber pilot flying the B-24 Liberator. After seeing action in Europe during World War II, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service. He remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve after the end of World War II, which would become the Air Force Reserve when the U.S. Air Force became an independent service in 1947. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve in 1959. He retired from the service in 1968, at which time he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. President Reagan recounted at a White House briefing that he was corrected by Stewart himself after Reagan incorrectly announced he was a major general at a campaign event.

===Marriage and family===

In 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer Dinah Shore at the Hollywood Canteen, a club mainly for servicemen. They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in Las Vegas in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet. After the war, Stewart began a relationship with Myrna Dell while he was filming &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; (1949). Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true.
Stewart&#x27;s first interaction with his future wife, Gloria Hatrick McLean, was at Keenan Wynn&#x27;s Christmas party in 1947. He had crashed the party and became inebriated, leaving a poor impression of himself with Hatrick. A year later, Gary Cooper and his wife, Veronica, invited Hatrick and Stewart to a dinner party, and the two began dating. A former model, Hatrick was divorced with two children. Stewart and Hatrick were married at Brentwood Presbyterian Church on August 9, 1949, and remained married until her death from lung cancer in 1994.

The couple purchased a home in Beverly Hills in 1951, where they resided for the rest of their lives. They also owned the Winecup Gamble Ranch in Nevada from 1953 to 1957. Stewart adopted Gloria&#x27;s two sons, Ronald (1944–1969) and Michael (born 1946), and with Gloria he had twin daughters, Judy and Kelly, on May 7, 1951. Ronald was killed in action in Vietnam on June 8, 1969, at the age of 24, while serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

===Friendships, interests, and character===

Stewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself. He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people. Director John Ford said of Stewart, &quot;You don&#x27;t get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.&quot;

Stewart&#x27;s 50-year friendship with Henry Fonda began in Manhattan when Fonda invited Stewart to be his third roommate (in addition to Joshua Logan and Myron McCormick) in order to make the rent. When Stewart moved to Hollywood in 1935, he again shared an apartment with Fonda, and the two gained reputations as playboys. Over their careers, they starred in four films together: &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (1948), &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), &quot;Firecreek&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Cheyenne Social Club&quot; (1970). Both Stewart&#x27;s and Fonda&#x27;s children later noted that their fathers&#x27; favorite activity when not working seemed to be quietly sharing time together while building and painting model airplanes, a hobby they had taken up in New York years earlier. Besides building model airplanes, Stewart and Fonda liked to build and fly kites, play golf, and reminisce about the &quot;old days&quot;. After Fonda&#x27;s death in 1982, Stewart&#x27;s only public comment was &quot;I&#x27;ve just lost my best friend.&quot; Their friendship was chronicled in Scott Eyman&#x27;s biography, &quot;Hank and Jim&quot; (2017).

Aside from Fonda, Stewart&#x27;s close friends included his former agent, Leland Hayward; director John Ford; photographer John Swope, Stewart&#x27;s former roommate; and Billy Grady, the talent scout who discovered Stewart and also served as the best man at his wedding. Gary Cooper was another close friend of Stewart&#x27;s. On April 17, 1961, Cooper was too ill with cancer to attend the 33rd Academy Awards ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf.

In addition to his film career, Stewart had diversified investments, including real estate, oil wells, the charter-plane company Southwest Airways, and membership on major corporate boards; he became a multimillionaire. Already prior to his enlistment in the Air Corps, he had been an avid pilot, with a private pilot certificate and a commercial pilot license, as well as over 400 hours of flying time. A highly proficient pilot, he entered a cross-country race with Leland Hayward in 1937 and was one of the early investors in Thunderbird Field, a pilot-training school built and operated by Southwest Airways in Glendale, Arizona.

Stewart was also active in philanthropy over the years. He served as the national vice-chairman of entertainment for the American Red Cross&#x27;s fund-raising campaign for wounded soldiers in Vietnam, as well as contributed donations for improvements and restorations to Indiana, his hometown in Pennsylvania. His signature charity event, &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon Race&quot;, held annually since 1982, has raised millions of dollars for the Child and Family Development Center at St. John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

Stewart was a lifelong supporter of scouting, having been a Second Class Scout as a youth and being awarded the Silver Buffalo Award for service to youth in 1958. He was also an adult Scout leader, and in the 1970s and 1980s, he made advertisements for the Boy Scouts of America, which led to his being incorrectly identified as an Eagle Scout. An award for Boy Scouts, &quot;The James M. Stewart Good Citizenship Award&quot; has been presented since 2003. Stewart was also a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in California.

===Political views===
Stewart was a staunch conservative Republican throughout his life. A political argument in 1947 reportedly led to a fistfight with friend Henry Fonda (a liberal Democrat), according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, &quot;Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other. We just didn&#x27;t talk about certain things. I can&#x27;t remember ever having an argument with him⁠—ever!&quot;

In 1964, Stewart campaigned for the conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater and, according to biographer Marc Eliot, erred on the obsessive prior to the election. Stewart was a hawk on the Vietnam War and maintained that his son, Ronald, did not die in vain. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Stewart, Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas, and Gregory Peck issued a statement calling for support of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Gun Control Act of 1968.

Stewart actively supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976. He attended Reagan&#x27;s campaign rallies, in one speech assuring that he was more conservative than ever, regardless of the death of his son in the Vietnam War. In the last years of his life, he supported the re-election of Jesse Helms to the Senate in 1990 and also donated to the campaign of Bob Dole for the 1996 presidential election.

In 1988, Stewart made a plea in Congressional hearings, along with Burt Lancaster, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, film director Martin Scorsese, and many others, against Ted Turner&#x27;s decision to &#x27;colorize&#x27; classic black-and-white films, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. Stewart stated, &quot;the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It&#x27;s morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should leave our film industry alone.&quot;

In 1989, Stewart founded the American Spirit Foundation to apply entertainment-industry resources to developing innovative approaches to public education and to assist the emerging democracy movements in the former Iron Curtain countries.

==Final years and death==
Stewart&#x27;s wife Gloria died of lung cancer on February 16, 1994, aged 75. According to biographer Donald Dewey, her death left Stewart depressed and &quot;lost at sea&quot;. Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children. He shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans, but also his co-stars and friends. His friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said Stewart was not depressed or unhappy, but finally allowed to rest and be alone.

Stewart was hospitalized after falling in December 1995. In December 1996, he was due to have the battery in his pacemaker changed but opted not to have that done. In February 1997, he was hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat. On June 25, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism one week later. Stewart died of a heart attack caused by the embolism at the age of 89, surrounded by his children at his home in Beverly Hills, on July 2, 1997. President Bill Clinton commented that America had lost a &quot;national treasure ... a great actor, a gentleman and a patriot&quot;. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. More than 3,000 mourners attended his memorial service, including June Allyson, Carol Burnett, Bob Hope, Lew Wasserman, Nancy Reagan, Esther Williams, and Robert Stack. Brig. Gen. James Stewart was given a funeral with full military honors and a three-volley salute.

==Acting style and screen persona==
According to biographer Scott Eyman, Stewart was an instinctive actor. He was natural and at ease in front of the camera, despite his shy off-screen personality. In line with his natural and conversational acting style, Stewart&#x27;s co-stars found him easy to work with, as he was willing to improvise around any situation that arose while filming. Later in his career, Stewart began to resent his reputation of having a &quot;natural&quot; acting technique. He asserted that there was not anything natural about standing on a sound stage in front of lights and cameras while acting out a scene.

Stewart had established early in his career that he was proficient at communicating personality and character nuances through his performances alone. He used an &quot;inside-out&quot; acting technique, preferring to represent the character without accents, makeup, and props. Additionally, he tended to act with his body, not only with his voice and face; for example, in &quot;Harvey&quot;, Stewart portrays the main character&#x27;s age and loneliness by slightly hunching down. He was also known for his pauses that had the ability to hold the audience&#x27;s attention. Film critic Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien related that Stewart&#x27;s &quot;stammering pauses&quot; created anxious space for the audience, leaving them in anticipation for the scene which Stewart took his time leading up to.


Stewart himself claimed to dislike his earlier film performances, saying he was &quot;all hands and feet&quot;, adding that he &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to know what to do with either&quot;. He mentioned that even though he did not always like his performances, he would not get discouraged. He said, &quot;But I always tried, and if the script wasn&#x27;t too good, well, then, I just tried a little bit harder. I hope, though, not so hard that it shows.&quot; Former co-star Kim Novak stated of his acting style that for emotional scenes, he would access emotions deep inside of him and would take time to wind down after the scene ended. He could not turn it off immediately after the director yelled cut.

Stewart was particularly adept at performing vulnerable scenes with women. Jack Lemmon suggested that Stewart&#x27;s talent for performing with women was that he was able to allow the audience to see the respect and gentility he felt toward the women through his eyes. He showed that his characters needed them as much as their characters needed him. In connection to Stewart&#x27;s screen persona with women, Peter Bradshaw said &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; is &quot;a film every school pupil should see&quot; due to Stewart&#x27;s character&#x27;s clear explanation of sexual consent after being accused of taking advantage of the main female character.

Stewart&#x27;s screen persona was that of an &quot;everyman&quot;, an ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. Audiences could identify with him, in contrast to other Hollywood leading men of the time, such as Cary Grant, who represented what the audience wanted to become. Stewart&#x27;s screen persona has been compared to those of Gary Cooper and Tom Hanks. Eyman suggested that Stewart could portray several different characters: &quot;the brother, the sweetheart, [and] the nice guy next door with a bias toward doing the right thing: always decent but never a pushover&quot;. In Stewart&#x27;s early career, Louella Parsons described his &quot;boyish appeal&quot; and &quot;ability to win audience sympathy&quot; as the reasons for his success as an actor; Stewart&#x27;s performances appealed to both young and old audiences. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, Stewart&#x27;s essential persona was &quot;a small-town friendly neighbor, with a gentle face and voice and a slim body that is at once graceful and awkward&quot;. Unlike many actors who developed their on-screen persona over time, Stewart&#x27;s on-screen persona was recognizable as early as &quot;Art Trouble&quot; (1934), his uncredited debut film role, where Stewart was relaxed and comfortable on screen. He portrayed this persona most strongly in the 1940s, but maintained a classic everyman persona throughout his career.

Film scholar Dennis Bingham wrote that Stewart was &quot;both a &#x27;personality&#x27; star and a chameleon&quot; who evoked both masculine and feminine qualities. Consequently, it was difficult for filmmakers to sell Stewart as the stereotypical leading man, and thus he &quot;became a star in films that capitalized on his sexual ambivalence&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s asexual persona as a leading man was unusual for the time period for an actor who was not mainly a comedian. However, during his career &quot;Stewart [encompassed] the furthest extremes of American masculinity, from Reaganite militarist patriotism to Hitchcockian perversity&quot;.

According to Roger Ebert, Stewart&#x27;s pre–World War II characters were usually likable, but in postwar years directors chose to cast Stewart in darker roles, such as Jeffries in &quot;Rear Window&quot;. Ebert put this into contemporary perspective by asking, &quot;What would it feel like to see [Tom Hanks] in a bizarre and twisted light?&quot;, explaining that it is jarring to see a beloved everyman persona such as Stewart in dark roles. Furthermore, Jonathan Rosenbaum explained that since audiences were more interested in Stewart&#x27;s &quot;star persona&quot; and &quot;aura&quot; than his characters, &quot;this makes it more striking when Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock periodically explore the neurotic and obsessive aspects of Stewart&#x27;s persona to play against his all-American innocence and earnestness.&quot;

Film scholar John Belton argued that rather than playing characters in his films, Stewart often played his own screen persona. He had difficulty playing famous historical personages because his persona could not accommodate the historical character. Belton explained that &quot;James Stewart is more James Stewart than Glenn Miller in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954) or Charles Lindbergh in &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957).&quot; Moreover, Jonathan Rosenbaum continued that Stewart&#x27;s &quot;pre-existing life-size persona&quot; in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; &quot;helped to shape and determine the impact of [his character] in [this film]&quot;. On the other hand, Stewart has been described as a character actor who went through several distinct career phases. According to film scholar Amy Lawrence, the main elements of Stewart&#x27;s persona, &quot;a propensity for physical and spiritual suffering, lingering fears of inadequacy&quot;, were established by Frank Capra in the 1930s and were enhanced through his later work with Hitchcock and Mann. John Belton explained that &quot;James Stewart evolves from the naive, small-town, populist hero of Frank Capra&#x27;s 1930s comedies to the bitter, anxiety-ridden, vengeance-obsessed cowboy in Anthony Mann&#x27;s 1950s Westerns and the disturbed voyeur and sexual fetishist in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1950s suspense thrillers.&quot; During his postwar career, Stewart usually avoided appearing in comedies, &quot;Harvey&quot; and &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; being exceptions. He played many different types of characters, including manipulative, cynical, obsessive, or crazy characters. Stewart found that acting allowed him to express the fear and anxiety that he could not express during the war; his post-war performances were received well by audiences because they could still see the innocent, pre-war Stewart underneath his dark roles. According to Andrew Sarris, Stewart was &quot;the most complete actor-personality in the American cinema&quot;.

==Legacy==

Stewart is remembered for portraying idealist &quot;everyman&quot; characters in his films. His heroism on screen and devotion to his family made him relatable and representative of the American ideal, leading Stewart to be considered one of the best-loved figures in twentieth-century American popular culture. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, &quot;his ability to &#x27;play&#x27;—even symbolize—honesty and &#x27;American ideals&#x27; made him an icon into whose mold later male stars tried to pour themselves&quot;. Similarly, film scholar James Naremore has called Stewart &quot;the most successful actor of the &#x27;common man&#x27; in the history of movies&quot; and &quot;the most intensely-emotional leading man to emerge from the studio system&quot;, who could cry on screen without losing his masculinity. David Thomson has explained Stewart&#x27;s appeal by stating that &quot;we wanted to be him, and we wanted to be liked by him&quot;, while Roger Ebert has stated that &quot;whether he played everyman, or everyman&#x27;s hidden psyche, Stewart was an innately likable man whose face, loping gait and distinctive drawl became famous all over the world&quot;. Among Stewart&#x27;s most recognizable qualities was his manner of speaking with a hesitant drawl. According to film scholar Tim Palmer, &quot;Stewart&#x27;s legacy rests on his roles as the nervous idealist standing trial for, and gaining stature from, the sincerity of his beliefs, while his emotive convictions are put to the test.&quot; Film critic David Ansen wrote about Stewart&#x27;s appeal as a person in addition to his appeal as an actor. Ansen retold a story in which Jack Warner, upon being told about Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential ambitions, said, &quot;No. Jimmy Stewart for president, Ronald Reagan for best friend.&quot; Ansen further explained that Stewart was the ultimate trustworthy movie star.

In contrast to his popularly remembered &quot;all-American&quot; screen persona, film critics and scholars have tended to emphasize that his performances also showed a &quot;dark side&quot;. According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, &quot;the other Jimmy Stewart ... was a different type altogether, a repressed and neurotic man buried beneath an apparently calm facade, but ready at any moment to explode with vengeful anxiety and anger, or else with deeply twisted and constrained passions that could never match up with cheery personality of the alter ego.&quot; Bingham has described him as having &quot;two coequal personas; the earnest idealist, the nostalgic figure of the homespun boy next door; and the risk-taking actor who probably performed in films for more canonical auteurs than any other American star&quot;. According to him, it is this complexity and his ambiguous masculinity and sexuality with which he approached his roles that characterized his persona. Naremore has stated that there was a &quot;troubled, cranky, slightly-repressed feeling in [Stewart&#x27;s] behavior&quot;, and Thomson has written that it was his dark side that produced &quot;great cinema&quot;.

Stewart was one of the most sought-after actors in 1950s Hollywood, proving that independent actors could be successful in the film industry, which led more actors in Hollywood to forego studio contracts. According to Bingham, Stewart marked &quot;the transition between the studio period...and the era of free-lance actors, independent production, and powerful talent agents that made possible the &quot;new kind of star&quot; of the late 1960s&quot;. Although Stewart was not the first big-name freelance actor, his &quot;mythic sweetness and idealism [which] were combined with eccentric physical equipment and capacity as an actor to enact emotion, anxiety, and pain&quot; enabled him to succeed in both the studio system, which emphasized the star as a real person, and the skeptical post-studio era.

A number of Stewart&#x27;s films have become classics of American cinema, with twelve of his films having been inducted into the United States National Film Registry as of 2019, and five—&quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958)—being featured on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest American films of all time. Stewart and Robert De Niro share the title for the most films represented on the AFI list. Stewart is also the most represented leading actor on the &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list presented by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Two of his characters—Jefferson Smith in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939) and George Bailey in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946)—made AFI&#x27;s list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, and &quot;Harvey&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940) were included in their list of Greatest American Comedies. In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Stewart third on its list of the greatest American male actors.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1960, Stewart was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1700 Vine Street for his contributions to the film industry. In 1974, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Helen Hayes. In 1997, Princeton University, Stewart&#x27;s alma mater, honored him with the dedication of the James M. Stewart Theater along with a retrospective of his films. Stewart has also been honored with his own postal stamp as part of the &quot;Legends of Hollywood&quot; stamp series. In 1999, a bust of Stewart was unveiled at the Eighth Air Force Heritage Museum in Georgia. The L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library at Brigham Young University houses his personal papers and movie memorabilia including letters, scrapbooks, recordings of early radio programs, and two of his accordions. Stewart donated his papers and memorabilia to the library after becoming friends with the curator of its arts and communications collections, James D&#x27;Arc.


=== Memorials ===
Stewart has several memorials in his childhood hometown, Indiana, Pennsylvania. On May 20, 1995, his 87th birthday, The Jimmy Stewart Museum was established. The museum is located near his birthplace, his childhood home, and the former location of his father&#x27;s hardware store. The museum has six galleries that include photos, memorabilia, personal mementos, movie posters, props, scripts, costumes and much more. Stewart had contributed significant donations to his hometown, and had done it quietly as he didn&#x27;t want the publicity. A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse, and a plaque marks his birthplace. In 1983, Jimmy Stewart came back to Indiana to celebrate his 75th birthday and unveiled the statue along with getting a phone call from then President Ronald Reagan to congratulate him on his birthday. 2011, the United States Post Office located at 47 South 7th Street in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was designated the &quot;James M. &#x27;Jimmy&#x27; Stewart Post Office Building&quot;. Additionally, the Indiana County–Jimmy Stewart Airport was named in his honor. His personal Cessna-310 airplane is refurbished and on display outside the airport that bears his name. His childhood home is still standing and overlooks his beloved hometown.

<text>Jalalabad (; ) is the fifth-largest city of Afghanistan. It has a population of about 356,274, and serves as the capital of Nangarhar Province in the eastern part of the country, about from the capital Kabul. Jalalabad is located at the junction of the Kabul River and the Kunar River in a plateau to the south of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is linked by the Kabul-Jalalabad Road to the west and Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, to the east through Torkham and the Khyber Pass.

Jalalabad is a leading center of social and trade activity because of its proximity with the Torkham border checkpoint and border crossing, away. Major industries include papermaking, as well as agricultural products including oranges, lemon, rice, and sugarcane, helped by its warm climate. It hosts Afghanistan&#x27;s second largest educational institute, Nangarhar University. For centuries the city was favored by Afghan kings and it has a cultural significance in Afghan poetry. During Timur Shah&#x27;s reign of the Durrani Empire, Jalalabad served as the Afghan winter capital.

== History ==

===Ancient and medieval===
Known at the time by names such as Nagarhara and Adinapur, Jalalabad was a major center of Greco-Buddhist culture during the late 1st millennium BCE, focused on sites such as Ahin Posh.

The first surviving references to the city are in early 1st millennium CE accounts by visiting Chinese Buddhist monks. In or about 400 CE, Faxian visited &quot;Nagarhara&quot; and worshiped at sacred Buddhist sites, such as the &quot;Cave of the Buddha&#x27;s Shadow” (佛影窟). In 630 CE, Xuan Zang, visited &quot;Adinapur&quot; and other locations nearby.

The Buddhist era began to end after the region was conquered by Muslim forces during the late 1st Millennium. However, conversions to Islam evidently did not occur quickly. In &quot;Hudud-al-Alam&quot;, written in 982 CE, there is reference to a village near Jalalabad where the local king had Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu wives.


The region became part of the Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th century. Sabuktigin annexed the land all the way west of the Neelum River in Kashmir. &quot;The Afghans and Khiljies who resided among the mountains having taken the oath of allegiance to Sabuktigin, many of them were enlisted in his army, after which he returned in triumph to Ghazni.&quot; The Ghurids succeeded the Ghaznavids and expanded the Islamic empire further into Hindustan. The region around Jalalabad later became part of the Khalji territory, followed by that of the Timurids.

===Modern===
It is said that the original name of Jalalabad was Adinapur or Nagar(a)hara. Jalalabad was named in the last decade of the sixteenth century in honour of Mughal ruler Jalal-uddin Mohammad Akbar, the grandson of the founder of the Mughal Empire: Babur. Babur had chosen the site for this city which was built by his grandson in 1560.

It remained part of the Mughal Empire until around 1738 when Nader Shah and his Afsharid forces defeated the Mughals. Nader Shah&#x27;s forces were accompanied by the young Ahmad Shah Durrani and his 4,000-strong Afghan army from southern Afghanistan. In 1747, he founded the Durrani Empire (Afghan Empire) after re-conquering the area. The Afghan army has long used the city while going back and forth during their military campaigns into the Indian-subcontinent.

In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan subjugated Jalalabad in his campaign to Jalalabad.

The British-Indian forces invaded Jalalabad in 1838, during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In the 1842 Battle of Jellalabad, Akbar Khan besieged the British troops on their way to Jalalabad. In 1878, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again invaded and set up camps in Jalalabad but withdrew two years later.

Jalalabad is considered one of the most important cities of the Pashtun culture. Seraj-ul-Emarat, the residence of Amir Habibullah and King Amanullah was destroyed in 1929 when Habibullah Kalakani rose to power; the other sanctuaries however, retain vestiges of the past. The mausoleum of both rulers is enclosed by a garden facing Seraj-ul-Emart. The Sulemankhils, a Pashtun family famous for their scientific research, is from Jalalabad. Other celebrated Pashtun families originate from the villages near Jalalabad too.

In the 1960s and 1970s, construction started on a new planned city called Reg-e Shamshad Khan.

From 1978 to early 1990s, the city served as a strategic location for the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In March 1989, two Mujahideen rebel factions backed by Pakistan and the U.S. assaulted the city during the Battle of Jalalabad. However government forces managed to drive them out within two months, which was a major setback to the resistance fighters and the ISI. The city was heavily bombarded and hundreds of civilians were killed. Many buildings, such as schools, hospitals and public buildings were destroyed during the 2-month battle.

After the resignation of President Najibullah, Jalalabad quickly fell to mujahideen rebels of Yunus Khalis on April 19, 1992. On September 12, 1996, the Taliban took control of the city until they were toppled by the US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001. Al-Qaeda had been building terrorist training camps in Jalalabad. The city returned to Afghan government control under Hamid Karzai.

The economy of Jalalabad gradually increased in the last decade. Many of the city&#x27;s population began joining the Afghan National Security Forces. Construction has also increased. The Jalalabad Airport has long served as a military base for the NATO forces. In 2011, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul announced that it plans to establish a consulate in Jalalabad. In March 2007, US marines murdered 19 unarmed civilians and wounded 50 near Jalalabad, in an incident compared by the New York Times to the Haditha massacre. None of those responsible received any serious punishment. Many suicide attacks by jihadist insurgents have taken place, including in August 2013, April 2015, January 2018, July 2018, September 2018, October 2019 and August 2020. The groups responsible for the attacks include the Taliban, Haqqani Network, al-Qaeda, and ISIS (Daesh).

On August 15, 2021, the Taliban again took control of the city. Its capture cut off the last highway from Kabul to the outside world, and the city fell later the same day. Three days later on August 18, protestors took down the Afghan Taliban flag and replaced it with a tricolor flag of the previous Afghan government.

== Demographics ==

The city population is estimated to be 280,685 in year 2021. It has six districts and a total land area of . The total number of dwellings in this city is 39,586.

Nearly all residents of Jalalabad are Muslim, followers of Sunni Islam. Jalalabad is also a center of the country&#x27;s Sikhs, although the community has dwindled in the city (and nationwide) since the wars began. Similarly it is also has a Hindu minority.

=== Land use ===
Jalalabad is the regional hub in eastern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. Agriculture is the predominant land use at 44%, higher density of dwellings is found in Districts 1–5 and vacant plots are largely clustered in District 6. Districts 1–6 all have a grid network of roads.

== Climate ==
Jalalabad&#x27;s climate is hot desert (Köppen: BWh), and it is one of the hottest localities in Afghanistan. The city&#x27;s climate has close resemblance to that of Arizona in the United States. It receives six to eight inches (152 to 203 mm) of rainfall per annum which are limited to winter and the months of spring. Frosts are not common, and during the summer, the temperature can reach a maximum of 120 °F (49 °C).

The north and southwestern parts of the city which has lower elevation are welcoming places to winds from the north and west cooling the parts in summer months. Jalalabad has the highest relative humidity in summer compared to other Afghan cities. However the moderate temperatures of winter has led to various people down the history establishing their settlements in the city. Because of its warm temperature relative to most of Afghanistan, Jalalabad (alongside Peshawar) was often the &quot;winter capital&quot; of various Afghan rulers of the past centuries, while rich people would relocate to villas in Jalalabad to avoid the freezing temperatures in Kabul.

==Flora and fauna==
Jalalabad is home to a large number of fruits. Various types of citrus fruits like orange, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, lime grow in gardens as well as in orchards. The orange trees yield a crop only once in three years. The &quot;narindj&quot; variety of orange is the most common one which has yellow skin and its taste is a combination of orange and grapefruit. The grapefruits grown here have a diameter of eight or nine inches. Per year 1800 tonnes of pomegranates, 334 tonnes of grapes, and 7750 tonnes of mulberries are produced in Jalalabad. The fruits are either sold in local markets or transported to Kabul markets from where they are exported. The second most common crop is local &quot;vatani&quot; variety of sugarcane. It contains 15% sugar by weight. Jalalabad also has the largest date farm in Afghanistan.

== Transportation ==
The Jalalabad Airport (also known as Nangarhar Airport) is located roughly southeast from the city&#x27;s center. It is a domestic airport for civilian use. It serves the population of Nangarhar and neighboring provinces.

There are proposals for the establishment of Afghanistan&#x27;s rail network linking Jalalabad with Pakistan Railways, allowing for increased trade of goods, people and commerce between the two countries.

Jalalabad is connected by main roads with the Afghan capital of Kabul, the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and several nearby Afghan cities and towns. All trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan passes through this city. The highway between Jalalabad and Kabul was resurfaced in 2006, reducing the transit time between these two important cities. This highway is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world because of the large number of accidents. An improvement in the road networks between Jalalabad and Peshawar has also been proposed, with the intention of widening the existing road and improving security to attract more tourists and allow for safer passage of goods between to the two countries.

== General places of interest ==

The people of Jalalabad go there not only for sports purposes but also for enjoyment and relaxation. This is especially during holidays or when they receive visiting family or friends from another place. It is also a popular hangout for those with cars.

==Sports==
The province is represented in domestic cricket competitions by the Nangarhar province cricket team. National team member Hamid Hasan was born in the province and he currently represents Afghanistan in international cricket. The Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium is the first international standard cricket stadium in Afghanistan. It is located in the Ghazi Amanullah Town, a modern suburb on the southeastern fringe of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province. Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal. The project, which was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing the Ghazi Amanullah Town, cost up the first phase of construction $1.8 million. The first phase, which took one year to complete, included the completion of the stadium itself. The remainder of the phases will see the construction of a pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings. The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the national team and under-19 team left for Canada and the Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a Twenty20 match. It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, who currently have One Day International status until at least 2013.

<text>Jakarta (; , Betawi: &quot;Jakartè&quot;), officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (; &quot;DKI Jakarta&quot;) and formerly known as Batavia until 1949, is the capital city of Indonesia and an autonomous region at the provincial level. Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world&#x27;s most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. The Special Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by two other provinces: West Java to the south and east; and (since 2000, when it was separated from West Java) Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta&#x27;s metropolitan area is ASEAN&#x27;s second largest economy after Singapore. In 2023, the city&#x27;s GDP PPP was estimated at US$724.010 billion.

Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers , which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 32.6 million , making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index. Jakarta&#x27;s business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and the ASEAN secretariat&#x27;s seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city.

Jakarta&#x27;s main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding due to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is relative, not absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively safe. This has made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced plans to move the capital from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The MPR approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after announcing plans to move the country&#x27;s capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to build Nusantara, to save the city in the next decade.

==Name==
Jakarta has been home to multiple settlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:
* Buni people (400 BC–500 AD)
* Sundapura (358–669)
* Sunda Kelapa (669–1527)
* Jayakarta (1527–1619)
* Batavia (1619–1949)
* Djakarta (1942–1972)
* Jakarta (1972–present)

The Buni people is a prehistoric clay pottery culture that flourished in coastal northern West Java, Jakarta, and Banten around 400 BC to 100 AD and survived until 500 AD.

Sundapura is the name mentioned in the Tugu inscription from Tarumanagara, a kingdom in coastal West Java. The strategic geographical position of coastal West Java, which corresponds to today modern Jakarta, is a commanding region that controls the Sunda Strait. This location is strategic in regard to Sumatra and also its connection to Asian continent of India and China.

After fall of the Tarumanagara, the name of city was changed to &#x27;Sunda Kelapa&#x27; or &#x27;Coconut of Sunda,&#x27; growing to be the main harbour for the Sunda Kingdom due to its desirable location.

The name &#x27;Jakarta&#x27; is derived from the word &quot;Jayakarta&quot; (Devanagari: जयकर्त), which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit जय &quot;jaya&quot; (victorious), and कृत &quot;krta&quot; (accomplished, acquired), thus &quot;Jayakarta&quot; translates as &#x27;victorious deed&#x27;, &#x27;complete act&#x27;, or &#x27;complete victory&#x27;. It was named for the Muslim troops of Fatahillah which successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527, eventually renaming it &#x27;Jayakarta.&#x27; Tomé Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in his magnum opus as &quot;Jacatra&quot; or &quot;Jacarta&quot; during his journey to the East Indies.

After the Dutch East India Company took over the area in 1619, they renamed it to &#x27;Batavia,&#x27; after the Batavi, a Germanic tribe who were seen as the ancestors of the Dutch. The city was then also known as (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia&#x27;s canals, mansions and ordered city layout. After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.

During the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as . After the Japanese surrender, the name was changed to &#x27;Jakarta.&#x27;

==History==
===Precolonial era===
The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD. The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia. The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital. Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, &quot;Chu-fan-chi&quot;, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles. The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.

The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices. The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate from central Java. In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta, and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.

Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an English East India Company (EIC) voyage led by Sir James Lancaster arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten, where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682. Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.

===Colonial era===
When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city &quot;Batavia&quot; in 1619.

Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls. At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton, &quot;batik&quot; and clothing worn by Arab communities.
The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The &quot;Koningsplein&quot;, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913, and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area. By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants, including 37,067 Europeans. The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.

On 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.

===Independence===

After World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945, and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.

After securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950. With Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games, Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture. Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese. The event marked the beginning of Suharto&#x27;s New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor.
In 1966, Jakarta was declared a &#x27;special capital region&#x27; (), with a status equivalent to that of a province. Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country&#x27;s then 26 provinces. Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, and built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects — some for the benefit of the Suharto family,— and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty. Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta. The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring.

After three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots and violence in 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign. Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians. In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia. Jemaah Islamiyah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005, with another in 2009. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city&#x27;s legislative body.

During the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia&#x27;s capital to Nusantara after 17 August 2024, but this has not occurred due to delays.

Between 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of Islamic State.

==Geography==
Jakarta covers , the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers , which extends into the two bordering provinces of West Java and Banten. The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).
Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level, and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor&#x27;s Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is of land area and of sea area. The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from with an average elevation of above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area. Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.

Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about each year, and up to in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025. In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city. Nowadays, a , with capacity per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows. In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30 cm) annually.

Environmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government&#x27;s lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally. This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue. The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.

Jakarta, faces significant air pollution, particularly during the dry season from August to December. Dry air during this period allows pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended periods, contributing to poor air quality.

===Architecture===
Jakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese, and Dutch influences. External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (&quot;Artocarpus integrifolia&quot;) and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo. Additionally, the number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.

Colonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze&#x27;s works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Mandiri Museum. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city&#x27;s first attempt at creating ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows, and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate. These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by P.A.J. Moojen.

After independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia&#x27;s beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts. Built-in 1996, Wisma 46 soars to a height of and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.

The urban construction boom continued during the 21st century. The Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD&#x27;s in the Asia-Pacific region. According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed , which puts the city in the top 10 of world rankings. It has more buildings taller than 150 metres than any other Southeast Asian or Southern Hemisphere cities.

==Landmarks==
Most landmarks, monuments, and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during the Sukarno era, then completed in the Suharto era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta&#x27;s monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the National Monument, Istiqlal mosque, the Legislature Building, and the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.
The most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the obelisk of the National Monument ( or &quot;Monas&quot;) in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the &quot;Selamat Datang&quot; monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout.

==Climate==

Jakarta experiences a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;) as classified by the system. The city&#x27;s wet season spans most of the year, from October to May. The dry season lasts from June to September, with each of these months receiving less than of rainfall on average. Situated in the western part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and February, averaging per month, while the driest month is August, with an average rainfall of .

Every year faces recurring issues, such as floods and thunderstorms. A cyclonic vortex leads to moisture convergence over a large area, including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex causes a mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography in southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection that causes floods in Jakarta.

Average temperatures are very high with moderate rainfall. During the day, the temperature usually hovers around but drops to about in the evening. These are average temperatures, and some days can be hotter. It&#x27;s advisable to dress appropriately to handle the heat. January is the rainiest month, with over of precipitation, whereas August is the driest, with around of rainfall. The average temperature in the coldest month (February) is , and in the warmest month (October), it is . Sea temperatures range from in August to in March, April, November, and December. Record low temperatures in Jakarta recorded , while the highest record reached .

==Demographics==
Jakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city&#x27;s population was born in Jakarta. Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs. The Ministry of Home Affairs () tabulates its own data, which has improved since ID cards were required in the last decade, lists Jakarta&#x27;s population at 11,261,595 at yearend 2021.

Between 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980–1990, the city&#x27;s population grew annually by 3.7%. The 2010 census counted some 9.58 million people, well above government estimates. The population rose from 4.5 million in 1970 to 9.5 million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2 million in 1970 to 28.5 million in 2010. As of 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10 million, with a population density of 15,174 people/km2. In 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30 million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia&#x27;s overall population. It is predicted to reach 35.6 million people by 2030 to become the world&#x27;s biggest megacity. The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010, and 101.3 in 2014.

===Ethnicity===
Jakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group. As of 2010, 36.17% of the city&#x27;s population were Javanese, 28.29% Betawi (locally established mixed race, cemented by diverse creole), 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.06%.

The &#x27;Betawi&#x27; (, or &#x27;people of Batavia&#x27;) are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs. They are thus a Creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab, and European descent. Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta. It is thus a conundrum for some first generation Betawi people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either their parents&#x27; ethnicity or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.

A significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, PIK, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta&#x27;s Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5% of the population, which was thought of as under-reported; this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.

The Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000 Batak; 300,960 Minangkabau and 101,370 Malays lived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest subset in Jakarta. Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists. Minang merchants are found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.

===Language===
Indonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak Dutch or Chinese, depending on their upbringing. English is used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta. Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such as Betawi, Javanese, and Sundanese. The Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartan slang and are used by most people regardless of their ethnic background. It is now popular not only in Jakarta, but all over Indonesia.

The Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during the Soeharto New Order era; older people may be fluent in Hokkien dialect and Mandarin, meanwhile the younger generation are fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanisation of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such as Hakka, Teochew and Cantonese. Hokkien, which is mainly from Sumatra (Medan, Bagansiapiapi, Batam) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as in Pantai Indah Kapuk, Pluit, and Kelapa Gading, meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities in Pontianak and Singkawang, are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like in Tambora and Grogol Petamburan. The Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tend to speak their native languages, such as Batak Toba, Mandailing, and Karo, depending on which ancestral towns and places in North Sumatra they came from. The Minangkabau mainly speak Minangkabau together with Indonesian.

Jakarta is home to most of the Indonesian national newspapers, besides some local-based newspapers. The daily local newspapers in Jakarta are &quot;Pos Kota&quot; and &quot;Warta Kota&quot;. National newspapers based in Jakarta include &quot;Kompas&quot; and &quot;Media Indonesia&quot;, and most of them have a news segment covering the city. A number of business newspapers (&quot;Bisnis Indonesia&quot;, &quot;Investor Daily&quot; and &quot;Kontan&quot;) and a sports newspaper (&quot;Super Ball&quot;) are also published.

Newspapers other than in Indonesian, mainly for a national and global audience, are also published daily. Examples are the English-language newspapers &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot; and online-only &quot;The Jakarta Globe&quot;. Chinese language newspapers also circulate, such as &quot;Indonesia Shang Bao&quot; (印尼商报), &quot;Harian Indonesia&quot; (印尼星洲日报), and &quot;Guo Ji Ri Bao&quot; (国际日报). The only Japanese language newspaper is &quot;The Daily Jakarta Shimbun&quot; (じゃかるた新聞).

Around 75 radio stations broadcast in Jakarta, 52 on the FM band, and 23 on the AM band. Radio entities are based in Jakarta, for example, national radio networks MNC Trijaya FM, Prambors FM, Trax FM, I-Radio, Hard Rock FM, Delta FM, Global FM and the public radio RRI; as well as local stations Gen FM, Radio Elshinta and PM2FAS.

Jakarta is the headquarters for Indonesia&#x27;s public television TVRI as well as private national television networks, such as Metro TV, tvOne, Kompas TV, RCTI and NET. Jakarta has local television channels such as TVRI Jakarta, JakTV, Elshinta TV and KTV. Many TV stations are analogue PAL, but some are now converting to digital signals using DVB-T2 following a government plan to digital television migration.

==Government and politics==
Jakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a vice governor, while the Jakarta Regional People&#x27;s Representative Council (, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor and serves as the main administrative office.

Executive governance consists of five administrative cities (), each headed by a mayor (w&quot;alikota)&quot; and one administrative regency () headed by a regent (&quot;bupati&quot;). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta&#x27;s mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.

Aside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the national lower house parliament. The representatives are elected from Jakarta&#x27;s three national electoral districts, which also include overseas voters. It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the national upper house parliament.

The Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal of smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living, and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.

===Public safety===

The Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police () is the police force that is responsible for maintaining law, security, and order for the Jakarta metropolitan area. It is led by a two-star police general (Inspector General of Police) with the title of &quot;Greater Jakarta Regional Police Chief&quot; (, abbreviated ). Its office is located at Jl. Jenderal Sudirman Kav. 55, Senayan, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta, and their hotline emergency number is 110.

The Jayakarta Military Regional Command (, abbreviated ) is the territorial army of the Indonesian Army, which serves as a defence component for Jakarta and its surrounding areas (Greater Jakarta). It is led by an army Major General with the title of &quot;Jakarta Military Regional Commander&quot; (, abbreviated ). The Jakarta Military Command is located at East Jakarta and oversees several military battalions ready to defend the capital city and its vital installations. It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security during state visits, VVIP security, and riot control.

===Municipal finances===
The Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others. The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta&#x27;s many problems is constrained by limited finances.

The provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15 and 20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies. Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment. In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50 trillion ($US5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment, and social spending (such as health and housing). Jakarta&#x27;s regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1 trillion ($US5.92 billion), Rp 83.2 trillion ($US6.2 billion), and Rp 89 trillion ($US6.35 billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.

===Administrative divisions===

Jakarta consists of five &quot;Kota Administratif&quot; (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one &quot;Kabupaten Administratif&quot; (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:
* Central Jakarta () is Jakarta&#x27;s smallest city and administrative and political centre. It is divided into eight districts. It is charactesised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and museums.
* West Jakarta () has the city&#x27;s highest concentration of small-scale industries. It has eight districts. The area includes Jakarta&#x27;s Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town.
* South Jakarta (), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has ten districts and functions as Jakarta&#x27;s groundwater buffer, but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the central business district is concentrated all area in Kebayoran Baru, Setiabudi, a small part in Tebet, Pancoran, Mampang Prapatan, and bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta. The area is known as the Jakarta Golden Triangle.
* East Jakarta () territory is characterised by several industrial sectors. Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has ten districts.
* North Jakarta () is bounded by the Java Sea. It is the location of Port of Tanjung Priok. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town, which was the centre of VOC trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (), the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia. North Jakarta is divided into six districts.

The only administrative regency () of Jakarta is the Thousand Islands (), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.
The province comprises three of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Jakarta I Electoral District consists of the administrative city of East Jakarta, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Jakarta II Electoral District consists of the administrative cities of Central Jakarta and South Jskarta, together with all overseas voters, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Jakarta III Electoral District consists of the administrative cities of North Jakarta and West Jakarta, together with the Thousand Islands Regency, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Infrastructure==
To transform the city into a more liveable one, a ten-year &quot;urban regeneration&quot; project was undertaken, for Rp 571 trillion ($40.5 billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city&#x27;s clean water and wastewater systems, housing, and flood control systems.

===Transportation===

===Healthcare===
Jakarta has many of the country&#x27;s best-equipped private and public healthcare facilities. In 2012, the Governor of Jakarta Joko Widodo introduced a universal health care program, the &#x27;Healthy Jakarta Card&#x27; (&quot;Kartu Jakarta Sehat&quot;, KJS). In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care system called the &quot;Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional&quot; (JKN), which is run by BPJS Kesehatan. KJS integrated into JKN, and KJS cards were valid till 2018. As of 2021, 85.55% of the people of Jakarta is covered by JKN.

Government-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, as well as community hospitals and puskesmas. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, and Hermina operate in the city.

===Water supply===

Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty per cent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River, southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.

According to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession. According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterward. However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005, while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011. Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.

==International relations==
===International organisations===
Jakarta hosts foreign embassies. Jakarta also serves as the seat of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Headquarters and is ASEAN&#x27;s diplomatic capital.

Jakarta is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ASEAN Smart Cities Network.

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Jakarta signed sister city agreements with other cities, including Casablanca. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta&#x27;s Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named after Sukarno, Indonesia&#x27;s first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.

Jakarta&#x27;s sister cities are:

* Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei
* Bangkok, Thailand
* Beijing, China
* Berlin, Germany
* Casablanca, Morocco
* East Jerusalem, Palestine
* Hanoi, Vietnam
* Islamabad, Pakistan
* Istanbul, Turkey
* Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
* Kyiv, Ukraine
* Los Angeles, United States
* Manila, Philippines
* Maputo, Mozambique
* Moscow, Russia
* Mumbai, India
* New York, United States
* Pyongyang, North Korea
* Seoul, South Korea
* Shanghai, China
* Tokyo, Japan

===Cooperation and friendship===
Jakarta has established a partnership with Rotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange. This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.

In addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:
* Arkansas, United States
* Budapest, Hungary
* New South Wales, Australia
* Paris, France
* Rotterdam, Netherlands

<text>Jack Leon Ruby (born Jacob Leon Rubenstein; March 25, 1911January 3, 1967) was an American nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, two days after Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy. 

Born in Chicago, Ruby operated nightclubs in Texas. On November 24, 1963, two days after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Ruby shot and mortally wounded Oswald in Dallas Police Headquarters and was immediately arrested. The shooting happened on live television. Ruby was convicted and sentenced to death; this was overturned on appeal, and he was granted a new trial, but Ruby fell ill, was diagnosed with cancer, and died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967.

In 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald, that Ruby shot Oswald on impulse and in retaliation for the Kennedy assassination. The commission&#x27;s findings have been supported by some writers but also challenged by various critics who hypothesize that Ruby was part of a conspiracy surrounding the Kennedy assassination.

==Early life and career==
Ruby was born Jacob Leon Rubenstein on or around March 25, 1911, in the Maxwell Street area of Chicago, the son of Joseph Rubenstein and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born Orthodox Jews. Ruby was the fifth of his parents&#x27; 10 surviving children. While he was growing up, his parents were often violent towards each other and frequently separated; Ruby&#x27;s mother was eventually committed to a mental hospital. 

His troubled childhood and adolescence were marked by juvenile delinquency with time being spent in foster homes. He was arrested at the age of 11 for truancy. Ruby eventually skipped school so often that he had to spend time at the Institute for Juvenile Research. He sold horse-racing tip sheets and various novelties, then acted as a business agent for a local refuse collectors union that later became part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT).

From his early childhood, Ruby was nicknamed &quot;Sparky&quot; by those who knew him. His sister, Eva Grant, said that he acquired the nickname because he resembled a slow-moving horse named &quot;Spark Plug&quot; or &quot;Sparky&quot; in the contemporary comic strip &quot;Barney Google&quot;. (&quot;Spark Plug&quot; debuted as a character in the strip in 1922.) Other accounts say that the name was given because of his quick temper. Grant stated that Ruby did not like the nickname and was quick to fight anyone who called him that.

In the 1940s, Ruby frequented race tracks in Illinois and California. He was drafted in 1943 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases until 1946. He had an honorable record and was promoted to Private First Class. Upon discharge, in 1946, Ruby returned to Chicago.

In 1947, Ruby moved to Dallas, purportedly because of the failure of merchandise deals in Chicago and to help operate his sister&#x27;s nightclub. Soon afterward he and his brothers shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for the name change was that the name &quot;Rubenstein&quot; was too long and that he was &quot;well known&quot; as Jack Ruby. Ruby later went on to manage various nightclubs, strip clubs, and dance halls in Dallas. He developed close ties to many Dallas police officers who frequented his nightclubs, where he provided them with free liquor, prostitutes, and other favors.

Ruby never married and had no children. At the time of the assassination, Ruby was living with George Senator, who referred to Ruby as &quot;my boyfriend&quot; during the Warren Commission hearing, although he denied the two were homosexual lovers. Warren Commission lawyer, Burt Griffin, later told author Gerald Posner: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure if Senator was honest with us about his relationship with Ruby. People did not advertise their homosexuality in 1963&quot;.

== Illegal activities ==
Some critics have said that Ruby was involved in illegal activity such as gambling, narcotics, and prostitution. An FBI report in 1956 stated that informant Eileen Curry had moved to Dallas with her boyfriend James Breen after jumping bail on narcotics charges. Breen told her that he had made connections with a large narcotics setup operating between Texas, Mexico, and the East, and that &quot;James got the okay to operate through Ruby of Dallas.&quot; Dallas County Sheriff Steve Guthrie told the FBI that he believed that Ruby &quot;operated some prostitution activities and other vices out of his club&quot; in Dallas. Dallas disc jockey Kenneth Dowe testified that Ruby was known around the station for &quot;procuring women for different people who came to town&quot;.

From 1949, up until the murder of Oswald, Ruby had nine criminal charges, ranging from assault to violating state liquor law.

==Character==
According to people interviewed by law enforcement and the Warren Commission, Ruby was desperate to attract attention to himself and his club. He knew a great number of people in Dallas, but had only a few friends. Because his business ventures were unsuccessful, he was heavily in debt.

The commission received reports of Ruby&#x27;s penchant for violence. He had a volatile temper, and he often resorted to violence with employees who had upset him. He acted as the bouncer of his own club and beat his customers on at least 25 occasions. The fights would often end with Ruby throwing his victims down the club&#x27;s stairs. In one fight with a man, the man bit Ruby&#x27;s left index finger so badly that the doctors had it amputated.

Stories of Ruby&#x27;s eccentric and unstable behavior describe him as sometimes taking his shirt or other clothes off in social gatherings, and either hitting his chest like a gorilla or rolling around on the floor. During conversations, he could change the topic suddenly in mid-sentence. He sometimes welcomed a guest to his club, but on other nights he would forbid the same guest from entering. He was described by those who knew him as &quot;a kook&quot;, &quot;totally unpredictable&quot;, &quot;a psycho&quot;, and &quot;suffering from some form of disturbance&quot;.

During the 1970s, prominent psychiatrist Irene Jakab, who was known for her use of art therapy in diagnosing and treating patients with mental illness, analyzed artwork that had been created by Ruby while he was in jail. While assessing one of Ruby&#x27;s drawings, which had been included as part of art exhibits at the World Congress of Psychiatry meeting in Waikiki and the University of Hawaii in late August and early September 1977, she claimed that his work conveyed &quot;repressed aggression and secretiveness,&quot; adding:

Notice how he really constricts himself so as not to reveal himself. He hides behind all those geometrical lines and pointed edges. You can feel his controlled aggression.

==John F. Kennedy assassination==
===November 21===
The Warren Commission attempted to reconstruct Ruby&#x27;s movements from November 21, 1963, through November 24. The Commission reported that he was attending to his duties as the proprietor of the Carousel Club located at 1312 1/2 Commerce St. in downtown Dallas and the Vegas Club in the city&#x27;s Oak Lawn district from the afternoon of November 21 to the early hours of November 22. A number of Dallas police officers were meeting in the office of Assistant District Attorney Ben Ellis when Ruby entered and passed out business cards advertising a gig by Jada, a stripper at the Carousel. Reportedly, Ruby introduced himself to Ellis and added: &quot;You probably don&#x27;t know me now, but you will.&quot;

===November 22: assassination of Kennedy===
According to the Warren Commission, on November 22, Ruby was in the second-floor advertising offices of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, five blocks away from the Texas School Book Depository, placing weekly advertisements for his nightclubs, when he learned of the assassination around 12:45 p.m. According to witnesses, Ruby was visibly shaken. Ruby then made phone calls to his assistant at the Carousel Club and to his sister. The Commission stated that an employee of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; estimated that Ruby left the newspaper&#x27;s offices at 1:30 p.m., but indicated that other testimony suggested that he had left earlier. According to the Warren Commission, Ruby arrived back at the Carousel Club shortly before 1:45 p.m. to notify employees that the club would be closed that evening.

John Newnam, an employee at the newspaper&#x27;s advertisement department, testified that Ruby became upset over an anti-Kennedy ad published in the &quot;Morning News&quot; that was signed by &quot;The American Fact-Finding Committee, Bernard Weissman, Chairman.&quot; Ruby was sensitive to antisemitism and was distressed that an ad attacking the President was signed by a person with a &quot;Jewish name.&quot; Early the next morning, Ruby noticed a political billboard featuring the text &quot;IMPEACH EARL WARREN&quot; in block letters. Ruby&#x27;s sister Eva testified that Ruby had told her that he believed that the anti-Kennedy ad and the anti-Warren sign were connected and were a plot by a &quot;gentile&quot; to blame the assassination on the Jews.

Ruby was seen in the halls of the Dallas Police Headquarters on several occasions after Oswald&#x27;s arrest for the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit. He was present at an arranged press conference with Oswald. Ruby later told the FBI that he had his .38 Colt Cobra revolver in his right pocket during the press conference. Newsreel footage from WFAA-TV (Dallas) and NBC shows that Ruby impersonated a newspaper reporter during a press conference held by District Attorney Henry Wade at Dallas Police Headquarters that night. Wade briefed reporters that Oswald was a member of the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee. Ruby was one of several people there who spoke up to correct Wade, saying, &quot;Henry, that&#x27;s the Fair Play for Cuba Committee&quot;, a pro-Castro organization. 

===November 24: murder of Oswald===

On November 24, at 11:21 a.m. CST, Oswald was being escorted by Dallas police Detectives Jim Leavelle and L. C. Graves through the police basement to an armored car that was to take Oswald to the nearby county jail, when Ruby who was standing in a crowd of reporters, emerged with his revolver aimed at Oswald&#x27;s abdomen. Ruby passed by William Harrison who saw the gun and began to reach his hand out. Detective Billy Combest described Ruby&#x27;s facial expression as that of a &quot;determined look or grimace&quot;. Ruby shot Oswald at point blank range, mortally wounding him. Combest exclaimed, &quot;Jack, you son of a bitch!&quot; 

Immediately after the shot was fired, Graves grabbed for Ruby&#x27;s gun, and Harrison grabbed Ruby&#x27;s shoulder, as the armored car had rolled down the ramp at the moment Ruby emerged and slightly hit Ruby&#x27;s leg almost immediately after he fired, causing him to almost lose balance as he was immediately subdued by police. Ruby and Oswald were both taken into the basement level jail office. After Ruby was handcuffed and taken up in the elevator, Oswald was placed in an ambulance and driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where President Kennedy had died two days earlier. 

At Parkland, surgeons subsequently determined Ruby&#x27;s bullet had entered Oswald&#x27;s left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused extensive damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side. Oswald died at 1:07 pm.

====Reaction====
A network television pool camera was broadcasting live to cover Oswald&#x27;s transfer; millions of people watching on NBC saw the shooting as it happened and in a matter of minutes it was on other networks. Several photographs were taken of the event, capturing the moments when Ruby pulled the trigger. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image, titled &quot;Jack Ruby Shoots Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;.

Great indignation was directed towards Ruby&#x27;s murder of Oswald. Many felt that the killing had robbed the nation of essential information and left key questions unanswered. Former Vice President Richard Nixon said, &quot;(Oswald was) also entitled to a trial ... two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right.&quot; Oswald&#x27;s murder compounded suspicions that the Kennedy assassination was part of a larger plot.

Not all were shocked, however. The crowd outside the headquarters applauded when they heard that Oswald had been shot. In Dallas and elsewhere in the nation, Oswald was hated in death, and Ruby was viewed as a hero by some citizens. During his time in jail, he received many letters from the public, often praising him for his actions.

==Prosecution==
After his arrest, Ruby said that he had been distraught over President Kennedy&#x27;s death, had wanted to help the city of Dallas &quot;redeem&quot; itself in the eyes of the public, and that he was &quot;saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial.&quot; He also claimed that he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so. Ruby said that he was an admirer of President Kennedy and the Kennedy family, that he cried when he heard that the President was shot, &quot;in mourning&quot; after, &quot;cried a great deal&quot; Saturday afternoon, and was depressed that night. The grief over the assassination, Ruby stated, finally &quot;reached the point of insanity,&quot; suddenly compelling him to shoot when Oswald walked in front of him in the basement that Sunday morning. 

At the time of the shooting, Ruby said that he was taking phenmetrazine (Preludin), a central nervous system stimulant. Ruby also said that he entered the police basement by coming down the Main Street ramp. Later, Ruby expressed remorse to his brother Earl, saying he never wanted Oswald to die. Ruby asked Dallas attorney Tom Howard to represent him. Howard accepted and asked Ruby if he could think of anything that might damage his defense. Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of &quot;Davis&quot; should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he &quot;had been involved with Davis, who was a gunrunner entangled in anti-Castro efforts.&quot;

Ruby&#x27;s brother Earl replaced Howard with prominent San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli, who agreed to represent him &quot;pro bono&quot;. Lawyer Joe H. Tonahill also signed on to assist with Ruby&#x27;s defense. At his bond hearing in January 1964, while talking to reporters, Ruby tearfully said, regarding the assassination of Kennedy, that he could not understand &quot;how a great man like that could be lost.&quot; 

Ruby testified that he thought he said, &quot;You killed my President, you rat!&quot; as he shot Oswald. Officer McMillon testified he heard Ruby say, &quot;You rat son of a bitch, you shot the president&quot;. This was disputed by footage showing McMillon looking in the opposite direction from the shooting. Dallas police sergeant Patrick Dean testified that when Ruby was arrested, Ruby said he thought about killing Oswald two nights earlier, to show the world that &quot;Jews have guts.&quot; Detective Don Archer said Ruby had told him he intended to shoot Oswald three times, and McMillon corroborated this. 

On March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and was sentenced to death. Ruby&#x27;s conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that &quot;an oral confession of premeditation made while in police custody&quot; should have been ruled inadmissible, because it violated a Texas criminal statute. The court also ruled that the venue should have been changed to a Texas county other than the one in which the high-profile crime had been committed.

During the six months following the Kennedy assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked to speak to the members of the Warren Commission. The commission initially showed no interest, but Ruby&#x27;s sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission and her letters became public. The Commission finally agreed to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Representative (and future President) Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby.

Ruby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying that &quot;my life is in danger here&quot; and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. He added that the people from whom he felt himself to be in danger were the John Birch Society of Dallas, including Edwin Walker, who he claimed were trying to falsely implicate him as being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President. He added: &quot;I want to tell the truth, and I can&#x27;t tell it here.&quot; Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply with his request because many legal barriers would need to be overcome, and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him since it had no police powers. Ruby said that he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

Eventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby&#x27;s lawyers that he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a change of venue before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby&#x27;s conviction and death sentence were overturned. 

Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, but Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital on December 9, 1966, suffering from pneumonia, where he was diagnosed with cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain. His condition rapidly deteriorated. An armed guard was placed outside his room, but family and friends were allowed to visit. On December 16, Earl Ruby, accompanied by one of his brother&#x27;s lawyers, smuggled a tape recorder hidden in a briefcase into Jack&#x27;s room to record an interview about his murder of Oswald. Ruby maintained that he entered the basement by coming down the ramp, had killed Oswald out of grief over the assassination, and denied knowing Oswald prior. According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19 that he had acted alone. &quot;There is nothing to hide,&quot; Ruby said, &quot;there was no one else.&quot;

==Death==
Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967, at Parkland Hospital. He was buried beside his parents in the Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.

==Official investigations==
===Warren Commission===
The Warren Commission found no evidence linking Ruby&#x27;s killing of Oswald with any broader conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. The report provided a detailed biography of Ruby&#x27;s life and activities to help ascertain whether he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. The Commission also investigated rumors that Ruby and Oswald knew each other or that Oswald was seen at the Carousel Club. Footage that showed Oswald glance briefly in Ruby&#x27;s direction as he emerged to shoot him, thought by some to be a look of recognition, compounded such suspicion. Careful analysis of the footage indicate Oswald was looking at reporter Ike Pappas who had held his microphone out towards Oswald and asked, &quot;Do you have anything to say in your defense?&quot; They concluded that various witnesses lacked credibility and that there was no solid evidence linking the two men. The Commission indicated that there was not a &quot;significant link between Ruby and organized crime&quot; and said he acted independently in killing Oswald.

The Warren Commission noted testimony indicating Ruby entered the basement of the headquarters just as Oswald was being transferred and that his shooting of Oswald was a spontaneous, unplanned act. Ruby drove into town with his pet dachshund Sheba to send an emergency money order at the Western Union on Main Street to one of his employees. The time stamp was 11:17 a.m. for the transaction. Ruby then walked half a block to the Dallas police headquarters, where he made his way into the basement. Warren Commission investigator David Belin said that postal inspector Harry Holmes arrived unannounced at the Dallas police station on the morning that Ruby shot Oswald and, upon invitation by the investigators, had questioned Oswald, thus delaying his transfer by half an hour. Belin noted that, had Ruby been part of a conspiracy, he would have been downtown 30 minutes earlier, when Oswald had been scheduled to be transferred. The commission accepted Ruby&#x27;s claim that he entered the police basement via the Main Street ramp. Author Norman Mailer and others have questioned why Ruby would have left his beloved dog in his car if his killing of Oswald had been planned.

Some of Ruby&#x27;s friends, relatives (notably his brother Earl and sister Eva) and associates, supported the official conclusion that Ruby acted alone, maintaining that he was upset over President Kennedy&#x27;s death, even crying on occasions and closing his clubs for three days as a mark of respect. They rejected conspiracy theorists&#x27; claims, saying that Ruby&#x27;s connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort of person who would be entrusted to be part of a conspiracy.

Dallas reporter Tony Zoppi, who knew Ruby well, claimed that one &quot;would have to be crazy&quot; to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he &quot;couldn&#x27;t keep a secret for five minutes ... Jack was one of the most talkative guys you would ever meet. He&#x27;d be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much.&quot; He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at &quot;the center of attention&quot;, trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.

Some writers, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, dismiss Ruby&#x27;s connections to organized crime as being highly minimal: &quot;It is very noteworthy that without exception, not one of these conspiracy theorists knew or had ever met Jack Ruby. Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable.&quot;

Bill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald&#x27;s murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was involved with organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that &quot;A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy.&quot;

Ruby&#x27;s brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering at Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggested in his book &quot;Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK&quot;, that witnesses may have confused Ruby with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon. Zoppi was also dismissive of mob ties and described Ruby as a &quot;born loser&quot;.

==Other investigations and dissenting theories==
Many critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, particularly regarding Ruby&#x27;s role in Oswald’s death.
===Ruby&#x27;s motive===
White House correspondent Seth Kantor, who was a passenger in Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade, testified that he had visited Parkland Hospital after Kennedy was shot, and that he felt a tug on his coat as he entered the hospital at about 1:30 p.m. He turned around to see Jack Ruby, who called him by his first name and shook his hand. He said that he had become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy, and Kantor responded without thinking that doing so would be a good idea.

Although Wilma Tice testified that she saw Ruby at Parkland Hospital, claiming to have later recognized his picture and that she saw a man, who possibly may have been Kantor, call him &quot;Jack&quot;, Ruby denied that he had been at Parkland Hospital and the Warren Commission dismissed Kantor&#x27;s testimony, saying that the encounter at Parkland Hospital would have to have taken place in a span of a few minutes before and after 1:30 pm, as evidenced by telephone company records of calls made by both people. The commission also pointed to contradictory witness testimony and to the lack of video confirmation of Ruby at the scene. The Commission concluded that &quot;Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital&quot; and &quot;may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw Ruby.&quot; 

In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations re-examined Kantor&#x27;s testimony and stated, &quot;the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken&quot; about his Parkland encounter with Ruby, but &quot;the Committee determined he probably was not.&quot; Kantor wrote in &quot;Who Was Jack Ruby?&quot;:

The mob was Ruby&#x27;s &quot;friend.&quot; And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: &quot;I have been used for a purpose,&quot; the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session. It would not have been hard for the mob to maneuver Ruby through the ranks of a few negotiable police.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote in its 1979 Final Report:

Ruby&#x27;s shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation. Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby&#x27;s intentions... The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting... There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby&#x27;s entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.

The HSCA suggested Ruby might have entered the basement via a stairway accessible from an alleyway next to the Dallas Municipal Building.

Garrett C. Hallmark, manager of the parking garage, said that Ruby talked on the phone at 3 p.m. on November 23 to somebody called Ken. He was seeking confirmation of the scheduled time for Oswald&#x27;s transfer and he said &quot;You know I&#x27;ll be there.&quot; Later that evening, waitress Wanda Helmick at Bull-Pen Drive-In Restaurant in Arlington, Texas, which was operated by Ralph Paul, a close friend and business associate of Ruby, said that Ruby rang Paul and that she overheard that Paul said something about a gun, and he asked Ruby if he were crazy.

Lieutenant Billy Grammer, a dispatcher for the Dallas Police Department, claimed that he received an anonymous phone call at 3 a.m. on November 24 from a man who told him that he knew of the plan to move Oswald from the basement and warned that, unless the plan were changed, &quot;we are going to kill him.&quot; After Oswald was shot, Grammer claimed to have recognized Ruby as the caller, and expressed belief that Ruby&#x27;s shooting of Oswald was &quot;a planned event.&quot; In a declassified FBI memo written by J. Edgar Hoover from the day of Oswald&#x27;s shooting, he reported that the night before Oswald&#x27;s death, the FBI in Dallas received a call from &quot;a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald&quot;. The FBI called the chief of Dallas police both at that time and the morning after to ensure Oswald would be kept safe. Hoover adds that &quot;however, this was not done&quot;.

Some critics point to eyewitness testimony which seem to contradict the official claim that Ruby was at home until 10:30 a.m. on November 24 and instead seem to indicate that Ruby was around the police Headquarters asking about Oswald&#x27;s transfer all morning. Ruby&#x27;s roommate George Senator testified that on November 24, Ruby was in his apartment until about 10:30 a.m.. However, Elnora Pitts, Ruby&#x27;s cleaning lady, phoned between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. to check it was alright for her to do her usual Sunday morning cleaning for Ruby (which she had been doing for several weeks). The man who answered claimed to be Ruby but did not sound like him, did not recognise Pitts and had no knowledge of the Sunday cleaning arrangements she had with Ruby. Johnnie Smith, of WBAP-TV, was in a TV truck outside the headquarters that morning and he said that he saw a man twice between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.; the man came to the truck to enquire about Oswald&#x27;s transfer. Smith said that he recognized the man as Ruby from a picture in the paper, though he said he could not recognize him from a mugshot. WBAP cameraman Ira Walker testified that a man came up to his TV truck at just after 10:30 a.m. and enquired about Oswald&#x27;s transfer. He identified the man as Ruby as did Warren Richey who was on top of the truck with his camera.

In his Warren Commission testimony, Detective Don Archer claimed that, after his arrest, Ruby looked him straight in the eye and said, &quot;Well, I intended to shoot him three times.&quot; Kantor wrote that Ruby&#x27;s response to Archer did not suggest a spontaneous reaction, and that he implied having prior intention. On another occasion Archer also said that Ruby was agitated and sweating but when Archer informed Ruby that Oswald had died &quot;he became calm&quot; and that this struck him as &quot;a complete difference in behaviour from what I expected&quot;, leading him to believe that &quot;his life had depended on his getting Oswald&quot;.

Ruby&#x27;s explanation for killing Oswald would be exposed &quot;as a fabricated legal ploy&quot;, according to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Ruby wrote a note to attorney Joseph Tonahill: &quot;Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn&#x27;t have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?&quot;

G. Robert Blakey, who was chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: &quot;The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.&quot;

Russell Moore, an acquaintance of Ruby, testified to the Commission that Ruby expressed no bitterness towards Oswald and called him &quot;a good looking guy,&quot; comparing him to the actor Paul Newman. Announcer Glen Duncan also said Ruby described Oswald as a &quot;fairly nice looking kid&quot; comparing him to Newman.

Author David Scheim writes that while some described Ruby as upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he was not. TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at police headquarters on Friday night and said that he &quot;appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing.&quot; Duncan also said that Ruby &quot;was not grieving&quot; and seemed &quot;happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald.&quot;

Scheim also suggests that Ruby made a &quot;candid confession&quot; when giving testimony to the Warren Commission. During his testimony, Ruby teared up when talking about a Saturday morning eulogy for Kennedy, but after composing himself, inexplicably said, &quot;I must be a great actor, I tell you that.&quot; Ruby also remarked that &quot;they didn&#x27;t ask me another question: &#x27;If I loved the President so much, why wasn&#x27;t I at the parade? (referring to the presidential motorcade) and &quot;it&#x27;s strange that perhaps I didn&#x27;t vote for President Kennedy, or didn&#x27;t vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection for him.&quot;
Ruby&#x27;s club stripper Jada, during an interview with ABC&#x27;s Paul Good, said that &quot;I believe [Ruby] disliked Bobby Kennedy&quot;.

Schiem also noted some who knew Ruby who stated that the patriotic statements which Ruby professed were quite out of character. Ruby&#x27;s gambling business partner Harry Hall said &quot;Ruby was the type who was interested in any way to make money,&quot; and he also said that he &quot;could not conceive of Ruby doing anything out of patriotism.&quot; Jack Kelly had known Ruby since 1943, and he &quot;scoffed at the idea of a patriotic motive...&quot; and felt that Ruby would have killed Oswald &quot;for publicity [or] for money&quot;. Ruby&#x27;s friend Paul Jones also said that he doubted that Ruby &quot;would have become emotionally upset and killed Oswald on the spur of the moment. He felt Ruby would have done it for money.&quot;

Ruby&#x27;s lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals after his 1964 conviction, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby&#x27;s lawyers argued that he could not have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. In an interview with reporters in March 1965, Ruby stated: &quot;Everything pertaining to what&#x27;s happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motive. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I&#x27;m in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world.&quot; A reporter asked, &quot;Are these people in very high positions, Jack?&quot;, and he responded, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Kantor speculated in 1978 that the &quot;Davis&quot; that Ruby mentioned to Tom Howard may have been Thomas Eli Davis III, a CIA-connected mercenary.

Dallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: &quot;Ruby told me, he said, &#x27;Well, they injected me for a cold.&#x27; He said it was cancer cells. That&#x27;s what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don&#x27;t believe that bullshit. He said, &#x27;I damn sure do!&#x27; One day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm.&quot; It was a note in which Ruby claimed that he was part of a conspiracy, and that his role was to silence Oswald. Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was &quot;an act of overthrowing the government&quot; and that he knew &quot;who had President Kennedy killed&quot;. He added: &quot;I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. I was framed to kill Oswald.&quot;

On March 11, 1959, FBI agent Charles W. Flynn of the Dallas Office approached Ruby to become a federal informant due to his job as a night club operator, since he &quot;might have knowledge of the criminal element in Dallas&quot;. Ruby was willing to become an informant and was contacted by the FBI eight times between March 11, 1959, and October 2, 1959, but he provided no information to the Bureau; he was not paid, and contact ceased.

Scheim theorised that Mafia leaders Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante Jr. and organized labor leader Jimmy Hoffa ordered the assassination of Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination. According to author Vincent Bugliosi, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations determined that all of these calls were related to Ruby seeking help from the American Guild of Variety Artists in a matter concerning two of his competitors. The House Select Committee on Assassinations report stated that &quot;most of Ruby&#x27;s phone calls during late 1963 were related to his labor troubles. In the light of the identity of some of the individuals with whom Ruby spoke, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed.&quot;

Bill Bonanno, son of New York Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, stated in &quot;Bound By Honor&quot; that he realized that certain Mafia families were involved in the JFK assassination when Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.

===Associations with organized crime and gunrunning allegations===
Some conspiracy theorists have suggested Ruby had links to organized crime. The House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook a similar investigation of Ruby in 1979, 15 years after the written report, and said that he &quot;had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures&quot; and &quot;the Dallas criminal element,&quot; but that he was not a member of organized crime. In a memo dated to the day of Oswald&#x27;s murder J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, wrote that &quot;We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago&quot;.

Ruby was said to have been acquainted with the Mafia. The HSCA said that Ruby had known Chicago mobster Sam Giancana and Joseph Campisi since 1947 and had been seen with them on many occasions. After an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found:

While Campisi&#x27;s technical characterization in federal law enforcement records as an organized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, it is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based organized crime members, particularly Joseph Civello, during the time he was the head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities.

G. Robert Blakey, the chief counsel for the HSCA, called Campisi &quot;the No. 2 man in the mob in Dallas.&quot; He wrote in a 1993 article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;It is difficult to dispute the underworld pedigree of Jack Ruby, though the Warren Commission did it in 1964. Similarly, a PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following:

In 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.

On the night before Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby and Ralph Paul had dinner together at the Egyptian Lounge run by Joe and Sam Campisi. After Ruby was jailed for killing Oswald, Joe Campisi &quot;regularly visited&quot; him.

Howard P. Willens was the third-highest official in the Department of Justice and assistant counsel to J. Lee Rankin. He helped organize the Warren Commission. Willens also outlined the commission&#x27;s investigative priorities and terminated an investigation of Ruby&#x27;s Cuban related activities. An FBI report states that Willens&#x27; father had been Tony Accardo&#x27;s next-door neighbor going back to 1958. In 1946, Tony Accardo allegedly asked Jack Ruby to go to Texas with Mafia associates Pat Manno and Romie Nappi to make sure that Dallas County Sheriff Steve Gutherie would acquiesce to the Mafia&#x27;s expansion into Dallas.

Ruby went to see a man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba four years before the assassination. McWillie had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, and Ruby considered him one of his closest friends. McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana&#x27;s Tropicana Club when Ruby visited him in August 1959. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The HSCA later concluded that Ruby &quot;most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests&quot;. The committee also found circumstantial but not conclusive evidence that &quot;Ruby met with Santo Trafficante Jr. in Cuba sometime in 1959.&quot;

James E. Beaird, who claimed to be a poker-playing friend of Ruby, told &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; and the FBI that Ruby smuggled guns and ammunition from Galveston Bay, Texas to Fidel Castro&#x27;s guerrillas in Cuba in the late 1950s. Beaird said that Ruby &quot;was in it for the money. It wouldn&#x27;t matter which side, just the one that would pay him the most.&quot; Beaird said that the guns were stored in a two-story house near the waterfront, and that he saw Ruby and his associates load &quot;many boxes of new guns, including automatic rifles and handguns&quot; on a 50-foot military-surplus boat. He claimed that &quot;each time that the boat left with guns and ammunition, Jack Ruby was on the boat.&quot;

Alternatively, some conspiracy theorists have focused on Ruby&#x27;s connections to the police in regards to his murder of Oswald, and dismiss his mob connections as a misdirection.

<doc id="16278" wikidata="Q294918" url="?curid=16278" title="James Randi">
<text>James Randi (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge; August 7, 1928 – October 20, 2020) was a Canadian-American stage magician, author, and scientific skeptic who extensively challenged paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. He was the co-founder of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). Randi began his career as a magician under the stage name The Amazing Randi and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims. Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from his foundation at 87.

Although often referred to as a &quot;debunker&quot;, Randi said he disliked the term&#x27;s connotations and preferred to describe himself as an &quot;investigator&quot;. He wrote about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, famously exposing fraudulent faith healer Peter Popoff, and was occasionally featured on the television program &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;

Before Randi&#x27;s retirement, JREF sponsored the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offered a prize of $1 million to applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties.

==Early life==
Randi was born on August 7, 1928, in Toronto, Canada. He was the son of Marie Alice (; 1906–1987) and George Randall Zwinge (1903–1967), an executive at Bell Telephone Company. He was of French, Danish and Austrian descent. He had a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors, who expected he would never walk again. He often skipped classes, and at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow. He practiced as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto&#x27;s Canadian National Exhibition and wrote for Montreal&#x27;s tabloid press. As a teenager, he stumbled upon a church where the pastor claimed to read minds. When Randi interrupted the performance and showed the parishioners how the trick worked, the pastor&#x27;s wife called the police and Randi spent four hours in a jail cell. This inspired his career as a scientific skeptic.

In his 20s, Randi posed as an astrologer, and to establish that they merely were doing simple tricks, he briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid &quot;Midnight&quot; under the name &quot;Zo-ran&quot; by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column. In his 30s, Randi worked in the UK, Europe, Philippine nightclubs, and Japan. He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences was that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the &quot;one-ahead&quot; technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.

==Career==

===Magician===
Although defining himself as a conjuror, Randi began a career as a professional stage magician and escapologist in 1946. He initially presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of &quot;The Amazing Randi&quot;. Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini&#x27;s record of 93 minutes, though Randi called attention to the fact that he was much younger than Houdini had been when he established the original record in 1926.

Randi was a frequent guest on the Long John Nebel program on New York City radio station WOR, and did character voices for commercials. After Nebel moved to WNBC in 1964, Randi was given Nebel&#x27;s time slot on WOR, where he hosted &quot;The Amazing Randi Show&quot; until January 1966, and often had guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi&#x27;s then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi stated that he was fired from WOR over complaints from the archbishop of New York that Randi had said on-air that &quot;Jesus Christ was a religious nut,&quot; a claim that Randi disputed.

Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As &quot;The Amazing Randi&quot; he appeared regularly on the New York-based children&#x27;s television series &quot;Wonderama&quot; from 1959 to 1967. In 1970, he auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children&#x27;s show &quot;The Magic Clown&quot;, which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up. In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, Randi, in defining the community of magicians, stated: &quot;I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours.&quot; In the December 2003 issue of &quot;The Linking Ring&quot;, the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated: &quot;Perhaps Randi&#x27;s ethics are what make him Amazing&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk.&quot;

During Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1973–1974 Billion Dollar Babies tour, Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Cooper&#x27;s executioner. He also built several of the stage props, including the guillotine. In a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special &quot;World of Wizards&quot;, Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.

Randi has been accused of actually using &quot;psychic powers&quot; to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: &quot;Yes, indeed, I&#x27;m a trickster, I&#x27;m a cheat, I&#x27;m a charlatan, that&#x27;s what I do for a living. Everything I&#x27;ve done here was by trickery.&quot; The professor shouted back: &quot;That&#x27;s not what I mean. You&#x27;re a fraud because you&#x27;re pretending to do these things through trickery, but you&#x27;re actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.&quot; A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: &quot;I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn&#x27;t realize it.&quot; Randi consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.

Randi was a member of the Society of American Magicians (SAM), the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), and The Magic Circle in the UK, holding the rank of &quot;Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star.&quot;

===Author===
Randi wrote ten books, among them &quot;Conjuring&quot; (1992), a biographical history of prominent magicians. The book is subtitled &quot;Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, &amp; Chicanery and of the Mountebanks &amp; Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!&quot; The book&#x27;s cover indicates it is by &quot;James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed&quot;. The book features the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi&#x27;s second book, &quot;Houdini, His Life and Art&quot;. This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.

Randi&#x27;s book, &quot;The Magic World of the Amazing Randi&quot; (1989), was intended as a children&#x27;s introduction to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he wrote several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus, as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. In 2011, he was working on &quot;A Magician in the Laboratory&quot;, which recounted his application of skepticism to science. He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of his friend Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.

Other books by Randi include &quot;Flim-Flam!&quot; (1982), &quot;The Faith Healers&quot; (1987), &quot;James Randi, Psychic Investigator&quot; (1991), &quot;Test Your ESP Potential&quot; (1982), and &quot;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&quot; (1995).

Randi was a regular contributor to &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, penning the &quot;&#x27;Twas Brillig ...&quot; column, and also served on its editorial board. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine, published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, of which he was also a fellow.

===Skeptic===

Randi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book &quot;The Truth About Uri Geller&quot; (1982).

Believing that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and CSICOP reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a &quot;very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days.&quot; During this effort, Randi made contact with Johnny Carson and discovered that he was &quot;very much on our side. He wasn&#x27;t only a comedian ... he was a great thinker.&quot; According to Randi, when he was on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Carson broke his usual protocol of not talking with guests before their entrance on stage, but instead would ask what Randi wanted to be emphasized in the interview. &quot;He wanted to be aware of how he could help me.&quot;

In 1973, Geller appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and this appearance is recounted in the &quot;Nova&quot; documentary &quot;Secrets of the Psychics&quot;.

In the documentary, Randi says that Carson &quot;had been a magician himself and was skeptical&quot; of Geller&#x27;s claimed paranormal powers, so before the date of taping, Randi was asked &quot;to help prevent any trickery&quot;. Per Randi&#x27;s advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff &quot;anywhere near them&quot;. When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said &quot;This scares me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.&quot; Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t feel strong&quot; and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being &quot;pressed&quot; to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham&#x27;s November 7, 2014, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
However, this appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller&#x27;s claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham:
According to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached Ray Hyman, a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller&#x27;s ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. Later that same year, together with Martin Gardner, a &quot;Scientific American&quot; columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman&#x27;s and Randi&#x27;s skepticism, they formed the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).

Using donations and sales of their magazine, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, they and secular humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz took seats on the executive board, with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan joining as founding members. Randi travelled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.

András G. Pintér, producer and co-host of the European Skeptics Podcast, called Randi the grandfather of European skepticism by virtue of Randi &quot;playing a role in kickstarting several European organizations.&quot;

Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million in 1991 and lost. Geller&#x27;s suit against CSICOP was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. The legal costs Randi incurred used almost all of a $272,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work. Randi also dismissed Geller&#x27;s claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography associated with the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argued, of trick photography using a simple hand-held optical device. During the period of Geller&#x27;s legal dispute, CSICOP&#x27;s leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller&#x27;s litigation, demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.

Randi went on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal. He also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment.

Randi appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on &quot;That&#x27;s My Line&quot;, Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick &quot;confessed everything&quot;.

Randi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship&#x27;s five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi&#x27;s investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff&#x27;s broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff&#x27;s wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff&#x27;s left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff&#x27;s assistants, who had handed out &quot;prayer cards&quot; to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.

The news coverage generated by Randi&#x27;s exposé on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; led to many TV stations dropping Popoff&#x27;s show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987. However, the televangelist returned soon after with faith-healing infomercials that reportedly attracted more than $23 million in 2005 from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry&#x27;s &quot;Think Again! TV&quot; documented one of Popoff&#x27;s more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.

In February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a &quot;spirit channeler&quot; named Carlos, who was actually artist José Alvarez, Randi&#x27;s partner. While performing as Carlos, Alvarez was prompted by Randi using sophisticated radio equipment. According to the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program on the Carlos hoax, &quot;it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the resulting potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)&quot;, though an analysis by &quot;The Skeptic&quot;″s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez&#x27;s appearances was not credulous, the hoax &quot;at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical&quot;. The hoax was exposed on &quot;60 Minutes Australia&quot;; &quot;Carlos&quot; and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.

In his book &quot;The Faith Healers&quot;, Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arose from compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi was also critical of João de Deus, a.k.a. &quot;John of God&quot;, a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who had received international attention. Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, &quot;To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious.&quot;
In 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the grooves on the record. However, Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.

In 1988, John Maddox, editor of the prominent science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, asked Randi to join the supervision and observation of the homeopathy experiments conducted by Jacques Benveniste&#x27;s team. Once Randi&#x27;s stricter protocol for the experiment was in place, the positive results could not be reproduced.
Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home&#x27;s large mustache and that other one-octave mouth organs were found in Home&#x27;s belongings after his death. According to Randi, author William Lindsay Gresham told Randi &quot;around 1960&quot; that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Eric J. Dingwall, who catalogued Home&#x27;s collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, &quot;It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public.&quot; The fraudulent medium Henry Slade also played an accordion while held with one hand under a table. Slade and Home played the same pieces. They had at one time lived near each other in the U.S. The magician Chung Ling Soo exposed how Slade had performed the trick.

Randi distinguished between pseudoscience and &quot;crackpot science&quot;. He regarded most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached and conducted, but nonetheless saw it as a legitimate subject that &quot;should be pursued&quot;, and from which real scientific discoveries may develop. Randi regarded crackpot science as &quot;equally wrong&quot; as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.

Despite multiple debunkings, Randi did not like to be called a &quot;debunker&quot;, preferring to call himself a &quot;skeptic&quot; or an &quot;investigator&quot;:
Skeptics and magicians Penn &amp; Teller credit Randi and his career as a skeptic for their own careers. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that &quot;Flim-Flam!&quot; was an early influence on him, and said &quot;If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today.&quot; He went on to say &quot;Outside of my family ... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me.&quot;

At the NECSS skeptic conference in 2017, Randi was asked by George Hrab what a &quot;&#x27;skeptic coming of age ceremony&#x27; would look like&quot; and Randi talked about what it was like as a child to learn about the speed of light and how that felt like he was looking into the past. Randi stated &quot;More kids need to be stunned&quot;.

At The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2011 (TAM 9) the Independent Investigations Group (IIG) organized a tribute to Randi. The group gathered together with other attendees, put on fake white beards, and posed for a large group photo with Randi. At the CSICon in 2017, in absence of Randi, the IIG organized another group photo with leftover beards from the 2011 photo. After Randi was sent the photo, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m always very touched by any such expression. This is certainly no exception. You have my sincere gratitude. I suspect, however that a couple of those beards were fake. But I&#x27;m in a forgiving mood at the moment. I&#x27;m frankly very touched. I&#x27;ll see you at the next CSICon. Thank you all.&quot;

In a 2019 &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine article, Harriet Hall, a friend of Randi, compares him to the fictional Albus Dumbledore. Hall describes their long white beards, flamboyant clothing, associated with a bird (Dumbledore with a phoenix and Randi with Pegasus). They both are caring and have &quot;immense brainpower&quot; and both &quot;can perform impressive feats of magic&quot;. She states that Randi is one of &quot;major inspirations for the skeptical work I do ... He&#x27;s way better than Dumbledore!&quot;.

===&quot;Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live&quot; television show===
&quot;Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live&quot; was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor Bill Bixby, the program offered $100,000 (Randi&#x27;s $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show&#x27;s syndicator, LBS Communications, Inc.) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.
* An astrologer, Joseph Meriwether, claimed that he was able to ascertain a person&#x27;s astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell Meriwether their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After Meriwether talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that he thought was theirs. By agreement, Meriwether needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.
* The next psychic, Barbara Martin, claimed to be able to read auras around people, claiming that auras were visible at least five inches above each person. She selected ten people from a group of volunteers who she said had clearly visible auras. On stage were erected ten screens, numbered &quot;1&quot; through &quot;10&quot;, just tall enough to hide the volunteer while not hiding their aura. Unseen by Martin, some of the volunteers positioned themselves behind different screens, then she was invited to predict which screens hid volunteers by seeing their aura above. She stated that she saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.
* A dowser, Forrest Bayes, claimed that he could detect water in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box. He was shown twenty boxes and asked to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight of the boxes, which he said contained water, but it turned out that only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.
* A psychometric psychic, Sharon McLaren-Straz, claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object by handling the object itself. In order to avoid ambiguous statements, the psychic agreed to be presented with both a watch and a key from each of twelve different people. She was to match keys and watches to their owners. According to the prior agreement, she had to match at least nine out of the twelve sets, but she succeeded in only two.
* Professional crystal healer Valerie Swan attempted to use ESP to identify 250 Zener cards, guessing which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that Swan had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, she was able to get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.

===James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)===

In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF&#x27;s blog, &quot;Swift&quot;. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gave examples of what he considered the nonsense that he dealt with every day.

Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi&#x27;s retirement from the JREF.

===2010s===

Randi began a series of conferences known as &quot;The Amazing Meeting&quot; (TAM) which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted a large percentage of younger attendees. Randi was regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society&#x27;s official podcast &quot;Skepticality&quot; and the Center for Inquiry&#x27;s official podcast &quot;Point of Inquiry&quot;. From September 2006 onwards, he occasionally contributed to &quot;The Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe&quot; podcast with a column called &quot;Randi Speaks&quot;. In addition, &quot;The Amazing Show&quot; was a podcast in which Randi shared various anecdotes in an interview format.

In 2014, Part2Filmworks released &quot;An Honest Liar&quot;, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O&#x27;Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi&#x27;s life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga), to whom he was married in 2013. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto&#x27;s Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It also received positive reviews from critics. The film was featured on the PBS &quot;Independent Lens&quot; series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.

In December 2014, Randi flew to Australia to take part in &quot;An Evening with James Randi&quot; tour, organized by Think Inc. This tour included a screening of &quot;An Honest Liar&quot; followed by a &quot;fireside chat&quot; with Randi on stage. Cities visited were Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney. MC in Adelaide was Dr. Paul Willis with Richard Saunders interviewing Randi. MC in Perth was Jake Farr-Wharton with Richard Saunders interviewing Randi. MC for Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney was Richard Saunders with Lawrence Leung interviewing Randi.

In 2017, Randi appeared in animated form on the website Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse, and indicated that this is a balance with which many magicians struggle.

==One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==

The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal. The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules. No one progressed past the preliminary test, which was set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He refused to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.

On April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.

On &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, March 6, 2001, Larry King asked claimed medium Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed. Randi appeared with Browne on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge. However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne&#x27;s death in November 2013.

During a subsequent appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea, another claimed medium, to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question. Instead Altea replied only, &quot;I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere.&quot; On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on the show, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.

In October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward appeared on &quot;Headline Prime&quot;, hosted by Glenn Beck. When asked if he would take &quot;the Amazing Randi&#x27;s&quot; challenge, Edward responded, &quot;It&#x27;s funny. I was on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I&#x27;ll say the same thing here: why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who&#x27;s got an adjective as a first name?&quot; Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.

Randi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008. Randi called the ADE 651 &quot;a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It&#x27;s a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars.&quot; There was no response from McCormick. According to Iraqi investigators, the ADE 651, which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints. On April 23, 2013, McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London; he was subsequently sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal, which Randi was the first to expose.

A public log of past participants in the Million Dollar Challenge exists. In 2015, after Randi&#x27;s retirement, his foundation said the Million Dollar Challenge would no longer consider applicants unless they meet a set of minimum protocols, to reduce the amount of frivolous claims.

==Legal disputes==
Randi was involved in a variety of legal disputes, but said that he had &quot;never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me.&quot; However, he said, he had paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.

===Uri Geller===
Randi met magician Uri Geller in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be &quot;Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome—everything!&quot; But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud. According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one-third of one per cent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was cancelled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.
In May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; that Geller had &quot;tricked even reputable scientists&quot; with stunts that &quot;are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes&quot;, referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller&#x27;s lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay by the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.
Geller sued both Randi and CSICOP in the 1980s. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi&#x27;s statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. 

===Other cases===
In 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a &quot;shopping market molester&quot; in a 1988 speech. However, the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister-in-law. The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case, CSICOP.

Late in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley. Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue—Curley&#x27;s comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true—Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto&#x27;s largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of &quot;alcohol toxicity&quot;.

Allison DuBois, on whose life the television series &quot;Medium&quot; was based, threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17, 2004, commentary without her permission. Randi removed the photo and subsequently used a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site, beginning with his December 23, 2005, commentary.

Sniffex, producer of a dowsing bomb detection device, sued Randi and the JREF in 2007, and lost. Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed. The company was later investigated and charged with fraud.

==Views==
=== Political views ===
Randi was a registered Democrat. In April 2009, he released a statement endorsing the legalization of most illegal drugs.

Randi had been reported as a believer in Social Darwinist theories, although he denounced the ideologies and movements that formed around the theories in 2013.

===Views on religion===
Randi&#x27;s parents were members of the Anglican Church but rarely attended services. He attended Sunday school at St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Church in Toronto a few times as a child, but he independently decided to stop going after receiving no answer to his request for proof of the teachings of the Church.

In his essay &quot;Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I&#x27;m a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright&quot;, Randi, who identified himself as an atheist, opined that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being &quot;impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes&quot; and questions how Adam and Eve&#x27;s family &quot;managed to populate the Earth without committing incest&quot;. He wrote that, compared to the Bible, &quot;&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is more believable. And much more fun.&quot;

Clarifying his view of atheism, Randi wrote &quot;I&#x27;ve said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that&#x27;s their preference, and they&#x27;ve read it in a book. That&#x27;s their right.&quot;

In &quot;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&quot; (1995), he examines various spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji, he writes &quot;Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret.&quot; In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

Regarding his 2006 coronary artery bypass surgery, Randi was asked if he was tempted by religious ideas about an afterlife or if he went through it any differently than if he had been religious. Randi replied &quot;I allowed Daniel Dennett to speak for me&quot; referring to Dennett&#x27;s essay &quot;Thank Goodness&quot;, which Dennett wrote after a serious surgery. Summing up the essay, Randi continued:
In a discussion with Kendrick Frazier at CSICon 2016, Randi stated &quot;I think that a belief in a deity is ... an unprovable claim ... and a rather ridiculous claim. It is an easy way out to explain things to which we have no answer.&quot; He then summarized his current concern with religious belief as follows: &quot;A belief in a god is one of the most damaging things that infests humanity at this particular moment in history. It may improve, and I see signs that it may be improving, and I&#x27;ll leave it at that.&quot;

==Personal life==
When Randi hosted his own radio show in the 1960s, he lived in a small house in Rumson, New Jersey, that featured a sign on the premises that read: &quot;Randi—Charlatan&quot;.

In the 1970s and 80s, Randi supported seven foster children.

In 1987, Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Randi said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while he was on tour with Alice Cooper, during which the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band&#x27;s lockers during a performance, completely ransacking the room, but finding nothing illegal.

In February 2006, Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. The weekly commentary updates to his Web site were made by guests while he was hospitalized. Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada, his annual convention of scientists, magicians, skeptics, atheists, and freethinkers.

Randi was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in June 2009. He had a series of small tumors removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery. He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7, as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks. He also said at the conference: &quot;One day, I&#x27;m gonna die. That&#x27;s all there is to it. Hey, it&#x27;s too bad, but I&#x27;ve got to make room. I&#x27;m using a lot of oxygen and such—I think it&#x27;s good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I&#x27;m a little prejudiced on the matter.&quot;

Randi underwent his final chemotherapy session in December 2009, an experience that he said was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be. In a video posted in April 2010, Randi stated that he had been given a clean bill of health.

In a 2010 blog entry, Randi came out as gay, a move he said was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film &quot;Milk&quot;.

Randi married Venezuelan artist José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga) on July 2, 2013, in Washington, D.C. In 1986, Randi met Alvarez in a Fort Lauderdale public library after he had recently moved to Florida. Alvarez, who was then known as Peña, had left his native land in fear of his life after being threatened for being homosexual. The alias Peña used, Jose Alvarez, was already an actual person in the United States. The identity confusion caused the real Alvarez some legal and financial difficulties. Peña was arrested for identity theft and faced deportation. They resided in Plantation, Florida.

In the 1993 documentary &quot;Secrets of the Psychics&quot;, Randi stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve never involved myself in narcotics of any kind; I don&#x27;t smoke; I don&#x27;t drink, because that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I&#x27;m willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world, as close as I can get to it&quot;.

In a video released in October 2017, Randi revealed that he had recently suffered a minor stroke, and that he was under medical advice not to travel during his recovery, so would be unable to attend CSICon 2017 in Las Vegas later that month.

Randi died at his home on October 20, 2020, at the age of 92. The James Randi Educational Foundation attributed his death to &quot;age-related causes&quot;. The Center for Inquiry said that Randi &quot;was the public face of skeptical inquiry, bringing a sense of fun and mischievousness to a serious mission.&quot; Kendrick Frazier said, as part of the statement, &quot;Despite his ferocity in challenging all forms of nonsense, in person he was a kind and gentle man.&quot;

<doc id="16279" wikidata="Q709525" url="?curid=16279" title="James Lind">
<text>James Lind (4 October 1716 – 13 July 1794) was a Scottish physician. He was a pioneer of naval hygiene in the Royal Navy. By conducting one of the first ever clinical trials, he developed the theory that citrus fruits cured scurvy.

Lind argued for the health benefits of better ventilation aboard naval ships, the improved cleanliness of sailors&#x27; bodies, clothing and bedding, and below-deck fumigation with sulphur and arsenic. He also proposed that fresh water could be obtained by distilling sea water. His work advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved nutrition.

==Early life==
Lind was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1716 into a family of merchants, then headed by his father, James Lind. He had an elder sister. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh.

In 1731 he began his medical studies as an apprentice of George Langlands, a fellow of the Incorporation of Surgeons which preceded the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In 1739, he entered the Navy as a surgeon&#x27;s mate, serving in the Mediterranean, off the coast of West Africa and in the West Indies. By 1747 he had become surgeon of in the Channel Fleet, and conducted his experiment on scurvy while that ship was patrolling the Bay of Biscay. Just after that patrol he left the Navy, wrote his MD thesis on venereal diseases and earned his degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and was granted a licence to practise in Edinburgh.

===Prevention and cure of scurvy===
Scurvy is a disease caused by a vitamin C deficiency, but in Lind&#x27;s day, the concept of vitamins was unknown. Vitamin C is necessary for healthy connective tissue. In 1740 the catastrophic result of then-Commodore George Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation attracted much attention in Europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 died, most of them allegedly from scurvy. According to Lind, scurvy caused more deaths in the British fleets than French and Spanish arms.

Since antiquity in some parts of the world, and since the 17th century in England, it had been known that citrus fruit had an antiscorbutic effect. John Woodall (1570–1643), an English military surgeon of the British East India Company recommended them but their use did not become widespread. John Fryer (1650–1733) too noted in 1698 the value of citrus fruits in curing sailors of scurvy. Although Lind was not the first to suggest citrus as a cure for scurvy, he was the first to study its effect by a systematic experiment in 1747. It was one of the first reported, controlled, clinical experiments in history, particularly because of its use of control groups.

Lind thought that scurvy was due to putrefaction of the body that could be helped by acids, so he included an acidic dietary supplement in the experiment. This began after two months at sea when the ship was afflicted with scurvy. He divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. They all received the same diet, but in addition group one was given a quart of cider daily, group two twenty-five drops of elixir of vitriol (sulfuric acid), group three six spoonfuls of vinegar, group four half a pint of seawater, group five two oranges and one lemon, and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of barley water. The treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one showed any effect from its treatment.

Shortly after this experiment, Lind retired from the Navy and practised privately as a physician. In 1753, he published &quot;A treatise of the scurvy&quot;, that was mostly ignored. In 1758, he was appointed chief physician of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar at Gosport. When James Cook went on his first voyage he carried wort (0.1 mg vitamin C per 100 g), sauerkraut (10–15 mg per 100 g) and a syrup, or &quot;rob&quot;, of oranges and lemons (the juice contains 40–60 mg of vitamin C per 100 g) as antiscorbutics, but only the results of the trials on wort were published. In 1762 Lind&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the most effectual means of preserving the health of seamen&quot; appeared. In it he recommended growing salad—i.e. watercress (43 mg vitamin C per 100 g)—on wet blankets. This was put into practice, and in the winter of 1775 the British Army in North America was supplied with mustard and cress seeds. However Lind, like most of the medical profession, believed that scurvy came from ill-digested and putrefying food within the body, bad water, excessive work, and living in a damp atmosphere that prevented healthful perspiration. Thus, while he recognised the benefits of citrus fruit (although he weakened the effect by switching to a boiled concentrate or &quot;rob&quot;, in which the boiling process destroys vitamin C), he never advocated citrus juice as a single solution. He believed that scurvy had multiple causes which therefore required multiple remedies.

The medical establishment ashore continued to believe that scurvy was a disease of putrefaction, curable by the administration of elixir of vitriol, infusions of wort and other remedies designed to &#x27;ginger up&#x27; the system. It could not account for the effect of citrus fruits and so dismissed the evidence of them as unproven and anecdotal. In the Navy however, experience had convinced many officers and surgeons that citrus juices provided the answer to scurvy, even if the reason was unknown. On the insistence of senior officers, led by Rear Admiral Alan Gardner in 1794, lemon juice was issued on board the &quot;Suffolk&quot; on a twenty-three-week, non-stop voyage to India. The daily ration of two-thirds of an ounce mixed in grog contained just about the minimum daily intake of 10 mg vitamin C. There was no serious outbreak of scurvy. This resulted in widespread demand for lemon juice, backed by the Sick and Hurt Board whose numbers had recently been augmented by two practical naval surgeons who knew of Lind&#x27;s experiments with citrus. The following year, the Admiralty accepted the Board&#x27;s recommendation that lemon juice be issued routinely to the whole fleet. Another Scot, Archibald Menzies, brought citrus plants to Kealakekua Bay in Hawaii on the Vancouver Expedition, to help the Navy re-supply in the Pacific.
This was not the end of scurvy in the Navy, as lemon juice was at first in such short supply that it could only be used in home waters under the direction of surgeons, rather than as a preventative. Only after 1800 did the supply increase so that, at the insistence of Admiral Lord St Vincent, it began to be issued generally.

===Prevention of typhus===

Lind noticed that typhus disappeared from the top floor of his hospital, where patients were bathed and given clean clothes and bedding. However, incidence was very high on the lower floors where such measures were not in place. Lind recommended that sailors be stripped, shaved, scrubbed, and issued clean clothes and bedding regularly. Thereafter, British seamen did not suffer from typhus, giving the British navy a significant advantage over the French.

===Fresh water from the sea===
In the 18th century ships took along water, cordial and milk in casks. According to the &quot;Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majesty&#x27;s Service at Sea&quot;, which had been published in 1733 by the Admiralty, sailors were entitled to a gallon of weak beer daily (5/6 of a British gallon, equivalent to the modern American gallon or slightly more than three and a half litres). As the beer had been boiled in the brewing process, it was reasonably free from bacteria and lasted for months, unlike water. In the Mediterranean, wine was also issued, often fortified with brandy.

A frigate with 240 men, with stores for four months, carried more than one hundred tons of drinkable liquid. Water quality depended on its source, the condition of casks and for how long it had been kept. In normal times, sailors were not allowed to take any water away. When water was scarce, it was rationed and rain collected with spread sails. Fresh water was also obtained when possible &quot;en voyage&quot;, but watering places were often marshy, and in the tropics infested with malaria.

In 1759, Lind discovered that steam from heated salt water was fresh. He proposed to use solar energy for the distillation of water. But only when a new type of cooking stove was introduced in 1810 was production of fresh water by distillation possible on a useful scale.

===Tropical disease===
Lind&#x27;s final work was published in 1768; the &quot;Essay on Diseases Incidental to Europeans in Hot Climates, with the Method of Preventing their fatal Consequences.&quot; It was a work on the symptoms and treatments of tropical disease, but was not specific to naval medicine and served more as a general text for doctors and British emigrants. The &quot;Essay&quot; was used as a medical text in Britain for fifty years following publication. Seven editions were printed, including two after Lind&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Lind married Isabella Dickie and had two sons, John and James. In 1773 he was living on Princes Street in a brand-new house facing Edinburgh Castle.

John (1751–1794), his elder son, studied medicine at St Andrews University and graduated in 1777, then succeeded his father as chief physician at Haslar Hospital in 1783. James (1765–1823), also embarked on a career with the British navy. His cousin was James Lind (1736–1812).

James rose to the rank of post-captain, and was notable for his role in the Battle of Vizagapatam in the Bay of Bengal in 1804, for which he was knighted.

==Death==
Lind died at Gosport in Hampshire in 1794. He was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Parish Churchyard in Portchester.

== Recognition ==

Lind&#x27;s is one of twenty-three names on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine building in Keppel Street, London. Names were selected by a committee of unknown constitution who deemed them to be pioneers in public health and tropical medicine. At University of Edinburgh Medical School there is the unveiled in 1953, funded by citrus growers of California and Arizona. The James Lind Alliance is named after him.

<text>James Clavell (born Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell; 10 October 1921 – 7 September 1994) was an Australian-born, British-raised and educated, naturalized-American writer, screenwriter, director, and World War II veteran and prisoner of war. Clavell is best known for his &quot;Asian Saga&quot; novels, a number of which have had television adaptations. Clavell also wrote such screenplays as those for &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958), based on the short story by George Langelaan, and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), based on the personal account of Paul Brickhill. He directed the popular 1967 film &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, for which he also wrote the script.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Sydney, Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell, a Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia with the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 to 1922. Richard Clavell was posted back to England when James was nine months old. Clavell was educated at The Portsmouth Grammar School.

===World War II===
In 1940, Clavell joined the Royal Artillery, and received an emergency Regular Army commission as a second lieutenant on 10 May 1941. Though trained for desert warfare, after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 he was sent to Singapore to fight the Japanese. The ship taking his unit was sunk en route to Singapore, and the survivors were picked up by a Dutch boat fleeing to India. The commander, described by Clavell years later as a &quot;total twit&quot;, insisted that they be dropped off at the nearest port to fight the war despite having no weapons.

==== Imprisoned in Changi ====
Shot in the face, he was captured in Java in 1942 and sent to a local Japanese prisoner of war camp. Later, he was transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore.

In 1981, Clavell recounted:

Changi became my university instead of my prison. Among the inmates there were experts in all walks of life—the high and the low roads. I studied and absorbed everything I could from physics to counterfeiting, but most of all I learned the art of surviving, the most important course of all.

Prisoners were fed a quarter of a pound () of rice per day, one egg per week and occasional vegetables. Clavell believed that if atomic bombs had not been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki he would not have survived the war.

Clavell did not talk about his wartime experiences with anyone, even his wife, for 15 years after the war. For a time he carried a can of sardines in his pocket at all times and fought an urge to forage for food in rubbish bins. He also experienced bad dreams and a nervous stomach kept him awake at night.

===Post-war career===
After the war, Clavell was promoted to war-substantive lieutenant, with effect from 1 August 1942, and to temporary captain on 10 June 1946, A motorcycle crash, however, ended his military career. On 20 July 1948, he was officially discharged from the army on account of disability, leaving with the honorary rank of captain. He enrolled with the University of Birmingham, where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951). He would visit her on the film sets where she was working and began to be interested in becoming a film director.

===Early work on films===
Clavell entered the film industry via distribution and worked at that in England for a number of years. He tried to get into producing but had no luck, so he started writing screenplays. In 1954 he moved to New York, then to Hollywood. While trying to break into screenwriting, he paid the bills working as a carpenter.

In 1956, he sold a script about pilots to RKO, &quot;Far Alert&quot;. The same year Michael Pate bought a story of his, &quot;Forbidden Territory&quot;, for filming.

Neither was filmed but &quot;Far Alert&quot; kept being sold and re-sold. &quot;In 18 months it brought in $87,000&quot;, he later said. &quot;We kept getting paid for writing it and rewriting it as it went from one studio to another. It was wonderful.&quot; It was later sold to Fox where it attracted the attention of Robert L. Lippert, who hired Clavell to write the science-fiction horror movie &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958). This became a hit and launched Clavell as a screenwriter.

He wrote &quot;Watusi&quot; (1959) for director Kurt Neumann, who had also made &quot;The Fly&quot;.

Clavell wrote &quot;Five Gates to Hell&quot; (1959) for Lippert, and when they could not find a suitable director, Clavell was given the job.

Paramount hired Clavell to write a film about the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers. It ended up not being made. Neither was a proposed movie about Francis Gary Powers made. Clavell did write, produce, and direct a Western at Paramount, &quot;Walk Like a Dragon&quot; (1960).

In 1959, Clavell wrote &quot;Moon Landing&quot; and &quot;First Woman in the Moon&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Men into Space&quot;, a &quot;day after tomorrow&quot;-style science fiction drama, which depicted, in realistic terms, the (at the time) near future of space exploration.

In 1960, Clavell had written a Broadway show with John Sturges, &quot;White Alice&quot;, a thriller set in the Arctic. It was never produced.

===Early prose and screenplay work===
In 1960, the Writers Guild went on strike, meaning Clavell was unable to work. He decided to write a novel, &quot;King Rat&quot;, based on his time at Changi. It took him three months and several more months after that to rework it. The book was published in 1962 and sold well. It was turned into a film in 1965.

In 1961, Clavell announced he had formed his own company, Cee Productions, who would make the films &quot;King Rat&quot;, &quot;White Alice&quot; and &quot;No Hands on the Clock&quot;.

In 1962, Clavell signed a multi picture contract with a Canadian company to produce and direct two films there, &quot;Circle of Greed&quot; and &quot;The Sweet and the Bitter&quot;. Only the second was made and it was not released until 1967.

Clavell wrote scripts for the war films &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964).

He wrote a short story, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Story&quot; (1964) and the script for &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; (1965), directed by John Sturges who had made &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Richard Sahib&quot; for Sturges which was never made.

Clavell wanted to write a second novel because &quot;that separates the men from the boys&quot;. The money from &quot;King Rat&quot; enabled him to spend two years researching and then writing what became &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1966). It was a huge best-seller, and Clavell sold the film rights for a sizeable amount (although the film would not be made until 1986).

===Leading film director===
Clavell returned to filmmaking. He wrote, produced and directed &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967), featuring Sidney Poitier and based on E. R. Braithwaite&#x27;s semiautobiographical 1959 book. It was a huge critical and commercial success.

Clavell was now in much demand as a filmmaker. He produced and directed &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot; (1969), a highwayman film which was a commercial failure. So too was an epic film about the Thirty Years&#x27; War, &quot;The Last Valley&quot; (1971).

===Career as novelist===
Clavell returned to novel writing, which was the focus of the remainder of his career. He spent three years researching and writing &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1975), about an Englishman who becomes a samurai in feudal Japan. It was another massive best-seller. Clavell was heavily involved in the 1980 miniseries which starred Richard Chamberlain and achieved huge ratings.

In the late 1970s he spent three years researching and writing his fourth novel, &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963. It was another best-seller and was turned into a miniseries in 1986.

Clavell briefly returned to filmmaking and directed a thirty-minute adaptation of his novelette &quot;The Children&#x27;s Story&quot;. He was meant to do a sequel to &quot;Shōgun&quot; but instead wrote a novel about the 1979 revolution in Iran, &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1986).

Clavell eventually returned to the &quot;Shōgun&quot; sequel, writing &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; (1993). This was his last completed novel.

==Novelist==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Clavell has a gift. It may be something that cannot be taught or earned. He breathes narrative ... He writes in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows&quot;. His first novel, &quot;King Rat&quot; (1962), was a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences at Changi. When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1966), was a fictional account of Jardine Matheson&#x27;s successful career in Hong Kong, as told via the character who was to become Clavell&#x27;s heroic archetype, Dirk Struan. Struan&#x27;s descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; was adapted as a movie in 1986.

Clavell&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1975), is set in 17th-century Japan, and it tells the story of a shipwrecked English navigator in Japan, based on that of William Adams. When the story was made into a TV miniseries in 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second-highest-rated miniseries in history (after &quot;Roots&quot;) with an audience of more than 120 million. A second 10-episode production of the epic was released in 2024 by FX on Hulu and FX. It set a new record as the most awarded single season of television in Emmy history, and won the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.

Clavell&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981), became a best-seller that year and was adapted into a TV miniseries in 1988.

Following the success of &quot;Noble House&quot;, Clavell wrote &quot;Thrump-o-moto&quot; (1985), &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1986) and &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; (1993).

===Peter Marlowe===
Peter Marlowe is Clavell&#x27;s author surrogate and a character of the novels &quot;King Rat&quot; and &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan&#x27;s) in &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1986). Featured most prominently in &quot;King Rat&quot;, Marlowe is an English prisoner of war in Changi Prison during World War II. In &quot;Noble House&quot;, set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong. Marlowe&#x27;s ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels.

In &quot;Noble House&quot; Marlowe is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalised, is based on real events (like those in &quot;King Rat&quot;). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, &quot;Perhaps I&#x27;m not there at all&quot;, although in a later scene, he admits he was &quot;the hero, of course&quot;.

===Novels===
The &quot;Asian Saga&quot; consists of six novels:

# &quot;King Rat&quot; (1962), set in a Japanese POW camp in Singapore in 1945.
# &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1966), set in Hong Kong in 1841
# &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1975), set in Japan from 1600 onwards
# &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963
# &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1986), set in Iran in 1979.
# &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; (1993), set in Japan in 1862

===Children&#x27;s stories===
* &quot;The Children&#x27;s Story&quot; (1964 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; short story; adapted as a movie and reprinted as a standalone book in 1981)
* &quot;Thrump-O-Moto&quot; (1986), illustrated by George Sharp

===Nonfiction===
* &quot;The Art of War&quot; (1983), a translation of Sun Tzu&#x27;s book

===Interactive fiction===
* &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shōgun&quot; (1986, Virgin Games) for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and MS-DOS)
*&quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shōgun&quot; (1988, Infocom) for Amiga, Apple II, MS-DOS and Mac

==Politics and later life==
In 1963 Clavell became a naturalised citizen of the United States. Politically, he was said to have been an ardent individualist and proponent of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, as many of his books&#x27; heroes exemplify. Clavell admired Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist school of philosophy, and in 1981 he sent her a copy of &quot;Noble House&quot; inscribed: &quot;This is for Ayn Rand—one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks. James C, New York, 2 September 81.&quot; 

Between 1970 and 1990, Clavell lived at Fredley Manor near Mickleham, located in Surrey in South East England.

==Personal life==
Clavell had three children. He and his wife had two daughters, Michaela and Holly. Clavell had an affair with Caroline Naylen Barrett, who was born in Tokyo to a Japanese mother and an American G.I. father. They had a daughter, Petra Barrett Brando-Corval, born in 1972. Barrett, the longtime personal assistant and later girlfriend of Marlon Brando, raised Petra in England; Brando legally adopted Petra in 1981. She lives in London with her husband Russel Anton Fischer, a film producer.

==Death and legacy==
In 1994, Clavell died in Switzerland from a stroke while suffering from cancer. He was 72. 

After sponsorship by his widow, the library and archive of the Royal Artillery Museum at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in southeast London, was renamed the James Clavell Library in his honour. The library was later closed pending the opening of a new facility in Salisbury, Wiltshire; however, James Clavell Square on the Royal Arsenal development on Woolwich riverside remains.

<text>John Frederick Joseph Cade AO (18 January 1912 – 16 November 1980) was an Australian psychiatrist who in 1948 discovered the effects of lithium carbonate as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder, then known as manic depression. At a time when the standard treatments for psychosis were electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy, lithium had the distinction of being the first effective medication available to treat a mental illness.

==Early life==
John Cade was born in Murtoa, in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. John&#x27;s father David was Murtoa&#x27;s general practitioner. Ellen, John&#x27;s mother, and younger brothers David and Frank completed the family. When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in Gallipoli and France. On return from the war, his father suffered from &#x27;war-weariness&#x27; and had difficulty in continuing in general practice. Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental Hygiene Department. Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely Sunbury, Beechworth and Mont Park. John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John&#x27;s later deep understanding of the needs of the mentally ill. John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, matriculating in 1928. He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects. He became a House Officer at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and then Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital before becoming severely ill with bilateral pneumococcal pneumonia. While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean. They married in 1937.

===World War II===
Like his father before him, Cade left his young family to fight for Australia in the Armed Forces in World War II. Cade was appointed captain, Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F., on 1 July 1940 and posted to the 2nd/9th Field Ambulance. Although trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Cade served as a surgeon and departed for Singapore in 1941 on . He was promoted to major in September 1941. After the Fall of Singapore to Japan, he became a prisoner of war at Changi Prison from February 1942 to September 1945. During his imprisonment, he reportedly would observe some fellow inmates having strange, vacillating behaviour. He thought perhaps a toxin was affecting their brains and when it was eliminated through their urine, they lost their symptoms.

==Discovery of the effect of lithium on mania==
After the war, Cade recuperated very briefly in Heidelberg Hospital, then took up a position at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused pantry in Bundoora that he conducted crude experiments which led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. Since he had no sophisticated analytical equipment these experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of guinea pigs. His early experiments suggested to him that the urine from manic patients was more toxic. There are 2 toxic substances in urine: urea and uric acid. He found urea was the same in both ill and healthy people. He started to work on uric acid. In order to do that, he made artificial solutions of uric acid. To make up different strengths of uric acid he needed to convert it into a substance that he could more easily manipulate. On its own uric acid would not dissolve in water. Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium was added to make a solution of lithium urate. Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with lithium carbonate solution, as a control solution, the guinea pigs were more restful. His use of careful controls in his experiments revealed that the lithium-ion had a calming effect by itself, but even this finding may have been caused by the toxic effects of an excessive dose of lithium. After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans, Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with mania, dementia præcox or melancholia, with outstanding results. The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium. He published these findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in a paper entitled &#x27;Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement&#x27;, published in 1949.

While Cade&#x27;s results appeared highly promising, side effects of lithium in some cases led to non-compliance. The toxicity of lithium led to several deaths of patients undergoing lithium treatment. The problem of toxicity was greatly reduced when suitable tests were developed to measure the lithium level in the blood. Moreover, as a naturally occurring chemical, lithium salt could not be patented, meaning that its manufacturing and sales were not considered commercially viable. These factors prevented its widespread adoption in psychiatry for some years, particularly in the United States, where its use was banned until 1970.

==Royal Park and RANZCP==

In 1952 Cade was appointed Superintendent and Dean of the clinical school at Royal Park Hospital. Two years later, at the request of the Mental Hygiene Authority which was planning to remodel Royal Park, he visited Britain for six months to inspect psychiatric institutions. On his return, he introduced modern facilities and replaced the rather authoritarian approach to patient care with a lot more personal and informal style that included group therapy. Concerned at the number of alcohol-related cases, he supported admission to aid early detection and later proposed the use of large doses of thiamine in the treatment of alcoholism. Cade served as the Superintendent at Royal Park until his retirement in 1977.

He served as the federal president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1969–70, and also as the president for its Victoria branch from 1963 until his death in 1980. In the end, Dr. Cade&#x27;s discovery did receive widespread acknowledgements and praise. For his contribution to psychiatry, he was awarded a Kittay International Award in 1974 (with Mogens Schou from Denmark), and he was invited to be a Distinguished Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists. In 1976, Cade was one of the first to be made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Dr. Cade remained humble about his chance discovery, describing himself as merely a gold prospector who happened to find a nugget. Finally, in July 2004, the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Cade&#x27;s 1949 article, &quot;Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement&quot;, was the number one most cited MJA article.

==Legacy==
John Cade died of oesophageal cancer at Fitzroy on 16 November 1980, and is buried at Yan Yean Cemetery in Whittlesea. Recognition of Cade&#x27;s pioneering work continued after his death. The Adult Acute unit at Royal Park Hospital was named the &quot;John Cade Unit&quot; in recognition of Cade&#x27;s long service to the hospital. After Royal Park&#x27;s closure, the newly opened Adult Acute Psychiatric Unit at Royal Melbourne Hospital was named &quot;John Cade Adult Acute Inpatient Unit&quot;. In 1980 the first John Cade memorial lecture was delivered by Mogens Schou at the congress in Jerusalem of the Collegian International Psychopharmacologium. In 2013 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) offered two $750 000 per annum fellowships for mental health research, entitled the &quot;NHMRC John Cade Fellowship in Mental Health Research&quot;. The Fellowship recipients were Professor Helen Christensen of the University of New South Wales and Professor John McGrath of The University of Queensland. The RANZCP awards The John Cade Memorial Medal to a final year Victorian medical student following a special clinical examination at Monash University or the University of Melbourne each year. The Faculty of Medicine at University of Melbourne also awards the John Cade Memorial Prize.

==Troubled Minds==
In 2004, Film Australia and SBS screened the documentary &quot;Troubled Minds – The Lithium Revolution&quot;, a 60-minute documentary portraying John Cade&#x27;s discovery of the use of Lithium in mental illness. The documentary received international recognition, winning the main prize at the International Vega Awards for Excellence in Scientific Broadcasting.
&quot;Troubled Minds&quot; was also recognised locally with writer/director Dennis K. Smith winning the AWGIE Award for Best Documentary.

<doc id="16286" wikidata="Q63850" url="?curid=16286" title="Johann von Werth">
<text>Johann von Werth (1591 – 16 January 1652), also &quot;Jan von Werth&quot; or in French &quot;Jean de Werth&quot;, was a German general of cavalry in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

== Biography ==
Werth was born in 1591 most likely at Büttgen in the Duchy of Jülich as the eldest son of the farmer Johann von Wierdt († 1606) and Elisabeth Streithoven. He had seven brothers and sisters. His exact birthplace is not sure, other candidates are Puffendorf (today part of Baesweiler) and Linnich. In the past, historians also argued for Weert in Limburg because they confused him with Jan van der Croon, another imperial general with similar vita.

Around 1610, he left home to become a soldier of fortune in the Walloon cavalry under Ambrogio Spinola in the Spanish Netherlands. Most likely, he fought in the War of the Jülich Succession and served afterwards in the garrison of Lingen. The outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War saw him moving to Bohemia in support of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. In the spanish regiment Marradas, he fought at White Mountain in 1620. In 1622, at the taking of Jülich, he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He also participated at the battle of Fleurus in 1622 but his military actions over the next eight years are not known. In this time, he married the Dutch woman Gertrud van Gent, mother of his eldest children Lambertine Irmgard and Johann Anton.

He served as an Oberstwachtmeister in a cavalry regiment in the Bavarian army in 1630. He obtained the command of a regiment, both titular and effective, in 1632, and in 1633 and 1634 laid the foundations of his reputation as a swift and fearsome leader of cavalry forays. His achievements were even more conspicuous in the great pitched Battle of Nördlingen (1634), after which the emperor made him a &quot;Freiherr&quot; of the Empire, and the elector of Bavaria gave him the rank of Lieutenant field marshal. About this time, he armed his regiment with the musket in addition to the sword.
In 1635 and 1636 Werth&#x27;s forays extended into Lorraine and Luxembourg, after which he projected an expedition into the heart of France. Starting in July 1636, from the country of the lower Meuse, he raided far and wide, and even urged his commander-in-chief, Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, to &quot;plant the Double Eagle on the Louvre&quot;. Though this was not attempted. Werth&#x27;s horsemen appeared at Saint-Denis before a French army of fifty thousand men at Compiègne forced the invaders to retreat. The memory of this raid lasted long, and the name of &quot;Jean de Wert&quot; figures in folk-songs and serves as a bogey to quieten unruly children.

In 1637 Jean de Wert married Maria Isabella von Spaur in St. Verena, Straßberg.

In 1637 Werth was once more in the Rhine valley, destroying convoys, relieving besieged towns and surprising the enemy&#x27;s camps. In February 1638 he defeated the Weimar troops in an engagement at Rheinfelden, but shortly afterwards was made prisoner by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. His hopes of being exchanged for the Swedish field marshal Gustaf Horn were dashed when Bernhard had to deliver up his captive to the French. Jean de Wert was brought to Paris, amidst great rejoicings from the country people. He was lionized by the society of the capital, visited in prison by high ladies. So light was his captivity that he said that nothing bound him but his word of honour. His eventual release was delayed until March 1642 because the Imperial government feared to see Horn at the head of the Swedish army and would not allow an exchange.

When at last Werth reappeared in the field it was as general of cavalry in the Imperial and Bavarian and Cologne services. His first campaign against the French marshal Guebriant was uneventful, but his second (1643) in which Baron Franz von Mercy was his commander-in-chief, was the Battle of Tuttlingen in which Werth was instrumental in a surprise victory. In 1644 he was in the lower Rhine country, but he returned to Mercy&#x27;s headquarters in time to fight in the Battle of Freiburg. In the following year he played a decisive role in the Second Battle of Nördlingen. Mercy was killed in this action, and Werth temporarily commanded the defeated arm until succeeded by Field-marshal Geleen. Werth was disappointed, but remained thoroughly loyal to his soldierly code of honour, and found an outlet for his anger in renewed military activity.
In 1647 differences arose between the Elector and the Emperor as to the allegiance due from the Bavarian troops, in which, after long hesitation, Werth, fearing that the cause of the Empire and of the Catholic religion would be ruined if the Elector resumed control of the troops, attempted to take his men over the Austrian border. But they refused to follow and, escaping with great difficulty from the Elector&#x27;s vengeance, Werth found a refuge in Austria. The Emperor was grateful for his conduct in this affair, ordered the Elector to rescind his ban. The last campaign of the war (1648) was uneventful, and shortly after its close he retired to live on the estates which he had bought in the course of his career. And it was at one of these, Benatek NE of Prague in Bohemia, a gift from the emperor, that he died on 16 of January 1652. He was buried in the church of Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Benátky.

== Legend of Jan and Griet ==

Johann von Werth&#x27;s life became a popular legend in the Rhineland and Cologne that is frequently reenacted at Karneval time:

A poor peasant, Jan, fell in love with Griet but she wanted a wealthier partner and declined his offer of marriage. Devastated by her rejection he came upon an army recruiter and signed up to go to war. Through hard work and good fortune he rose to become a general, celebrating several victories. After taking the fort at Hermannstein he was leading his triumphant troops into Cologne through St. Severin&#x27;s Gate, when he saw his former love Griet selling fruit at a market. Griet was filled with regret at turning down such a successful person and exclaimed &quot;Jan, who would have thought it?&quot; to which he replied &quot;Griet, who would have had done it!&quot; and turns away.

The story has several variants. It has inspired many songs including one in 2001 by the rock band BAP. Jan von Werth&#x27;s name has been used for centuries to name military and recreational organisations, particularly groups of mounted marksmen at Schützenfests and Karneval.
