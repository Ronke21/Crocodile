<text>The subject of homosexuality and Judaism dates back to the Torah. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a (something abhorred or detested) that can be subject to capital punishment by the current Sanhedrin under halakha (Jewish law).

The issue has been a subject of contention within modern Jewish denominations, and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has seen homosexual male intercourse as contrary to Judaism, not homosexuality in-and-of-itself. This opinion is often still maintained by Orthodox Judaism.

Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which until December 2006 held the same position as Orthodoxy, has since issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of pluralism; one opinion continues to follow the Orthodox position while another opinion substantially liberalizes the view of homosexual sex and relationships (while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited).

Theologically liberal branches such as Reconstructionist, Humanistic, and Reform Judaism have all openly accepted homosexuality, homosexual intercourse, and same-sex marriage.

==Homosexuality in the Torah==
The Book of Leviticus refers to male homosexual sexual practices twice (JPS translation):

Several commentators believe that the verses specifically condemn the practice of sodomy (i.e. anal intercourse between two males). Rabbinic thought supports this view, condemning homosexuality as an example of &quot;unnatural intercourse&quot; compared to the &quot;natural intercourse&quot; between non-related men and women. Intercourse in both scenarios only occur if penetration exists.

Deuteronomy 23:17 tells followers: &quot;None of the daughters of Israel shall be a kedeshah, nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a Kadesh.&quot; This has been interpreted as prohibiting the &quot;sons of Israel&quot; from serving as a homosexual temple prostitute in a pagan cult.

==Rabbinic Jewish application and interpretation of these verses==

===Prohibitions for homosocial interaction===

The laws of prohibit affectionate touch between an unmarried man and woman (except close relatives), because this touch is considered &quot;approaching&quot; a forbidden relationship. As gay male sex is included in the category of along with other sexual prohibitions, the prohibition of would seem to also apply between two gay men. Nevertheless, some sources raise the possibility that the law may be more lenient for two men than for a man and a woman. The consensus seems to be that touch between gay men which involves sexual desire is rabbinically forbidden, while touch which does not involve sexual desire is permitted.

Another issue is the prohibition of (seclusion of two individuals together in a manner that would allow them to have sex). The Talmud records a debate over whether applies to any two men. Maimonides, Tur, and Shulchan Aruch rule leniently that of two men is permitted, because &quot;Jews are not suspected of homosexual sex&quot;. Nevertheless, the Shulchan Aruch recommended to avoid such , &quot;in these generations where promiscuous people are common&quot; (possibly a reference to the use of Köçek dancer-prostitutes in the Ottoman Empire at the time). However, this recommendation was not repeated by later authorities.

Based on the precedents that can apply to two men in a circumstance where homosexual behavior is a concern, a modern halakhic authority rules that two men cannot be alone together if both of them are homosexual. Opinions also exist that the prohibition only applies to two men who are in a relationship with each other, or that there is no technical prohibition at all if they are confident they can avoid forbidden touch (but they should still avoid sharing a bedroom).

===Applicability of Biblical death penalty===
Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation was the death penalty, though minors under 13 years of age were exempt from this, as from any other penalty. However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. The Jewish Oral Law states that capital punishment would be applicable only if two men were caught in the act of anal sex, if there were two witnesses to the act, if the men involved were warned that they committed a capital offense, and the two men—or the willing party, in case of rape—subsequently acknowledged the warning but continued to engage in the prohibited act anyway. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.

Rabbinic tradition understands the Torah&#x27;s system of capital punishment to not be in effect for the past approximately 2,000 years, in the absence of a Sanhedrin and Temple. The relative absence of anti-homosexual prosecutions is also linked to the Jewish belief that homosexuality did not exist in the community.

Classical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual attraction is inherently sinful. In fact, the mental and emotional feelings two men experience when they engage in intimate relations are not condemned. However, they are condemned if intercourse, commonly interpreted as penetrative sex, occurs. If the man caught does (repentance), i.e., he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions, he is seen to be forgiven by God.

===Lesbian sexual activity===
Although lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Hebrew Bible, sexual liaisons between women are forbidden by Orthodox rabbinical literature. The Talmud discusses tribadism (women rubbing genitals together, or ) without explicitly prohibiting it; the main concern was whether or not this activity removed their status as a virgin, making them ineligible to marry a member of the priesthood. However, the Sifra condemned marriage between two women, considering it within the category of licentious foreign behavior which is forbidden to Jews. Following this lead, later halakhic codes prohibited tribadism on the same grounds. The penalty for lesbian acts was flagellation, rather than the death penalty. Two reasons that explain the latter include lesbianism not being explicitly prohibited in the Torah and the belief that it did not constitute intercourse.

===Same-sex marriage in Midrash===

Sifra states: &quot;&#x27;Like the deeds of the land of Egypt where you dwelt, you shall not do&#x27; – What would they do? A man would marry a man, a woman would marry a woman...&quot;

Nonetheless, some contemporary scholars believe that same-sex marriage is theoretically permissible because sanctifies the relationship between the spouses rather than the &quot;sexual intimacies&quot; they commit. The permissibility of same-sex marriage is also compared to the permissibility of marriage between a divorcee and a male descendant of a (priest). The latter is accepted by adherents of Conservative Judaism because they believe the ethical components of Judaism, exemplified by justice and compassion, trump the legal components.

==== Reasons for the prohibition ====

Reasons suggested by the rabbis for the prohibition on gay male sex include the following:
* The rationale for abstaining homosexuality extends beyond not emulating the Canaanites
* It is considered a defiance of sexual anatomy, which is unlike God&#x27;s intention of procreation and sexual activity
* The sexual arousal involved results in a vain emission of semen
* It may lead a man to abandon his family to pursue a homosexual relationship
* It is non-procreative
* It blurs the lines between masculinity and femininity

==Orthodox Jewish views==
While a variety of views regarding homosexuality as an inclination or status exist within the Orthodox Jewish community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is some disagreement about which male homosexual acts come under core prohibitions, the majority of Orthodox Judaism puts male-male anal sex in the category of , &#x27;die rather than transgress&#x27;, the small category of biblically-prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law to die rather than do. According to the Talmud, homosexual acts are not necessarily forbidden between non-Jews, as it merely states that the &quot;bnei Noach&quot; i.e. the &quot;descendants of Noah&quot; (the entire world) have accepted thirty mitzvot (commandments) but only choose to practice three of them: one, they do not draw up marriage contracts for homosexuals – two, they do not merchandise (human) flesh in the marketplace – three, they do have respect for the Torah. Although in passages from the Torah it is quite clear that non-Jews do indeed practice homosexuality and that it’s allowed for them – since in Leviticus 
18:3 there is a strict instruction not to follow the so-called &quot;acts of Egypt&quot; among which there was also homosexuality included in them. Canaanites were also claimed to be engaging in homosexual acts as well. The archetypal model in Judaism is marital heterosexuality with fornication, celibacy, adultery, homosexuality, incest and bestiality seen to be part of a continuous prism of wrong.

In a speech given in 1986, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, discussed &quot;individuals who express an inclination towards a particular form of physical relationship in which the libidinal gratification is sought with members of one&#x27;s own gender&quot;. He wrote that &quot;society and government must be to offer a helping hand to those who are afflicted with this problem&quot;.

In a 2008 open letter distributed to Orthodox community leaders, the Hod organization appealed to the Orthodox community to recognize them as part of the religious society. Up to 2013, 163 Orthodox rabbis from Israel and abroad signed this statement, including Yuval Cherlow, Binyamin Lau, Haim Navon, Daniel Sperber, Eliezer Melamed, Shai Piron, and Yehuda Gilad. In 2010, TorahWeb.org published a brief position statement entitled &quot;Torah View on Homosexuality&quot;, co-authored by Rav Hershel Schachter, Rav Mordechai Willig, Rav Michael Rosensweig, and Rav Mayer Twersky.

On July 22, 2010, a &quot;Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community&quot; was released. It was written primarily by Nathaniel Helfgot, Aryeh Klapper, and Yitzchak Blau. Signatories include more than a hundred rabbis and laypeople. Some of the statement&#x27;s more notable supporters are Rabbi Marc Angel, co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship; Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founder of Lincoln Square Synagogue, Efrat, and Ohr Torah Stone Institutions; and Rabbi Avi Weiss, head of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, founder of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah and Yeshivat Maharat, and co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship.

An edict signed by dozens of Israeli Orthodox rabbis and published in 2016 by the Israeli Modern Orthodox rabbinic group Beit Hillel, a group which promotes inclusiveness in Orthodox Judaism, stated, in part, &quot;According to the Torah and halacha, the [same-sex sexual] acts are forbidden, but not the proclivities, and therefore, people with same-sex tendencies, men and women, have no invalidation in halacha or tradition. They are obligated by the commandments of the Torah, they can fulfill a [ritual] obligation on behalf of the public, and carry out all of the community functions just like any member.&quot; It also stated, in part, &quot;Just as it [is] inconceivable to mock someone for being physically, behaviorally, or mentally different, so too those with same-sex tendencies should not be mocked. On the contrary, those around them—family and community—should show special feeling for them, and apply to them the Torah commandment of &#x27;Love thy neighbor as thyself&#x27; and to be diligent in avoiding the prohibition of insulting another.&quot;

Rabbi Dr. Immanuel Jakobovits describes the traditional opinion on homosexuality as follows: &quot;Jewish law[...] rejects the view that homosexuality is to be regarded merely as a disease or as morally neutral... Jewish law holds that no hedonistic ethic, even if called &quot;love&quot;, can justify the morality of homosexuality any more than it can legitimize adultery or incest, however genuinely such acts may be performed out of love and by mutual consent.&quot; Rabbi Norman Lamm argued that some (although not all) homosexuals should be viewed as diseased and in need of compassion and treatment, rather than willful rebels who should be ostracized. He distinguishes between six varieties of homosexuals, including &quot;genuine homosexuals&quot; who have &quot;strong preferential erotic feelings for members of the same sex&quot;, &quot;transitory&quot; and &quot;situational&quot; homosexuals who would prefer heterosexual intercourse but are denied it or seek gain in homosexuality, and heterosexuals who are merely curious.

===Prominent Gay Orthodox Jews===

When Steven Greenberg, who received Orthodox rabbinic ordination, publicly announced in 1999 that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in the Jewish newspapers. Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University, stated, &quot;It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society.&quot; As Greenberg has a rabbinic ordination from the Orthodox rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University (RIETS), he is generally described as the first openly gay Orthodox Jewish rabbi. However, some Orthodox Jews, including many rabbis, dispute his being an Orthodox rabbi.

Orthodox Israeli rabbi Ron Yosef became in 2009 the first Israeli Orthodox Rabbi to come out, by appearing in Uvda (&quot;Fact&quot;), Israel&#x27;s leading investigative television program, in an episode regarding conversion therapies in Israel. Yosef remains in his position as a pulpit Rabbi. Yosef testified that his Yemenite congregation did not accept him being a homosexual very easily and it took them a while to accept it. Yosef received death threats in the year leading up to the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. In 2013, he stated he was in a relationship with a man. Yosef has stated his approach to the issue of homosexuality in Judaism as follows: &quot;It is clear to me that lying with another man is forbidden, and our starting point is commitment to halacha and Torah. The goal is not to seek permission. But you need to give us a shoulder and support.&quot;

In 2019 Daniel Atwood became the first openly gay Orthodox person to be ordained as a rabbi; he was ordained by the rabbi Daniel Landes, in Jerusalem. In October 2023, &quot;The Forward&quot; reported about Shua Brick, &quot;experts say that Brick is the first openly gay rabbi to serve on the clergy of an Orthodox synagogue in the U.S.&quot;, explaining that Brick &quot;runs the youth program, leads Torah study for adults, and fills in when the senior rabbi is out of town&quot; at Beth Jacob Congregation in Oakland, California, where he started coming out as gay to members of the congregation over a year prior to October 2023. He was ordained by Yeshiva University.

===Ex-gay organizations===
JONAH was a Jewish ex-gay organization that focuses on &quot;prevention, intervention, and healing of the underlying issues causing same-sex attractions&quot;. In 2012, four former clients of JONAH sued the organization for fraud, claiming that it sold them therapies that were ineffective and counterproductive. Soon after in that same year, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), a professional association of more than 1,000 Orthodox rabbis around the world, sent an open email to its members that it no longer supported conversion therapy generally, or JONAH specifically. In 2015, a New Jersey jury found JONAH guilty of consumer fraud for promising to be able to change its clients&#x27; sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable. As part of the sentence, JONAH was required to cease all operations, but continues to operate under the name JIFGA .

===Other viewpoints===
Jiří Mordechai Langer, who studied in the Hasidic community of Belz, arrived in Palestine in 1940. &quot;His reconciliation of homosexuality and Judaism involved[...] a homosexual Jewish theology;[...] a sociology of Jewish homosexuality in Hasidism&quot;.

Haredi Rabbi Avigdor Miller defended the assassination of Harvey Milk, saying &quot;A decent gentile got up and shot him because of his spreading homosexuality&quot;.

The late UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote the foreword to Rabbi Chaim Rapoport&#x27;s book &quot;Judaism and Homosexuality: An Authentic Orthodox View&quot;. In the foreword, Rabbi Sacks has written: &quot;Compassion, sympathy, empathy, understanding – these are essential elements of Judaism. They are what homosexual Jews who care about Judaism need from us today.&quot;

Modern Orthodox leader Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein is reported to have said that the intensity of Orthodox community&#x27;s condemnation of homosexuality goes beyond what its status as a religious transgression warrants, and that he feels toward homosexual people &quot;criticism, disapproval, but tempered with an element of sympathy&quot;. Rabbi Steven Greenberg, for example, argues that there are many sins considered to be abominations in the Torah, homosexual men are disproportionately censured. While some Modern Orthodox congregations may still invite a person up for an aliyah who is known not to keep kosher, the same is not always true of a man known to engage in same-sex sexual activity.

In both the United States and in Israel several groups have sprung up in the last few years that seek to support those who identify as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBTQ children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women&#x27;s group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod (&quot;Majesty&quot;). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBTQ people with whom to share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.

Orthodox Rabbis Shmuley Boteach and Zev Farber have questioned the opposition of Orthodox groups to government recognition of same-sex civil marriages (or in Boteach&#x27;s case, to state-sanctioned civil unions), arguing that although Judaism does not condone homosexuality, governments should not enforce any particular religion&#x27;s view of marriage, and that conferring civil benefits to committed homosexual couples should be viewed as promoting family values.

In October 2010, Boteach wrote an op-ed column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on homosexuality, arguing that he does not deny that there is a biblical prohibition on male same-sex relationships and a commandment for men and women to marry and have children. Still, he understands those in context. &quot;There are 613 commandments in the Torah... So when Jewish gay couples tell me they have never been attracted to members of the opposite sex and are desperate alone, I tell them &quot;You have 611 commandments left. That should keep you busy. Now, go create a kosher home[...] you are His beloved children.&quot; Five years later he wrote that he believed in the equality of all of God&#x27;s children, and has seen too much homophobia in his life. He believes that the biggest threat to marriage does not come from gay marriage, but heterosexual divorce, which he says afflicts half of marriages. He opposes government involvement at all in recognizing marriage, but supports state-sanctioned &quot;civil unions&quot; for all. Open Orthodox Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.

In November 2016, dozens of LGBT activists protested in Jerusalem against comments reportedly made by the city&#x27;s chief rabbi Rabbi Shlomo Amar, who reportedly told an Israeli newspaper that gay people were an &quot;abomination&quot;, and homosexuality a &quot;cult&quot;.

In 2017, the Senior Rabbi of the Spanish &amp; Portuguese Sephardi Community Joseph Dweck gave a class describing &quot;the entire revolution of feminism and even homosexuality in our society[...] is a fantastic development for humanity&quot;. These words were condemned by Rabbi Aaron Bassous as &quot;false and misguided[...] corrupt from beginning to end&quot;. This affair caused Dweck to step down from the Sephardic Beth Din but not as a communal leader.

In 2019, Rabbi Daniel Landes wrote, &quot;Leviticus 18:22[...] has not been erased from the Torah. But that biblical commandment does not give us license to ignore or abuse the significant number of carefully observant Jews who are LGBTQ.&quot;

Film documentaries made about Orthodox homosexuals in recent years include &quot;Trembling Before G-d&quot;, &quot;Keep Not Silent&quot;, and &quot;Say Amen&quot;.

==Conservative Judaism==

As a matter of both Jewish law and institutional policy, Conservative (&quot;Masorti&quot;) Judaism has wrestled with homosexuality issues since the 1980s.

Conservative Jewish writer Herschell Matt initially argued that homosexuals may be excused because Judaism does recognise &#x27;constraint&#x27; as a valid excuse to disobey the law. However, Matt later shifted to outright support for homosexuality, viewing it as part of the natural order. Conservative Rabbi Robert Kirshchner states that Jews have historically adapted their laws to new circumstances, indicating accommodation for homosexuality.
In Conservative Judaism, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly makes the movement&#x27;s decisions concerning Jewish law. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement.

In 2006, the CJLS shifted its position and paved the way for significant changes regarding the Conservative movement&#x27;s policies toward homosexuality. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three distinct responsa reflecting very different approaches to the subject. One responsum substantially liberalized Conservative Judaism&#x27;s approach including lifting most (but not all) classical prohibitions on homosexual conduct and permitted the blessing of homosexual unions and the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. Two others completely retained traditional prohibitions. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, the adoption of multiple opinions permits individual Conservative rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to select which opinion to accept, and hence to choose individually whether to maintain a traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct or to permit openly gay/lesbian/bisexual unions and clergy.

The liberalizing responsum, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 of 25 votes, was authored by Rabbis Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. It lifted most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opened the way to the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbis and cantors and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopped short of religiously recognizing same-sex marriage. The responsum invoked the Talmudic principle of &quot;kavod habriyot&quot;, which the authors translated as &quot;human dignity&quot;, as authority for this approach. The responsum maintained a prohibition on male-male anal sex, which it described as the sole Biblically prohibited homosexual act. This act remains a &quot;yehareg ve&#x27;al ya&#x27;avor&quot; (&quot;die rather than transgress&quot; offense) under the decision.

Two traditionalist responsa were adopted. A responsum by Rabbi Joel Roth, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 votes, reaffirmed a general complete prohibition on homosexual conduct. A second responsum by Rabbi Leonard Levy, adopted as a minority opinion by 6 votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.

The Committee rejected the third paper by Gordon Tucker which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual sexual practices.

The consequences of the decision have been mixed. On the one hand, four members of the Committee—Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Joseph Prouser—resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change. On the other hand, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it will immediately begin admitting gay/lesbian/bisexual students as soon as the law committee passes a policy that sanctions such ordination. On March 26, 2007, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay/lesbian/bisexual candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program.

In June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13–0 vote. In 2021, two Conservative Rabbis became the first known example of two Rabbis of the same sex marrying each other.

Although the American example was initially an outlier in the global Conservative movement, it is now the case that &quot;all Masorti seminaries, except for the one in
Argentina, now accept openly gay students&quot;. Since 2014 in the United Kingdom the Masorti movement offers a &quot;Shutafut&quot; (&quot;partnership&quot;) ceremony to same-gender couples wishing to marry in a Conservative religious ceremony. The &quot;Shutafut&quot; contains many of the iconic elements of a traditional Jewish wedding service - the &quot;chupah&quot;, the seven blessings, the wine, the glass breaking, but without the symbolic act of acquisition in a traditional Jewish wedding.

In Israel, the head of the Masorti&#x27;s Vaad Halakha (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi David Golinkin, wrote to the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct. Despite the contention within the Israeli movement however in the same year, Israel&#x27;s Schechter Rabbinical Seminary sanctioned the training of openly gay Rabbis.

Hungary&#x27;s Neolog movement - distinct from but seen as a fraternal counterpart and in some ways spiritual ancestor of the modern Masorti movement - has been more divided. Although not embracing and providing for same-gender marriage or full inclusion in Jewish life, Mazsihisz, the main representative umbrella body for Neolog Judaism, has affirmed its opposition to exclusion by homophobia and in 2013 dismissed the director of its youth movement for making comments about excluding gay people from all religious life for their sexual orientation. In 2021 the President of Mazsihisz was made to apologise for signing a &quot;Joint Declaration of the Churches on the Holiness of Marriage&quot; that held &quot;the sanctification of the woman-man relationship by marriage is the foundation of human dignity&quot;. His critics included Mazsihisz&#x27;s Chief Rabbi and earlier that same year the movement made a statement widely seen as condemning new Hungarian laws limiting the exposure of children to content referencing homosexuality.

Rabbi Bradley Artson, Dean of the Rabbinic School at American Jewish University, claims to have studied every reference he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers. Every citation he found described an encounter between males where one party, the master, physically abused another, the slave. Rabbi Artson could not find a single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. &quot;Homosexual relationships today&quot;, Rabbi Artson says, &quot;should not be compared to the ancient world. I know too many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships. I know too many same-sex couples that are loving parents raising good descent ethical children. Who&#x27;s to say their family relationships are less sanctified in the eyes of God than mine is with my wife and our children?&quot;

==Reform Judaism==
The Reform Judaism movement, the largest branch of Judaism in North America, has rejected the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, they do not prohibit the ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations, rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in light of what is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.

In 1972, Beth Chayim Chadashim, the world&#x27;s first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, was established in West Los Angeles, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.

In 1977, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), which is the Union for Reform Judaism&#x27;s principal body, adopted a resolution calling for legislation decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults, and calling for an end to discrimination against gays and lesbians. The resolution called on Reform Jewish organizations to develop programs to implement this stand.

Reform rabbi Lionel Blue was the first British rabbi to publicly declare himself as gay, which he did in 1980.

In the late 1980s, the primary seminary of the Reform movement, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, changed its admission requirements to allow openly gay and lesbian people to join the student body.

In 1990, the Union for Reform Judaism announced a national policy declaring lesbian and gay Jews to be full and equal members of the religious community. Also in 1990, the CCAR officially endorsed a report of their own Ad Hoc Committee on Homosexuality and the Rabbinate. This position paper urged that &quot;all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation that they have chosen&quot;. The committee endorsed the view that &quot;all Jews are religiously equal, regardless of their sexual orientation&quot;.

In 1995, Reform Rabbi Margaret Wenig&#x27;s essay &quot;Truly Welcoming Lesbian and Gay Jews&quot; was published in &quot;The Jewish Condition: Essays on Contemporary Judaism Honoring [Reform] Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler&quot;; it was the first published argument to the Jewish community on behalf of civil marriage for gay couples.

In 1996, the CCAR passed a resolution approving the same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:

:However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle—we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a &quot;marriage&quot; within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.

:The Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and

:That the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.

:That this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.

In 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on Human Sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage &quot;may be present in committed same-gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community&quot;. The report called for the CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy &quot;teshuvah&quot; (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.

In March 2000, the CCAR issued a new resolution stating that &quot;We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same-gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.&quot;

Also in 2000, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion established the Institute for Judaism, Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender Identity to &quot;educate HUC-JIR students on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues to help them challenge and eliminate homophobia and heterosexism; and to learn tools to be able to transform the communities they encounter into ones that are inclusive and welcoming of LGBT Jews&quot;. It is the first and only institute of its kind in the Jewish world.

In 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, &quot;Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities&quot;.

Also in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the bisexual and transgender communities, and saying, &quot;Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and
Calls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Siddur Sha&#x27;ar Zahav&quot;, a prayer book written to address the lives and needs of LGBTQ as well as heterosexual and cisgender Jews, was published.

In 2014, the CCAR joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage, which is America&#x27;s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.

In 2015, Rabbi Denise Eger became the first openly gay president of the CCAR.

Also in 2015, the High Holy Days Reform Jewish prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T&#x27;filah. Mishkan HaNefesh can be translated as &quot;sanctuary of the soul&quot;. It replaces a line from the Reform movement&#x27;s earlier prayerbook, &quot;Gates of Repentance&quot;, that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line &quot;rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]&quot;, and adds a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering &quot;mibeit&quot;, Hebrew for &quot;from the house of&quot;, in addition to the traditional &quot;son of&quot; or &quot;daughter of&quot;. The Mishkan HaNefesh includes several sets of translations for the traditional prayers. Psalm 23 includes the familiar &quot;traditional&quot; translation, an adaptation that is considered &quot;gender-sensitive&quot; but remains faithful to the traditional version, a feminist adaption from Phyllis Appell Bass, and the fourth was published in 1978 by a contemporary rabbi.

==Reconstructionist Judaism==
The Reconstructionist movement sees homosexuality and bisexuality as normal expressions of sexuality and welcomes gays, bisexuals, and lesbians into Reconstructionist communities to participate fully in every aspect of community life. Since 1985, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College has admitted openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates to their rabbinical and cantorial programs. In 1993, a movement Commission issued: &quot;Homosexuality and Judaism: The Reconstructionist Position&quot;. The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages/commitment ceremonies, though the RRA does not require its members to officiate at them. In 2007, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Toba Spitzer, the first openly LGBT person chosen to head a rabbinical association in the United States. In 2011 Sandra Lawson became the first openly homosexual African-American and first African-American admitted to the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College; she was ordained in June 2018, which made her the first openly homosexual, female, black rabbi in the world. In 2013, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Jason Klein, the first openly gay man chosen to head a national rabbinical association of one of the major Jewish denominations in the United States. Also in 2013, Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.

==Jewish Renewal==
Jewish Renewal is a recent movement in Judaism which endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with Kabbalistic, Hasidic, musical and meditative practices; it describes itself as &quot;a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism&#x27;s prophetic and mystical traditions&quot;. The Jewish Renewal movement ordains people of all sexual orientations as rabbis and cantors. In 2005, Eli Cohen became the first openly gay rabbi ordained by the Jewish Renewal Movement, followed by Chaya Gusfield and Rabbi Lori Klein in 2006, who became the two first openly lesbian rabbis ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2007, Jalda Rebling, born in Amsterdam and now living in Germany, became the first openly lesbian cantor ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2011, the bisexual rights activist Debra Kolodny was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Renewal movement and hired as the rabbi for congregation P&#x27;nai Or of Portland. The Statement of Principles of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal (and OHALAH and the Rabbinic Pastors Association) states in part, &quot;We welcome and recognize the sanctity of every individual regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We recognize respectful and mutual expressions of adult human sexuality as potentially sacred expressions of love, and therefore, we strive to welcome a variety of constellations of intimate relationships and family forms including gay, lesbian, and heterosexual relationships as well as people choosing to be single.&quot;

==Humanistic Judaism==
Humanistic Judaism is a movement in Judaism that offers a non-theistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. In 2004, the Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a resolution supporting &quot;the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex&quot;, and affirming &quot;the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof&quot;. In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying. The Association of Humanistic Rabbis has also issued a pro-LGBT statement titled &quot;In Support of Diverse Sexualities and Gender Identities&quot;. It was adopted in 2003 and issued in 2004.

==LGBT-affirmative activities==
Jewish LGBT rights advocates and sympathetic clergy have created various institutions within Jewish life to accommodate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender parishioners. Beth Chayim Chadashim, established in 1972 in West Los Angeles, was the world&#x27;s first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines, including Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York City, Bet Mishpachah in Washington, D.C., and Congregation Or Chadash in Chicago. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.

LGBT-inclusive services and ceremonies specific to Jewish religious culture have also been created, ranging from LGBT-affirmative haggadot for Passover to a &quot;Stonewall Shabbat Seder&quot;.

In October 2012 Rainbow Jews, an oral history project showcasing the lives of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until the present, was launched. It is the United Kingdom&#x27;s first archive of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender history.

The ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives has, among other things, the Twice Blessed Collection, circa 1966-2000; this collection &quot;consists of materials documenting the Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender experience, circa 1966-2000, collected by the Jewish Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Archives, founded and operated by Johnny Abush&quot;.

Recent research by the sociocultural psychologist, Chana Etengoff, has highlighted the therapeutic benefits of LGBTQ petitions to religious leaders, including meaning-making, social action, agency and empowerment.

<doc id="16187" wikidata="Q131805" url="?curid=16187" title="John Dewey">
<text>John Dewey (; October 20, 1859 – June 1, 1952) was an American philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer. He was one of the most prominent American scholars in the first half of the twentieth century.

The overriding theme of Dewey&#x27;s works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, &quot;Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous.&quot; Dewey considered two fundamental elements—schools and civil society—to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. He asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed public opinion, accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians.

Dewey was one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of pragmatism and is considered one of the founding thinkers of functional psychology. His paper &quot;The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology&quot;, published in 1896, is regarded as the first major work in the (Chicago) functionalist school of psychology. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd-most-cited psychologist of the 20th century.

Dewey was also a major educational reformer for the 20th century. A well-known public intellectual, he was a major voice of progressive education and liberalism. While a professor at the University of Chicago, he founded the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to apply and test his progressive ideas on pedagogical method. Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, art, logic, social theory, and ethics.

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===
John Dewey was born in Burlington, Vermont, to a family of modest means. He was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey. Their first son was also named John, but he died in an accident on January 17, 1859. The second John Dewey was born October 20, 1859, forty weeks after the death of his older brother. Like his older, surviving brother, Davis Rich Dewey, he attended the University of Vermont, where he was initiated into Delta Psi, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1879.

A significant professor of Dewey&#x27;s at the University of Vermont was Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey (H. A. P. Torrey), the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president Joseph Torrey. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at Johns Hopkins University.

=== Career ===

After two years as a high-school teacher in Oil City, Pennsylvania, and one year as an elementary school teacher in the small town of Charlotte, Vermont, Dewey decided that he was unsuited for teaching primary or secondary school. After studying with George Sylvester Morris, Charles Sanders Peirce, Herbert Baxter Adams, and G. Stanley Hall, Dewey received his Ph.D. from the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Michigan (1884–88 and 1889–94) with the help of George Sylvester Morris. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled &quot;The Psychology of Kant&quot;.

In 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded University of Chicago (1894–1904) where he developed his belief in Rational Empiricism, becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled &quot;Thought and its Subject-Matter&quot;, which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title &quot;Studies in Logical Theory&quot; (1904).

During that time Dewey also initiated the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, &quot;The School and Society&quot; (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the university, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the American Psychological Association (A.P.A.). From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at Teachers College at Columbia University and influenced Carl Rogers.

In 1905 he became president of the American Philosophical Association. He was a longtime member of the American Federation of Teachers. Along with the historians Charles A. Beard and James Harvey Robinson, and the economist Thorstein Veblen, Dewey is one of the founders of The New School.

Dewey published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books. His most significant writings were &quot;The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology&quot; (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; &quot;Human Nature and Conduct&quot; (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior; &quot;The Public and its Problems&quot; (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to Walter Lippmann&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom Public&quot; (1925); &quot;Experience and Nature&quot; (1925), Dewey&#x27;s most &quot;metaphysical&quot; statement; &quot;Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World&quot; (1929), a glowing travelogue from the nascent USSR.

&quot;Art as Experience&quot; (1934), was Dewey&#x27;s major work on aesthetics; &quot;A Common Faith&quot; (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the Dwight H. Terry Lectureship at Yale; &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot; (1938), a statement of Dewey&#x27;s unusual conception of logic; &quot;Freedom and Culture&quot; (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and &quot;Knowing and the Known&quot; (1949), a book written in conjunction with Arthur F. Bentley that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works (see Transactionalism).

While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in &quot;Experience and Nature&quot;. However, dissatisfied with the response to the first (1925) edition, for the second (1929) edition he rewrote the first chapter and added a Preface in which he stated that the book presented what was later called a new (Kuhnian) paradigm: &quot;&#x27;I have not striven in this volume for a reconciliation between the new and the old&#x27; [E&amp;N:4]&quot; &quot;.&quot; and he asserts Kuhnian incommensurability:

&quot;&#x27;To many the associating of the two words [&#x27;experience&#x27; and &#x27;nature&#x27;] will seem like talking of a round square&#x27; but &#x27;I know of no route by which dialectical argument can answer such objections. They arise from association with words and cannot be dealt with argumentatively&#x27;.&quot; The following can be interpreted now as describing a Kuhnian conversion process: &quot;&#x27;One can only hope in the course of the whole discussion to disclose the [new] meanings which are attached to &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;nature,&quot; and thus insensibly produce, if one is fortunate, a change in the significations previously attached to them&#x27; [all E&amp;N:10].&quot;

Reflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, Hilda Neatby wrote &quot;Dewey has been to our age what Aristotle was to the later Middle Ages, not a philosopher, but &quot;the&quot; philosopher.&quot;

=== Visits to China and Japan ===

In 1919, Dewey and his wife traveled to Japan on sabbatical leave. Though Dewey and his wife were well received by the people of Japan during this trip, Dewey was also critical of the nation&#x27;s governing system and claimed that the nation&#x27;s path towards democracy was &quot;ambitious but weak in many respects in which her competitors are strong&quot;. He also warned that &quot;the real test has not yet come. But if the nominally democratic world should go back on the professions so profusely uttered during war days, the shock will be enormous, and bureaucracy and militarism might come back.&quot;

During his trip to Japan, Dewey was invited by Peking University to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin. Dewey and his wife Alice arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919, just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German-held territories in Shandong province to Japan. Their demonstrations on May Fourth excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.
In these two years, Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of Bolshevism to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China&#x27;s transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shih. For these audiences, Dewey represented &quot;Mr. Democracy&quot; and &quot;Mr. Science,&quot; the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as &quot;the American Confucius&quot;. His lectures were lost at the time but have been rediscovered and published in 2015. Dewey&#x27;s lecture on &quot;Three Contemporary Philosophers: Bertrand Russell, Henri Bergson and William James&quot; at Peking University in 1919 was attended by a young Mao Zedong.

Zhixin Su states: 
:Dewey was, for those Chinese educators who had studied under him, the great apostle of philosophic liberalism and experimental methodology, the advocate of complete freedom of thought, and the man who, above all other teachers, equated education to the practical problems of civic cooperation and useful living.
Dewey urged the Chinese to not import any Western educational model. He recommended to educators such as Tao Xingzhi, that they use pragmatism to devise their own model school system at the national level. However, the national government was weak, and the provinces largely controlled by warlords, so his suggestions were praised at the national level but not implemented. However, there were a few implementations locally. Dewey&#x27;s ideas did have influence in Hong Kong, and in Taiwan after the nationalist government fled there. In most of China, Confucian scholars controlled the local educational system before 1949 and they simply ignored Dewey and Western ideas. In Marxist and Maoist China, Dewey&#x27;s ideas were systematically denounced.

=== Visit to Southern Africa ===
Dewey and his daughter Jane went to South Africa in July 1934, at the invitation of the World Conference of New Education Fellowship in Cape Town and Johannesburg, where he delivered several talks. The conference was opened by the South African Minister of Education Jan Hofmeyr, and Deputy Prime Minister Jan Smuts. Other speakers at the conference included Max Eiselen and Hendrik Verwoerd, who later became prime minister of the Nationalist government that introduced apartheid.

Dewey&#x27;s expenses were paid by the Carnegie Foundation. He also traveled to Durban, Pretoria and Victoria Falls in what was then Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and looked at schools, talked to pupils, and gave lectures to the administrators and teachers. In August 1934, Dewey accepted an honorary degree from the University of the Witwatersrand. The white-only governments rejected Dewey&#x27;s ideas as too secular. However black people and their white supporters were more receptive.

=== Personal life ===
Dewey married Alice Chipman in 1886 shortly after Chipman graduated with her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. The two had six children: Frederick Archibald Dewey, Evelyn Riggs Dewey, Morris (who died young), Gordon Chipman Dewey, Lucy Alice Chipman Dewey, and Jane Mary Dewey. Alice Chipman died in 1927 at the age of 68; weakened by a case of malaria contracted during a trip to Turkey in 1924 and a heart attack during a trip to Mexico City in 1926, she died from cerebral thrombosis on July 13, 1927. Dewey married Estelle Roberta Lowitz Grant, &quot;a longtime friend and companion for several years before their marriage&quot; on December 11, 1946. At Roberta&#x27;s behest, the couple adopted two siblings, Lewis (changed to John Jr.) and Shirley.

Dewey&#x27;s interests and writings included many topics, and according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, &quot;a substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on current domestic and international politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes. (He is probably the only philosopher in this encyclopedia to have published both on the Treaty of Versailles and on the value of displaying art in post offices.)&quot;

In 1917, Dewey met F. M. Alexander in New York City and later wrote introductions to Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Supreme Inheritance&quot; (1918), &quot;Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Use of the Self&quot; (1932). Alexander&#x27;s influence is referenced in &quot;Human Nature and Conduct&quot; and &quot;Experience and Nature.&quot; As well as his contacts with people mentioned elsewhere in the article, he also maintained correspondence with Henri Bergson, William M. Brown, Martin Buber, George S. Counts, William Rainey Harper, Sidney Hook, and George Santayana.

=== Death ===
John Dewey died of pneumonia on June 1, 1952, at his home in New York City after years of ill-health and was cremated the next day.

==Functional psychology==
At the University of Michigan, Dewey published his first two books, &quot;Psychology&quot; (1887), and &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding&quot; (1888), both of which expressed Dewey&#x27;s early commitment to British neo-Hegelianism. In &quot;Psychology&quot;, Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.

While still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, James Hayden Tufts and George Herbert Mead, together with his student James Rowland Angell, all influenced strongly by the recent publication of William James&#x27; &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot; (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of Wilhelm Wundt and his followers.

By 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he later wrote &quot;Ethics&quot; (1908) at the recently founded University of Chicago and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called &quot;Chicago group&quot; of psychology.

Their new style of psychology, later dubbed functional psychology, had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey&#x27;s article &quot;The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology&quot; which appeared in &quot;Psychological Review&quot; in 1896, he reasons against the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc in favor of a &quot;circular&quot; account in which what serves as &quot;stimulus&quot; and what as &quot;response&quot; depends on how one considers the situation and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.

Dewey was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.

Dewey also expressed interest in work in the psychology of visual perception performed by Dartmouth research professor Adelbert Ames Jr. He had great trouble with listening, however, because it is known Dewey could not distinguish musical pitches—in other words was an amusic.

=== Education and teacher education ===

Dewey&#x27;s educational theories were presented in &quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot; (1897), &quot;The Primary-Education Fetich&quot; (1898), &quot;The School and Society&quot; (1900), &quot;The Child and the Curriculum&quot; (1902), &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916), &quot;Schools of To-morrow&quot; (1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and &quot;Experience and Education&quot; (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.

The ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey&#x27;s writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one&#x27;s full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that &quot;to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities&quot; (&quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot;, Dewey, 1897).

In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that &quot;education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction&quot;.

In addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In &quot;The Child and the Curriculum&quot; (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, &quot;the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened&quot; (1902, p. 13). He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.

At the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the &quot;child-centered&quot; excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, &quot;we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning&quot; (Dewey, 1902, pp. 13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.

In order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that &quot;the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction&quot; (Dewey, 1902, p. 16).

It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of hands-on learning or experiential education, which is related to, but not synonymous with experiential learning. He argued that &quot;if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind&quot; (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp. 217–18). Dewey&#x27;s ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. Problem-Based Learning (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey&#x27;s ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.

Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. Throughout the history of American schooling, education&#x27;s purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools that attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce.
In &quot;The School and Society&quot; (Dewey, 1899) and &quot;Democracy of Education&quot; (Dewey, 1916), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1899; 1916).

For Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. For Dewey, &quot;The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education&quot; (Dewey, 1904, p. 18).

Dewey&#x27;s qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which &quot;work automatically, unconsciously&quot; (Dewey, 1904, p. 15). Turning to Dewey&#x27;s essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.

==== Professionalization of teaching as a social service ====
For many, education&#x27;s purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress.

As Dewey notes, &quot;The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. Skill, the ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skills needed in contemporary life. If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in the production of character.&quot;(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).

According to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is &quot;impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now&quot; (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p. 25). However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill, and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a &quot;lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill, and character&quot; (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p. 242) of the nation&#x27;s workforce.

As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economic civilization awaits them. According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill, and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.

==== A teacher&#x27;s knowledge ====

Dewey believed that successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one&#x27;s ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. &quot;No one,&quot; according to Dewey, &quot;can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [their] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [their] entire career&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 34).

According to Dewey, it is not that the &quot;teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,&quot; rather, &quot;a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35). The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.

In addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher &quot;is possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils&quot; (Dewey, PST, 2010, p. 37). For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g., the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 &amp; Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. As Dewey notes, &quot;this further study is not a sideline but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 34).

According to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one&#x27;s knowledge with others. &quot;There are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. To the &#x27;natural born&#x27; teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35). For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.

==== A teacher&#x27;s skill ====
The best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses his or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). As Dewey notes, &quot;I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. The explanation is simple. They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 36).

Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind-to-mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.

==== A teacher&#x27;s disposition ====
As a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities that the teacher brings to the classroom. As Dewey notes, &quot;no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency&quot; (Dewey, TLS, p. 25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.

According to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, they know that their career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours, and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome their genuine love and sympathy for their students.

For Dewey, &quot;One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of careworn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions&quot; (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35).

It is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on them because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.

==== The role of teacher education to cultivate the professional classroom teacher ====
Dewey&#x27;s passions for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which &quot;work automatically, unconsciously&quot; (Dewey, 1904, p. 15). According to Dewey, teacher-education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g., creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday schoolwork with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010).

As Dewey notes, &quot;The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. But later &#x27;progress&#x27; may consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers&#x27; journals, attending teachers&#x27; institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life&quot; (Dewey, 1904, p. 15).

For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing oneself in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.

As Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010).

As Dewey notes, &quot;An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility&quot; (Dewey, PST, 2010, p. 39). For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.

As well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (1896) and The New School for Social Research (1919), many of Dewey&#x27;s ideas influenced the founding of Bennington College and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the board of trustees. Dewey&#x27;s works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived Black Mountain College in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included Buckminster Fuller, Willem de Kooning, Charles Olson, Franz Kline, Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and Paul Goodman, among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the &quot;Black Mountain Poets&quot; a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance.

=== Journalism ===

Dewey&#x27;s definition of &quot;public,&quot; as described in &quot;The Public and its Problems&quot;, has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. &quot;The &#x27;public&#x27; of public journalists is Dewey&#x27;s public.&quot; 

Dewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem.Since every action generates unintended consequences, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.

In &quot;The Public and its Problems&quot;, Dewey presents a rebuttal to Walter Lippmann&#x27;s treatise on the role of journalism in democracy. Lippmann&#x27;s model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news. In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.

Dewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine. The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.
Dewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and conditions, in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge. Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge. The &quot;audience&quot; would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it. Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in &quot;The Public and Its Problems&quot;: &quot;Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse. Communication can alone create a great community&quot; (Dewey, p. 142).

Dewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. &quot;The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy.&quot; (&quot;The Public and its Problems&quot;, p. 149). This Great Community can only occur with &quot;free and full intercommunication.&quot; (p. 211) Communication can be understood as journalism.

=== Logic and method ===
Dewey sees paradox in contemporary logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?

Logical positivism also figured in Dewey&#x27;s thought. About the movement he wrote that it &quot;eschews the use of &#x27;propositions&#x27; and &#x27;terms&#x27;, substituting &#x27;sentences&#x27; and &#x27;words&#x27;.&quot; (&quot;General Theory of Propositions&quot;, in &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot;) He welcomes this changing of referents &quot;in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions.&quot; However, he registers a small complaint against the use of &quot;sentence&quot; and &quot;words&quot; in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition &quot;narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences.&quot; In other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or &quot;adjudged only by means of context.&quot;

Yet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends; indeed, the deficiencies in traditional logic he expressed hope for the trends to solve occupies the whole first part of same book. Concerning traditional logic, he states there:

==== Critical thinking ====

Dewey was pivotal in advancing the philosophy of education by emphasizing the role of experience and active problem-solving in cultivating critical thinking. In &quot;How We Think&quot;, Dewey describes reflective thinking as an &quot;active, persistent, and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it and the further conclusions to which it tends.” Thinking is not merely the passive absorption of facts but an active, dynamic process that involves questioning, analyzing, and transforming experiences into meaningful conclusions. Dewey’s approach transformed traditional education by advocating for an interactive classroom environment. His contributions laid the groundwork for modern pedagogical methods that not only focus on the acquisition of factual knowledge but also foster the development of independent thought, creativity, and a deeper understanding of how to apply learning in everyday life.

Many authors thus regard Dewey as a key figure in affirming the importance of critical thinking in education. Dewey did use the term &quot;critical thinking&quot; in the first edition of his book &quot;How We Think&quot;, but the term did not originate with Dewey.

==== Aesthetics ====

&quot;Art as Experience&quot; (1934) is Dewey&#x27;s major writing on aesthetics.

It is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by Albert C. Barnes at the Barnes Foundation, whose own ideas on the application of art to one&#x27;s way of life was influenced by Dewey&#x27;s writing. Dewey made art through writing poetry, but he considered himself deeply unmusical: one of his students described Dewey as &quot;allergic to music.&quot; Barnes was particularly influenced by &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916) and then attended Dewey&#x27;s seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.

=== Philanthropy, women and democracy ===

Dewey founded the University of Chicago laboratory school, supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially Jane Addams&#x27; Hull House. John Dewey and Jane Addams influenced each other&#x27;s expansive theory of democracy.

Through his work at the Hull House serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women&#x27;s suffrage. Dewey experienced the lack of children&#x27;s education while contributing in the classroom at the Hull House. There he also experienced the lack of education and skills of immigrant women. Stengel argues:

His leading views on democracy included: 

First, Dewey believed that democracy is an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making ... Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society. 

This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.

Dewey believed that a woman&#x27;s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, &quot;You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won&#x27;t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn&#x27;t do&quot;. John Dewey&#x27;s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams&#x27; Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew as well as the support for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

As commonly argued by Dewey&#x27;s greatest critics, he was not able to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women&#x27;s suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. &quot;Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures&quot;. With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.

With respect to technological developments in a democracy:

His work on democracy influenced B. R. Ambedkar, one of his students, who later served as a Law and Justice Minister of India.

=== Religion ===

Historians have examined his religious beliefs. Biographer Steven Clark Rockefeller traced Dewey&#x27;s democratic convictions to his childhood attendance at the Congregational Church, with its strong proclamation of social ideals and the Social Gospel. Historian Edward A. White suggested in &quot;Science and Religion in American Thought&quot; (1952) that Dewey&#x27;s work led to the 20th-century rift between religion and science.

Dewey went through an &quot;evangelical&quot; development as a child. As an adult he was negative, or at most neutral, about theology in education. He instead took a meliorist position with the goal of scientific humanism and educational and social reform without recourse to religion.

As an atheist and a secular humanist in his later life, Dewey participated with a variety of humanistic activities from the 1930s into the 1950s, which included sitting on the advisory board of Charles Francis Potter&#x27;s First Humanist Society of New York (1929); being one of the original 34 signatories of the first &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; (1933) and being elected an honorary member of the Humanist Press Association (1936).

His opinion of humanism is summarized in his own words from an article titled &quot;What Humanism Means to Me&quot;, published in the June 1930 edition of &quot;Thinker 2&quot;:

=== Pragmatism, instrumentalism, consequentialism ===
Dewey sometimes referred to his philosophy as instrumentalism rather than pragmatism and would have recognized the similarity of these two schools to the newer school named consequentialism. In some phrases introducing a book he wrote later in life meant to help forestay a wandering kind of criticism of the work based on the controversies due to the differences in the schools that he sometimes invoked, he defined at the same time with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:

His concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in &quot;Knowing and the Known&quot; in 1949.

Dewey also regularly refers and discusses the definitions of pragmatism used by other philosophers within the movement such as Charles Pierce and William James when trying to pin down his own definitions in his &quot;Essays in Experimental Logic&quot;. Regarding Pierce he writes &quot;Mr. Pierce explained that he took the term &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; from Kant, in order to denote empirical consequences.&quot; Following this statement he also introduces James&#x27; usage of the term pragmatism when he writes &quot;what is important is that the consequences should be specific... When he [James] said that general notions must &#x27;cash in&#x27;, he meant of course that they must be translatable into verifiable specific things.

==== Epistemology ====

The terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley, to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation. In the order of chronological appearance, these are:
* Self-Action: Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused their actions.
* Interaction: as described by Newton, where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, the third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
* Transaction: where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with multiple aspects and phases of action without any attribution to ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

A series of characterizations of Transactions indicate the wide range of considerations involved.

==Social and political activism==
===1894 Pullman Strike===
While Dewey was at the University of Chicago, his letters to his wife Alice and his colleague Jane Addams reveal that he closely followed the 1894 Pullman Strike, in which the employees of the Pullman Palace Car Factory in Chicago decided to go on strike after industrialist George Pullman refused to lower rents in his company town after cutting his workers&#x27; wages by nearly 30 percent. On May 11, 1894, the strike became official, later gaining the support of the members of the American Railway Union, whose leader Eugene V. Debs called for a nationwide boycott of all trains including Pullman sleeping cars.

Considering most trains had Pullman cars, the main 24 lines out of Chicago were halted and the mail was stopped as the workers destroyed trains all over the United States. President Grover Cleveland used the mail as a justification to send in the National Guard, and ARU leader Eugene Debs was arrested.

Dewey wrote to Alice: &quot;The only wonder is that when the &#x27;higher classes&#x27; – damn them – take such views there aren&#x27;t more downright socialists. [...] [T]hat a representative journal of the upper classes – damn them again – can take the attitude of that harper&#x27;s weekly&quot;, referring to headlines such as &quot;Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Repress the Rebellion&quot;, which claimed, in Dewey&#x27;s words, to support the sensational belief that Debs was a &quot;criminal&quot; inspiring hate and violence in the equally &quot;criminal&quot; working classes. He concluded: &quot;It shows what it is to be a higher class. And I fear Chicago Univ. is a capitalistic institution – that is, it too belongs to the higher classes&quot;.

===Pro-war stance in First World War===
Dewey was an advocate of US participation in the First World War. For this he was criticised by Randolph Bourne, a former student whose essay &quot;Twilight of Idols&quot;, was published in the literary journal &quot;Seven Arts&quot; in October 1917. Bourne criticised Dewey&#x27;s instrumental pragmatist philosophy.

===International League for Academic Freedom===

As a major advocate of academic freedom, in 1935 Dewey, together with Albert Einstein and Alvin Johnson, became a member of the United States section of the International League for Academic Freedom, and in 1940, together with Horace Kallen, edited a series of articles related to the Bertrand Russell Case.

===Dewey Commission===
He directed the famous Dewey Commission held in Mexico in 1937, which cleared Leon Trotsky of the charges made against him by Joseph Stalin, and marched for women&#x27;s rights, among many other causes.

===League for Industrial Democracy===
In 1939, Dewey was elected President of the League for Industrial Democracy, an organization with the goal of educating college students about the labor movement. The Student Branch of the L.I.D. later became the Students for a Democratic Society.

As well as defending the independence of teachers and opposing a communist takeover of the New York Teachers&#x27; Union, Dewey was involved in the organization that eventually became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, sitting as an executive on the NAACP&#x27;s early executive board.
He was an avid supporter of Henry George&#x27;s proposal for taxing land values. Of George, he wrote, &quot;No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker.&quot; As honorary president of the Henry George School of Social Science, he wrote a letter to Henry Ford urging him to support the school.

<doc id="16188" wikidata="Q125525" url="?curid=16188" title="Jackal">
<text>Jackals are canids native to Africa and Eurasia. While the word &quot;&quot; has historically been used for many canines of the subtribe canina, in modern use it most commonly refers to three species: the closely related black-backed jackal (&quot;Lupulella mesomelas&quot;) and side-striped jackal (&quot;Lupulella adusta&quot;) of Central and Southern Africa, and the golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) of south-central Europe and Asia. The African golden wolf (&quot;Canis lupaster&quot;) was also formerly considered a jackal.

While they do not form a monophyletic clade, all jackals are opportunistic omnivores, predators of small to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers. Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals, birds, and reptiles, and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well-suited for long-distance running, capable of maintaining speeds of for extended periods of time. Jackals are crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk.

Their most common social unit is a monogamous pair, which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruders and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults, which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories. Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs, for example, to scavenge a carcass, but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;jackal&quot; dates back to 1600 and derives from the French , itself from Ottoman Turkish (), itself from Persian (&#x27;), from or cognate with Sanskrit (&#x27;) meaning &quot;the howler&quot;.

== Taxonomy and relationships ==
Similarities between jackals and coyotes led Lorenz Oken, in the third volume of his &quot;Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte&quot; (1815), to place these species into a new separate genus, &quot;Thos&quot;, named after the classical Greek word &quot;jackal&quot;, but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time. Angel Cabrera, in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of Morocco, questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of &quot;Canis&quot; could justify a subdivision of that genus. In practice, Cabrera chose the undivided-genus alternative and referred to the jackals as &quot;Canis&quot; instead of &quot;Thos&quot;.

Oken&#x27;s &quot;Thos&quot; theory was revived in 1914 by Edmund Heller, who embraced the separate genus theory. Heller&#x27;s names and the designations he gave to various jackal species and subspecies live on in current taxonomy, although the genus has been changed from &quot;Thos&quot; to &quot;Canis&quot;.

The wolf-like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related. They all have 78 chromosomes. The group includes genus &quot;Canis&quot;, &quot;Cuon&quot;, and &quot;Lycaon&quot;. The members are the dog &quot;(C. lupus familiaris)&quot;, gray wolf (&quot;C. lupus&quot;), coyote (&quot;C. latrans&quot;), golden jackal (&quot;C. aureus&quot;), Ethiopian wolf (&quot;C. simensis&quot;), black-backed jackal (&quot;C. mesomelas&quot;), side-striped jackal (&quot;C. adustus&quot;), dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), and African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;). The latest recognized member is the African wolf (&quot;C. lupaster&quot;), which was once thought to be an African branch of the golden jackal. As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; are karyologically indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog. The two African jackals are shown to be the most basal members of this clade, indicating the clade&#x27;s origin from Africa. &quot;Canis arnensis&quot; arrived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9 million years ago and is probably the ancestor of modern jackals.

The paraphyletic nature of &quot;Canis&quot; with respect to &quot;Lycaon&quot; and &quot;Cuon&quot; has led to suggestions that the two African jackals should be assigned to different genera, &quot;Schaeffia&quot; for the side-striped jackal and &quot;Lupulella&quot; for the black-backed jackal or &quot;Lupulella&quot; for both.

The intermediate size and shape of the Ethiopian wolf has at times led it to be regarded as a jackal, thus it has also been called the &quot;red jackal&quot; or the &quot;Simien jackal&quot;.
== Species ==
==Folklore and literature==
Like foxes and coyotes, jackals are often depicted as clever sorcerers in the myths and legends of their regions. They are mentioned roughly 14 times in the Bible. It is frequently used as a literary device to illustrate desolation, loneliness, and abandonment, with reference to its habit of living in the ruins of former cities and other areas abandoned by humans. It is called &quot;wild dog&quot; in several translations of the Bible. In the King James Bible, Isaiah 13:21 refers to &#x27;doleful creatures&#x27;, which some commentators suggest are either jackals or hyenas.

In the Indian &quot;Panchatantra&quot; stories, the jackal is mentioned as wily and wise. In Bengali tantrik tradition, they represent the goddess Kali. It is said she appears as jackals when meat is offered to her.

The Serer religion and creation myth posits jackals were among the first animals created by Roog, the supreme deity of the Serer people.

<doc id="16190" wikidata="Q6311333" url="?curid=16190" title="Jumping the broom">
<text>Jumping the broom (or jumping the besom) is a phrase and custom relating to a wedding ceremony in which the couple jumps over a broom. It is most widespread among African Americans and Black Canadians, popularized during the 1970s by the novel and miniseries &quot;&quot;, and originated in mid-19th-century antebellum slavery in the United States. The custom is also attested in Irish weddings.

Possibly based on an 18th-century idiomatic synonym for a sham marriage (a marriage of doubtful validity), it was popularized with the introduction of civil marriage in Britain by the Marriage Act 1836. The expression may also derive from the custom of jumping over a besom (&quot;broom&quot; refers to the plant from which the household implement is made) associated with the Romanichal Travellers of the United Kingdom, especially those in Wales.

==Euphemism for irregular marriage==
References to &quot;broomstick marriages&quot; emerged in England during the mid-to-late 18th century to describe a wedding ceremony of doubtful validity. The earliest use of the phrase is in the 1764 English edition of a French work. The French text, describing an elopement, refers to the runaway couple hastily embarking on &quot;un mariage sur la croix de l&#x27;épée&quot; (literally &quot;marriage on the cross of the sword&quot;); this was freely translated as &quot;performed the marriage ceremony by leaping over a broomstick&quot;.

A 1774 use in the &quot;Westminster Magazine&quot; also describes an elopement. A man brought his underage fiancée to France and discovered that it was as difficult to arrange a legal marriage there as in England, but declined a suggestion that a French sexton might simply read the marriage service before the couple because &quot;He had no inclination for a Broomstick-marriage&quot;. In 1789, the rumoured clandestine marriage between the Prince Regent and Maria Fitzherbert is cited in a satirical song in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;Their way to consummation was by hopping o&#x27;er a broom, sir&quot;.

Despite these allusions, research by legal historian Rebecca Probert of Warwick University has failed to find evidence of an actual contemporary practice of jumping over a broomstick as a sign of informal union. Probert says that the word &quot;broomstick&quot; was used in the mid-18th century in several contexts to mean &quot;something ersatz, or lacking the authority its true equivalent might possess&quot;; because the expression &quot;broomstick marriage&quot; (a sham marriage) was in circulation, folk etymology led to a belief that people once signified an irregular marriage by jumping over a broom. American historian Tyler D. Parry, however, contests the claim that no part of the British custom involved jumping. In his book, &quot;Jumping the Broom: The Surprising Multicultural Origins of a Black Wedding Ritual&quot;, Parry writes that African Americans and British Americans had a number of cultural exchanges during the 18th and 19th centuries. He describes correlations between the ceremonies of enslaved African Americans and those of the rural British, saying that it is not coincidental that two groups separated by an ocean used similar matrimonial forms revolving around a broomstick. If British practitioners never used a physical leap, Parry wonders how European-Americans and enslaved African Americans in the American South and rural North America learned about the custom.

Later examples of the term &quot;broomstick marriage&quot; were used in Britain, with the similar implication that the ceremony did not create a legally-binding union. This meaning survived into the early 19th century; during an 1824 case in London about the legal validity of a marriage ceremony consisting of the groom placing a ring on the bride&#x27;s finger before witnesses, a court official said that the ceremony &quot;amounted to nothing more than a broomstick marriage, which the parties had it in their power to dissolve at will.&quot;

The Marriage Act 1836, which introduced civil marriage, was contemptuously called the &quot;Broomstick Marriage Act&quot; by those who felt that a marriage outside the Anglican church did not deserve legal recognition. The phrase began to refer to non-marital unions; a man interviewed in Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; said, &quot;I never had a wife, but I have had two or three broomstick matches, though they never turned out happy.&quot; Tinkers reportedly had a similar marriage custom, &quot;jumping the budget&quot;, with the bride and groom jumping over a string or other symbolic obstacle.

Charles Dickens&#x27; novel, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (first published in serial form in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; from 1 December 1860 to August 1861), contains a reference in chapter 48 to a couple&#x27;s marriage &quot;over the broomstick.&quot; The ceremony is not described, but the reference indicates that readers would have recognized this as an informal (not legally valid) agreement.

Although it has been assumed that &quot;jumping (or, sometimes, &#x27;walking&#x27;) over the broom&quot; always indicated an irregular or non-church union in England (as in the expressions &quot;Married over the besom&quot; and &quot;living over the brush&quot;), examples of the phrase exist in the context of legal religious and civil weddings. Other sources cite stepping over a broom as a test of chastity, and putting out a broom was said to be a sign &quot;that the housewife&#x27;s place is vacant&quot; as a way of advertising for a wife. The phrase was also used colloquially in the US and Canada as a synonym for getting married legally.

==British Romani customs==
Romani couples in Wales would elope, when they would &quot;jump the broom&quot;, or jump over a branch of flowering common broom or a besom made of broom. Welsh Kale and Romanichals in England and Scotland practiced the ritual into the 1900s. According to Alan Dundes (1996), the custom originated among the Welsh Kale and English Romanichals.

C.W. Sullivan III (1997) replied to Dundes that the custom originated among the Welsh people, and was known as a &quot;priodas coes ysgub&quot; (&quot;besom wedding&quot;). Sullivan&#x27;s source is Welsh folklorist Gwenith Gwynn (also known as W. Rhys Jones), who assumed that the custom had existed on the basis of conversations with elderly Welsh people during the 1920s (none of whom, however, had seen it). One said, &quot;It must have disappeared before I was born, and I am seventy-three&quot;.
Gwynn&#x27;s dating of the custom to the 18th century rested on the assumption that it must have disappeared before the elderly interviewees were born, and on his misreading of the Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog parish baptismal register.
Local variations of the custom developed in portions of England and Wales. Instead of placing the broom on the ground and jumping together, the broom was placed at an angle by the doorway; the groom jumped first, followed by the bride. In southwest England, Wales and the border areas between Scotland and England, &quot;[while some] couples ... agreed to marry verbally, without exchanging legal contracts[,] ... [o]thers jumped over broomsticks placed across their thresholds to officialize their union and create new households&quot;; this indicated that contract-less weddings and jumping a broomstick were different kinds of marriage.

==African-American and Black-Canadian custom==

In some African-American and Black-Canadian communities, couples end their wedding ceremony by jumping over a broomstick together or separately. The practice is documented as a marriage ceremony for enslaved people in the Southern United States during the 1840s and 1850s, who were often not permitted to marry legally. Its revival in 20th-century African-American and Black-Canadian culture is due to the novel and miniseries &quot;&quot; (1976, 1977). Alan Dundes (1996) notes how &quot;a custom which slaves were &quot;forced&quot; to observe by their white masters has been revived a century later by African Americans as a treasured tradition&quot;.

It has been speculated that the custom may have originated in West Africa. Although there is no direct evidence of this, Dundes cites a Ghanaian custom of waving brooms over the heads of newlyweds and their parents. Among southern Africanswho were largely not a part of the Atlantic slave tradeit represented a wife&#x27;s commitment (or willingness) to clean the courtyard of her new home. Historian Tyler D. Parry, in &quot;Jumping the Broom: The Surprising Multicultural Origins of a Black Wedding Ritual&quot;, considers the Ghanaian connection weak; the ritual used by enslaved people has many more similarities to the custom in the British Isles. Parry writes that despite the racial animus which characterized the US South during the nineteenth century, poor white Southerners (many of whom were descendants of people who had irregular forms of matrimony in Britain) and enslaved African Americans had more cultural exchange than is commonly acknowledged.

Slaveholders had a dilemma about committed relationships between enslaved people. Although family stability might be desirable to keep enslaved people tractable and pacified, legal marriage was not; marriage gave a couple rights over each other which conflicted with slaveholderer claims. Most marriages between enslaved black people were not legally recognized during the American slavery era; marriage was a legal civil contract, and civil contracts required the consent of free persons. In the absence of legal recognition, the enslaved community developed its own methods of distinguishing committed unions from casual ones. The ceremonial jumping of the broom was an open declaration of settling down in a marriage relationship. Jumping the broom was done before witnesses as a public, ceremonial announcement that a couple chose to become as nearly married as was then allowed. There are records of African Americans jumping the broom in slave narratives. An ex-slave from Georgia, George Eason, said how enslaved people jumped the broom to get married.

Jumping the broom fell out of practice when Black people were free to marry legally. The practice survived in some communities, and the phrase &quot;jumping the broom&quot; was synonymous with &quot;getting married&quot; even if the couple did not literally do so. After its smaller-scale continuity in rural areas of the United States (in Black and white communities), the custom was revivied among African Americans after the publication of Alex Haley&#x27;s &quot;.&quot; Danita Rountree Green describes the African-American custom during the early 1990s in her book, &quot;Broom Jumping: A Celebration of Love&quot; (1992).

==In popular culture==
American singer-songwriter Brenda Lee released the rockabilly song &quot;Let&#x27;s Jump the Broomstick&quot; on Decca Records in 1959. Via its association with Wales and the association of the broom with witches, the custom has been adopted by some Wiccans. &quot;Jumping the Broom&quot;, a film starring Paula Patton and Laz Alonso and directed by Salim Akil, was released on 6 May 2011.

In the 1977 TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, Kunta Kinte/&quot;Toby&quot; (John Amos as the adult Kunta Kinte) had a marriage ceremony in which he and Belle (Madge Sinclair) jumped the broom. It also appears in episode two of the 2016 miniseries remake, when Kunta Kinte questions its African origins. An engaged couple jumps a broom in the 2016 film, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. Lance (Morris Chestnut) and Mia (Monica Calhoun) jump over the broom after they get married in &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1999).

In &quot;R &amp; B&quot;, an episode of &quot;This Is Us&quot;, Randal and Beth jump the broom while walking down the aisle after their wedding ceremony in a flashback. In &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, an episode of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Miranda Bailey and Ben Warren jump over a broom at the end of their wedding ceremony. In &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;, another episode of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Maggie Pierce and Winston Ndugu jump over a broom, finishing their wedding ceremony. Amani and Woody jump the broom at the end of their wedding in a 2020 episode of &quot;Married at First Sight&quot;. In the first act of August Wilson&#x27;s play, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;, Doaker says: &quot;See that? That&#x27;s when him and Mama Berniece got married. They called it jumping the broom. That&#x27;s how you got married in them days.&quot; Jarette and Iyanna jump the broom at the end of their wedding in a 2022 episode of &quot;Love Is Blind&quot;.

<doc id="16193" wikidata="Q221048" url="?curid=16193" title="Jackie Robinson">
<text>Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American professional baseball player who became the first African-American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the color line when he started at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947. The Dodgers signing Robinson heralded the end of racial segregation in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s.

Born in Cairo, Georgia, Robinson was raised in Pasadena, California. A four-sport student athlete at Pasadena Junior College and the University of California, Los Angeles, he was better known for football than he was for baseball, becoming a star college player with the UCLA Bruins football team. Following his college career, Robinson was drafted for service during World War II but was court-martialed for refusing to sit at the back of a segregated Army bus, eventually being honorably discharged. Afterwards, he signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues, where he caught the eye of Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who thought he would be the perfect candidate for breaking the color line in MLB.

During his 10-year MLB career, Robinson won the inaugural Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, was an All-Star for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954, and won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player Award in 1949—the first black player so honored. Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers&#x27; 1955 World Series championship. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 in his first year of eligibility.

Robinson&#x27;s character, his use of nonviolence, and his talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the civil rights movement. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o&#x27;Nuts. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. After his death in 1972, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his achievements on and off the field. In 1997, MLB retired his uniform number, 42, across all Major League teams; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored. MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, &quot;Jackie Robinson Day&quot;, for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every player on every team wears no. 42.

==Early life==
===Family and personal life===
Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (née McGriff) and Jerry Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed &quot;Mack&quot;), and Willa Mae. His middle name honored former President Theodore Roosevelt, who died 25 days before Robinson was born. After Robinson&#x27;s father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California.

The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson&#x27;s mother worked various odd jobs to support the family. Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities. As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.

===John Muir High School===
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir Technical High School. Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson&#x27;s older brothers, Frank and Mack (himself an accomplished track and field athlete and silver medalist behind Jesse Owens in the 200 meters at the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics) inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.

At Muir Tech, Robinson played numerous sports at the varsity level and lettered in four of them: football, basketball, track and field, and baseball. He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on the football team, and guard on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the broad jump. He was also a member of the tennis team.

In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon. In late January 1937, the &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot; newspaper reported that Robinson &quot;for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball, and tennis.&quot;

===Pasadena Junior College===
After Muir, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track. On the football team, he played quarterback and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke an American junior college broad-jump record held by his brother Mack with a jump of 25 ft. in. on May 7, 1938. As at Muir High School, most of Jackie&#x27;s teammates were white. While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military. In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

That year, Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school&#x27;s Order of the Mast and Dagger (&quot;Omicron Mu Delta&quot;), awarded to students performing &quot;outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition.&quot; Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.

An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson&#x27;s impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank&#x27;s family.

===UCLA and afterward===
After graduating from PJC in spring 1939, Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school&#x27;s first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.

He was one of four black players on the Bruins&#x27; 1939 football team; the others were Woody Strode, Kenny Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team&#x27;s four backfield players. At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football&#x27;s most They went undefeated with four ties at Robinson finished the season with 12.2 yards per attempt on 42 carries, which is the school football record for highest rushing yards per carry in a season as of 2022. Robinson also led the NCAA in punt return average in the 1939 and 1940 seasons.

In track and field, Robinson won the 1940 NCAA championship in the long jump at . Baseball was Robinson&#x27;s &quot;worst sport&quot; at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his first game he went 4-for-4 and twice stole home.

While a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, Rachel Isum (b.1922), a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson&#x27;s athletic career He played football as a senior, but the 1940 Bruins won only one game. In the spring, Robinson left college just shy of graduation, despite the reservations of his mother and Isum. He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government&#x27;s National Youth Administration (NYA) 

After the government ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu in the fall of 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, which drew the United States into World War II and ended Robinson&#x27;s nascent football career.

==Military career==
In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit at Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley.

Although the Army&#x27;s initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race-neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. The applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and with the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.

After receiving his commission, Robinson was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st &quot;Black Panthers&quot; Tank Battalion. While at Fort Hood, Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev. Karl Downs, President of Sam Huston College (now Huston–Tillotson University) in nearby Austin, Texas; in California, Downs had been Robinson&#x27;s pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC.

An event on July 6, 1944, derailed Robinson&#x27;s military career. While awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer&#x27;s wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to the back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed.

After Robinson&#x27;s commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.

By the time of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers.

Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson&#x27;s court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas, and he was never in combat.

After his acquittal, he was transferred to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944. While there, Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout. Robinson took the former player&#x27;s advice and wrote to Monarchs co-owner Thomas Baird.

==Post-military==
After his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Samuel Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school&#x27;s basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.

==Playing career==
===Negro leagues and major league prospects===
In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues. Robinson accepted a contract for $400 per month. Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues&#x27; disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him. The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now communicate only by letter. In all, Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases. He also appeared in the 1945 East–West All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.

During the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interests. No black man had played in the major leagues since Moses Fleetwood Walker in 1884, but the Boston Red Sox nevertheless held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore H. Y. Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets. He left the tryout humiliated, and more than 14 years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the final major league team to integrate its roster.

Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers&#x27; roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn&#x27;s International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson&#x27;s prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: &quot;Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?&quot; Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player &quot;with guts enough not to fight back.&quot; After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts not containing a reserve clause. Among those with whom Rickey discussed prospects was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, who, according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck, &quot;influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he&#x27;s never completely gotten credit.&quot;

Although he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945. On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season. On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals. In what was later referred to as &quot;The Noble Experiment&quot;, Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s. He was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues, and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first. Larry Doby, who broke the color line in the American League the same year as Robinson, said, &quot;One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons why Josh died so early—he was heartbroken.&quot;

Rickey&#x27;s offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena. That September, he signed with Chet Brewer&#x27;s Kansas City Royals, a post-season barnstorming team in the California Winter League. Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City. On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev. Karl Downs.

===Minor leagues===
In 1946, Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League. Clay Hopper, the manager of the Royals, asked Rickey to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate, but Rickey refused.

Robinson&#x27;s presence was controversial in racially segregated Florida. He was not allowed to stay with his white teammates at the team hotel, and instead lodged at the home of Joe and Dufferin Harris, a politically active African-American couple who introduced the Robinsons to civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility, scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers&#x27; organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach. In Jacksonville, the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day, by order of the city&#x27;s Parks and Public Property director. In DeLand, a scheduled day game was postponed, ostensibly because of issues with the stadium&#x27;s electrical lighting.

After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach&#x27;s City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team&#x27;s parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the &quot;de facto&quot; baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.

Later in spring training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base, allowing him to make shorter throws to first base. Robinson&#x27;s performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants&#x27; season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals&#x27; Jackie Robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs. Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played against him when they both lived in California. During Robinson&#x27;s first at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground out at his first at bat, Robinson ended up with four hits in his five at bats; his first hit was a three-run home run in the game&#x27;s third inning. He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals&#x27; 14–1 victory. Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 fielding percentage, and he was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example), the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson. Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson&#x27;s presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an astounding figure by International League standards. In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.

===Major leagues===
====Breaking the color barrier (1947)====

In 1947, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. Robinson made his debut as a Dodger wearing uniform number 42 on April 11, 1947, in a preseason exhibition game against the New York Yankees at Ebbets Field with 24,237 in attendance. On April 15, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers&#x27; 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1884 to openly break the major league baseball color line. Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.

Robinson&#x27;s promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, &quot;I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin&#x27; zebra. I&#x27;m the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What&#x27;s more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.&quot;

Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. According to a press report, the St. Louis Cardinals threatened to strike if Robinson played and spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was said to have been leaked by the Cardinals&#x27; team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;″s Rud Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland&#x27;s anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his &quot;Tribune&quot; colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After it was published, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. &quot;You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts,&quot; Frick was quoted as saying. &quot;I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don&#x27;t care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another.&quot; Woodward&#x27;s article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. The Cardinals players denied that they were planning to strike, and Woodward later told author Roger Kahn that Frick was his true source; writer Warren Corbett said that Frick&#x27;s speech &quot;never happened&quot;. Regardless, the report led to Robinson receiving increased support from the sports media. Even &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, a publication that had backed the color line, came out against the idea of a strike.

Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from Enos Slaughter. On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players and manager Ben Chapman called Robinson a &quot;nigger&quot; from their dugout and yelled that he should &quot;go back to the cotton fields&quot;. Rickey later recalled that Chapman &quot;did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers. When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty men.&quot;

However, Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players. Robinson named Lee &quot;Jeep&quot; Handley, who played for the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson&#x27;s defense with the famous line, &quot;You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them.&quot; In 1947 or 1948, Reese is said to have put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Boston or Cincinnati. A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, depicts Reese with his arm around Robinson. Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with ethnic epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he &quot;whispered a few words into Robinson&#x27;s ear&quot;, which Robinson later characterized as &quot;words of encouragement&quot;. Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games. Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to each other via telephone throughout the season.

Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the Dodgers, with a batting average of .297, an on-base percentage of .383, and a .427 slugging percentage. He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, and 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in sacrifice hits, with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29. His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).

That year, the Brooklyn Dodgers won the National League pennant and went on to face the Yankees in the 1947 World Series. Robinson became the first black player to play in the World Series. He appeared in all seven games, with the Dodgers ultimately losing in Game 7.

====MVP, Congressional testimony, and film biography (1948–1950)====
Following Stanky&#x27;s trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky). Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season. In a 12–7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he hit for the cycle—a home run, a triple, a double, and a single in the same game. The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the pennant and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series.

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 when a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Larry Doby (who broke the color barrier in the American League on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson. In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to $ today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a vaudeville tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate. In 1948, Wendell Smith&#x27;s book, &quot;Jackie Robinson: My Own Story&quot;, was released.

In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler&#x27;s suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that &quot;Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second&quot;. The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game — the first All-Star Game to include black players.

That year, a song about Robinson by Buddy Johnson, &quot;Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?&quot;, reached number 13 on the charts; Count Basie recorded a famous version. Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series.

Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the United States House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.

In 1950, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman with 133. His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000 ($ in dollars). He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 batting average, and 12 stolen bases. The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson&#x27;s life, &quot;The Jackie Robinson Story&quot;, in which Robinson played himself, and actress Ruby Dee played Rachel &quot;Rae&quot; (Isum) Robinson. The project had been previously delayed when the film&#x27;s producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Robinson, &quot;doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture&#x27;s leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner Walter O&#x27;Malley, who referred to Robinson as &quot;Rickey&#x27;s prima donna&quot;. In late 1950, Rickey&#x27;s contract as the Dodgers&#x27; team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O&#x27;Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O&#x27;Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, &quot;Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it.&quot;

====Pennant races and outside interests (1951–1953)====
Before the 1951 season, O&#x27;Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson&#x27;s playing career. O&#x27;Malley was quoted in the &quot;Montreal Standard&quot; as saying, &quot;Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post&quot;—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game and then hit a home run in the 14th inning, which proved to be the winning margin. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.

Despite Robinson&#x27;s regular-season heroics, on October 3, 1951, the Dodgers lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson&#x27;s famous home run, known as the Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson&#x27;s feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed &quot;how much of a competitor Robinson was.&quot; He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.

Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952. He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases. He did, however, record a career-high on-base percentage of .436. The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show &quot;Youth Wants to Know&quot;, Robinson challenged the Yankees&#x27; general manager, George Weiss, on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player. Sportswriter Dick Young, whom Robinson had described as a &quot;bigot&quot;, said, &quot;If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness.&quot; The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the outfield, with Jim Gilliam, another black player, taking over everyday second base duties. Robinson&#x27;s interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League, but according to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.

In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals, leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another World Series loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson&#x27;s continued success spawned a string of death threats. He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for &quot;Our Sports&quot; magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson&#x27;s old friend Joe Louis. Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis.

====World Championship and retirement (1954–1956)====
In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs scored, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles. The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson&#x27;s individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base. Robinson, then 36 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series. He missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base. That season, the Dodgers&#x27; Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.

In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs scored, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals. By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball. Robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end Game 7 of the 1956 World Series. After the season, the Dodgers traded Robinson to the arch-rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 cash (equal to $ today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock full o&#x27;Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company. Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to &quot;Look&quot; magazine two years previously, his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.

==Legacy==


Robinson&#x27;s major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman&#x27;s desegregation of the military in 1948. Robinson&#x27;s breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. said that he was &quot;a legend and a symbol in his own time&quot;, and that he &quot;challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.&quot; According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson&#x27;s &quot;efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ... [His] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone&#x27;s abilities.&quot;

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of 28, he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers. During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games. In 1999, he was one of 30 players named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Robinson&#x27;s career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post–&quot;long ball&quot; era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning. Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more walks than strikeouts (740 to 291). Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 (Minnie Miñoso was the other). He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total, including 19 steals of home. None of the latter were double steals (in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time). Robinson has been referred to by author David Falkner as &quot;the father of modern base-stealing&quot;.

Historical statistical analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position he played. After playing his rookie season at first base, Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman. He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951. Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.

Assessing himself, Robinson said, &quot;I&#x27;m not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being.&quot; Regarding Robinson&#x27;s qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, &quot;You want a guy that comes to play. But he didn&#x27;t just come to play. He came to beat you. He came to stuff the damn bat right up your ass.&quot;

==Post-baseball life==
Robinson once told future Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron that &quot;the game of baseball is great, but the greatest thing is what you do after your career is over.&quot; Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957. Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, he was diagnosed with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson&#x27;s physical condition from the disease.

In October 1959, Robinson entered the Greenville Municipal Airport&#x27;s whites-only waiting room. Airport police asked Robinson to leave, but he refused. At a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) speech in Greenville, South Carolina, Robinson urged &quot;complete freedom&quot; and encouraged black citizens to vote and to protest their second-class citizenship. The following January, approximately 1,000 people marched on New Year&#x27;s Day to the airport, which was desegregated shortly thereafter.

In his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, Robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on-field qualifications, rather than his cultural impact on the game. He was elected on the first ballot, becoming the first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum.

In 1965, Robinson served as an analyst for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Major League Baseball Game of the Week&quot; telecasts, the first black person to do so. In 1966, Robinson was hired as general manager for the short-lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football League. In 1972, he served as a part-time commentator on Montreal Expos telecasts.

From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was the vice president for personnel at Chock full o&#x27;Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry. He also chaired the NAACP&#x27;s million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization&#x27;s board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank&#x27;s first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.

Robinson was active in politics throughout his post-baseball life. He identified himself as a political independent, although he held conservative opinions on several issues, including the Vietnam War (he once wrote to Martin Luther King Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration&#x27;s military policy). After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential race against John F. Kennedy, Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively for his stance on civil rights. Robinson was angered by the 1964 presidential election candidacy of conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the election. After the party nominated Goldwater instead, Robinson left the party&#x27;s convention commenting that he now had &quot;a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler&#x27;s Germany&quot;. He later became special assistant for community affairs when Rockefeller was re-elected governor of New York in 1966 and in 1971 was appointed to the New York State Athletic Commission by Rockefeller. In 1968, he broke with the Republican party and supported Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in that year&#x27;s presidential election.

Robinson protested against the major leagues&#x27; ongoing lack of minority managers and central office personnel, and he turned down an invitation to appear in an old-timers&#x27; game at Yankee Stadium in 1969. He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, nine days before his death, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I look at that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball.&quot; This wish was only fulfilled after Robinson&#x27;s death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation to Jackie), a Hall of Fame-bound player who would go on to manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.

==Family life and death==
After Robinson&#x27;s retirement from baseball, his wife Rachel Robinson pursued a career in academic nursing. She became an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center. She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed in 1990. She and Jackie had three children: Jackie Robinson Jr. (1946–1971), Sharon Robinson (b. 1950), and David Robinson (b. 1952).

Robinson&#x27;s eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had emotional trouble during his childhood and entered special education at an early age. He enlisted in the Army in search of a disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son&#x27;s drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader toward the end of his life.

Robinson did not outlive his son by very long. In 1968, he suffered a heart attack. Complications from heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, Robinson died of a heart attack at his home at 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old. Robinson&#x27;s funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan&#x27;s Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners. Many of his former teammates, other famous baseball players, and basketball star Bill Russell served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson&#x27;s interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, where he was buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum. Twenty-five years after Robinson&#x27;s death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson&#x27;s gravesite.

After Robinson&#x27;s death, his widow founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, and she remains an officer as of 2024. On April 15, 2008, she announced that in 2010 the foundation would open a museum devoted to Jackie in Lower Manhattan. Robinson&#x27;s daughter, Sharon, became a midwife, educator, director of educational programming for MLB, and the author of two books about her father. His youngest son, David, who has ten children, is a coffee grower and social activist in Tanzania.

==Awards and recognition==
On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Robinson&#x27;s uniform number, 42, alongside those of former teammates Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32). In 2017, a statue of Robinson, created by sculptor Branly Cadet, was unveiled at Dodger Stadium. It was the first statue the Dodgers ever unveiled.

In 1999, Robinson was named by &quot;Time&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. That same year, he was one of 30 players elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. That same year, he was ranked No. 44 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot; in 1999. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Robinson at number 42 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Baseball writer Bill James, in &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, ranked Robinson as the 32nd greatest player of all time strictly on the basis of his performance on the field, noting that he was one of the top players in the league throughout his career. Robinson was among the 25 charter members of UCLA&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984. In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante included Robinson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

The City of Pasadena has recognized Robinson with a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field in Brookside Park next to the Rose Bowl, and with the Jackie Robinson Center (a community outreach center providing health services). In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $ today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting oversized nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue, across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported by members of the Robinson family.

Major League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the &quot;Jackie Robinson Award&quot; in honor of the first recipient (Robinson&#x27;s Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues).

On April 15, 1997, Robinson&#x27;s jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues. Under the terms of the retirement, a grandfather clause allowed the handful of players who wore number 42 to continue doing so in tribute to Robinson, until such time as they subsequently changed teams or jersey numbers. This affected players such as the Mets&#x27; Butch Huskey and Boston&#x27;s Mo Vaughn. The Yankees&#x27; Mariano Rivera, who retired at the end of the 2013 season, was the last player in Major League Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis. Since 1997, only Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s number 99, retired by the NHL in 2000, and Bill Russell&#x27;s number 6, retired by the NBA in 2022, have been retired league-wide in any of the four major sports.

As an exception to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson&#x27;s major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson&#x27;s permission to wear the number. After Griffey received her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson&#x27;s number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all of MLB&#x27;s uniformed personnel (including players) wore number 42 on April 15; this tradition has continued every year since on that date.

At the November 2006 groundbreaking for Citi Field, the new ballpark for the New York Mets, it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn&#x27;s old Ebbets Field, would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The rotunda was dedicated at the opening of Citi Field on April 16, 2009. It honors Robinson with large quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large freestanding statue of his number, 42, which has become an attraction in itself. Mets owner Fred Wilpon announced that the Mets—in conjunction with Citigroup and the Jackie Robinson Foundation—would create the Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center, located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation at One Hudson Square, along Canal Street in lower Manhattan. Along with the museum, scholarships will be awarded to &quot;young people who live by and embody Jackie&#x27;s ideals.&quot; The museum opened in 2022. The New York Yankees honor Robinson with a plaque in Monument Park.

Since 2004, the Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year has been presented the &quot;Jackie Robinson Award&quot;.

Robinson has also been recognized outside of baseball. In December 1956, the NAACP recognized him with the Spingarn Medal, which it awards annually for the highest achievement by an African-American. President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on March 26, 1984, and on March 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave Robinson&#x27;s widow the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress; Robinson was only the second baseball player to receive the award, after Roberto Clemente. On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, announced that Robinson was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.

A number of buildings have been named in Robinson&#x27;s honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium, which, because of the efforts of Jackie&#x27;s brother Mack, features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis. The stadium also unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14, 2013. City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1990 and a statue of Robinson with two children stands in front of the ballpark. His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15. 1990. A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor to PJC) are named in Robinson&#x27;s honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack. The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson, and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him. His home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and Brooklyn residents sought to turn his home into a city landmark. In 1978, Colonial Park in Harlem was renamed after Robinson. Robinson also has an asteroid named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson. In 1997, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway in his honor. The following year, a statue of Robinson was dedicated at Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In 1997, the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five-dollar gold coin. Robinson has also been honored by the United States Postal Service on three separate postage stamps, in 1982, 1999, and 2000.

In 2011, the U.S. placed a plaque at Robinson&#x27;s Montreal home to honor the ending of segregation in baseball. The house, at 8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park, was Robinson&#x27;s residence when he played for the Montreal Royals during 1946. In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie&#x27;s widow, wrote: &quot;I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida. In the end, Montreal was the perfect place for him to get his start. We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there. The people were so welcoming and saw Jack as a player and as a man.&quot;

On November 22, 2014, UCLA announced that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him. The only sport this did not affect was men&#x27;s basketball, which had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that sport to wear 42, with Hazzard&#x27;s blessing). In a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three athletes (in women&#x27;s soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues.

A jersey that Robinson brought home with him after his rookie season ended in 1947 was sold at an auction for $2.05 million on November 19, 2017. The price was the highest ever paid for a post-World War II jersey.

<text>JPEG Network Graphics (JNG, ) is a JPEG-based graphics file format which is closely related to PNG: it uses the PNG file structure (with a different signature) as a container format to wrap JPEG-encoded image data.

JNG was created as an adjunct to the MNG animation format, but may be used as a stand-alone format. JNG files embed an 8-bit or 12-bit JPEG datastream in order to store color data, and may embed another datastream (1, 2, 4, 8, 16-bit PNG, or 8-bit JPEG grayscale image) for transparency information. However, a JNG may contain two separate JPEG datastreams for color information (one 8-bit and one 12-bit) to permit decoders that are unable to (or do not wish to) handle 12-bit datastreams to display the 8-bit datastream instead, if one is present.

Version 1.0 of the JNG specification was released on January 31, 2001 (initially as part of the MNG specification). Usually, all the applications supporting the MNG file format can handle JNG files too. For example, Konqueror has native MNG/JNG support, and MNG/JNG plugins are available for Opera, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox. The Mozilla Application Suite (and hence Netscape) originally supported MNG/JNG, but native support was removed in Mozilla 1.5a by developers, and Mozilla has not supported the format since. Safari does not support MNG/JNG.

JNG enhances the capabilities of the JFIF format (the usual JPEG file format) by supporting transparency, two consecutive color streams (one 8-bit and the other 12-bit), and other useful PNG features like color correction, gamma correction, embedded color profiles, PNG-style metadata, checksums, etc. The transparency information inside a JNG file (as an alpha channel) can be saved either in lossless PNG format or in lossy JPEG format. This way, users can benefit from the power of JPEG compression while preserving lossless (PNG-compressed) transparency information.

The chunk-based structure of JNG files is essentially the same as that of PNG files, differing only in the slightly different signature and the use of different chunks.

JNG does not have a registered Internet media type, but codice_1 can be used.

==Alternatives==
Due to the lack of wide adoption of both the JNG and MNG format, it has fallen in disuse in favor of other formats that are in active development with similar qualities:
* JPEG XR: Supporting wide color space and a lossy format with transparency (JNG contender, standardized)
* WebP: Supporting a lossy format with transparency and animation (JNG/MNG contender, not yet standardized)
* JPEG XL: Supporting wide color spaces, lossy and lossless encoding, animation and transparency (JPEG/PNG replacement contender)

<doc id="16196" wikidata="Q469740" url="?curid=16196" title="Jane Shore">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Jane&quot; Shore (née Lambert; 1445 – c. 1527) was one of the many mistresses of King Edward IV of England. She became the best known to history through being later accused of conspiracy by the future King Richard III, and compelled to do public penance. She was also a sometime mistress of other noblemen, including Edward&#x27;s stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings but ended her life in bourgeois respectability.

== Early life and first marriage ==
Born in London in about 1445, Elizabeth Lambert was the daughter of a prosperous merchant, John Lambert (d.1487), and his wife Amy (d.1488), who was the daughter of a well-off grocer named Robert Marshall. The name &quot;Jane&quot;, which has sometimes been attached to her, was the invention of a 17th-century playwright (Heywood), because during the course of the sixteenth century, her real first name was omitted, then forgotten by authors. The tradition must go further back, however, as on 28 August 1599 was licensed the &quot;History of the Life and Death of Master Shore and Jane Shore his Wife&quot;.

Spending time in her father&#x27;s shop at a young age may have brought the young Elizabeth into contact with ladies of high rank. C.J.S. Thompson&#x27;s highly romanticised biography, &quot;The Witchery of Jane Shore, the Rose of London: The Romance of a Royal Mistress&quot; (1933) claimed that she was able to observe their behaviour and gain an understanding of the manners of those higher ranking than herself. She was thought to have been highly intelligent, and as a result received an education that was not usually associated with a person of her class. Thompson also claimed that her beauty earned her the title of &quot;The Rose of London&quot; – although this is not mentioned in contemporary sources. According to Thomas More, writing when Shore was elderly, she had been fair of body though not tall; she was attractive to men more through her personality than her physical beauty, being intelligent, literate, merry and playful.

She attracted many suitors, among them William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, friend and confidant of Edward IV. It is likely Hastings fell in love with Elizabeth Lambert before her marriage; his affection for her is apparent later in life by his continual protection of her.

Such extreme attention made John Lambert desirous of finding his daughter a suitable husband. Such an opportunity presented itself with William Shore (d. 1494), a goldsmith and banker and common visitor to the Lambert home. He was approximately 14 or 15 years older than Jane. Though handsome and well-to-do, he never really won her affections. Their marriage was annulled in March 1476 after she petitioned for the annulment of her marriage on the grounds that her husband was impotent, which prevented her from fulfilling her desire to have children. Pope Sixtus IV commissioned three bishops to decide the case, and they granted the annulment.

== Royal mistress ==
According to the Patent Rolls for 4 December 1476, it was during this same year that Shore began her liaison with Edward IV, after his return from France. Edward remained involved with her until his death. She had a large amount of influence over the king, but would not use it for her own personal gain. This was exemplified by her practice of bringing those out of favour before the king to help them gain pardon. Shore, according to the official records, was not showered with gifts, unlike many of Edward&#x27;s previous mistresses. Their relationship lasted until Edward&#x27;s death in 1483. It is reputed that her advocacy saved Eton College, and the society for the ladies at Eton College is to this day called the Jane Shore Society in her memory.

== Open penance and prison ==
Shore is also known to have two other lovers, Edward IV&#x27;s eldest stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings. Grey&#x27;s wife was the wealthy heiress Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, who also happened to be Hastings&#x27; stepdaughter. Shore was instrumental in bringing about the alliance between Hastings and the Woodvilles, which was formed while Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was Protector, before he took the throne as King Richard III. She was accused of carrying messages between Hastings and Edward IV&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth Woodville. It was because of her role in this alliance that Shore was charged with conspiracy, along with Hastings and the Woodvilles, against the Protector&#x27;s government.

Simon Stallworth wrote to Sir William Stonor on 21 June 1483 that:&quot;Mastres Chore is in prisone: what schall happyne hyr I knowe nott.&quot;
Shore&#x27;s punishment included open penance at Paul&#x27;s Cross for her promiscuous behaviour by Richard. The Great Chronicle of London records the event of Richard III&#x27;s coronation on 6 July 1483 and that:&quot;shortly afftyr was a woman namyd – Shoore that before days, after the common ffame, the lord Chambyrlain held, contrary his honour, called to a Reconnyng ffor part of his goodys &amp; othyr thyngs, In soo much alle hyr movablys were attached by þe Shyrevys of London, and she lastly as a common harlot put to opyn penaunce, ffor the lyfe that she ledd wt þe said lord hastyngys &amp; othir grete astatys.&quot;But it may have been motivated by the suspicion that she had harboured Grey when he was a fugitive or as a result of Richard&#x27;s antagonism towards any person who represented his older brother&#x27;s court. A clash of personalities between the lighthearted Shore and stern Richard also generated a mutual dislike between the two. Shore accordingly went in her chemise through the streets one Sunday with a (thin candle) in her hand, attracting a lot of male attention along the way.
After her public penitence, Shore resided in Ludgate prison.

== Second marriage and later life ==

While in Ludgate prison, she captivated the King&#x27;s Solicitor General, Thomas Lynom. After he expressed an interest in Shore to Richard, the king tried to dissuade him for his own good. This is evinced by a letter to John Russell from Richard where the King asked the chancellor to try to prevent the marriage, but if Lynom were determined on the marriage, to release Shore from prison and put her in the charge of her father until Richard&#x27;s next arrival in London when the marriage could take place.By the &quot;King&quot;

&quot;Right Reverend fadre in God, &amp;c. Signifying unto you that it is shewed unto us that our Servant and Sollicitor Thomas Lynom merveillously blynded and abused with the late wife of William Shore nowe being in Ludgate by our commandement hathe made contract of matrymony with hir, as it is said, and entendethe to our full grete mervaile to procede to theffect of the same. We for many causes wold be sory that hee soo shuld be disposed. Pray you therefore to sende for him. And in that ye goodly may exhorte and sture hyme to the contrary. And if ye find him utterly set forto marye hur and noon otherwise wolbe advertised, than if it may stande with the lawe of the churche we be content, the tyme of marriage be deferred to ourcommyng next to London, that upon sufficient suertie founde for hure good abering ye doo sende hure keper and discharge hym of our saidcommaundement by warrant of thise, committing hure to the Rule and guyding of hur fader or any other by your discrecion in the meane season.&quot; Given, &amp;c.

&quot;RIC.&quot; Rex.

To the Righte Reverend fadre in God &amp;c. The Bisshop of Lincolne, our ChancellorThey were married and had one daughter. It is believed that Shore lived the remainder of her life in bourgeois respectability. Lynom lost his position as King&#x27;s Solicitor when Henry VII defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in August 1485, but he was able to stay on as a mid-level bureaucrat in the new reign, becoming a gentleman who sat on the commissions in the Welsh Marches and clerk controller to Arthur, Prince of Wales, at Ludlow Castle. Thomas More attested that even in her old age an attentive observer might discern in her shriveled countenance traces of her former beauty.

== Descriptions ==
Thomas More&#x27;s description remains to this day the most famous:This woman was born in London, worshipfully frended, honestly brought vp, &amp; very wel maryed, sauing somewhat to sone, her husbande an honest citezen, yonge &amp; goodly &amp; of good substance. But forasmuche as they were coupled ere she wer wel ripe, she not very feruently loued, for whom she neuer longed. Which was happely the thinge, that the more easily made her encline vnto the kings appetite when he required her. Howbeit the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparel, ease, plesure &amp; other wanton welth, was hable soone to perse a softe tender hearte. But when the king had abused her, anon her husband (as he was an honest man &amp; one that could his good, not presuming to touch a kinges concubine) left her vp to him al togither. When the king died, the lord Chamberlen toke her. Which in the kinges daise, albeit he was sore ennamored vpon her, yet he forbare her, either for reuerence, or for a certain frendly faithfulnes. Proper she was &amp; faire: nothing in her body that you would haue changed, but if you would haue wished her somewhat higher. Thus say thei that knew her in her youthe. Albeit some that now se her (for yet she liueth) deme her neuer to haue ben wel visaged. Whose iugement semeth me somwhat like, as though men should gesse the bewty of one longe before departed, by her scalpe taken out of the charnel house: for now is she old lene, withered &amp; dried vp, nothing left but ryuilde skin &amp; hard bone. An yet being euen such: whoso wel aduise her visage, might gesse &amp; deuise which partes how filled, wold make it a faire face. Yet she delited not men so much in her bewty, as in her plesant behauiour. For a proper wit had she, &amp; could both rede wel &amp; write, mery in company, redy &amp; quick of aunswer, neither mute nor ful of bable, sometime taunting without displeasure not without disport. The king would say that he had .iii. concubines, which in three diuers properties diuersly exceled. One the meriest, an other the wiliest, the thirde the holiest harlot in his realme, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly to any place, but it wer to his bed. The other two were somwhat greter parsonages, &amp; of their humilitie content to be nameles, &amp; to forbere the praise of those properties. But the meriest was this Shoris wife, in whom the king therfore toke speciall pleasure. For many he had, but her he loued. Whose fauour, to sai the trouth, (for sinne it wer to belie the deuil) she neuer abused to any mans hurt, but to many a mans comfort &amp; relief: where the king toke displeasure, she wolud mitigate &amp; appease his mind: where men were out of fauour, she wold bring them in his grace. For many that had highly offended, shee obtained pardon. Of great forfetures she gate men remission. And finally in many weighty sutes, she stode many men in gret stede, either for none, or very smal rewardes, &amp; those rather gay then rich: either for that she was content with the dede selfe well done, or for that she delited to be suid vnto, &amp; to show what she was able to do wyth the king, or for that wanton women and welthy be not alway couetouse. I doubt not some shal think this woman to sleight a thing, to be written of &amp; set amonge the remembraunces of great matters: which thei shal specially think, that happely shal esteme her only by that thei now see her. But me semeth the chaunce so much the more worthy to be remembred, in how much she is now in the more beggerly condicion, vnfrended &amp; worne out of acquantance, after good substance, after as gret fauour with the prince, after as gret sute &amp; seking to with al those that those days had busynes to spede, as many other men were in their times, which be now famouse, only by the infamy of their il dedes. Her doinges were not much lesse, albeit thei be muche lesse remembered, because thei were not so euil. For men vse if they haue an euil turne, to write it in marble: &amp; whoso doth vs a good tourne, we write it in duste which is not worst proued by her: for at this daye shee beggeth of many at this daye liuing, that at this day had begged if she had not bene.These words of Sir Thomas More probably suggested to Shakespeare that proverbial reflection in &quot;Hen. VIII.&quot; act iv. sc. 2.: &quot;Men&#x27;s evill manners live in brass: their virtues We write in water.&quot;

According to Michael Drayton, who had seen a purported portrait of her, &quot;her hair [was] of a dark yellow, her face round and full, her eye gray, delicate harmony&quot;.

== Children ==
‘Julyan Lyneham’ is given 40 shillings in John Lambert&#x27;s will of 1487.

It was recently discovered, 2021 a quoted inscription in an old book which may throw some further light on the matter. On the north wall of the chancel of St. Mary&#x27;s, Whittlesea, is a marble mural monument to Thomas Hake, 1590. Its two panels are now blank, but it is probable that they had figures. The text, however, is still extant and perfectly readable:
&quot;Celastia seqvor terrestria sperno | Here Lyeth Bvried the Bodye of Thomas Hake, Esqvier | sonne and heire of Symon Hake of Depinge in | the countie of Lyncolne Esqvier and of Alice | his wife dovghter of Thomas Lynham Esqvier | somtyme President of Walles which Thomas | Hake died the first of March An° Dni 1590. | Who married Anne Dovghter of Roger Wylson of Govsner in the covntie of Lancaster Gent. | and of Jane his wife Dovghter of John Wallis which | Thomas and Anne had yssve 5 sonnes and 3 dovgh- | ters which died all yonge Bvt William Hake the | yongest ther only sonne and heire now livinge&quot; Thomas Lynham, Esquire, referred to as sometime &quot;President of Wales&quot; (although in reality he was probably just a member of the Council of Wales and the Marches, not its president), had a daughter named Alice who married Simon Hake (or Hacke). They had at least one son, Thomas (d. 1 March 1590), and he had many children, though only one surviving, William, who erected the memorial.

William Hake (d.1625) of Peterborough married Lucy, daughter of Henry Gates of Gosberton, Lincolnshire, on 14 June 1596 at Gosberton, Lincoln, England and they had the children Henry, Fane, Thomas, Anthony, Symon, William (b.1601), Elizabeth, Anne, Lucy, Frances, Grace and Mary.

Their eldest daughter was called Elizabeth.

Both William Hake and his father Thomas were members of Parliament. The Hake family were Royalists during the Civil War, a sundial on a south-facing wall-end overlooking the garden then running down to the river&#x27;s flood plain, but not now publicly accessible triumphantly declares VIVAL CAROLUS SECUNDUS 1663.

Of the same place, Whittlesea, Cambridge, in 1544–1551, we find Thomas Lynon or Lynom, executor of Richard, son of Thomas Lynon. In 1538 Thomas Lyname, yeoman, is granted a demise, indented, for 80 years, of the manor-place or lordship of Whittlesea, Cambridgeshire by Thorney Abbey. Simon Hake, Alice Lyneham&#x27;s husband, had been a tenant of Thorney Abbey.

*She is a significant character in &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, an anonymous play written shortly before William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. In the play, she is reduced to destitution on the streets, ignored by both former lovers and people she had helped after Richard frightens citizens with severe punishments if she is supported in any way.
*&quot;Mistress Shore&quot; is frequently mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Richard III&quot;. (She actually appears in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1955 film version, played by Pamela Brown—she has only one line: &quot;Good morrow, my Lord&quot;, which is interpolated into the film. The film shows her as attending to Edward IV, but afterwards having a passionate affair with Lord Hastings.) Edward IV, Thomas Grey, and Lord Hastings are all characters in the play.
*The story of Jane Shore&#x27;s wooing by Edward IV, her influence in court, and her tragic death in the arms of Matthew Shore is the main plot in a play by Thomas Heywood, &quot;Edward IV&quot; (printed 1600). The play shows her struggling with the morality of accepting the king&#x27;s offers, using her influence to grant pardons to those wrongfully punished, and expressing regret for her relationship with Edward. In this version, her first marriage is never annulled, but the two are reconciled right before dying and being buried together in &quot;Shores Ditch, as in the memory of them&quot;. This is supposed to be the origin of the name Shoreditch.
*&quot;The Tragedy of Jane Shore&quot; is a 1714 play by Nicholas Rowe. Rowe portrays her as a kind woman who encourages her lover Hastings to oppose Richard&#x27;s usurpation of power. In revenge Richard forces her to do penance and to become an outcast. As in Heywood&#x27;s version, her husband seeks her out and they are reconciled before she dies.
*A performance of &quot;Jane Shore&quot; was given on Saturday 30 July 1796 at a theatre in Sydney. The pamphlet for the play was printed by a convict in the settlement, George Hughes, who was the operator of Australia&#x27;s first printing press. The pamphlet for the play is the earliest-surviving document printed in Australia. It was presented as a gift to Australia by the Canadian Government and is held at the National Library of Australia in the National Treasures collection in Canberra.
*&quot;Jane Shore&quot;. The play by W. G. Wills was produced at the Leeds Amphitheatre in 1875 and 1876, starring Wilson Barrett as &#x27;Henry&#x27; Shore and his wife Caroline Heath as &#x27;Henry&#x27;s&#x27; errant wife Jane Shore.

===Poetry===
*Thomas Churchyard (d. 1604) published a poem about her in &quot;Mirror for Magistrates&quot;.
*Anthony Chute&#x27;s 1593 poem &quot;Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore&#x27;s wife&quot; is supposed to be the lament of Jane Shore, whose ghost tells her life story and makes moral reflections.
*Michael Drayton wrote a poem about her in his &quot;Heroical Epistles&quot;.
*Andrew Marvell refers to her in &quot;The King&#x27;s Vows&quot;, a satire on Charles II, in which the king says, &quot;But what ever it cost I will have a fine Whore, /As bold as Alce Pierce and as faire as Jane Shore.&quot;

<doc id="16200" wikidata="Q357676" url="?curid=16200" title="Jack Kemp">
<text>Jack French Kemp (July 13, 1935 – May 2, 2009) was an American politician and professional football player. A member of the Republican Party from New York, he served as Housing Secretary in the administration of President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1993, having previously served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989. He was the Republican Party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in the 1996 election, as the running mate of Bob Dole; they lost to incumbent president Bill Clinton and vice president Al Gore. Kemp had previously contended for the presidential nomination in the 1988 Republican primaries.

Before entering politics, Kemp played as a quarterback for 13 years. He played briefly in the National Football League (NFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL), but became a star in the American Football League (AFL). He served as a captain of both the San Diego Chargers and the Buffalo Bills, earning the AFL Most Valuable Player award in 1965 after leading the Bills to a second consecutive championship. He played in the AFL for all 10 years of its existence, appeared in its All-Star game seven times, played in its championship game five times, and set many of the league&#x27;s career passing records. Kemp also co-founded the AFL Players Association, for which he served five terms as president. During the early part of his football career, he served in the United States Army Reserve.

As an economic conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative opposition to abortion to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As a proponent of both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon Ronald Reagan&#x27;s political agenda and the architect of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.

After his days in political office, Kemp remained active as a political advocate and commentator; he served on corporate and nonprofit organization boards. He also authored, co-authored, and edited several books. He promoted American football and advocated for retired professional football players. Kemp was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 by President Barack Obama.

==Early life==

===Youth===
Born, raised, and educated in Los Angeles, Kemp was the third of four sons of Frances Elizabeth (née Pope) and Paul Robert Kemp Sr. Paul turned his motorcycle messenger service into a trucking company that grew from one to 14 trucks. Frances was a well-educated social worker and Spanish teacher. Kemp grew up in the heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles, but his tight-knit middle-class family attended the Church of Christ, Scientist. In his youth, sports consumed Kemp, who once chose the forward pass as the subject of a school essay on important inventions, although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl.

Kemp attended Melrose Avenue&#x27;s Fairfax High School, which was, at the time, known for its high concentration of both Jewish students and children of celebrities. Over 95% of Kemp&#x27;s classmates were Jewish, and he later became a supporter of Jewish causes. His classmates included musician Herb Alpert, baseball pitcher Larry Sherry, and academic Judith A. Reisman. During his years in high school, Kemp worked with his brothers at his father&#x27;s trucking company in downtown Los Angeles. In his spare time, he was a rigorous reader, preferring history and philosophy books.

===College===
After graduating from high school in 1953, he attended Occidental College, a founding member of the NCAA Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Kemp selected Occidental because its football team used professional formations and plays, which he hoped would help him to become a professional quarterback. At and , he considered himself too small to play for the USC Trojans or UCLA Bruins, the major Southern California college football programs.

At Occidental, Kemp was a record-setting javelin hurler and played several positions on the football team: quarterback, defensive back, place kicker, and punter. Although he was near-sighted, Kemp was tenacious on the field. During his years as starting quarterback, the 1955 and 1956 Occidental teams posted 6–2 and 3–6 records. Kemp was named a Little All-America player one year in which he threw for over 1,100 yards. That year, he led the nation&#x27;s small colleges in passing. He and close friend Jim Mora, who later became an NFL head coach, were members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Another teammate in college was Ron Botchan, who was an NFL referee for years (record five Super Bowls). Kemp declined to become involved in student government. After graduating from Occidental with a degree in physical education, he pursued postgraduate studies in economics at Long Beach State University and California Western University in San Diego, and served in the military from 1958 to 1962.

==Marriage, family, and faith==
Kemp graduated from Occidental in 1957 and married Joanne Main, his college sweetheart, after she graduated from Occidental in 1958. Main had grown up in Fillmore, California, and attended Fillmore High School in Ventura County. Kemp&#x27;s Biblical Literature professor, Keith Beebe, presided over the wedding. The Kemps had two sons. Both were professional football quarterbacks: Jeff Kemp (born in 1959) played in the NFL from 1981 to 1991, and Jimmy Kemp (born in 1971) played in the CFL from 1994 to 2002. Significantly for a man with his demanding schedule, Jack never missed one of their games as children or in college. They also had two daughters: Jennifer Kemp Andrews (born in 1961) and Judith Kemp (born in 1963).

Joanne Kemp once suffered a miscarriage, which Kemp later said made him re-evaluate the sanctity of human life and affirmed his opposition to abortion.

Following his wedding, Kemp converted to his wife&#x27;s Presbyterian faith. He identified as a born-again Christian.

Kemp was a 33rd degree Freemason in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction.

==Football career==
After being selected by the Detroit Lions in the 17th round of the 1957 NFL draft, Kemp was cut from the team before the 1957 NFL season began. He spent 1957 with the Pittsburgh Steelers and 1958 on the taxi squads of the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants. The Giants hosted the NFL championship game, known as the &quot;Greatest Game Ever Played&quot; and the first overtime NFL playoff game, but, as a third-string quarterback member of the taxi squad, Kemp did not take the field.

In 1958, Kemp joined the United States Army Reserve and he served a year on active duty as a private to complete his initial training. He was a member of the San Diego–based 977th Transportation Company from 1958 to 1962. When his unit was activated for the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Kemp received a medical exemption for his chronically separated left shoulder. The injury led to his discharge from the Reserve in July 1962.

In 1959, Kemp played one game for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, which made him ineligible for the NFL, in 1959. According to his older brother Tom, his parents drove him from California to Calgary, Alberta, only to see him cut. By this time, Kemp had been cut from five professional teams (Lions, Steelers, Giants, 49ers, and Stampeders) and his family encouraged him to get on with his life. On February 9 and 11, 1960, the newly formed AFL agreed to &quot;no tampering&quot; policies with the NFL and CFL respectively, protecting each league&#x27;s players. Players like Kemp, with modest NFL experience, were often signed by the AFL at the time. Kemp signed as a free agent with the AFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Chargers.

===Sid Gillman era (1960–1962)===
In 1960, Kemp led the Chargers to a Western Division Championship with a 10–4 record. He finished second in the league to Frank Tripucka in passing attempts, completions, and yards (making him and Tripucka the league&#x27;s first 3,000-yard passers), led the AFL in yards per completion and times sacked, and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead. Under Kemp, the Chargers&#x27; offense averaged 46 points over its last four games and scored more than 41 points in five of its last nine games. In the AFL championship game, he led the team to field goals on its first two possessions, but after the Houston Oilers posted a touchdown in the second quarter for a 7–6 lead, the Chargers never recovered.

In 1961, &quot;San Diego Union&quot; editor Jack Murphy convinced Barron Hilton to move the Chargers from Los Angeles to San Diego. Kemp led the relocated team to a 12–2 record and a repeat Western Division Championship. He again finished second in passing yards (this time to George Blanda). The Chargers earned an AFL championship game rematch against the Oilers. However, this time the Chargers were unable to score until a fourth-quarter field goal in a 10–3 loss.

In 1962, Kemp broke his middle finger when he struck a helmet against the New York Titans in the second game of the season and was unable to play. He persuaded his doctors to set his broken finger around a football, so that his grip would not be affected once the finger healed. Chargers coach Sid Gillman put Kemp on waivers to try to &quot;hide&quot; him. Buffalo Bills coach Lou Saban noticed that Kemp was available and claimed him for a $100 waiver fee on September 25, 1962, in what sportswriter Randy Schultz has called one of the biggest bargains in professional football history. The Dallas Texans and Denver Broncos also attempted to claim Kemp, but he was awarded to Buffalo by AFL commissioner Joe Foss.

===Lou Saban era (1962–1965)===
According to Billy Shaw, Kemp&#x27;s acquisition solved the Bills&#x27; quarterback problem, but Kemp was not excited about coming to Buffalo. According to Van Miller, &quot;Jack&#x27;s a skier, and he wanted to go to Denver and play for the Broncos. He hated the thought of coming to Buffalo.&quot; In Buffalo, he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by Henry Thoreau, which led to chidings from Saban.

Injuries, including the broken finger, kept Kemp from playing for most of 1962. That season, Kemp received a military draft notice for service in the Vietnam War but was granted a draft waiver because of a knee problem. The injuries healed, and Kemp debuted for Buffalo on November 18, 1962, by directing the only touchdown drive in a 10–6 win over the Oakland Raiders. He played only four games for Buffalo in 1962, but made the AFL All-Star team. The Bills won three of their last four games to finish 7–6–1.

On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica. In 1963, a four-season starting quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica left for the Raiders. Lamonica felt he &quot;... learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. And I truly believe that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills.&quot; In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns. The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in weather. During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.

Kemp was said to be the &quot;clubhouse lawyer&quot; for the Bills because of his role in mediating conflicts. In 1964, he managed personalities such as Gilchrist, who walked off the field when plays were not being called for him, and Saban, whom he kept from cutting Gilchrist the following week. He also managed the politics of his quarterback battle with Lamonica, who engineered four winning touchdown drives in the Bills&#x27; first seven games. Kemp was the first and only Professional Football player to pass for three touchdowns in the first quarter of a season-opening game, against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1964, until the record was tied but not broken, 47 years later in 2011 by Aaron Rodgers. The 1964 team won its first nine games and went 12–2 for the regular season, winning the Eastern Division with a final game victory over the Patriots at Fenway Park. Kemp led the league in yards per attempt and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead, which was shared by Gilchrist and Sid Blanks. In the AFL championship game, he scored the final touchdown with just over nine minutes left in a 20–7 victory. Not long after, Kemp played a key role in an off the field decision. Kemp was part of the All-Star Game played three weeks after the Championship Game alongside teammates such as Cookie Gilchrist and Ernie Warlick, with the game scheduled to be played in New Orleans, Louisiana. However, Gilchrist led a movement of African American players wanting to boycott the game due to experiencing discrimination by cab drivers and others during their time in New Orleans; Kemp saw this firsthand when Gilchrist, and Warlick were not allowed to share a cab with him. Kemp attended a boycott meeting and alongside Ron Mix convinced the white players to go with the idea of a boycott. One day after the players left the city, AFL Commissioner Joe Foss moved the game to Houston, Texas.

According to Lamonica, the 1965 team had a new emphasis: &quot;In &#x27;64 we had depended a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us. . .But that all changed in &#x27;65. The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So we went to a pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year.&quot; In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp&#x27;s role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.

===Joe Collier and John Rauch eras (1966–1969)===
Following the championship game, Saban resigned to coach the University of Maryland and defensive coordinator Joe Collier was promoted to head coach for the 1966 season. Kemp led the Bills to their third consecutive division title with a 9–4–1 record. However, in the AFL championship game, which was played for the right to represent the AFL in Super Bowl I, the Bills lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 31–7. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star for the sixth consecutive year. The 1967 Bills endured a 4–10 1967 AFL season, in which Kemp was not named to the All-Star game for the first time in his AFL career.

On August 23, 1968, the Bills suffered a blowout preseason loss to the Houston Oilers. On August 26, Collier put the Bills through a 40-play scrimmage. During the scrimmage, Ron McDole fell on Kemp&#x27;s right knee and injured it, forcing Kemp to sit out the entire 1968 season. The Bills went 1–12–1 without Kemp.

Despite Kemp&#x27;s return from injury and the arrival of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only compiled a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league&#x27;s 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, &quot;I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ... I figured that if I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress.&quot;

===Sports career summary===
Kemp led Buffalo to the AFL playoffs four straight years (1963–1966), three consecutive Eastern Division titles (1964–1966) and two straight AFL Championships (1964–1965). He led the league in career passes attempted, completions, and yards gained passing. He played in five of the AFL&#x27;s 10 Championship Games, and holds the same career records (passing attempts, completions, and yardage) for championships. He is second in many other championship game categories, including career and single-game passer rating. He ranks third in rushing touchdowns by an NFL or AFL quarterback with 40, behind Steve Young&#x27;s 52 and Otto Graham&#x27;s 44. A &quot;Sporting News&quot; All-League selection at quarterback in 1960 and 1965, and the AFL MVP in 1965. He was the only AFL quarterback to be listed as a starter all 10 years of the league&#x27;s existence and one of only 20 players to serve all 10 of those years. His number 15 was retired by the Bills in 1984. In 2012, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Kemp to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2012.

However, despite his success and important AFL records, he is most prominently listed in the NFL record book for less flattering accomplishments, including his place as a former record holder for most quarterback sacks in a game. Despite Kemp&#x27;s many records, Joe Namath and Len Dawson were selected as the quarterbacks for the All-time AFL team. Kemp is a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bills&#x27; Wall of Fame.

Kemp co-founded the AFL Players Association with Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots, and was elected its president five times. His founding of and involvement in the players&#x27; union contributed to his frequent siding with the Democrats on labor issues later in his career.

The NCAA&#x27;s highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Award, was presented to Kemp in 1992, and he was named one of the association&#x27;s 100 most influential student-athletes in 2006.

==Political career==

Kemp&#x27;s political career began long before his 1970 campaign. In 1960 and 1961, Kemp was an editorial assistant to &quot;San Diego Union&quot; editor and future Richard Nixon aide Herb Klein. Subsequently, Kemp became a volunteer in both Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s successful 1966 California gubernatorial campaign. In the 1967 football off-season, Kemp worked on Reagan&#x27;s staff in Sacramento. In 1969, he was special assistant to the Republican National Committee chairman.

Kemp was a voracious reader, and his political beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater&#x27;s &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot;, Ayn Rand&#x27;s novels such as &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and Friedrich von Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;. He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality which came from playing football with black teammates. As Kemp said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do.&quot; Kemp&#x27;s football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that &quot;the huddle is colorblind.&quot;

===House of Representatives (1971–1989)===

As a self-described &quot;bleeding-heart conservative&quot;, Kemp represented a part of the suburban Buffalo region known as the Southtowns (that traditionally voted Democratic) in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989. He was described as having the charisma of the earlier John F. Kennedy. David Rosenbaum described Kemp as an independent politician who often legislated outside his committees&#x27; jurisdictions and often spoke in favor of ideals and principles rather than his party&#x27;s political platforms. As a supply-sider, he was not a proponent of balanced budgeting and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal.

The Erie County, New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after incumbent congressman Richard D. McCarthy decided to run for the United States Senate. During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pont—discussed in &quot;Time&quot;. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon&#x27;s director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon&#x27;s war policies in order to firm up Kemp&#x27;s support from military hawks.

Kemp championed several Chicago school and supply-side economics issues, including economic growth, free markets, free trade, tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income. He was a long-time proponent of the flat tax. He also defended the use of anti-Communist contra forces in Central America, supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, and was the first lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones, which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants. During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat; he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert F. Kennedy. He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, David Gergen heralded him as a &quot;courageous voice in the wilderness.&quot; Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools. Kemp at times felt his role was that of &quot;freewheeling, entrepreneurial, wildcatting backbencher.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; identified 38-year-old second-term congressman Kemp as a future leader in its 1974 &quot;Faces for the Future&quot; feature. Another early-career notable magazine appearance was in a 1978 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;. The article explained allegations of homosexual activity among staffers in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Sacramento office in 1967; Kemp was not implicated. Kemp considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1980 and Hugh Sidey mentioned him as a contender to unseat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election and was a front runner for the vice presidency at the 1980 Republican National Convention, where he received 43 votes from conservative detractors of George H. W. Bush. After he was reelected for a sixth term in 1980, his Republican peers elected him to a party leadership position, and he served seven years as chairman of the House Republican Conference. This promotion occurred immediately after Kemp and David Stockman urged Reagan by memorandum to dedicate his first 100 days to working on an economic package with Congress. Kemp considered running for Governor of New York in 1982 but ultimately decided to stay in the House. By 1984, many viewed Kemp as Reagan&#x27;s heir apparent.
Kemp had his first encounter with supply-side economics in 1976, when &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his congressional office. Kemp questioned Wanniski all day (until midnight, at Kemp&#x27;s Bethesda, Maryland home) and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer&#x27;s supply-side discipline. Thereafter, Kemp espoused supply-side economics freely, and in 1978 he and Sen. William Roth of Delaware proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics&#x27; inclusion in President Reagan&#x27;s economic plan, although at the time of Robert Mundell&#x27;s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley, and Wanniski. In 1979, Kemp wrote &quot;An American Renaissance&quot; (), to deliver his message that &quot;A rising tide lifts all boats.&quot; Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation. Reagan&#x27;s budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.

During the Reagan years, Kemp and his followers ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 had become one of the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker&#x27;s success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.

An early Kemp tax reform attempt was an unsuccessful 1979 proposal to index tax brackets for cost of living fluctuations, which was incorporated in Reagan&#x27;s 1980 package. Kemp co-sponsored a legislative attempt at enterprise zones in 1980. One of Kemp&#x27;s more trying times as a congressman came in 1982 when Reagan decided to reverse the tax cuts and promote tax increases. The reversal was controversial and stimulated opposition by Kemp. Nonetheless, the revised taxes passed. In 1983, Kemp opposed the policies of chairman Volcker on multiple occasions. The debates included domestic monetary involvement and roles in funding the International Monetary Fund.

Kemp delivered speeches at several Republican National Conventions. He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas. During the 1984 Convention, with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman, Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed control of the party platform to the consternation of G.O.P. senators Bob Dole and Howard Baker. Kemp&#x27;s official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy. However, the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes, the gold standard and the role of the Federal Reserve. Despite Kemp&#x27;s official role, his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes. By 1985, Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 presidential nomination. He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain, Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress.

Kemp was a critic of association football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: &quot;I think it is important for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands—[that] a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport.&quot; Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin&#x27;s 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his &quot;tongue was firmly planted in cheek&quot; when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer&#x27;s main problem is &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have a quarterback&quot;. Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have &quot;changed&quot; his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a &quot;boring game&quot;.

===Presidential bid (1988)===
In 1988, if Kemp had won his campaign for the United States presidency, it would have made him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan&#x27;s 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp&#x27;s leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in his campaign. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters&#x27; social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp&#x27;s free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government&#x27;s role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.

After the May 1987 Gary Hart–Donna Rice scandal, a questionnaire by &quot;The New York Times&quot; requested things such as psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the &quot;Times&quot; inquiry as &quot;beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate&quot;. His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York. Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemp&#x27;s campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red, which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques. To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz. To position himself as Reagan&#x27;s successor, Kemp called for Shultz&#x27;s resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on the SDI. In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan—a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.

Despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects, Kemp&#x27;s primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts. As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending. Some viewed Kemp&#x27;s supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit. In late 1987, political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non-social issues. Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagan&#x27;s INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union&#x27;s Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty. With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same &quot;sabre-rattling&quot; stand. By early 1988, the moderates (Bush and Dole) were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates.

He used a somewhat negative advertising campaign that seemed to have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In &quot;Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics&quot;, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp&#x27;s campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39 delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the vice presidential nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence at the time of his death. In 1994, Kemp&#x27;s 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.

===Cabinet (1989–1993)===

As a so-called &quot;bleeding-heart conservative&quot;, Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing. However, the scandals of Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD&#x27;s director, he cleaned up HUD&#x27;s reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the Federal Housing Administration. He halted or revamped certain programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett. He supported &quot;Operation Clean Sweep&quot; and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.

Although Kemp coaxed Bush to support a $4 billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361 million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp&#x27;s pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp&#x27;s proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as did most of the Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp&#x27;s Economic Empowerment Task Force. However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp&#x27;s new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256 million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp&#x27;s Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.

President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, and instead used Kemp to speak on the administration&#x27;s low priority conservative activist agenda. Bush&#x27;s contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his &quot;Points of Light&quot; theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from presidential candidate Bill Clinton. By the time of the Los Angeles riots of 1992, Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: Mort Zuckerman compared Bush&#x27;s vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemp&#x27;s success in advance best when he said in 1989, &quot;Good ideas with money can do a whole lot. Good ideas without money aren&#x27;t probably going to do a whole lot,&quot; and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemp&#x27;s ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administration&#x27;s leading users of first class corporate jets. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.

Generally, his time as housing secretary was considered unsuccessful. However, although he could not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5 billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a vice presidential candidate.

Kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker, White House Chief of Staff, that Bush&#x27;s best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention, Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemp&#x27;s reference to parts of the President&#x27;s economic policy as &quot;gimmicks&quot; after the 1992 State of the Union Address. Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bush&#x27;s administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a &quot;domestic policy czar.&quot; The letter, highlighting Kemp&#x27;s &quot;energy, enthusiasm and national clout&quot;, insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the Bush Cabinet for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.

===Post-HUD years (1993–1996)===
Kemp gave public speeches for $35,000 apiece between his time as Housing Secretary and his vice presidential nomination. By 1994, Kemp had embarked on 241 fund-raising dinners to raise $35 million for a 1996 presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts. After stepping down from his $189,000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job, Kemp personally earned $6.9 million in the next three years, primarily for speaking on behalf of local Republican candidates. During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities, Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series.

Kemp was considered the star of the 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp was considered the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement by the end of the year. In January 1995, Kemp&#x27;s stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.

Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich appointed Kemp to head a tax reform commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.

During the campaign, Kemp&#x27;s endorsement was highly coveted. Forbes had tried to get Kemp to run in the 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole&#x27;s campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.

Kemp was also outspoken on immigration on around this time: according to Kemp&#x27;s interpretation of a scientific index that he and Bennett support, &quot;immigrants are a blessing, not a curse.&quot; In 1994, Kemp and Bennett opposed California ballot Proposition 187, a measure to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining public services, in direct opposition to first-term Republican California Governor Pete Wilson, one of its endorsers who was running for re-election. Republican Senate candidate Michael Huffington had also endorsed the proposition. Kemp supported rights for illegal immigrants, and opposed Lamar Smith and Alan Simpson&#x27;s proposed restrictions on legal immigration.

===Vice presidential nomination (1996)===
Kemp had a reputation as the highest-profile progressive Republican. When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the vice presidential nominee. On August 5, 1996, Dole announced a 15% across-the-board tax cut in response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemp&#x27;s tax reform commission. Several of Dole&#x27;s other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennett&#x27;s Empower America, which had Jeane Kirkpatrick, Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatrick&#x27;s tough foreign policy, Bennett&#x27;s &quot;right conduct&quot; and even Alexander&#x27;s school choice interest.

Bennett declined the offer to be Dole&#x27;s running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole&#x27;s antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential nominee, running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp was seen as a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole&#x27;s senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp&#x27;s tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole&#x27;s running mate in 1996, they appeared on the cover of the August 19, 1996 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that &quot;Time&quot; inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.

The two politicians had a storied history stemming from alternative perspectives and objectives. Dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against John F. Kennedy&#x27;s tax cuts, while Kemp was an outspoken supply-sider. In the early 1980s, according to David Stockman, Kemp persuaded Reagan to make a 30% across-the-board tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature. Once Reagan was elected, Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way. Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan. The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms. Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Dole&#x27;s request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action &quot;Dole proofing&quot; the platform, and the plank passed over Dole&#x27;s opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the Senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks. This is said to have been Dole&#x27;s most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate. During the 1988 presidential election, the two antagonized each other. After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet, the two did not really cross paths again until 1996, when Kemp endorsed Dole&#x27;s opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March.

Dole despised Kemp&#x27;s economic theories, but he felt Kemp-like tax cuts offered his best chance at electoral success. For his part, Kemp had to make concessions as well: he had to back expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools despite his longstanding opposition to Proposition 187, and mute his opposition to abolishing affirmative-action programs in California. Some derided Kemp for his compromise and referred to him as a &quot;con artist&quot;. From the outset of their campaign, Dole-Kemp trailed, and they faced skeptics even from within the party. However, Kemp was able to use the nomination to promote his opposition to Clinton&#x27;s partial birth abortion ban veto. During the campaign, Kemp and Forbes advocated for a stronger stand on tax cutting than Dole used. However, in general, the opinion was that Kemp was helpful to the ticket&#x27;s chances of catching Bill Clinton, and Kemp&#x27;s advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign. Kemp was seen as likely to influence several types of swing voters, especially those of his native state of California, and even the Democrats feared Kemp might lure voters.

After receiving the nomination, Kemp became the ticket&#x27;s spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to agreement on the self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described as if he was the presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp&#x27;s style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp&#x27;s voice on minority issues, Colin Powell&#x27;s support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.

Both Al Gore and Kemp had presidential aspirations, which induced pursuit of debate on a higher plane. In addition, Gore and Kemp were long-time friends, unlike Gore and his previous vice presidential opponent Dan Quayle. Thus, as debaters they avoided personal attacks. However, some felt Kemp failed to counter substantive attacks. In the final October 9, 1996 vice presidential debate against Al Gore (held as the Dole–Kemp ticket trailed badly in the national polls), Kemp was soundly beaten, and Al Gore&#x27;s performance is considered one of the best modern debate performances. The debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the then-current baseball playoffs, in which Roberto Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; second baseman, cursed and spat on an umpire. The Mexico policy debate was one of the more interesting topics for critical review. The Gore victory was not a surprise since Kemp had been outmatched by Gore in previous encounters, and Gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater.

==Late career==

In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and financial backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded the free market advocacy group Empower America, which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works. Empower America represented the populist wing of the party: while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights, it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit. He resigned as co-chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.

By 1996, Kemp had been named a director of six corporate boards. He was a director for Hawk Corporation, IDT Corporation, CNL Hotels and Resorts, InPhonic, Cyrix Corporation and American Bankers Insurance Group. Kemp briefly served on the board of Oracle Corporation, whose CEO was his friend Larry Ellison, in 1996, but resigned when he ran for vice president; he was named to the board of Six Flags, Inc. in December 2005. Kemp opted not to stand for re-election to IDT&#x27;s board in 2006. He also served on the Habitat for Humanity board of directors, and served on the board of Atlanta-based software maker EzGov Inc. Kemp also served on the board of directors of Election.com, which was the private company that ran the world&#x27;s first election on the internet (won by Al Gore), the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary. Kemp was also a business partner with Edra and Tim Blixseth promoting membership in the elite private ski and golf Yellowstone Club. Kemp also partnered with the Blixseths in a failed anti-terrorism software venture called Blxware which was investigated for &quot;conning&quot; the federal government out of $20 million in contracts for software which fraudulently claimed to detect secret messages from Al-Qaeda in television broadcast signals. Kemp was the founder and chairman of Kemp Partners, a strategic consulting firm that helps clients achieve both business and public policy goals.

In addition to corporate boards of directors, Kemp served on several advisory boards such as the UCLA School of Public Policy Advisory Board, and the Toyota Diversity Advisory Board as well as the Howard University Board of Trustees, on which he served since 1993. On March 25, 2003, Kemp was selected as chairman of the board of Directors of USA Football, a national advocacy group for amateur football created by the National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Players Association. The organization supports Pop Warner, American Youth Football, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, National Recreation and Park Association, Police Athletic League, YMCA, and the Amateur Athletic Union. He was also vice president of NFL Charities.
In the late 1990s, Kemp remained outspoken on political issues: he was critical of Clinton&#x27;s International Monetary Fund lax policies toward South Korea. In early 1998, he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election, but his campaign possibilities faltered, and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush. Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation, Social Security and education. When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment, Kemp opposed the plan in favor of tax cuts. Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger, he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation. In addition to his fiscal and economic policies, Kemp advocated against abortion when Congress was considering a bill banning intact dilation and extractions. He also advocated for retired NFL veterans on issues such as cardiovascular screening, assisted living, disability benefits, and the 2007 joint replacement program. He argued in support of reforming immigration laws. In the late 1990s, Kemp also was a vocal advocate for free market reform in Africa, arguing that the continent had great economic growth potential if it could shed autocratic and statist governmental policies.

In 1997, when Gingrich was embroiled in a House ethics controversy, Kemp served as an intermediary between Dole and Gingrich to save the Republican Party leader. Later, in 2002, when Lott made caustic remarks about Strom Thurmond, Kemp was upset, and he supported Lott&#x27;s apology, saying he had encouraged him to &quot;repudiate segregation in every manifestation.&quot; Kemp was among the prominent leaders who pledged to raise money in 2005 for Scooter Libby&#x27;s defense when he was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in a case regarding the release of Central Intelligence Agency information.

In June 2004, Kemp rescinded his support of Vernon Robinson for Congress due to the latter&#x27;s views on immigration laws, citing Robinson&#x27;s choice to run &quot;as a Pat Buchanan Republican&quot;.

In 2006 Kemp, along with 2004 vice-presidential nominee John Edwards, co-chaired the Council on Foreign Relations task force on Russia, producing a document called &quot;Russia&#x27;s Wrong Direction: What the United States Can and Should Do&quot;. After their task force roles ended, the pair advocated solutions to poverty in America at various fora.
On January 6, 2008, Kemp endorsed McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries shortly before the New Hampshire primary, which surprised conservative Republican tax cutters. However, as McCain neared the official nomination, the press associated McCain with Kemp more and more. Kemp prepared an open letter to Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCain&#x27;s behalf to quell their dissatisfactions. In addition, Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy.

He was a syndicated newspaper columnist.

In February 2008, Kemp was associated with a group called &quot;Defense of Democracies&quot; that was advocating an electronic surveillance bill that failed in the House of Representatives. The group&#x27;s television ad caused such controversy that some of its advisors, including Schumer and Donna Brazile, resigned.

He was a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and served as co-chair of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Cabinet.

He was a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott, and is awarded annually to college football&#x27;s Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

==Illness and death==

On January 7, 2009, Kemp&#x27;s office issued a statement announcing that he had cancer; the type of cancer and the anticipated treatment were not announced. His diagnosis and prognosis were never publicly disclosed. However, he continued to serve as chairman of his Washington-based Kemp Partners consulting firm and continued his involvement in charitable and political work until his death.

On May 2, 2009, Kemp died from cancer at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, at the age of 73. President Barack Obama praised Kemp&#x27;s work on race, adding that Kemp understood that divisions involving race and class stood in the way of the country&#x27;s common goals, and former President George W. Bush said that Kemp &quot;will be remembered for his significant contributions to the Reagan Revolution and his steadfast dedication to conservative principles during his long and distinguished career in public service.&quot; It was later revealed that melanoma was the probable type of cancer Kemp died from.

==Legacy==

Kemp&#x27;s legacy includes the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s, also known as the first of two &quot;Reagan tax cuts.&quot; These served as the foundation of supply-side economics, known as Reaganomics. Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts can spur economic growth and reduce deficits. Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics, George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snow, were believers. Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.

In the early 21st century, Kemp continued to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible for the implementation of supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He has been described as a beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who are socially conservative, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.

In addition to Roth, he has had numerous political allies. At times, he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and tax cuts, collaborated with McCain and Phil Gramm on tax cuts and spending restraints, legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman, and fought poverty with James Pinkerton. Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally. After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet, Kemp remained close to Gingrich, Lott, Weber, and Mack. Kemp was a member of the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. As a progressive voter, he had civil rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks, Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. Loury and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends. He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III, Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia. Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp. During the Reagan presidency, when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting, a leading United States Senate tax-cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley, a former basketball star. Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress, including Steve Largent, J. C. Watts, and Heath Shuler.

Congressman Paul Ryan cites Kemp as a mentor, and mentioned him in his acceptance speech as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2012.

&quot;Growth is obviously what Jack Kemp was about&quot; stated Fred Barnes in the opening of the session &quot;Growth! Growth! Growth!&quot; of Jack Kemp Foundation&#x27;s Forum on &quot;The Future of the American Idea&quot;, in 2014. Kemp didn&#x27;t believe in limits to growth, a blind spot shared by many politicians of his era and which prompted him to dismiss the 1991 Report of the United Nations Population Fund as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

Senator Arlen Specter in a severe rebuke of federal governmental policy, stated just one day after Kemp died of cancer, that Kemp would still be alive if the federal government had done a better job funding cancer research.

Following Kemp&#x27;s death, his son, Jimmy Kemp, created the Jack Kemp Foundation to continue his father&#x27;s legacy. A 501(c)(3) charitable organization, the foundation&#x27;s mission statement is to &quot;develop, engage and recognize exceptional leaders who champion the American Idea&quot;. The foundation is located in Washington, D.C., and is committed to advancing the universal values of the American Idea: growth, freedom, democracy and hope.

The football stadium at Occidental College is named after him.

<doc id="16203" wikidata="Q44311" url="?curid=16203" title="Jihad">
<text>Jihad (; ) is an Arabic word that means &quot;exerting&quot;, &quot;striving&quot;, or &quot;struggling&quot;, particularly with a praiseworthy aim. In an Islamic context, it encompasses almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God&#x27;s guidance, such as an internal struggle against evil in oneself, efforts to build a good Muslim community (&quot;ummah&quot;), and struggle to defend Islam. Literally meaning &#x27;struggle&#x27;, the term is most frequently associated with warfare.

&quot;Jihad&quot; is classified into inner (&quot;greater&quot;) &quot;jihad&quot;, which involves a struggle against one&#x27;s own passions and impulses, and outer (&quot;lesser&quot;) &quot;jihad&quot;, which is further subdivided into &quot;jihad&quot; of the pen/tongue (debate or persuasion) and &quot;jihad&quot; of the sword (warfare). Much of Muslim opinion considers inner &quot;jihad&quot; to have primacy over outer &quot;jihad&quot;, although many Western scholars disagree. The analysis of a large survey from 2002 reveals considerable nuance in the conceptions of &quot;jihad&quot; held by Muslims around the world, ranging from righteous living and promoting peace to fighting against the opponents of Islam.

The word &quot;jihad&quot; appears frequently in the Qur&#x27;an referring to both religious and spiritual struggle and to war and physical struggle, often in the idiomatic expression &quot;striving in the path of God &quot;(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)&quot;&quot;, conveying a sense of self-exertion. In the &quot;hadiths&quot;, &quot;jihad&quot; refers predominantly to warfare. Greater &quot;jihad&quot; refers to spiritual and moral struggle, and has traditionally been emphasized in Sufi and Ahmadiyya circles. The sense of &quot;jihad&quot; as armed resistance was first used in the context of persecution faced by Muslims when Muhammad was at Mecca, when the community had two choices: further emigration (&quot;hijrah&quot;) or war. The Qur&#x27;an justifies war in self-defense or in response to aggression towards other Muslims, however the sword verses have historically been interpreted to renounce other verses and justify offensive war against unbelievers, forcibly converting polytheistic pagans during the early Muslim conquests. A set of rules pertaining to &quot;jihad&quot; were developed, including prohibitions on harming those who are not engaged in combat, on killing animals such as horses, and on unnecessary destruction of enemy property.

In the twentieth century, the notion of &quot;jihad&quot; lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to ideological and political discourse. While modernist Islamic scholars have emphasized the defensive and non-military aspects of &quot;jihad&quot;, some Islamists have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical texts. The term has gained additional attention in recent decades through its use by various insurgent Islamic extremist, militant Islamist, and terrorist individuals and organizations. Today, the word &quot;jihad&quot; is often used without religious connotations, like the English &quot;crusade&quot;.

==Etymology and literary origins==
The term &quot;jihad&quot; is derived from the Arabic root &quot;jahada&quot;, meaning &quot;to exert strength and effort, to use all means in order to accomplish a task&quot;. In its expanded sense, it can be fighting the enemies of Islam, as well as adhering to religious teachings, enjoining good and forbidding evil. The peaceful sense of &quot;efforts towards the moral uplift of society or towards the spread of Islam&quot; can be known as &quot;&quot;jihad&quot; of the tongue&quot; or &quot;&quot;jihad&quot; of the pen&quot;, as opposed to &quot;&quot;jihad&quot; of the sword&quot;. It is used as a term in &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence) mostly in the latter sense, while in Sufism mostly in the sense of fighting the &quot;nafs al-ammara&quot;, which is the psychological state of succumbing to one&#x27;s own desires. Spiritual and moral &quot;jihad&quot; is generally emphasized in pious and mystical circles.

The Hans Wehr &quot;Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot; defines the term as &quot;fight, battle; &quot;jihad&quot;, holy war (against the infidels, as a religious duty)&quot;. However, given the range of meanings, it is incorrect to equate it simply with &quot;holy war&quot;. The notion of &quot;jihad&quot; has its origins in the Islamic idea that the whole humankind will embrace Islam. In the Qur&#x27;an and in later Muslim usage, &quot;jihad&quot; is commonly followed by the expression &quot;fi sabil illah&quot;, &quot;in the path of God.&quot; Muhammad Abdel-Haleem stated that it indicates &quot;the way of truth and justice, including all the teachings it gives on the justifications and the conditions for the conduct of war and peace.&quot;

In Modern Standard Arabic, the term &quot;jihad&quot; is used for a struggle for causes, both religious and secular. It is sometimes used without religious connotation, with a meaning similar to the English word &quot;crusade&quot; (as in &quot;a crusade against drugs&quot;). &quot;Jihad&quot; is used commonly in Arabic countries, in the neutral sense of &quot;a struggle for a noble cause&quot;, as a unisex name given to children. Nonetheless, &quot;jihad&quot; is usually used in the religious sense and its beginnings trace to the Qur&#x27;an and the words and actions of Muhammad.

===Quran===
&quot;Jihad&quot; is mentioned in four places in the Qur&#x27;an as a noun, while its derived verb is used in twenty-four places. &quot;Mujahid&quot;, the active participle meaning &quot;jihadist&quot;, is mentioned in two verses. In some of these mentions (see At-Tawbah 9/41, 44, 81, 86), it is understood that the word &quot;jihad&quot; directly refers to war, and in others, &quot;jihad&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;the effort to live in accordance with Allah&#x27;s will&quot;. Qur&#x27;anic exhortations to &quot;jihad&quot; have been interpreted by Islamic scholars both in the combative and non-combative sense. Ahmed al-Dawoody wrote that there seventeen references to or derivatives of &quot;jihad&quot; occur altogether forty-one times in eleven Meccan texts and thirty Medinan ones, with 28 mentions related to religious belief or spiritual struggle and 13 mentions related to warfare or physical struggle.

===Hadith===
There are also many hadiths (records of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) about &quot;jihad&quot;, typically under the headings of &quot;kitab al-jihad&quot; (book of &quot;jihad&quot;) or &quot;faza&#x27;il al-jihad&quot; (virtues of &quot;jihad&quot;) in &quot;hadith&quot; collections or as the subject of independent works. Of the 199 &quot;hadith&quot; references to &quot;jihad&quot; in the Bukhari collection of &quot;hadith&quot;, all assume that &quot;jihad&quot; means warfare.

Among reported sayings of Muhammad involving &quot;jihad&quot; are:
and
Ibn Nuhaas cited a hadith from Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, where Muhammad stated that the highest kind &quot;jihad&quot; is &quot;The person who is killed whilst spilling the last of his blood&quot; (Ahmed 4/144). Muhammad also said, “I cannot find anything” as meritorious as &quot;jihad&quot;; he further likened &quot;jihad&quot; to “praying ceaselessly and fasting continuously”. Muhammad said that “if it were not a hardship for the Muslims, I would never idle behind from a raiding party going out to fight in the path of Allah... I [would] love to raid in the path of Allah and be killed, to raid again and be killed, and to raid again and be killed”. Muhammad also said that &quot;Lining up for battle in the path of Allah [jihad] is worthier than 60 years of worship&quot;. Muhammad claimed that any Muslim who refused to fight in &quot;jihad&quot; “will be tortured like no other sinful human” in hell with confirmation from Qur&#x27;an 8:15-16. In another &quot;hadith&quot; Muhammad said, “the sword wipes away all sins” and “being killed in the path of Allah washes away impurity”.

According to another &quot;hadith&quot;, supporting one&#x27;s parents is an example of &quot;jihad&quot;. It has been reported that Muhammad considered performing &quot;hajj&quot; well to be the best &quot;jihad&quot; for Muslim women.

The &quot;hadith&quot; emphasize &quot;jihad&quot; as one of the means to Paradise. All sins (except debt) would be forgiven for the one who dies in it. Participation in &quot;jihad&quot; had to be voluntary and intention must be pure, for &quot;jihad&quot; is only waged for the sake of God not for material wealth. On the contrary, &quot;jihad&quot; required man to put both his life and wealth at risk. &quot;Jihad&quot; is ranked as one of the highest good deeds; according to one &quot;hadith&quot; it is the third-best deed after prayer and being good to one&#x27;s parents. One &quot;hadith&quot; exempts military &quot;jihad&quot; on men whose parents are alive, as serving one&#x27;s parents is considered a superior &quot;jihad&quot;.

==Greater and lesser &quot;jihad&quot;==
Tradition distinguishes the &quot;greater &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; (inner struggle against sinful behavior) from the &quot;lesser &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; (military sense). Early Islamic thought considered non-violent interpretations of &quot;jihad&quot;, especially for those Muslims who could not partake in warfare in distant lands. Most classical writings use the term &quot;jihad&quot; in the military sense. The tradition differentiating between the &quot;greater and lesser &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; is not included in any of the authoritative compilations of Hadith. In consequence, some Islamists dismiss it as not authentic.

The most commonly cited &quot;hadith&quot; for &quot;greater &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; is:
A number of fighters came to Muhammad and he said &quot;You have come from the &#x27;lesser &quot;jihad&quot;″ to the &#x27;greater &quot;jihad&quot;″.&quot; The fighters asked &quot;what is the greater &quot;jihad&quot;?&quot; Muhammad replied, &quot;It is the struggle against one&#x27;s passions.&quot;

This passage was cited in &quot;The History of Baghdad&quot; by Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, an 11th-century Islamic scholar. This reference gave rise to the practice of distinguishing &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot; &quot;jihad&quot;. Islamic scholars such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani consider the &quot;hadith&quot; to have a weak chain of transmission.

The concept has had &quot;enormous influence&quot; in Islamic mysticism (Sufism).

Ibn Hazm lists four kinds of &quot;jihad fi sabilillah&quot; (struggle in the cause of God):
* &quot;Jihad&quot; of the heart &quot;(jihad bil qalb/nafs)&quot; is concerned with combatting the devil and in the attempt to escape his persuasion to evil. This type of &quot;jihad&quot; was regarded as the greater &quot;jihad&quot; (&quot;al-jihad al-akbar&quot;).
* &quot;Jihad&quot; by the tongue &quot;(jihad bil lisan)&quot; (also &quot;jihad&quot; by the word, &quot;jihad al-qalam&quot;) is concerned with speaking the truth and spreading the word of Islam with one&#x27;s tongue.
* &quot;Jihad&quot; by the hand &quot;(jihad bil yad)&quot; refers to choosing to do what is right and to combat injustice and what is wrong with action.
* &quot;Jihad&quot; by the sword &quot;(jihad bis saif)&quot; refers to &quot;qital fi sabilillah&quot; (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by Salafi Muslims and offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood.

A related &quot;hadith&quot; tradition that has &quot;found its way into popular Muslim literature&quot;, and which has been said to &quot;embody the Muslim mindset&quot; of the Islamic Golden Age (the period from the mid-8th century to mid-13th century following the relocation of the Abbasid capital from Damascus to Baghdad), is: 

The belief in the veracity of this &quot;hadith&quot; was a contributing factor in the efforts by successive &quot;caliphs&quot; to subsidize translations of &quot;Greek, Hebrew and Syriac science and philosophy texts&quot;, and the saying continues to be heavily emphasised in certain Islamic traditions advocating intellectualism over violence, for example in Timbuktu, where it is central to one of two key lessons in the work &quot;Tuhfat al-fudala&quot; by 16th-century Berber scholar Ahmed Baba. In general, however, fewer people today are aware of the &quot;hadith&quot;, which suffers from &quot;a general lack of knowledge&quot;, according to Akbar Ahmed.

According to classical Islamic scholars like Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, &quot;jihad&quot; is against four types of enemies: the lower self (&quot;nafs&quot;), Satan, the unbelievers, and the hypocrites. The first two types of &quot;jihad&quot; are purely peaceful spiritual struggles. According to Ibn Qayyim, &quot;Jihad against the lower self precedes &quot;jihad&quot; against external enemies.&quot; Confirming the central importance of the spiritual aspect of &quot;jihad&quot;, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote:

Engaging in the greater &quot;jihad&quot; does not preclude engaging in the lesser &quot;jihad&quot;. Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani recommended his followers to pursue both the greater and the lesser &quot;jihad&quot;s.

At least one important contemporary Twelver Shia figure, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, wrote a treatise on the &quot;Greater &quot;Jihad&quot;&quot; (i.e., internal/personal struggle against sin).

Robert W. Schaefer discussed &quot;jihad&quot; and &quot;gazavat&quot; in the context of the Caucasus: &quot;&quot;Gazavat&quot; was the &quot;jihad&quot; of its day. &quot;Gazavat&quot; meant putting yourself on the right path (what Muslims refer to as the lesser &quot;jihad&quot;) as well as expelling the invader (what is referred to as greater &quot;jihad&quot;).&quot;

==Defensive and offensive lesser &quot;jihad&quot;==
Classical scholars considered various justifications for &quot;jihad&quot;, including waging it defensively vs offensively. Scholarly opinions carried significant weight with Muslim leaders. Scholars paid more attention to conduct of war (&quot;jus in bello)&quot; than justification of war (&quot;jus ad bellum&quot;). The decision of when to wage war was often viewed as a political decision best left to political authorities.

Two justifications for &quot;jihad&quot; were given: defensive war against external aggression, or an offensive or preemptive attack against an enemy state. According to the majority of jurists, the &quot;casus belli&quot; (justifications for war) are restricted to aggression against Muslims, and &quot;fitna&quot;—persecution of Muslims because of their religious belief. They hold that unbelief in itself is not a justification for war. These jurists therefore maintain that only combatants are to be fought; noncombatants such as women, children, clergy, the aged, the insane, farmers, serfs, the blind, and so on are not to be killed in war. Thus, the Hanafī Ibn Najīm stated: &quot;the reason for &quot;jihād&quot; in our [the Hanafīs] view is &quot;kawnuhum harbā ‛alaynā&quot; [literally, their being at war against us].&quot; The Hanafī jurists al-Shaybānī state that &quot;although unbelief in God is one of the greatest sins, it is between the individual and his God the Almighty and the punishment for this sin is to be postponed to the &quot;dār al-jazā’&quot;, (the abode of reckoning, the Hereafter).&quot; Al-Sarakhsī says something similar. Offensive &quot;jihad&quot; involved forays into enemy territory either for conquest, thus enlarging the Muslim political order, or to dissuade the enemy from attacking Muslim lands.

Shia and Sunni theories of &quot;jihad&quot; are similar, except that Shias consider offensive &quot;jihad&quot; to be valid only under the leadership of the Mahdi, who is currently believed to be in occultation but will return. However, defensive &quot;jihad&quot; is permissible in Shia Islam before the Mahdi&#x27;s return. In fact, Shia scholars emphasized it was a religious duty for Shia to defend all Muslims (including Sunni Muslims) from outside invaders.

===Rules of warfare===

Rules prohibit attacking or molesting non-combatants, including women, children under the age of puberty, elderly men, people with disabilities and those who are sick. Diplomats, merchants and peasants are similarly immune from being attacked. Monks are presumed to be non-combatants and thus have immunity; places of worship should not be attacked. Even if the enemy disregarded the immunity of noncombatants, Muslims could not respond in kind. However, these categories lose their immunity should they participate in fighting, planning, or supplying the enemy. Some jurists argued that immunity was more related to noncombatant status than being in a certain demographic class. For example, Muhaqqiq al-Hilli opined that only old men are only immune from being killed if they neither fight, nor take a role in military decision making.

Up until the Crusades, Muslim jurists disallowed the use of &quot;mangonels&quot; because the weapon killed indiscriminately with the potential of harming noncombatants. During the Crusades this ruling was reversed out of military need. Jurists grappled with the question of attacking an enemy that used women, children or Muslims as human shields. Most jurists held that it was permissible to attack the enemy in cases of military necessity, but steps should be taken to direct the attack towards combatants to avoid the human shield. Abu Hanifa argued that if Muslims stopped combat for fear of killing noncombatants, then such a rule would make fighting impossible, as every city had civilians. Mutilating the enemy dead is prohibited.

Two rulings on destruction of enemy property conflict. In one military battle, Prophet Muhammad ordered the destruction of an enemy&#x27;s palm trees as a means of ending a siege without bloodshed. By contrast, Abu Bakr prohibited destruction of trees, buildings and livestock. Most jurists did not allow unnecessary destruction of enemy property, but allowed it in cases of military necessity, such as destroying buildings in which the enemy is taking shelter. Some jurists allowed destruction if it would weaken the enemy or win the war. Many jurists cautioned against &quot;unnecessary devastation&quot;, not just out of humanitarian concerns, but practical ones: it is more useful to capture an enemy&#x27;s property than to destroy it. Islamic scholars prohibited killing animals, unless due to military necessity (such as killing horses in battle). This is because, unlike property, animals feel pain.

==History ==

In pre-Islamic Arabia, Bedouins raided enemy tribes and settlements to collect spoils. According to some scholars (such as James Turner Johnson), while Islamic leaders &quot;instilled into the hearts of the warriors the belief&quot; in &quot;jihad&quot; &quot;holy war&quot; and &quot;ghaza&quot; (raids), the &quot;fundamental structure&quot; of this Bedouin warfare &quot;remained, ... raiding to collect booty&quot;. According to Jonathan Berkey, the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s statements in support of &quot;jihad&quot; may have originally been directed against Muhammad&#x27;s local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but these same statements could be redirected once new enemies appeared. According to scholar Majid Khadduri, it was the shift in focus to the conquest and spoils collecting of non-Bedouin unbelievers and away from traditional inter-Bedouin tribal raids, that may have made it possible for Islam to expand and to avoid self-destruction.

===Classical===
According to Al-Baqara 256 &quot;there is no compulsion in religion&quot;. The primary aim of &quot;jihad&quot; as warfare is not the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam by force, but rather the expansion and defense of the Islamic state. There could be truces before this was achieved, but no permanent peace. One who died &quot;on the path of God&quot; was a martyr (&quot;shahid&quot;), whose sins were remitted and who secured &quot;immediate entry to paradise&quot;.

According with Bernard Lewis, &quot;from an early date Muslim law laid down&quot; &quot;jihad&quot; in the military sense as &quot;one of the principal obligations&quot; of both &quot;the head of the Muslim state&quot;, who declared &quot;jihad&quot;, and the Muslim community. According to legal historian Sadakat Kadri, Islamic jurists first developed classical doctrine of &quot;jihad&quot; &quot;towards the end of the eighth century&quot;, using the doctrine of &quot;naskh&quot; (that God gradually improved His revelations over the course of Muhammed&#x27;s mission). They subordinated Qur&#x27;anic verses emphasizing harmony to the more &quot;confrontational&quot; verses of Muhammad&#x27;s later years and linked verses on exertion (&quot;jihad&quot;) to those of fighting (&quot;qital&quot;). Muslims jurists of the eighth century divided the world into three divisions, &quot;dar al-Islam&quot;/&quot;dar al-‛adl&quot;/&quot;dar al-salam&quot; (house of Islam/house of justice/house of peace), &quot;dar al-harb&quot;/&quot;dar al-jawr&quot; (house of war/house of injustice, oppression), and &quot;dar al-sulh&quot;/&quot;dar al-‛ahd/dār al-muwada‛ah&quot; (house of peace/house of covenant/house of reconciliation). The eighth century jurist Sufyan al-Thawri (d. 778) headed what Khadduri called a pacifist school, which maintained that &quot;jihad&quot; was only a defensive war. He stated that the jurists who held this position, among whom he refers to Hanafi jurists al-Awza‛i (d. 774) and Malik ibn Anas (d. 795), and other early jurists, &quot;stressed that tolerance should be shown unbelievers, especially scripturaries and advised the Imam to prosecute war only when the inhabitants of the &quot;dar al-harb&quot; came into conflict with Islam.&quot; The duty of &quot;Jihad&quot; was a collective one (&quot;fard al-kifaya&quot;). It was to be directed only by the caliph who might delay it when convenient, negotiating truces for up to ten years at a time. Within classical Islamic jurisprudence, during the first few centuries after the prophet&#x27;s death, &quot;jihad&quot; consisted of wars against unbelievers, apostated, and was the only form of permissible warfare. Bernard Lewis stated that fighting rebels and bandits was legitimate, though not a form of &quot;jihad&quot;, and that while the classical perception and presentation of &quot;jihad&quot; was warfare in the field against a foreign enemy, internal &quot;jihad&quot; &quot;against an infidel renegade, or otherwise illegitimate regime was not unknown.&quot;)

However, some argue martyrdom is never automatic, because it is God&#x27;s province to judge who is worthy of that designation.

Classical manuals of Islamic jurisprudence often contained a section called &quot;Book of Jihad&quot;, with rules governing the conduct of war covered at great length. Such rules include treatment of nonbelligerents, women, children (also cultivated or residential areas), and division of spoils. Such rules offered protection for civilians. Spoils include &quot;Ghanimah&quot; (spoils obtained by actual fighting), and &quot;fai&quot; (obtained without fighting i.e. when the enemy surrenders or flees).

The first documentation of the law of &quot;jihad&quot; was written by &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Awza&#x27;i and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani. (It grew out of debates that surfaced following Muhammad&#x27;s death.) Although some Islamic scholars have differed on the implementation of &quot;Jihad&quot;, the consensus amongst them is that &quot;jihad&quot; always includes armed struggle against persecution and oppression.

Both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim asserted that Muhammad never initiated hostilities and that all the wars he engaged in were primarily defensive. He never forced non-Muslims to Islam and upheld the truces with non-Muslims so long as they did not violate them. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s views on &quot;Jihad&quot; are explained in his treatise titled &quot;Qāʿidah mukhtaṣarah fī qitāl al-kuffār wa muhādanatuhum wa taḥrīm qatlahum li mujarrad kufrihim&quot;. (An abridged rule on fighting the unbelievers and making truces with them, and the prohibition of killing them merely because of their unbelief). According to Ibn Taymiyya, human blood is inviolable by default, except &quot;by right of justice&quot;. Although Ibn Taymiyya authorised offensive &quot;Jihad&quot; ( &quot;Jihad al-Talab&quot;) against enemies who threaten Muslims or obstruct their citizens from freely accepting Islam, unbelief (&quot;Kufr&quot;) by itself is not a justification for violence, whether against individuals or stated. According to Ibn Taymīyah, &quot;jihad&quot; is a legitimate reaction to military aggression by unbelievers and not merely due to religious differences. Ibn Taymiyya wrote:&quot;As for the transgressor who does not fight, there are no texts in which Allah commands him to be fought. Rather, the unbelievers are only fought on the condition that they wage war, as is practiced by the majority of scholars and is evident in the Book and Sunnah.&quot;

As important as &quot;jihad&quot; was, it is not considered one of the &quot;pillars of Islam&quot;. According to one scholar (Majid Khadduri, this is because the five pillars are individual obligations, but &quot;jihad&quot; is a &quot;collective obligation&quot; of the Muslim community meant to be carried out by the Islamic state. This was the belief of &quot;all jurists, with almost no exception&quot;, but did not apply to &quot;defense&quot; of the Muslim community from a sudden attack, in which case &quot;jihad&quot; was an &quot;individual obligation&quot; of all believers, including women and children.

Scholars had previously claimed it was the responsibility of a centralized government to organize &quot;jihad&quot;. But this changed as the authority of the Abbasid caliph weakened. Al-Mawardi allowed local governors to wage &quot;jihad&quot; on the caliph&#x27;s behalf. This decentralization of &quot;jihad&quot; became especially pressing after the Crusades. Ali ibn Tahir al-Sulami argued that all Muslims were responsible for waging wars of self-defense. Al-Sulami encouraged Muslim rulers from distant lands to assist Muslims who were under attack.

Classical Shia doctrine maintained defensive &quot;jihad&quot; was always permissible, but offensive &quot;jihad&quot; required the presence of the Imam. An exception to this, during medieval times, was when the first Fatimid caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah claimed to be the representative of the Imam and claimed the right to launch offensive &quot;jihad&quot;.

After the Mongol invasions, Shia scholar Muhaqqiq al-Hilli claimed that defensive war was not just permissible but praiseworthy, even obligatory. If a Muslim could not take part in the defense then he should, at least, send material support. This remained the case even if the Muslims were ruled by an unjust ruler.

====Early Muslim conquests====

In the early era that inspired classical Islam (Rashidun Caliphate) and lasted less than a century, &quot;jihad&quot; spread the realm of Islam to include millions of subjects, and an area extending &quot;from the borders of India and China to the Pyrenees and the Atlantic&quot;. The role of religion in these early conquests is debated. Medieval Arabic authors claimed the conquests were commanded by God, and presented them as orderly and disciplined, under the command of the caliph. Many modern historians question whether hunger and desertification, rather than &quot;jihad&quot;, was a motivating force in the conquests. Historian William Montgomery Watt argued, &quot;Most of the participants in the [early Islamic] expeditions probably thought of nothing more than booty ... There was no thought of spreading the religion of Islam.&quot; Similarly, Edward J. Jurji argues that the motivations of the Arab conquests were certainly not &quot;the propagation of Islam...Military advantage, economic desires, [and] the attempt to strengthen the hand of the state and enhance its sovereignty...are some of the determining factors.&quot; Some recent explanations cite both material and religious causes in the conquests.

===Post-classical usage===
According to some authors, the more spiritual definitions of &quot;jihad&quot; developed sometime after the 150 years of &quot;jihad&quot; wars and Muslim territorial expansion, and particularly after the Mongol invaders sacked Baghdad and overthrew the Abbasid Caliphate. Historian Hamilton Gibb stated, &quot;in the historic [Muslim] Community the concept of &quot;jihad&quot; had gradually weakened and at length it had been largely reinterpreted in terms of Sufi ethics.&quot; notes that &quot;despite the theoretical importance of the idea of &quot;jihad&quot; in classical Islamic juristic thought&quot;, by the time of the Abbasids, the concept was no longer central to statecraft.

Rudolph Peters wrote that with the stagnation of Islamic expansionism, the concept of &quot;jihad&quot; became internalized as a moral or spiritual struggle. Earlier classical works on fiqh emphasized &quot;jihad&quot; as war for God&#x27;s religion, Peters claimed. Later Islamic scholars like Ibn al-Amir al-San&#x27;ani, Muhammad Abduh, Rashid Rida, Ubaidullah Sindhi, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Shibli Nomani, etc. emphasized the defensive aspect of &quot;jihad&quot;, distinguishing between defensive &quot;jihad&quot; ( &quot;jihad al-daf&quot;) and offensive &quot;jihad&quot; (&quot;jihad al-talab&quot; or &quot;jihad&quot; of choice ). They refuted the notion of consensus that &quot;jihad al-talab&quot; was a communal obligation(&quot;fard kifaya&quot;). In support of this view, these scholars referred to the works of classical scholars such as Al-Jassas and Ibn Taymiyyah. According to Ibn Taymiyya, the reason for &quot;jihad&quot; against non-Muslims is not their disbelief, but the threat they pose to Muslims. Citing Ibn Taymiyya, scholars including Rashid Rida, Al San&#x27;ani, and Qaradawi argued that unbelievers need not be fought unless they pose a threat to Muslims. Thus, &quot;jihad&quot; is obligatory only as defensive warfare to respond to aggression or &quot;perfidy&quot; against the Muslim community, and that the &quot;normal and desired state&quot; between Islamic and non-Islamic territories was one of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot;. This was similar to the Western &quot;Just war&quot; concept. Similarly 18th-century scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab defined &quot;jihad&quot; as a defensive military action to protect the Muslim community, and emphasized its defensive aspect in synchrony with later 20th century Islamic writers. Today, some Muslim authors only recognize as legitimate wars fought for the purpose of territorial defense as well as wars fought for the defense of religious freedom.

Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s hallmark themes included the permissibility of overthrowing a ruler who is classified as an unbeliever due to a failure to adhere to Islamic law, the absolute division of the world into &quot;dar al-kufr&quot; and &quot;dar al-Islam&quot;, labeling anyone not adhering to one&#x27;s particular interpretation of Islam as an unbeliever, and the call for warfare against Non-Muslims, particularly Jews and Christians.

Ibn Taymiyyah recognized &quot;the possibility of a &quot;jihad&quot; against `heretical` and `deviant` Muslims within &quot;dar al-Islam&quot;. He identified as heretical and deviant Muslims anyone who propagated innovations (&quot;bida&quot;&#x27;) contrary to the Qur&#x27;an and Sunna ... legitimated &quot;jihad&quot; against anyone who refused to abide by Islamic law or revolted against the true Muslim authorities.&quot; He used a broad definition of what constituted aggression or rebellion against Muslims, which would make &quot;jihad&quot; &quot;not only permissible but necessary.&quot; Ibn Taymiyyah paid careful attention to the questions of martyrdom and the benefits of &quot;jihad&quot;: &quot;It is in &quot;jihad&quot; that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world and in the Hereafter. Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness.&quot;

Bernard Lewis stated that while most Islamic theologians in the classical period (750–1258 CE) understood &quot;jihad&quot; to be a military endeavor, after Islamic conquest stagnated and the caliphate divided into smaller stated, &quot;irresistible and permanent &quot;jihad&quot; came to an end&quot;. As &quot;jihad&quot; became unfeasible it was &quot;postponed from historic to messianic time.&quot; Even when the Ottoman Empire carried on a new holy war of expansion in the seventeenth century, &quot;the war was not universally pursued&quot;. They made no attempt to recover Spain or Sicily.

By the 1500s, it had become accepted that the permanent state of relations between &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; was that of peace.

Shah Ismail of the Safavid dynasty tried to claim the right to wage offensive &quot;jihad&quot;, particularly against the Ottomans. However, Shia ulama did not permit that, maintaining the classical position that the true Imam could wage such a war. During the Qajar period, Shia ulama adopted the position that the Shah was responsible for national security. They authorized the Perso-Russian wars in the 19th century as &quot;jihad&quot;.

In the 18th century, the Durrani Empire under the reigns of Ahmad Shah Durrani and his son and successor, Timur Shah Durrani, had declared &quot;jihad&quot;s against Sikh Misls in the Punjab region, often to consolidate territory and continue Afghan their region, efforts under Ahmad Shah failed, while Timur Shah had succeeded.

===Colonialism and modernism===

When Europeans began to colonize the Muslim world, &quot;jihad&quot; was one of the first responses. Emir Abdelkader organized a &quot;jihad&quot; in Algeria against French domination, tapping into existing Sufi networks. Other wars were often declared to be &quot;jihad&quot;: the Senussi religious order declared &quot;jihad&quot; against Italian control of Libya in 1912, and the &quot;Mahdi&quot; in Sudan declared jihad against British and Egyptians in 1881.

Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh argued that peaceful coexistence should be the normal state between Muslim and non-Muslim stated, citing verses in the Qur&#x27;an that allowed war only in self-defense. However, this view left open &quot;jihad&quot; against colonialism, which was seen as an attack on Muslims.

Sayyid Ahmad Khan argued that &quot;jihad&quot; was limited to cases of oppression, and since the British Raj allowed freedom of religion, &quot;jihad&quot; against the British was unnecessary. Instead, Khan formulated &quot;jihad&quot; as recovering past Muslim scientific progress to modernize the Muslim world.

A concept that played a role in anti-colonial &quot;jihad&quot; (or lack thereof) was the belief in &quot;Mahdi&quot;. According to Islamic eschatology, a messianic figure named Mahdi will one day appear and restore justice on earth. This belief sometimes discouraged Muslims from conducting &quot;jihad&quot;, instead inducing them to wait. Such messages were circulated in Algeria to undermine Emir Abdelkader&#x27;s &quot;jihad&quot; against the French. Alternatively, this belief could be a powerful mobilizing force when someone proclaimed to be the Mahdi. Mahdist rebellions happened in India (1810), Egypt (1865) and Sudan (1881).

With the Islamic revival, a new &quot;fundamentalist&quot; movement arose, with different interpretations of Islam that increased emphasis on &quot;jihad&quot;. The Wahhabi movement that spread across the Arabian peninsula starting in the 18th century emphasized &quot;jihad&quot; as armed struggle. The Fula jihads in West Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries led to the establishment of various states, most notably the Sokoto Caliphate. None of these movements were victorious. The Sokoto Caliphate lasted for a century until it was conquered by the British and incorporated into Colonial Nigeria in 1903.

===Ottoman Jihad in World War One===
When the Ottoman caliph called for a &quot;Great &quot;Jihad&quot;&quot; Muslims against Allied powers during World War I, hopes and fears emerged that non-Turkish Muslims would side with Ottoman Turkey, but the appeal did not unite the Muslim world, and Muslims did not turn on their non-Muslim commanders in the Allied forces. (The war led to the end of the caliphate as the Ottoman Empire allied with the war&#x27;s losers and surrendered. Post-war capitulations were overturned by secularist Mustafa Kemal, who later abolished the caliphate.)

Prior to the Iranian revolution in 1922, Shiite cleric Mehdi Al-Khalissi issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; prohibiting Iraqis from participating in the Iraqi elections, as the Iraqi government had been established by foreign powers. He later played a role in the Iraqi revolt of 1920. Between 1918 and 1919 in the Shia holy city of Najaf the League of the Islamic Awakening was established by religious scholars, tribal chiefs, and landlords who assassinated a British officer in the hopes of sparking a similar rebellion in Karbala.

During the revolt, Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Shirazi, father of Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi and grandfather of Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, declared British rule impermissible and called for &quot;jihad&quot; against European occupations in the Middle East.

====Post-colonialism====

Islamism played an increasing role in the Muslim world in the 20th century, especially following the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s. One of the first Islamist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood, emphasized physical struggle and martyrdom in its creed: &quot;God is our objective; the Qur&#x27;an is our constitution; the Prophet is our leader; struggle (&quot;jihad&quot;) is our way; and death for the sake of God is the highest of our aspirations.&quot; Hassan al-Banna emphasized &quot;jihad&quot; of the sword, and called on Egyptians to &quot;jihad&quot; against the British Empire,
 (the first influential scholar since the 1857 India uprising to do so). The group called for &quot;jihad&quot; against Israel in the 1940s, and its Palestinian branch, Hamas, called for &quot;jihad&quot; against Israel during the First Intifada.

Modern Muslim thought had been focused on when to go to war (&quot;jus ad bellum&quot;), not paying much attention on conduct during war (&quot;jus in bello&quot;). This was because most Muslim theorists viewed international humanitarian law as consistent with Islamic requirements. However, Muslims later discussed conduct during war in response to terrorist groups who targeted civilians.

According to Rudolph F. Peters and Natana J. DeLong-Bas, the new &quot;fundamentalist&quot; movement brought a reinterpretation of Islam and their own writings on &quot;jihad&quot;. These writings tended to be less involved with the different of schools of Islamic law, or in solutions for all potential situations. &quot;They emphasize more the moral justifications and the underlying ethical values of the rules, than the detailed elaboration of those rules.&quot; They also tended to ignore the distinction between Greater and Lesser &quot;jihad&quot; because it distracted Muslims &quot;from the development of the combative spirit they believe is required to rid the Islamic world of Western influences&quot;.

Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists were often influenced by the ideas of Ibn Taymiyyah, and Egyptian journalist Sayyid Qutb.

Qutb preached in his book &quot;Milestones&quot; that &quot;jihad&quot;, “is not a temporary phase but a permanent war ... &quot;Jihad&quot; for freedom cannot cease until the Satanic forces are put to an end and the religion is purified for God in toto.” Qutb focused on martyrdom and &quot;jihad&quot;, adding the theme of treachery and enmity towards Islam of Christians and especially Jews. If non-Muslims were waging a &quot;war against Islam&quot;, &quot;jihad&quot; against them was defensive, not offensive. He insisted that Christians and Jews were &quot;mushrikeen&quot; (not monotheists) because (he alleged) they gave their priests or rabbis &quot;authority to make laws, obeying laws which were made by them [and] not permitted by God&quot; and &quot;obedience to laws and judgments is a sort of worship&quot;.

Later ideologue, Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj, departed from some of Qutb&#x27;s teachings. While Qutb felt that &quot;jihad&quot; was a proclamation of &quot;liberation for humanity&quot; (in which humanity has the free choice between Islam and unbelief), Faraj saw &quot;jihad&quot; as a mean of conquering the world and reestablishing the caliphate. Faraj legitimized lying, attacking by night (even accidentally killing innocents), and destroying trees of the infidel. His ideas influenced Egyptian Islamist extremist groups, and Ayman al-Zawahiri, later the leader of al-Qaeda.

During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and although it was predominantly Sunni, Afghanistan&#x27;s Shiite population took arms against the Communist government and allied Soviet forces and the nation&#x27;s Sunnis and were collectively referred to as the Afghan Mujahideen. Shiite jihadists in Afghanistan were known as the Tehran Eight and received support from the Iranian government in fighting the Communist Afghan government and allied Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

====Terrorism====
Many Muslims, including scholars like al-Qaradawi and Sayyid Tantawi, denounced Islamic terrorist attacks against civilians, seeing them as contrary to rules of &quot;jihad&quot; that prohibit targeting noncombatants. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States blamed Saudi Arabian Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan, triggering bin Laden, who in turn on October 7 issued a televised message, declaring &quot;Allah had blessed a vanguard group of Muslims, the spearhead of Islam, to destroy America.&quot; American and British forces were deployed around Afghanistan, and Mullah Mohammad Omar, also the Commander to the Faithful of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, in turn called the world&#x27;s Muslims to join him in &quot;jihad&quot;.

====Abdullah Azzam====

In the 1980s Abdullah Azzam advocated waging &quot;jihad&quot; against the &quot;unbelievers&quot;. Azzam issued a fatwa calling for &quot;jihad&quot; against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, declaring it an obligation for all able-bodied Muslims to repel invaders. His fatwa was endorsed by others, including Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz. Azzam saw Afghanistan as the beginning of &quot;jihad&quot; to repel unbelievers from many countries—the southern Soviet Republics of Central Asia, Bosnia, the Philippines, Kashmir, Somalia, Eritrea, Spain, and especially his home country of Palestine. The Soviet defeat in Afghanistan is said to have &quot;amplified the jihadist tendency from a fringe phenomenon to a major force in the Muslim world.&quot; Many fighters returned to their home countries to continue &quot;jihad&quot;, participating in insurgencies and later creating a &quot;transnational jihadist stream.&quot;

Azzam also argued for a broader interpretation of who it was permissible to kill, which may have influenced students such as bin Laden. He argued, based on his interpretation of the hadith, that it is a sin to not wage offensive &quot;jihad&quot; against the unbelievers in non-Muslim lands, continuing until only those who submit to Islam remain; expelling unbelievers from Muslim lands, contrastingly, is defensive &quot;jihad&quot;. In February 1998, bin Laden put a &quot;Declaration of the World Islamic Front for &quot;Jihad&quot; against the Jews and the Crusaders&quot; in the &quot;Al-Quds al-Arabi&quot; newspaper. He later organised the September 11 attacks against the United States.

===Shia===
In Shia Islam, &quot;jihad&quot; is one of the ten Practices of the Religion (though not one of the five pillars). Traditionally, Twelver Shi&#x27;a doctrine differed from that of Sunni Islam on the concept of &quot;jihad&quot;, with &quot;jihad&quot; seen as a &quot;lesser priority&quot; in Shia theology and &quot;armed activism&quot; by Shias &quot;limited to a person&#x27;s immediate geography&quot;.

Because of their history of oppression, Shias also associated &quot;jihad&quot; with certain passionate features, notably in the remembrance of Ashura. Mahmoud M. Ayoub says:

In Islamic tradition &quot;jihad&quot; or the struggle in the way of God, whether as armed struggle, or any form of opposition of the wrong, is generally regarded as one of the essential requirements of a person&#x27;s faith as a Muslim. Shi&#x27;î tradition carried this requirement a step further, making &quot;jihad&quot; one of the pillars or foundations (arkan) of religion. If, therefore, Husayn&#x27;s struggle against the Umayyad regime must be regarded as an act of &quot;jihad&quot;, then, In the mind of devotees, the participation of the community in his suffering and its ascent to the truth of his message must also be regarded as an extension of the holy struggle of the Imam himself. The &quot;hadith&quot; from which we took the title of this chapter stated this point very clearly. Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq is said to have declared to al-Mufaddal, one of his closest disciples, &#x27;The sigh of the sorrowful for the wrong done us is an act of praise (tasbih) [of God], his sorrow for us is an act of worship, and his keeping of our secret is a struggle (&quot;jihad&quot;) in the way of God&#x27;; the Imâm then added, &#x27;This hadith should be inscribed in letters of gold&#x27;.

and

Hence, the concept of &quot;jihad&quot; (holy struggle) gained a deeper and more personal meaning. Whether through weeping, the composition and recitation of poetry, showing compassion and doing good to the poor or carrying arms, the Shi&#x27;i Muslim saw himself helping the Imam in his struggle against the wrong (zulm) and gaining for himself the same merit (thawab) of those who actually fought and died for him. The ta&#x27;ziyah, in its broader sense the sharing of the entire life of the suffering family of Muhammad, has become for the Shi&#x27;i community the true meaning of compassion.

In the Syrian civil war, Shia and Sunni fighters waged &quot;jihad&quot; against each other. In Yemen, the Houthi Movement used appeals to &quot;jihad&quot; as part of their ideology as well as their recruitment.

==Islamic jurisprudence==
Observers have noted the evolution in the rules of &quot;jihad&quot;—from the original &quot;classical&quot; doctrine to that of 21st century Salafi jihadism. According to legal historian Sadarat Kadri, during the last few centuries, incremental changes in Islamic legal doctrine (developed by Islamists who otherwise condemn any &quot;bid‘ah&quot; (innovation) in religion), &quot;normalized&quot; what was once &quot;unthinkable&quot;. &quot;The very idea that Muslims might blow themselves up for God was unheard of before 1983, and it was not until the early 1990s that anyone anywhere had justified killing innocent Muslims who were not on a battlefield.&quot;

The first or the &quot;classical&quot; doctrine of &quot;jihad&quot; which was developed towards the end of the 8th century, emphasized the &quot;jihad&quot; of the sword (&quot;jihad bil-saif&quot;) rather than the &quot;&quot;jihad&quot; of the heart&quot;, but it contained many legal restrictions developed from interpretations of the Quran and the Hadith, such as detailed rules involving &quot;the initiation, the conduct, the termination&quot; of &quot;jihad&quot;, the treatment of prisoners, the distribution of booty, etc. Absent a sudden attack on the Muslim community, &quot;jihad&quot; was not a &quot;personal obligation&quot; (&quot;fard ayn&quot;); instead it was a &quot;collective one&quot; (&quot;fard al-kifaya&quot;), which had to be discharged &quot;in the way of God&quot; (&quot;fi sabil Allah&quot;), and could only be launched by the caliph, &quot;whose discretion over its conduct was all but absolute.&quot; (This was designed in part to avoid incidents like the Kharijia&#x27;s &quot;jihad&quot; against and killing of Caliph Ali, once they deemed that he was no longer a Muslim). Martyrdom resulting from an attack on the enemy with no concern for your own safety was praiseworthy, but dying by your own hand (as opposed to the enemy&#x27;s) merited a special place in Hell. The collective obligation to &quot;jihad&quot; is sometimes simplified as &quot;offensive &quot;jihad&quot;&quot; in Western texts.

Islamic theologian Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir has been identified as the key theorist and ideologue behind modern jihadist violence. His theological and legal justifications influenced Abu Musab al-Zarqawi of al-Qaeda as well as jihadi terrorist groups, including ISIS. Zarqawi used a manuscript of al-Muhajir&#x27;s ideas at AQI training camps that were later deployed by ISIS, referred to as &quot;The Jurisprudence of Jihad&quot; or &quot;The Jurisprudence of Blood&quot;.

The book has been described as rationalising &quot;the murder of non-combatants&quot; by Mark Towsend, citing Salah al-Ansari of Quilliam, who noted: &quot;There is a startling lack of study and concern regarding this abhorrent and dangerous text &quot;The Jurisprudence of Blood&quot; in almost all Western and Arab scholarship&quot;. Charlie Winter of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; describes it as a &quot;theological playbook used to justify the group&#x27;s abhorrent acts&quot;. He stated:

Psychologist Chris E. Stout claimed that jihadists regard their actions as &quot;for the greater good&quot;; that they are in a &quot;weakened in the earth&quot; situation that renders terrorism a valid resort.

==Usage==
The term &#x27;jihad&#x27; has accrued both violent and non-violent meanings. According to John Esposito, it can simply mean striving to live a moral and virtuous life, spreading and defending Islam as well as fighting injustice and oppression, among other things. The relative importance of the two forms of &quot;jihad&quot; is a matter of controversy. Rudoph Peters wrote that, in the contemporary world, traditionalist Muslims understand &quot;jihad&quot; from classical works on fiqh; modernist Muslims regard &quot;jihad&quot; as a just war in international law and emphasize its defensive aspects; and fundamentalists view it as an expansion of Islam and realization of Islamic ideals. David Cook wrote that Muslims understood &quot;jihad&quot; in a military sense, in both classical and contemporary texts. Cook located the idea that &quot;jihad&quot; is primarily non-violent in Sufi texts and the Western scholars who study them, or from Muslim apologists. Gallup stated that its surveys show that the concept of &quot;jihad&quot; among Muslims &quot;is considerably more nuanced than the single sense in which Western commentators invariably invoke the term&quot;.

===Muslim public opinion===
A Gallup poll asked Muslims in eight countries to define &quot;jihad&quot;. In Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and Morocco, the most frequent response was to &quot;duty toward God&quot;, a &quot;divine duty&quot;, or a &quot;worship of God&quot;, with no military connotations. In Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Indonesia, many of the responses includes &quot;sacrificing one&#x27;s life for the sake of Islam/God/a just cause&quot; or &quot;fighting against the opponents of Islam&quot;. Other common meanings of &quot;jihad&quot; in the Muslim world include &quot;a commitment to hard work&quot;, &quot;promoting peace&quot;, and &quot;living the principles of Islam&quot;. The terminology was also applied to the fight for women&#x27;s liberation.

===Other struggles===
Shia Muslim scholar Mahmoud M. Ayoud stated, &quot;The goal of true &quot;jihad&quot; is to attain a harmony between Islam (submission), iman (faith), and ihsan (righteous living).&quot; &quot;Jihad&quot; is a process encompassing both individual and social reform, this is called &quot;jihad fi sabil Allah&quot; (&quot;struggle in the way of God&quot;), and can be undertaken following the Qur&#x27;an (&quot;jihad bi-al-qur&#x27;an&quot;). According to Ayoud the greatest &quot;jihad&quot; is the struggle of every Muslim against social, moral, and political evils. However, depending on social and political circumstances, &quot;jihad&quot; may be regarded as a sixth fundamental obligation (&quot;farid&quot;) incumbent on the entire Muslim community (&quot;ummah&quot;) when their integrity is in danger, in this case &quot;jihad&quot; becomes an &quot;absolute obligation&quot; (&quot;fard &#x27;ayn&quot;), or when social and religious reform is gravely hampered. Otherwise it is a &quot;limited obligation&quot; (&quot;fard kifayah&quot;), incumbent upon those who are directly involved. These rules apply to armed struggle or &quot;&quot;jihad&quot; of the sword&quot;.

In modern times, Pakistani scholar and professor Fazlur Rahman Malik used the term to describe the struggle to establish a &quot;just moral-social order&quot;, while President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia used it to describe the struggle for economic development in that country.

According to the BBC, a third meaning of &quot;jihad&quot; is the struggle to build a good society. In a commentary of the &quot;hadith&quot; Sahih Muslim, entitled al-Minhaj, the medieval Islamic scholar Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi stated, &quot;one of the collective duties of the community as a whole (&quot;fard kifaya&quot;) is to lodge a valid protest, to solve problems of religion, to have knowledge of Divine Law, to command what is right and forbid wrong conduct&quot;.

Scholar Natana J. DeLong-Bas lists a number of types of &quot;jihad&quot; that have been proposed by Muslims:
* educational &quot;jihad&quot; (&quot;jihad al-tarbiyyah&quot;);
* missionary &quot;jihad&quot; or calling the people to Islam (&quot;jihad al-da&#x27;wah&quot;)

Other &quot;types&quot; mentioned include:
* &quot;Intellectual&quot; &quot;jihad&quot; (similar to missionary &quot;jihad&quot;).
* &quot;Economic&quot; &quot;jihad&quot; (doing good involving money such as spending within one&#x27;s means, helping the &quot;poor and the downtrodden&quot;) Bourguiba used &quot;jihad&quot; to describe the struggle for economic development. Iran has a Ministry of Jihad for Agriculture.
* &quot;Jihad Al-Nikah,&quot; or sexual jihad, &quot;refers to women joining the &quot;jihad&quot; by offering sex to fighters to boost their morale&quot;. The term originated from a &quot;fatwa&quot; believed to have been fabricated by the Syrian government to discredit its opponents, and the prevalence of this phenomenon has been disputed.

==== Usage by some non-Muslims ====
* The United States Department of Justice used various &quot;ad hoc&quot; definitions of &quot;jihad&quot; in indictments of individuals involved in terrorist activities:
** &quot;As used in this First Superseding Indictment, &quot;jihad&quot; is the Arabic word meaning &#x27;holy war&#x27;. In this context, &quot;jihad&quot; refers to the use of violence, including paramilitary action against persons, governments deemed to be enemies of the fundamentalist version of Islam.&quot;
** &quot;As used in this Superseding Indictment, &#x27;violent &quot;jihad&quot;&#x27; or &#x27;jihad&#x27; include planning, preparing for, and engaging in, acts of physical violence, including murder, maiming, kidnapping, and hostage-taking.&quot; in the indictment against several individuals including José Padilla.
* Karen Armstrong: &quot;Fighting and warfare might sometimes be necessary, but it was only a minor part of the whole &quot;jihad&quot; or struggle&quot;.
* Maxime Rodinson: &quot;&quot;Jihad&quot; is a propagandistic device which, as need be, resorts to armed struggle—two ingredients common to many ideological movements&quot;.
* Benjamin R. Barber used the term &quot;jihad&quot; to point out the resistant movement by fundamentalist ethnic groups who want to protect their traditions, heritage and identity from globalization (which he refers to as &#x27;McWorld&#x27;).

===Other groups===

====Ahmadiyya====
In Ahmadiyya Islam, &quot;jihad&quot; is primarily one&#x27;s personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives. Violence is only to be used to protect religion and one&#x27;s own life in extreme situations of persecution.

====Quranist====
Quranists do not believe that the word &quot;jihad&quot; means holy war. They believe it means to struggle, or to strive. They believe it can incorporate both military and non-military aspects. When it refers to the military aspect, it is understood primarily to be defensive warfare.

<text>A Jacobin (; ) was a member of the Jacobin Club, a revolutionary political movement that was the most famous political club during the French Revolution (1789–1799). 
The club got its name from meeting at the Dominican rue Saint-Honoré Monastery of the Jacobins. The Dominicans in France were called &quot;Jacobins&quot; (, corresponds to &quot;Jacques&quot; in French and &quot;James&quot; in English) because their first house in Paris was the
Saint Jacques Monastery.

The terms Jacobin and Jacobinism have been used in a variety of senses. Prior to 1793, the terms were used by contemporaries to describe the politics of Jacobins in the congresses of 1789 through 1792. With the ascendancy of Maximilien Robespierre and the Montagnards into 1793, they have since become synonymous with the policies of the Reign of Terror, with Jacobinism now meaning &quot;Robespierrism&quot;. As Jacobinism was memorialized through legend, heritage, tradition and other nonhistorical means over the centuries, the term acquired a &quot;semantic elasticity&quot; in French politics of the late 20th Century with a &quot;vague range of meanings&quot;, but all with the &quot;central figure of a sovereign and indivisible public authority with power over civil society.&quot; Today in France, Jacobin colloquially indicates an ardent or republican supporter of a centralized and revolutionary democracy or state as well as &quot;a politician who is hostile to any idea of weakening and dismemberment of the State.&quot;

== In the French Revolution ==
The Jacobin Club was one of several organizations that grew out of the French Revolution and it was distinguished for its left-wing, revolutionary politics. Because of this, the Jacobins, unlike other sects such as the Girondins (who were originally part of the Jacobins, but branched off), were closely allied to the sans-culottes, who were a popular force of working-class Parisians that played a pivotal role in the development of the revolution.

The Jacobins had a significant presence in the National Convention; they were dubbed &quot;the mountain&quot; or Montagnards for their seats in the uppermost part of the chamber. Eventually, the Revolution coalesced around The Mountain&#x27;s power, with the help of the insurrections of the sans-culottes, and, led by Robespierre, the Jacobins established a revolutionary dictatorship, or the joint domination of the Committee of Public Safety and Committee of General Security.

The Jacobins were known for creating a strong government that could deal with the needs of war, economic chaos, as well as internal rebellion (such as the war in the Vendée). This included establishing the world&#x27;s first universal military draft as a solution to filling army ranks to put down civil unrest and prosecute war. The Jacobin dictatorship was known for enacting the Reign of Terror, which targeted speculators, monarchists, right-wing Girondin, Hébertists, and traitors, and led to many beheadings.

The Jacobins supported the rights of property, but represented a much more middle-class position than the government that succeeded them in Thermidor.

They favored free trade and a market economy much like the Girondists, but their relationship to the people made them more willing to adopt interventionist economic policies. Unlike the Girondins, their economic policy favored price controls (&quot;i.e.&quot;, General maximum) on staples like grain and select household and grocery goods to address economic problems. Using the &quot;armée revolutionnaire&quot;, they targeted farmers, the rich and others who may have stocks of essential goods (&quot;goods of the first necessity&quot;) in service of a national distribution system with severe punishment for uncooperative hoarders.

Another tenet of Jacobinism is a secularism that includes the elimination of existing religions in favor of one run by the state (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the cults of Reason and the Supreme Being).

Jacobinism was as an ideology thus developed and implemented during the French Revolution of 1789. In the words of François Furet, in &quot;Penser la révolution française&quot; (quoted by Hoel in Introduction au Jacobinisme...), &quot;Jacobinism is both an ideology and a power: a system of representations and a system of action.&quot; (&quot;le jacobinisme est à la fois une idéologie et un pouvoir : un système de représentations et un système d&#x27;action&quot;). Its political goals were largely achieved later during France&#x27;s Third Republic.

== France ==
Jacobinism did not end with the Jacobins. The Robespierrist François-Noël Babeuf eventually rejected the rule of the Jacobins and welcomed the end of the Terror. However, he later eschewed the Thermidorean Reaction that overthrew the Jacobins and he returned to Robespierrism. In May 1796, he led a failed coup d&#x27;état with neo-Robespierrists to attempt to return the republic to the Montagnard Constitution of 1793 in the Conspiracy of Equals. His political ideology was a form of neo-Jacobinism and primordial communism that highlighted egalitarian division of all land and property enforced by a dictatorship run by the Equals. His ideas were widely publicized and further developed as &quot;Babeuvism&quot; by colleague Filippo Buonaroti in his 1828 book, &quot;Histoire de la Conspiration Pour l&#x27;Égalité Dite de Babeuf&quot; (&quot;History of Babeuf&#x27;s Conspiracy for Equality&quot;).

Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx called the Conspiracy of Equals &quot;the first appearance of a truly active Communist party.&quot; Leon Trotsky echoed these sentiments, stating that the foundation of the Communist International marked a &quot;carrying on in direct succession the heroic endeavours and martyrdom of a long line of revolutionary generations from Babeuf.&quot;

Himself a Robespierrist, Buonaroti went on to write &quot;Observations sur Maximilien Robespierre&quot; in 1836, which extolled the Jacobin leader as a legend and hero. His portrayal of Robespierre as a model for socialist revolutionaries greatly influenced young socialists and republicans, such as Albert Laponneraye.

The 19th century socialist firebrand, nationalist and founder of Blanquism, Louis Auguste Blanqui expressed admiration for Jacobin leaders of the Terror like Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, framing them in messianic terms. There is evidence that his principles were also instructed by Babeuvism through his familiarity with Buonarroti. After the French Revolution of 1848, he criticized contemporaries who claimed to be heirs of Jacobinism, writing: &quot;Our own self-styled Montagnards are a caricature, indeed a very poor copy, of the Girondins.&quot; His view of Robespierre later changed over an understanding of the Terror&#x27;s executions of Georges Danton and the Hébertists, as well as the formation of the Cult of the Supreme Being, the latter due to Blanqui&#x27;s promotion of materialism and atheism. According to Blanqui, the Hebertists were the true revolutionaries in defending atheism, science and equality. He said that socialism needed to be built on the foundations laid by the French Revolution, and would better defend the ideals of the Enlightenment than Jacobinism, adding the toast, &quot;Citizens, the Mountain is dead! To socialism, its sole heir!&quot;

Various French left-wing parties would claim to be the &quot;true heirs&quot; to the French Revolution and the 1871 Paris Commune. Aspects of Blanqui were likewise claimed by French political groups like the Radical Socialists and the Stalinists. Other organizations included the French Central Revolutionary Committee and its successor, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and the Blanquist section of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association or First International.

On 4 October 1919, Alexandre Varenne founded the socialist daily &quot;La Montagne, Quotidien de la Démocratie Socialiste du Center&quot;. The title was selected to reflect its alignment with the ideas of the Montagnards.

In the 1930s, the Popular Front coalition included the French Communist Party or &quot;Parti communiste français&quot; (PCF), who along with portions of the alliance&#x27;s socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) party increasingly emphasized patriotism. The PCF were characterized as &quot;New Jacobins&quot;, and their leader Maurice Thorez as a &quot;Stalinist Jacobin&quot;.

On the French right, the nazi-collaborating founder of Neosocialism Marcel Déat was known to be inspired by Jacobin politics.

== India ==

In 1794, Frenchmen in the Kingdom of Mysore allegedly established the &quot;Jacobin Club of Mysore&quot; with the assistance of its ruler Tipu Sultan, who purportedly declared himself &quot;Citizen Tipoo&quot;. During the subsequent Fourth Anglo-Mysore War of 1799, British forces captured French volunteers led by François Ripaud who were serving under Mysorean command. French historian Jean Boutier argued that senior officials of the East India Company fabricated the club&#x27;s existence to justify their war against Mysore.

==Italy==

Blanquism had a notable influence on Benito Mussolini who founded fascism as an outgrowth of revolutionary socialism. He claimed he &quot;introduced into Italian socialism something of (Henri) Bergson mixed with much of Blanqui,&quot; including Blanqui&#x27;s nationalism, the idea of rule by a dominant minority and use of violence. However, Mussolini dispensed with Blanquism&#x27;s links to the Enlightenment and communism and instead stated, fascism is &quot;opposed to all individualistic abstractions based on eighteenth century materialism; and it is opposed to all Jacobinistic utopias and innovations.&quot; The masthead of his newspaper Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia carried quotes from Blanqui (&quot;Whoever has steel has bread&quot;) and Napoleon Bonaparte (&quot;The Revolution is an idea which has found bayonets!&quot;). Leon Trotsky called fascism in a sense &quot;a caricature of Jacobinism&quot;.

==Poland==
King Stanisław II August was enamored with the American Constitution, the ideals of the Gironde of 1790–1792, and the office of &quot;Roi Citoyen&quot; (&quot;Citizen King&quot;). He helped develop the 1791 Polish Constitution which embraced social reforms guaranteeing &quot;the freedom, property and equality of every citizen.&quot; Its ratification led some Society of the Friends of the Constitution chapters to endorse the King and his &quot;Rzeczypospolita&quot; and helped shape the French constitution adopted later that year.

While the Constitutionalists had contacts with Jacobin Clubs, they were expressly not Jacobins. However prior to the 1792 war that crushed the republic, Russian Empress Catherine the Great claimed the constitution was the work of the Jacobins and that she would be &quot;fighting Jacobinism in Poland&quot; and &quot;the Jacobins of Warsaw&quot;.

==Russia and Soviet Union==
The 1870s saw the emergence of the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Marseillaise&quot;, a Russian revolutionary song set to a Robert Schumann melody inspired by the 1792 &quot;Marseillaise&quot;. It was used as a national anthem by the Russian Provisional Government and in Soviet Russia for a short time alongside &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

In the early 20th Century, Bolshevism and Jacobinism were linked. Russia&#x27;s notion of the French Revolution permeated educated society and was reflected in speeches and writings of leaders, including Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. They modeled their revolution after the Jacobins and the Terror with Trotsky even envisioning a trial for Nicholas II akin to that for Louis XVI. Lenin regarded the execution of the former tsar and his immediate family as necessary, highlighting the precedent set in the French Revolution. At the same time, the Bolsheviks consciously tried to avoid the mistakes they saw made by the French revolutionaries.

Lenin referred to Robespierre as a &quot;Bolshevik &quot;&quot;&quot; and erected a statue to him. Other statues were planned or erected of other prominent members of the Terror as well as Babeuf. The Voskresenskaya Embankment in St. Petersburg was also renamed &quot;Naberezhnaya Robespera&quot; for the French leader in 1923; it was returned to its original name in 2014.

Like Karl Marx, Lenin saw the overall progress in events in France from 1789 through 1871 as the French Bourgeois Revolution. He adhered to the Montagnards&#x27; policies of centralization of authority to stabilize a new state, the virtue and necessity of terror against oppressors and &quot;an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry&quot; (&quot;the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasants&quot;). He would refer to his side as the Mountain or Jacobin and label his Menshevik opponents as the &quot;Gironde&quot;.

== United Kingdom ==
The conventionalized scrawny, French revolutionary &quot;sans-culottes&quot; Jacobin, was developed from about 1790 by British satirical artists James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson and George Cruikshank. It was commonly contrasted with the stolid stocky conservative and well-meaning John Bull, dressed like an English country squire. C. L. R. James also used the term to refer to revolutionaries during the Haitian Revolution in his book &quot;The Black Jacobins&quot;.

Thomas Paine was a believer in the French Revolution and supported the Girondins. At the same time, Protestant Dissenters seeking for relief from the Test and Corporation Acts supported the French Revolution at least in its early stages after seeing concessions to religious minorities by the French authorities in 1787 and in the Declaration of Rights of Man. Paine&#x27;s publications enjoyed support by Painite Radical factions like the Manchester Constitutional Society. Prominent members of the Society who worked for the Radical &quot;Manchester Herald&quot; newspaper even contacted the Jacobin Club in France on 13 April 1792. Thus, Radicals were labeled &quot;Jacobins&quot; by their opponents. Regional Painite radicalism was incorrectly portrayed as English Jacobinism and were attacked by Conservative forces including Edmund Burke as early as 1791. The London Revolution Society also corresponded with the National Assembly starting in November 1789. Their letters were circulated among the regional Jacobin clubs, with around 52 clubs corresponding with the society by the spring of 1792. Other regional British revolutionary societies formed in centers of British Jacobinism. English Jacobins included the young Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and others prior to their disillusionment with the outbreak of the Reign of Terror. Others, such as Paine, William Hazlitt and Whig statesman Charles James Fox, remained idealistic about the Revolution.

The London Corresponding Society founded in 1792 was partly modeled on the Jacobins to pressure the government in a law-abiding manner for democratic reform. Scottish chapters of the Societies of the Friends of the People pressed for parliamentary reform at the 1792 Scottish Convention in Edinburgh using explicit imitations of the Jacobins.

Overall, after 1793 with the sidelining of the Girondins and the Terror, &quot;Jacobin&quot; became a pejorative for radical left-wing revolutionary politics and was linked to sedition. The word was further promoted in England by George Canning&#x27;s 1797–98 newspaper &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot; and later, John Gifford&#x27;s 1798–1821 &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;, which both criticized the English Radicals of the 18th and 19th centuries. Much detail on English Jacobinism can be found in E. P. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot;.

Welsh Jacobins include William Jones, a radical patriot who was a keen disciple of Voltaire. Rather than preaching revolution, Jones believed that an exodus from Wales was required and that a new Welsh colony should be founded in the United States.

The socialist Chartist movement in the first half of the 19th Century was inspired by Robespierre. Chartist leader James Bronterre O&#x27;Brien defended Robespierre, describing him as &quot;one of the greatest men, and one of the purest and most enlightened reformers, that ever existed in the world.&quot; He came to Robespierre through his studies of Buonarroti and even served as Buonarroti&#x27;s translator for the English edition of &quot;Buanarroti&#x27;s History of Babeuf&#x27;s Conspiracy for Equality,&quot; for which he further included his own observations.

== Austria ==
In the correspondence of Austrian statesman and diplomat Prince Klemens von Metternich and other leaders of the repressive policies that followed the second fall of Napoleon in 1815, &quot;Jacobin&quot; is the term commonly applied to anyone with progressive tendencies, such as the emperor Alexander I of Russia.

== United States ==
Federalists often characterized Thomas Jefferson, who himself had intervened in the French Revolution, and his Democratic-Republican party as Jacobins. Early Federalist-leaning American newspapers during the French Revolution referred to the Democratic-Republican party as the &quot;Jacobin Party&quot;. The most notable examples are the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot;, published in Philadelphia, and the &quot;Delaware and Eastern-Shore Advertiser&quot;, published in Wilmington, during the elections of 1800.

In modern American politics, the term Jacobin is often used to describe extremists of any party who demand ideological purity.

Evidencing the antagonistic relationship between the press and insurgent Arizona conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, &quot;The New York Times&quot; attacked Goldwater in their Bastille Day coverage of the 1964 Republican National Convention. The paper called his supporters &quot;Cactus Jacobins&quot;, comparing their opposition to &quot;establishment&quot; Eastern Republicans (see Rockefeller Republican) and &quot;sensation‐seeking columnists and commentators&quot; as expressed by moderate former president Dwight Eisenhower to the execution of representatives of the Ancien Régime in the Reign of Terror. In contrast, L. Brent Bozell, Jr. has written in Goldwater&#x27;s seminal &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot; (1960) that &quot;Throughout history, true Conservatism has been at war equally with autocrats and with &#x27;democratic&#x27; Jacobins.&quot;

In 2010 an American left-wing socialist publication, &quot;Jacobin&quot;, was founded.

On 27 May 2010 issue of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Columbia university political science and humanities professor and self-described liberal Mark Lilla analyzed three recent books dealing with American political party discontent in a review titled &quot;The Tea Party Jacobins&quot;. On the other side, historian Victor Davis Hanson likened the rise and policies of leftists in the Democratic Party in 2019 to the Jacobins and Jacobinism.

== Influence ==
The political rhetoric and populist ideas espoused by the Jacobins would lead to the development of the modern leftist movements throughout the 19th and 20th century, with Jacobinism being the political foundation of almost all leftist schools of thought including anarchism, communism and socialism. The Paris Commune was seen as the revolutionary successor to the Jacobins. The undercurrent of radical and populist tendencies espoused and enacted by the Jacobins would create a complete cultural and societal shock within the traditional and conservative governments of Europe, leading to new political ideas of society emerging. Jacobin rhetoric would lead to increasing secularization and skepticism towards the governments of Europe throughout the 1800s. This complex and complete revolution in political, societal and cultural structure, caused in part by the Jacobins, had lasting impact throughout Europe, with such societal revolutions throughout the 1800s culminating in the Revolutions of 1848.

Jacobin populism and complete structural destruction of the old order led to an increasingly revolutionary spirit throughout Europe and such changes would contribute to new political foundations. It also informed new political ideologies. For instance in France, Georges Valois, founder of the first non-Italian fascist party Faisceau, claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the Jacobin movement. While fascism bears similarities to Jacobinism particularly as a democratic nationalism fighting against an existing order, it is difficult to directly trace such lineage. Fascist groups themselves have held a variety of opinions mostly negative about the French Revolution, with the German National Socialists straightforwardly condemning it. Italian fascists called on fascism to surpass the French Revolution &quot;with a new kind of democracy run by producers.&quot; Some French fascists were ambivalent or admired parts of Jacobinism and the Revolution. Valois on the other hand saw the Revolution as the start of a movement both socialist and nationalist, which fascists would complete.

Leftist organizations would take different elements from Jacobin&#x27;s core foundation. Anarchists took influence from the Jacobins use of mass movements, direct democracy and left-wing populism which would influence the tactics of direct action. Some Marxists would take influence from the extreme protectionism of the Jacobins and the notion of the vanguard defender of the republic which would later evolve into vanguardism. The Jacobin philosophy of a complete dismantling of an old system, with completely radical and new structure, is historically seen as one of the most revolutionary and important movements throughout modern history.

<text>Johann Tobias Krebs (7 July 1690 – 11 February 1762) was a German organist and composer, today best remembered as the father of Johann Ludwig Krebs, one of Bach&#x27;s most accomplished pupils.

Krebs was born in Heichelheim and went to school in the nearby Weimar. Nothing is known about his early musical training, but at age 20 Krebs was proficient enough at the keyboard to be invited to become organist at Buttelstedt, another town in the same area. Krebs accepted, but continued his music studies in Weimar, travelling there twice a week to study with Johann Gottfried Walther, and later with Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1721 he was accepted a position at Buttstädt, where he played the organ of Michaeliskirche and taught at the school. Krebs remained in Buttstädt for the rest of his life. He had three sons, and the eldest, Johann Ludwig Krebs, became a well-known composer.

Krebs&#x27; surviving works are scarce. A few chorale preludes preserved in manuscripts show a marked fondness for counterpoint. Two of the lesser known pieces from the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis catalogue may have been composed by Krebs: 
* Chorale prelude &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;, BWV 660b, an arrangement of one of Bach&#x27;s Leipzig Chorales, &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;, BWV 660
* Trio in C minor, BWV Anh. 46, a contrapuntal trio which bears some similarity to Bach&#x27;s organ trio sonatas
In addition, Johann Tobias Krebs and his eldest son are among the list of potential composers of the &quot;Eight Short Preludes and Fugues&quot;, BWV 553–560, once attributed to Bach.

<text>Joseph Gurney Cannon (May 7, 1836 – November 12, 1926) was an American politician from Illinois and leader of the Republican Party. Cannon represented parts of Illinois in the United States House of Representatives for twenty-three non-consecutive terms between 1873 and 1923; upon his retirement, he was the longest serving member of the United States Congress ever. From 1903 to 1911, he presided as Speaker of the House, becoming one of the most powerful speakers in United States history.

As the Speaker during most of the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, Cannon was an obstacle to the progressive policies advanced by Roosevelt and later abandoned by Taft. A revolt against Cannon&#x27;s authority as Speaker, led by George W. Norris, was a contributing factor to the Republican Party split in the elections of 1910 and 1912 and led to significant reforms to the House rules.

The Cannon House Office Building, the oldest congressional office building, was named for him in 1962.

==Early life and education==
Cannon was born in Guilford County, North Carolina. on May 7, 1836. He was the elder of two sons of Horace Franklin Cannon, a country doctor, and Gulielma Cannon (née Hollingsworth).

The Cannon family were Quakers and, like most members of their faith, opposed to slavery. Abhorring the practice and fearing war, the Cannons were among the many Quakers who left the South for the Western frontier. In 1840, his family moved west with other North Carolina Quakers, settling about 30 miles north of Terre Haute along the Wabash River. Their new settlement became Annapolis, Indiana. Horace Cannon drowned on August 7, 1851, as he tried to reach a sick patient by crossing a creek. Joe Cannon, aged fifteen, became head of the family and took charge of the family farm. He worked as a clerk in a country store to save money and, after five years, the family were able to pay their mortgage.

Cannon became fascinated by the law when asked to testify in a slander case on behalf of a friend represented by John Palmer Usher. He studied under Usher at his Terre Haute office and used the remainder of his savings to enroll in law school at the University of Cincinnati. In 1858, he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Terre Haute, Indiana, but was disappointed when Usher refused to offer him a place in his office. He relocated to Shelbyville, Illinois but failed to attract clients, and from there moved on to Tuscola, county seat of the newly organized Coles County. His choice of a new hometown was involuntary; while travelling from Shelbyville to Chicago to find more clients, he ran out of money. He boarded a Chicago-bound train in Mattoon but was removed from the train in Tuscola after failing to show a ticket.

While building his law practice, Cannon became a follower of Abraham Lincoln during the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858. He launched his first campaign for the office of state&#x27;s attorney for Coles County in 1860 but was defeated. However, he was elected in 1861 as state&#x27;s attorney for the twenty-seventh judicial district, after the Republican legislature reformed the state judicial system. Cannon remained in that position until 1872, when he was elected to the U.S. House.

== Early House career ==
In 1872, Cannon ran for the U.S. House as an anti-reform candidate supportive of President Ulysses S. Grant. He later recalled it as &quot;a reform year, the beginning of a decade of &#x27;reform&#x27; which shook up the virtues as well as the vices of the people. Nothing was right and nobody was safe from the reformers.&quot; Despite this, Cannon was elected to represent Illinois&#x27;s 14th district, which included nearby Danville, in the 43rd Congress.

Initially, Cannon focused on purely local issues. He secured an appointment to the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, from which he promoted a bill to provide that postage on newspapers and magazines should be prepaid by publishers, rather than by the subscribers after arrival. Despite opposition from the publishing industry, the measure passed both houses of Congress and became law. His maiden speech in the House was a defense of this bill and the free mailing of seed. Upon a remark by William Walter Phelps that Cannon &quot;must have oats in his pocket,&quot; the freshman Representative exclaimed, &quot;Yes! I have oats in my pocket and hayseed in my hair, and the Western people generally are affected the same way. And we expect that the seed, being good, will yield a good crop.&quot; The incident gained Cannon an instant national reputation as an advocate for farmers, though he would frequently bemoan that the press treated him as a caricature, rather than giving serious consideration to his legislative proposals.

In 1889, Cannon stood as a candidate for Speaker of the House, but finished a poor third behind Thomas Brackett Reed and William McKinley. Instead, Cannon was named (alongside Reed and McKinley) to the powerful Committee on Rules. As his career progressed, Cannon had gained a reputation for partisan loyalty which was made evident in the 51st Congress. For example, he led opposition within the Republican Party to the Lodge Federal Elections Bill, but after the party caucus approved the bill by one vote, Cannon aided Speaker Reed in passing the bill on an expedited process by a party-line vote. Likewise, when Reed introduced dramatic reforms to the House Rules, Cannon vigorously pressed the issue both in committee and in the whole House. As a consequence of his efforts, Cannon was among the many House Republicans unseated in the 1890 elections.

Cannon was out of office for only one term; he was elected again in 1892. After Reed&#x27;s abrupt retirement in 1899, Cannon stood again for the Speakership but was defeated by David B. Henderson of Iowa. Cannon finally became Speaker in 1903, at the start of the 58th Congress. From 1895 until he became Speaker, Cannon chaired the powerful Appropriations Committee.

== Speaker of the House (19031911) ==
=== Theodore Roosevelt presidency ===
At the time Cannon was elevated to Speaker, the President was Theodore Roosevelt, a fellow Republican. Roosevelt immediately took steps to consult Cannon on legislative matters and the two met several times a week at Roosevelt&#x27;s request. However, unlike Roosevelt, Cannon opposed most of the progressive reform efforts of the day, including conservation, women&#x27;s suffrage, the labor movement, and especially reductions in the overall tariff rate. Cannon also came to personally oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s demanding, autocratic personality, once asserting that Roosevelt had &quot;no more use for the Constitution than a tomcat has for a marriage license.&quot; On another occasion, he said, &quot;That fellow at the other end of the Avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.&quot;

At the time of Cannon&#x27;s election, the Speaker of the House concurrently held the chair of the Rules Committee, which determined under what rules and restrictions bills could be debated, amended, and voted on, and, in some cases, whether they would be allowed on the floor at all. As such, Cannon effectively controlled every aspect of the House&#x27;s agenda: bills reached the floor of the House only if Cannon approved of them, and then in whatever form he determined – with Cannon himself deciding whether and to what extent the measures could be debated and amended. Cannon also reserved to himself the right to appoint not only the chairs of the various House committees, but also all of the committees&#x27; members, and (despite the seniority system that had begun to develop) used that power to appoint his allies and proteges to leadership positions while punishing those who opposed his legislation.

Cannon wielded the Speaker&#x27;s authority with unprecedented severity. While his predecessor Thomas Brackett Reed was noted for his dramatic expansion of the Speaker&#x27;s authority, Cannon distinguished himself by the manner in which he wielded that authority. According to historian Booth Mooney, &quot;The deadly rapier wielded by Reed gave way to a bludgeon, which at first he used only to knock down Democrats.&quot; Though Reed had been lampooned as a &quot;Czar,&quot; press treatment of &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Cannon was far more critical during his first term as Speaker. Cannon was criticized by the Democratic press for the arbitrary exercise of his considerable power; on one voice vote, he ruled, &quot;The ayes make the most noise, but the nays have it.&quot; On another occasion, Representative Cordell Hull attempted to offer an income tax amendment to a tariff bill, and Cannon simply ignored him. When one Representative was asked by a constituent for a copy of the House Rules, the Representative simply sent back a picture of Speaker Cannon. When confronted with criticisms directly, Cannon would respond that the power he exercised was granted by the whole House, which reserved the authority to amend the Rules or vote him out as Speaker.

Early in his term, Cannon was largely free from opposition within the House majority. His wrath was typically reserved for the Senate, and in conference committees he was a vigorous defender of the House position on legislation, winning him support and admiration from his colleagues. He continued to enjoy the public support of the President, who praised him in 1906 as &quot;a patriotic American... for every man, rich or poor, capitalist or labor man, so long as he is a decent American, and [Cannon] is entitled to our support because he is a patriotic man.&quot;

After the 1906 election, the relationship between Cannon and Roosevelt began to fray. Roosevelt, who had already announced he would not campaign in 1908, adopted a more progressive stance against major corporations. Roosevelt&#x27;s new proposals for a Pure Food and Drug Act, an income tax, an inheritance tax, a federal corporation law, government involvement in labor disputes, laws regulating the labor of women and children, and regulation of railroad securities all drew opposition from Cannon. Quoting John Morley, Cannon began to frequently refer to Roosevelt as &quot;half St. Paul, half St. Vitus.&quot; Rumors began to spread that Roosevelt would look to supplant Cannon as speaker, in order to hasten his legislative agenda through the House, but Roosevelt never addressed them, and Cannon survived as Speaker through Roosevelt&#x27;s term in office.
=== William Howard Taft presidency ===

==== 1908 elections ====
As early as 1905, Cannon had expressed confidence that he was a contender for the 1908 presidential nomination. Ultimately, Roosevelt was able to maneuver the delegates at the 1908 Republican National Convention in support of William Howard Taft, his Secretary of War. Cannon received 51 of the 54 Illinois delegates and a handful from other states, finishing a distant fourth. Taft was nominated easily on the first ballot. Nevertheless, Cannon was influential at the convention, engineering the party platform and the nomination of conservative James S. Sherman of New York, one of his strongest House allies, for vice president.

During the 1908 campaign, Cannon came under heavy fire from the press, which denounced him as a tyrant and obstacle to every piece of progressive legislation introduced in the prior thirty years. One cartoon depicted him as the &quot;Unrepentant Defendant&quot; in the court trial of &quot;Predatory Wealth&quot; for its victimization of &quot;The Common People.&quot; For his part, Cannon attributed the newspaper opposition to his refusal to support Roosevelt&#x27;s proposal to permit the duty-free importation of newsprint and wood pulp, as well as his very first House bill which passed the cost of magazine and newspaper subscriptions to publishers.

The Democratic Party seized on the issue of House reform, stating in their party platform, &quot;The House of Representatives, as controlled in recent years by the Republican party, has ceased to be a deliberative and legislative body, responsive to the will of a majority of its members, but has come under the absolute domination of the Speaker, who has entire control of its deliberations and powers of legislation. ... Legislative government becomes a failure when one member, in the person of the Speaker, is more powerful than the entire body.&quot; William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, and labor leader Samuel Gompers each visited Illinois to campaign against Cannon&#x27;s re-election. Even some Republicans, including Nebraska representative George W. Norris, campaigned against &quot;Cannonism.&quot; Taft himself privately admitted, &quot;the great weight I have to carry in this campaign is Cannonism.&quot; Nevertheless, Taft and the Republicans won an easy victory in the fall elections; Norris, who had distinguished himself as an intra-party rival to Cannon&#x27;s power, won re-election by only 22 votes.
==== 1910 rules revolt ====
When the 61st Congress met in March 1909, Roosevelt and Taft agreed that Cannon could not be removed as Speaker. The large Republican majority carried him to another term in office, though a core of twelve &quot;Insurgent&quot; members refused to vote for him. However, the new Democratic floor leader, Champ Clark, forced a roll-call vote on the usually uncontested vote to adopt the rules of the previous Congress. An amendment was ultimately adopted, with Democratic and Insurgent votes, to revise certain rules, including the introduction of a unanimous consent calendar for those bills which were not contested. In retaliation, Cannon removed three Insurgents from committee chairs and moved others to less significant committees. To the press, Cannon said, &quot;Judas was an insurgent and sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver. I have no doubt he would have been applauded by the newspapers in Jerusalem had there been any in that day.&quot;

As Cannon&#x27;s power continued to expand, his relationship with Taft continued to decline. Taft stayed out of House business, neither aiding nor opposing Cannon, but he privately noted that it was his wish to have Cannon removed. Cannon likewise grew critical of Taft, particularly after his elevation of Edward Douglass White, a Catholic Democrat, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. A growing movement within the Republican Party came to support Cannon&#x27;s removal as Speaker, for pragmatic reasons; Henry Cabot Lodge advised Roosevelt that the Republicans would lose the House if Cannon remained, Taft expressed that such removal would &quot;accord... with the welfare of the Republican party,&quot; and various Republican newspapers suggested his resignation as Speaker or even from Congress. In the face of growing opposition, Cannon grew defiant. He said, &quot;I will say positively that I will not retire from Congress until my constituents fail to give me a majority.&quot; In one public meeting, he pulled open his coat and shouted, &quot;Behold Mr. Cannon, the Beelzebub of Congress! Gaze on this noble manly formme, Beelzebub! Me, the Czar!&quot; Of the Insurgents, he remarked that they were &quot;dishonest and disgruntled&quot;; he accused them of introducing demagogic bills which would never be approved, then telling the &quot;ignorant element&quot; of their constituents that Cannon had personally stopped the bill, &quot;thus creating the belief that the Speaker was a &#x27;Czar&#x27; and controlled by the &#x27;interests.&#x27;&quot;

On March 16, 1910, Cannon&#x27;s power began to crack when the House voted against his ruling on a matter of procedure. Edgar Crumpacker, chair of the Committee on the Census, introduced a joint resolution regarding the upcoming census. Though the resolution was not in the order of business, Crumpacker argued that the matter was constitutionally privileged, as the census was mandated by the Constitution, and the Constitution overrode any House rule. Cannon ruled in favor of the argument, but the House majority voted not to sustain his ruling. It was rare for the House to reject a Speaker&#x27;s ruling, and Cannon bitterly remarked that his &quot;face [had been] rubbed in the sand.&quot; Sensing an opening, George Norris took the opportunity. The next day, Norris introduced a prepared resolution to create a new Rules Committee with fifteen members, all elected by the House. The Speaker, who had been the chair of the Rules Committee &quot;ex officio&quot; since 1880, would be barred from membership, thus placing the Committee (and ostensibly the House) above the Speaker&#x27;s authority, with the power to revise that authority. Like Crumpacker, Norris claimed his resolution was constitutionally privileged under Article I, Section 5: &quot;Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings...&quot; and therefore should be heard immediately by the whole House. Having used Cannon&#x27;s own ruling against him, Norris placed the Speaker in a double-bind. Cannon immediately denounced the resolution as &quot;anarchy under the color of law,&quot; but hurriedly withdrew to whip votes against it. His lieutenants delayed through dilatory tactics while loyal members returned to the Capitol, but after a weekend recess, Cannon proved unable to rally support to his side. On March 19, Cannon ruled Norris&#x27;s resolution out of order, citing a long list of precedential rulings by prior Speakers, but the House again overruled him on appeal, by a vote of 182 to 163. The House immediately voted on the resolution itself, and it passed with 42 Republican and all 149 Democratic votes by the margin of 191 to 156. Cannon did maintain his position as Speaker by entertaining an immediate motion to vacate, which he won handily since the Republican majority would not risk a Democratic speaker replacing him. However, his iron rule of the House was broken.

The new Rules Committee, chaired by John Dalzell, passed a flurry of reforms, including a discharge rule empowering a majority to remove bills from committee and a &quot;Calendar Wednesday,&quot; allowing committees to present bills otherwise blocked from consideration by the Speaker&#x27;s scheduling. Despite the dramatic reduction in Cannon&#x27;s powers, Republican prospects for the upcoming election did not improve. The Democrats won control of the House in the 1910 midterm elections for the first time since 1894; Cannon himself struggled for his re-election.
== Later House career ==
After Republicans became the minority party in the House, Cannon refused to serve as minority leader. He returned as ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, which he had chaired before his term as Speaker. While as chair he had favored lower spending, as ranking member he presented numerous expenditure measures to the Democratic majority. When the Insurgents&#x27; revolt of 1910 evolved into the Republican Party split of 1912, Cannon was defeated for re-election. He returned in 1914 and was re-elected each congressional election until 1920. He was a critic of President Woodrow Wilson and U.S. entry into World War I. He was also an outspoken critic of Wilson&#x27;s League of Nations.

Cannon declined to run in the 1922 congressional election and retired at the end of his last term in 1923; he was featured on the cover of the first issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on the last day of his last term in office.

==Personal life==
Cannon was one of the charter members of Tuscola&#x27;s Masonic Lodge No. 332, which was founded on October 2, 1860.

Cannon married Mary Reed in 1862. They had two daughters. In 1876, Cannon moved his family to Danville, Illinois, where he resided for the rest of his life.

Born a Quaker, he became a Methodist after leaving Congress. However, he may have been effectively a Methodist long before this. After marrying in a Methodist service, a Quaker encouraged him to express regret for this, to which Cannon replied, &quot;If you mean that I am to get up in meeting and say that I am sorry I married Mary, I won&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;m sorry and I&#x27;m damned if I will say I am.&quot;

Cannon died in his residence in Danville on November 12, 1926, while in a deep sleep. He had a weakened heart and also suffered from the general effects of old age. He was buried in Spring Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The first building of offices for congressmen outside of the United States Capitol building was named after Cannon.

=== Public image ===
His antic speaking style, diminutive stature and pugnacious manner were his trademarks. The newspapers frequently lampooned him as a colorful rube.

Despite his reputation for tyranny in the House, Cannon was well-liked by colleagues and friends in Washington, including members of the opposition.

=== Length of service ===
Cannon is to date the second longest-serving Republican Representative, surpassed only by Alaska congressman Don Young, and also was the first member of Congress of either party ever to surpass 40 years of service (non-consecutive). His congressional career spanned 46 years of cumulative service, a concurrent 50 years, barring two terms after which he came back—a record not broken until 1959. He is the longest-serving member ever of the House of Representatives in Illinois, although the longest continuous service belongs to Adolph J. Sabath. He served in the House during the terms of 11 presidents, a record he shares with John Dingell and Jamie Whitten.

Cannon is to date the second-longest continuously serving Republican Speaker in history, after another Illinoisan, Dennis Hastert, who surpassed him on June 1, 2006.
