<text>Jewish holidays, also known as Jewish festivals or Yamim Tovim (, or singular , in transliterated Hebrew []), are holidays observed by Jews throughout the Hebrew calendar. They include religious, cultural and national elements, derived from three sources: &quot;mitzvot&quot; (&quot;biblical commandments&quot;), rabbinic mandates, the history of Judaism, and the State of Israel.

Jewish holidays occur on the same dates every year in the Hebrew calendar, but the dates vary in the Gregorian. This is because the Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar (based on the cycles of both the sun and moon), whereas the Gregorian is a solar calendar. Each holiday can only occur on certain days of the week, four for most, but five for holidays in Tevet and Shevat and six for Hanukkah (see Days of week on Hebrew calendar).
==General concepts==

===Groupings===
Certain terms are used very commonly for groups of holidays.
* The Hebrew-language term &quot;Yom Tov&quot; (), sometimes referred to as &quot;festival day&quot;, usually refers to the six biblically mandated festival dates on which all activities prohibited on Shabbat are prohibited, except for some related to food preparation. These include the first and seventh days of Passover (the Feast of Unleavened Bread / the Feast of Matzot – Exodus 23:15, Deuteronomy 16:16), [first day of] Shavuot, both days of Rosh Hashanah, first day of Sukkot, and [first day of] Shemini Atzeret. By extension, outside the Land of Israel, the second-day holidays known under the rubric &quot;Yom tov sheni shel galuyot&quot; (literally, &quot;Second &quot;Yom Tov&quot; of the Diaspora&quot;)—including Simchat Torah—are also included in this grouping. Colloquially, Yom Kippur, a biblically mandated date on which even food preparation is prohibited, is often included in this grouping. The tradition of keeping two days of Yom Tov in the diaspora has existed since roughly 300 BCE.
* The English-language term High Holy Days or High Holidays refers to Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur collectively. Its Hebrew analogue, &quot;Days of Awe&quot; (), is more flexible: it can refer just to those holidays, or to the Ten Days of Repentance, or to the entire penitential period, starting as early as the beginning of Elul, and (more rarely) ending as late as Shemini Atzeret.
* The term Three Pilgrimage Festivals ( or &quot;ḥaġim&quot;) refers to Passover (the Feast of Unleavened Bread / Feast of Matzot), Shavuot and Sukkot. Within this grouping Sukkot normally includes Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah.
* &quot;Ma&#x27;agal Hashana&quot; (; &quot;year cycle&quot;), a more general term, is often used – especially in educational settings – to refer to the overall study of the Jewish calendar, outlining the month by month events, with mitzvot and minhagim, and philosophical material, that occur over the course of the year.

===Terminology used to describe holidays===
Certain terminology is used in referring to different categories of holidays, depending on their source and their nature:

&quot;Shabbat&quot; () (Ashkenazi pron. from Yiddish &quot;shabbos&quot;), or Sabbath, is referred to by that name exclusively. Similarly, &quot;Rosh Chodesh&quot; () is referred to by that name exclusively.
*&quot;Yom tov&quot; () (Ashkenazi pron. from Yid. &quot;yontif&quot;) (&quot;lit.,&quot; &quot;good day&quot;): See &quot;Groupings&quot; above.
* &quot;Moed&quot; () (&quot;festive season&quot;), plural &quot;moadim&quot; (), refers to any of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. When used in comparison to &quot;Yom Tov,&quot; it refers to Chol HaMoed, the intermediate days of Passover and Sukkot.
* &quot;Ḥag&quot; or &quot;chag&quot; () (&quot;festival&quot;), plural &quot;chagim&quot; (), can be used whenever &quot;yom tov&quot; or &quot;moed&quot; is. It is also used to describe Hanukkah and Purim, as well as &quot;Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut&quot; (Israeli Independence Day) and &quot;Yom Yerushalayim&quot; (Jerusalem Day).
* &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; (), or, less commonly, &quot;tzom&quot; (), refers to a &quot;fast&quot;. These terms are generally used to describe the rabbinic fasts, although &quot;tzom&quot; is used liturgically to refer to Yom Kippur as well.

===&quot;Work&quot; on Sabbath and biblical holidays===

The most notable common feature of Shabbat and the biblical festivals is the requirement to refrain from the 39 Melakhot on these days. &quot;Melakha&quot; is most commonly translated as &quot;work&quot;; perhaps a better translation is &quot;creative-constructive work&quot;. Strictly speaking, melakha is defined in halakha (Jewish law) by 39 categories of labor that were used in constructing the Tabernacle while the Jews wandered in the desert. As understood traditionally and in Orthodox Judaism:
*On Shabbat and Yom Kippur all melakha is prohibited.
*On a holiday other than Yom Kippur which falls on a weekday, not Shabbat, most melakha is prohibited. Some &quot;melacha&quot; related to the preparation of food is permitted.
*On weekdays during Chol HaMoed, melakha is not prohibited &quot;per se.&quot; However, melakha should be limited to that required either to enhance the enjoyment of the remainder of the festival or to avoid great financial loss, or several other categories.
*On other days, there are no restrictions on melakha.

In principle, Conservative Judaism understands the requirement to refrain from melakha in the same way as Orthodox Judaism. In practice, Conservative rabbis frequently rule on prohibitions around melakha differently from Orthodox authorities. Still, there are some Conservative/Masorti communities around the world where Shabbat and festival observance fairly closely resembles Orthodox observance.

However, many, if not most, lay members of Conservative congregations in North America do not consider themselves Shabbat observant, even by Conservative standards. At the same time, adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism do not accept traditional halakha, and therefore restrictions on melakha, as binding at all. Jews fitting any of these descriptions refrain from melakha in practice only as they see fit.

Shabbat and holiday work restrictions are always put aside in cases of pikuach nefesh, which are actions to save a human life. At the most fundamental level, if there is any possibility whatsoever that action must be taken to save a life, Shabbat restrictions are set aside immediately, and without reservation. Where the danger to life is present but less immediate, there is some preference to minimize violation of Shabbat work restrictions where possible. The laws in this area are complex.

===Second day of biblical festivals===

The Torah specifies a single date on the Jewish calendar for observance of holidays. Nevertheless, festivals of biblical origin other than Shabbat and Yom Kippur are observed for two days outside the land of Israel, and Rosh Hashanah is observed for two days even inside the land of Israel.

Dates for holidays on the Jewish calendar are expressed in the Torah as &quot;day x of month y&quot;. Accordingly, the beginning of &quot;month y&quot; needs to be determined before the proper date of the holiday on &quot;day x&quot; can be fixed. Months in the Jewish calendar are lunar, and originally were thought to have been proclaimed by the blowing of a &quot;shofar&quot;. Later, the Sanhedrin received testimony of witnesses saying they saw the new crescent moon. Then the Sanhedrin would inform Jewish communities away from its meeting place that it had proclaimed a new moon. The practice of observing a second festival day stemmed from delays in disseminating that information.

* &quot;Rosh Hashanah.&quot; Because of holiday restrictions on travel, messengers could not even leave the seat of the Sanhedrin until the holiday was over. Inherently, there was no possible way for anyone living away from the seat of the Sanhedrin to receive news of the proclamation of the new month until messengers arrived &quot;after the fact&quot;. Accordingly, the practice emerged that Rosh Hashanah was observed on both possible days, as calculated from the previous month&#x27;s start, everywhere in the world.
* &quot;Three Pilgrimage Festivals.&quot; Sukkot and Passover fall on the 15th day of their respective months. This gave messengers two weeks to inform communities about the proclamation of the new month. Normally, they would reach most communities within the land of Israel within that time, but they might fail to reach communities farther away (such as those in Babylonia or overseas). Consequently, the practice developed that these holidays be observed for one day within Israel, but for two days (both possible days as calculated from the previous month&#x27;s start) outside Israel. This practice is known as &quot;yom tov sheni shel galuyot&quot;, &quot;second day of festivals in exile communities&quot;.

:: For Shavuot, calculated as the fiftieth day from Passover, the above issue did not pertain directly, as the &quot;correct&quot; date for Passover would be known by then. Nevertheless, the Talmud applies the same rule to Shavuot, and to the Seventh Day of Passover and Shemini Atzeret, for consistency.

Yom Kippur is not observed for two days anywhere because of the difficulty of maintaining a fast over two days.

: Shabbat is not observed based on a calendar date, but simply at intervals of seven days. Accordingly, there is never a doubt of the date of Shabbat, and it need never be observed for two days.

Adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally do not observe the second day of festivals, although some do observe two days of Rosh Hashanah.

==Holidays of biblical and rabbinic (Talmudic) origin==

===Shabbat—The Sabbath===
Jewish law &quot;(halacha)&quot; accords &quot;Shabbat&quot; () the status of a holiday, a day of rest celebrated on the seventh day of each week. Jewish law defines a day as ending at either sundown or nightfall, when the next day then begins. Thus,
* Shabbat begins just before sundown Friday night. Its start is marked by the lighting of Shabbat candles and the recitation of Kiddush over a cup of wine.
* Shabbat ends at nightfall Saturday night. Its conclusion is marked by the prayer known as Havdalah.
The fundamental rituals and observances of Shabbat include:
* Reading of the Weekly Torah portion
* Abbreviation of the Amidah in the three regular daily services to eliminate requests for everyday needs
* Addition of a musaf service to the daily prayer services
* Enjoyment of three meals, often elaborate or ritualized, through the course of the day
* Restraint from performing &quot;melacha&quot; (see above).
In many ways, &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) sees &quot;Shabbat&quot; as the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar.
* It is the first holiday mentioned in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), and God was the first one to observe it (Genesis).
* The Torah reading on &quot;Shabbat&quot; has more sections of &quot;parshiot&quot; (Torah readings) than on Yom Kippur or any other Jewish holiday.
* The prescribed penalty in the Torah for a transgression of &quot;Shabbat&quot; prohibitions is death by stoning (Exodus 31), while for other holidays the penalty is (relatively) less severe.
* Observance of Shabbat is the benchmark used in &quot;halacha&quot; to determine whether an individual is a religiously observant, religiously reliable member of the community.

===Rosh Chodesh—The New Month===

Rosh Chodesh () is a minor holiday or observance occurring on the first day of each month of the Jewish calendar, as well as the last day of the preceding month if it has thirty days.
* Rosh Chodesh observance during at least a portion of the period of the Nevi&#x27;im could be fairly elaborate. See, for example, 1 Samuel 20
*Over time there have been varying levels of observance of a custom that women are excused from certain types of work, as in Megilla 22b:4: &quot;the days of the New Moon, when it is customary for women to refrain from work&quot;.
* Fasting is normally prohibited on Rosh Chodesh.
Beyond the preceding, current observance is limited to changes in liturgy.
:In the month of Tishrei, this observance is superseded by the observance of Rosh Hashanah, a major holiday.
&quot;Related observances:&quot;
* The date of the forthcoming Rosh Chodesh is announced in synagogue on the preceding Sabbath.
* There are special prayers, the kiddush levana, said upon observing the waxing moon for the first time each month.

===Rosh Hashanah—The Jewish New Year===

====Selichot====
The month of Elul that precedes Rosh Hashanah is considered to be a propitious time for repentance. For this reason, additional penitential prayers called Selichot are added to the daily prayers, except on Shabbat. Sephardi Jews add these prayers each weekday during Elul. Ashkenazi Jews recite them from the last Sunday (or Saturday night) preceding Rosh Hashanah that allows at least four days of recitations.

====Rosh Hashanah====
* Erev Rosh Hashanah (eve of the first day): 29 Elul
* Rosh Hashanah: 1–2 Tishrei

According to oral tradition, Rosh Hashanah () (lit., &quot;Head of the Year&quot;) is the Day of Memorial or Remembrance (, &quot;Yom HaZikaron&quot;), and the day of judgment (, &quot;Yom HaDin&quot;). God appears in the role of King, remembering and judging each person individually according to his/her deeds, and making a decree for each person for the following year.

The holiday is characterized by one specific mitzvah: blowing the &quot;shofar&quot;. According to the Torah, this is the first day of the seventh month of the calendar year, and marks the beginning of a ten-day period leading up to Yom Kippur. According to one of two Talmudic opinions, the creation of the world was completed on Rosh Hashanah.

Morning prayer services are lengthy on Rosh Hashanah, and focus on the themes described above: majesty and judgment, remembrance, the birth of the world, and the blowing of the &quot;shofar&quot;. Most communities recite the brief &quot;Tashlikh&quot; prayer, a symbolic casting off of the previous year&#x27;s sins, during the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.

The Bible specifies Rosh Hashanah as a one-day holiday, but it is traditionally celebrated for two days, even within the Land of Israel. (See &quot;Second day of biblical festivals,&quot; above.)

====Four New Years====
The Torah itself does not use any term like &quot;New Year&quot; in reference to Rosh Hashanah. The Mishnah in Rosh Hashanah specifies four different &quot;New Year&#x27;s Days&quot; for different purposes:
* 1 Tishrei (conventional &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot;): &quot;new year&quot; for calculating calendar years, sabbatical-year &quot;(shmita)&quot; and jubilee cycles, and the age of trees for purposes of Jewish law; and for separating grain tithes.
* 15 Shevat (Tu Bishvat): &quot;new year&quot; for trees–&quot;i.e.,&quot; their current agricultural cycle and related tithes.
* 1 Nisan: &quot;New Year&quot; for counting months and major festivals and for calculating the years of the reign of a Jewish king
** In biblical times, the day following 29 Adar, Year 1 of the reign of ___, would be followed by 1 Nisan, Year 2 of the reign of ___.
** In modern times, although the Jewish calendar year number changes on Rosh Hashanah, the months are still numbered from Nisan.
** The three pilgrimage festivals are always reckoned as coming in the order Passover-Shavuot-Sukkot. This can have religious law consequences even in modern times.
* 1 Elul (Rosh Hashanah LeMa&#x27;sar Behemah): &quot;new year&quot; for animal tithes. However, the Halacha does not follow this opinion, but rather that the animal tithe goes by 1 Tishrei.

====Aseret Yemei Teshuva—Ten Days of Repentance====
The first ten days of Tishrei (from the beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Ten Days of Repentance (עשרת ימי תשובה, &quot;Aseret Yemei Teshuva&quot;). During this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is &quot;exceedingly appropriate&quot; for Jews to practice repentance, an examination of one&#x27;s deeds and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one&#x27;s deeds before God, fasting, self-reflection, and an increase of involvement with, or donations to, tzedakah &quot;charity&quot;.

===Tzom Gedalia—Fast of Gedalia===

* Tzom Gedalia: 3 Tishrei
The Fast of Gedalia () is a minor Jewish fast day. It commemorates the assassination of the governor of Yehud province, Gedaliah, which ended any level of Jewish rule following the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple.
According to the simple reading of the Bible, the assassination occurred on Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), and if so, the fast is postponed to 3 Tishrei in respect for the holiday and it is further postponed to 4 Tishrei if 3 Tishrei is Shabbat. However, the Talmud states explicitly that it took place on 3 Tishrei. 

As on all minor fast days, fasting from dawn to dusk is required, but other laws of mourning are not normally observed. A Torah reading is included in both the Shaharit and Minha prayers, and a haftarah is also included at &quot;Mincha&quot;. There are also some additions to the liturgy of both services.

===Yom Kippur—Day of Atonement===

* Erev Yom Kippur: 9 Tishrei
* Yom Kippur: 10 Tishrei (begins at sunset)

Yom Kippur () is the holiest day of the year for Jews. Its central theme is atonement and reconciliation. This is accomplished through prayer and complete fasting—including abstinence from all food and drink (including water)—by all healthy adults. Bathing, wearing of perfume or cologne, wearing of leather shoes, and sexual relations are some of the other prohibitions on Yom Kippur—all them designed to ensure one&#x27;s attention is completely and absolutely focused on the quest for atonement with God. Yom Kippur is also unique among holidays as having work-related restrictions identical to those of Shabbat. The fast and other prohibitions commence on 10 Tishrei at sunset—sunset being the &quot;beginning&quot; of the day in Jewish tradition.

A traditional prayer in Aramaic called &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; (&quot;All Vows&quot;) is traditionally recited just before sunset. Although often regarded as the start of the Yom Kippur evening service—to such a degree that &quot;Erev Yom Kippur&quot; (&quot;Yom Kippur Evening&quot;) is often called &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; (also spelled &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;)—it is technically a separate tradition. This is especially so because, being recited before sunset, it is actually recited on 9 Tishrei, which is the day &quot;before&quot; Yom Kippur; it is not recited on Yom Kippur itself (on 10 Tishrei, which begins &quot;after&quot; the sun sets).
: The words of Kol Nidre differ slightly between Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. In both, the supplicant prays to be released from all personal vows made to God during the year, so that any unfulfilled promises made to God will be annulled and, thus, forgiven. In Ashkenazi tradition, the reference is to the coming year; in Sephardic tradition, the reference is to the year just ended. Only vows between the supplicant and God are relevant. Vows made between the supplicant and other people remain perfectly valid, since they are unaffected by the prayer.

A &quot;Tallit&quot; (four-cornered prayer shawl) is donned for evening and afternoon prayers–the only day of the year in which this is done. In traditional Ashkenazi communities, men wear the &quot;kittel&quot; throughout the day&#x27;s prayers. The prayers on Yom Kippur evening are lengthier than on any other night of the year. Once services reconvene in the morning, the services (in all traditions) are the longest of the year. In some traditional synagogues prayers run continuously from morning until nightfall, or nearly so. Two highlights of the morning prayers in traditional synagogues are the recitation of &quot;Yizkor,&quot; the prayer of remembrance, and of liturgical poems &quot;(piyyutim)&quot; describing the temple service of Yom Kippur.

Two other highlights happen late in the day. During the &quot;Minchah&quot; prayer, the &quot;haftarah&quot; reading features the entire Book of Jonah. Finally, the day concludes with &quot;Ne&#x27;ilah,&quot; a special service recited only on the day of Yom Kippur. Ne&#x27;ilah deals with the closing of the holiday, and contains a fervent final plea to God for forgiveness just before the conclusion of the fast. Yom Kippur comes to an end with the blowing of the &quot;shofar&quot;, which marks the conclusion of the fast. It is always observed as a one-day holiday, both inside and outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel.

Yom Kippur is considered, along with 15th of Av, as the happiest days of the year (Talmud Bavli—Tractate Ta&#x27;anit).

===Sukkot—Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles)===

* Erev Sukkot: 14 Tishrei
* Sukkot: 15–21 Tishrei (22 outside Israel)
* The first day of Sukkot is (outside Israel, first two days are) full&quot; yom tov, &quot;while the remainder of Sukkot has the status of Chol Hamoed, &quot;intermediate days&quot;.
&quot;Sukkot&quot; ( or , &quot;sukkōt&quot;) or &quot;Succoth&quot; is a seven-day festival, also known as the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (&quot;shalosh regalim&quot;) mentioned in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word &quot;sukkot&quot; is the plural of the Hebrew word &quot;sukkah&quot;, meaning booth. Jews are commanded to &quot;dwell&quot; in booths during the holiday. This generally means taking meals, but some sleep in the &quot;sukkah&quot; as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific rules for constructing a &quot;sukkah&quot;.

Along with dwelling in a &quot;sukkah,&quot; the principal ritual unique to this holiday is use of the Four Species: &quot;lulav&quot; (palm), &quot;hadass&quot; (myrtle), &quot;aravah&quot; (willow) and &quot;etrog&quot; (citron). On each day of the holiday other than Shabbat, these are waved in association with the recitation of Hallel in the synagogue, then walked in a procession around the synagogue called the &quot;Hoshanot&quot;.

The seventh day of the Sukkot is called Hoshanah Rabbah, the &quot;Great &quot;Hoshanah&quot;&quot; (singular of &quot;Hoshanot&quot; and the source of the English word hosanna). The climax of the day&#x27;s prayers includes seven processions of &quot;Hoshanot&quot; around the synagogue. This tradition mimics practices from the Temple in Jerusalem. Many aspects of the day&#x27;s customs also resemble those of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Hoshanah Rabbah is traditionally taken to be the day of the &quot;delivery&quot; of the final judgment of Yom Kippur, and offers a last opportunity for pleas of repentance before the holiday season closes.

===Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah===

* Shemini Atzeret: 22 Tishrei (combined with Simchat Torah in Israel)
* Simchat Torah outside Israel: 23 Tishrei

The holiday of Shemini Atzeret () immediately follows the conclusion of the holiday of Sukkot. The Hebrew word &quot;shemini&quot; means &quot;eighth&quot;, and refers to its position on &quot;the eighth day&quot; of Sukkot, actually a seven-day holiday. This name reflects the fact that while in many respects Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday in its own right, in certain respects its celebration is linked to that of Sukkot. Outside Israel, meals are still taken in the Sukkah on this day.

The main notable custom of this holiday is the celebration of &quot;Simchat Torah&quot; (), meaning &quot;rejoicing with the Torah&quot;. This name originally referred to a special &quot;ceremony&quot;: the last weekly Torah portion is read from Deuteronomy, completing the annual cycle, and is followed immediately by the reading of the first chapter of Genesis, beginning the new annual cycle. Services are especially joyous, and all attendees, young and old, are involved.

This ceremony so dominates the holiday that in Israel, where the holiday is one day long, the whole holiday is often referred to as &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;. Outside Israel, the holiday is two days long; the name &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot; is used for the first day, while the second is normally called &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;.

===Hanukkah—Festival of Lights===

* Erev Hanukkah: 24 Kislev
* Hanukkah: 25 Kislev – 2 or 3 Tevet

The story of Hanukkah () is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), they are apocryphal books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of olive oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the Talmud (Shabbat 21b), written about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.

Hanukkah marks the defeat of Seleucid Empire forces that had tried to prevent the people of Israel from practicing Judaism. Judah Maccabee and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem. The eight-day festival is marked by the kindling of lights—one on the first night, two on the second, and so on—using a special candle holder called a &quot;Hanukkiah&quot;, or a &quot;Hanukkah menorah.&quot;

Religiously, Hanukkah is a minor holiday. Except on Shabbat, restrictions on work do not apply. Aside from the kindling of lights, formal religious observance is restricted to changes in liturgy. Hanukkah celebration tends to be informal and based on custom rather than law. Three widely practiced customs include:
* Consumption of foods prepared in oil, such as potato pancakes or &quot;sufganiyot,&quot; commemorating the miracle of oil
* Playing the game of dreidel (called a &quot;sevivon&quot; in Hebrew), symbolizing Jews&#x27; disguising of illegal Torah study sessions as gambling meetings during the period leading to the Maccabees&#x27; revolt
* Giving children money, especially coins, called Hanukkah gelt. However, the custom of giving presents is of far more recent, North American, origin, and is connected to the gift economy prevalent around North American Christmas celebrations.

===Tenth of Tevet===

* Asarah B&#x27;Tevet: 10 Tevet
The Tenth of Tevet (, &quot;Asarah B&#x27;Tevet&quot;) is a minor fast day, marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem as outlined in 2 Kings 25:1

:And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.

This fast&#x27;s commemoration also includes other events occurring on 8, 9 and 10 Tevet.

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see Tzom Gedalia, above). This is the only minor fast that can fall on a Friday under the current fixed Jewish calendar.

===Tu Bishvat—New Year of the Trees===
* Tu Bishvat: 15 Shevat

Tu Bishvat () (lit., &quot;fifteenth of Shevat&quot;, as is the number &quot;15&quot; in Hebrew letters), is the new year for trees. It is also known as (&quot;Ḥag ha-Ilanot,&quot; Festival of Trees), or (&quot;Rosh ha-Shanah la-Ilanot,&quot; New Year for Trees). According to the Mishnah, it marks the day from which fruit tithes are counted each year. Starting on this date, the biblical prohibition on eating the first three years of fruit (&quot;orlah&quot;) and the requirement to bring the fourth year fruit &quot;(neta revai)&quot; to the Temple in Jerusalem were counted.

During the 17th century, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria of Safed and his disciples created a short seder, called &quot;Hemdat ha‑Yamim,&quot; reminiscent of the seder that Jews observe on Passover, that explores the holiday&#x27;s Kabbalistic themes. This Tu Bishvat seder has witnessed a revival in recent years. More generally, Tu Bishvat is celebrated in modern times by eating various fruits and nuts associated with the Land of Israel.

Traditionally, trees are planted on this day. Many children collect funds leading up to this day to plant trees in Israel. Trees are usually planted locally as well.

===Purim—Festival of Lots===

* Fast of Esther: normally 13 Adar
* Purim: 14 Adar
* Shushan Purim: 15 Adar
* In leap years on the Hebrew calendar, the above dates are observed in the Second Adar &quot;(Adar Sheni)&quot;. The 14th and 15th of First Adar &quot;(Adar Rishon)&quot; are known as &quot;Purim Katan&quot;

====Purim Katan====
&quot;Purim Katan&quot; () (lit., &quot;small Purim&quot;) is observed on the 14th and 15th of First Adar in leap years. These days are marked by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.

====Ta&#x27;anit Esther–Fast of Esther====


&quot;Ta&#x27;anit Esther&quot; (), or &quot;Fast of Esther&quot;, is named in honor of the fast of Esther and her court as Esther prepared to approach the king unbidden to invite him and Haman to a banquet. It commemorates that fast, as well as one alluded to later in the Book of Esther, undertaken as the Jews prepared to battle their enemies.

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see Tzom Gedalia, above). While normally observed on 13 Adar, the eve of Purim, this fast is advanced to Thursday, 11 Adar, when 13 Adar falls on Shabbat.

====Purim and Shushan Purim====

Purim () commemorates the events that took place in the Book of Esther. The principal celebrations or commemorations include:
* The reading of the &quot;&quot;Megillah&quot;&quot;. Traditionally, this is read from a scroll twice during Purim–once in the evening and again in the morning. Ashkenazim have a custom of making disparaging noises at every mention of Haman&#x27;s name during the reading.
* The giving of &quot;Mishloakh Manot&quot;, gifts of food and drink to friends and neighbors.
* The giving of &quot;Matanot La&#x27;evyonim&quot;, gifts to the poor and the needy.
* The Purim meal (&quot;Se&#x27;udat Purim&quot; or &quot;Purim Se&#x27;udah&quot;). This meal is traditionally accompanied by consumption of alcohol, often heavy, although Jewish sages have warned about the need to adhere to all religious laws even in a drunken state.
Several customs have evolved from these principal commemorations. One widespread custom to act out the story of Purim. The Purim spiel, or Purim play, has its origins in this, although the &quot;Purim spiel&quot; is not limited to that subject. Wearing of costumes and masks is also very common. These may be an outgrowth of Purim plays, but there are several theories as to the origin of the custom, most related in some way to the &quot;hidden&quot; nature of the miracles of Purim.

Purim carnivals of various types have also become customary. In Israel there are festive parades, known as &quot;Ad-D&#x27;lo-Yada&quot;, in the town&#x27;s main street. The largest and most renowned is in Holon.

Most Jews celebrate Purim on 14 Adar, the day of celebration after the Jews defeated their enemies. Because Jews in the capital city of Shushan fought with their enemies an extra day, Purim is celebrated a day later there, on the day known as , Shushan Purim. This observance was expanded to &quot;walled cities&quot;, which are defined as cities &quot;walled since the time of Joshua&quot;. In practice, there are no Jews living in Shushan (Shush, Iran), and Shushan Purim is observed fully only in Jerusalem. Cities like Safed and Tiberias also partially observe Shushan Purim. Elsewhere, Shushan Purim is marked only by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.

===Pesach—Passover===
* Erev Pesach and Fast of the Firstborn, (&quot;Ta&#x27;anit Bechorot&quot;): 14 Nisan
* Pesach (Passover): 15–21 Nisan (outside Israel 15–22 Nisan)
* The first day and last day of Passover (outside Israel, first two and last two days) are full &quot;yom tov&quot;, while the remainder of Passover has the status of &quot;Chol Hamoed&quot;, &quot;intermediate days&quot;.
* Pesach Sheni (second Passover): 14 Iyar

====Month of Nisan====
As a rule, the month of Nisan is considered to be one of extra joy. Traditionally, throughout the entire month, Tahanun is omitted from the prayer service, many public mourning practices (such as delivering a eulogy at a funeral) are eliminated, and voluntary fasting is prohibited. However, practices sometimes vary.

====Eve of Passover and Fast of the Firstborn====
The day before Passover (&quot;Erev Pesach,&quot; lit., &quot;Passover eve&quot;) is significant for three reasons:
* It is the day that all of the involved preparations for Passover, especially elimination of leavened food, or &quot;chametz&quot;, must be completed. In particular, a formal search for remaining &quot;chametz&quot; is done during the evening of Erev Pesach, and all remaining &quot;chametz&quot; is finally destroyed, disposed of or nullified during the morning of Erev Pesach.
* It is the day observed as the Fast of the Firstborn (תענית בכורות). Jews who are firstborn fast, in remembrance of the tenth plague, when God killed the Egyptian firstborn, while sparing the Jewish firstborn. This fast is overridden by a &quot;seudat mitzvah&quot;, a meal celebrating the fulfillment of a commandment; accordingly, it is almost universal for firstborn Jews to attend such a meal on this day so as to obviate their need to fast.
* During the era of the Temple in Jerusalem, the &quot;Korban Pesach&quot;, or sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb, was carried out the afternoon of 14 Nisan in anticipation of its consumption on Passover night.

When Passover starts on Sunday, and the eve of Passover is therefore Shabbat, the above schedule is altered. See Eve of Passover on Shabbat for details.

====Passover====

Passover (פּסח) &quot;(Pesach&quot;), also known liturgically as חג המצות &quot;(&quot;Ḥag haMatzot&quot;&quot;, the &quot;Festival of Unleavened Bread&quot;), is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (&quot;shalosh regalim&quot;) mentioned in the Torah. Passover commemorates the Exodus, the liberation of the Israelite slaves from Egypt. No &quot;chametz&quot; (leavened food) is eaten, or even owned, during the week of Passover, in commemoration of the biblical narrative in which the Israelites left Egypt so quickly that their bread did not have enough time to rise. Observant Jews go to great lengths to remove all &quot;chametz&quot; from their homes and offices in the run-up to Passover.

Along with the avoidance of &quot;chametz&quot;, the principal ritual unique to this holiday is the seder. The &quot;seder&quot;, meaning &quot;order&quot;, is an ordered ritual meal eaten on the first night of Passover, and outside Israel also on the second night. This meal is known for its distinctive ritual foods—matzo (unleavened bread), maror (bitter herbs), and four cups of wine—as well as its prayer text/handbook/study guide, the Haggadah. Participation in a Passover seder is one of the most widely observed Jewish rituals, even among less affiliated or less observant Jews.

Passover lasts seven days in Israel, and eight days outside Israel. The holiday of the last day of Passover (outside Israel, last two days) commemorates the Splitting of the Red Sea; according to tradition this occurred on the seventh day of Passover.

====Pesach Sheni====

&quot;Pesach Sheni&quot; (פסח שני) (&quot;Second Passover&quot;) is a day prescribed in the Torah to allow those who did not bring the Paschal Lamb offering &quot;(Korban Pesach)&quot; a second chance to do so. Eligibility was limited to those who were distant from Jerusalem on Passover, or those who were ritually impure and ineligible to participate in a sacrificial offering. Today, some have the custom to eat matzo on Pesach Sheni, and some make a small change to the liturgy.

===Sefirah—Counting of the Omer===

* &quot;Sefirat HaOmer&quot; (Counting of the Omer): 16 Nisan – 5 Sivan 
&quot;Sefirah&quot; (lit. &quot;Counting&quot;; more fully, &quot;Sefirat HaOmer,&quot; &quot;Counting of the Omer&quot;) (ספירת העומר), is the 49-day period between the biblical pilgrimage festivals of Passover and Shavuot. The Torah states that this period is to be counted, both in days and in weeks. The first day of this period is the day of the first grain offering of the new year&#x27;s crop, an omer of barley. The day following the 49th day of the period is the festival of Shavuot; the Torah specifies a grain offering of wheat on that day.

Symbolically, this period has come to represent the spiritual development of the Israelites from slaves in the polytheistic society of Ancient Egypt to free, monotheistic people worthy of the revelation of the Torah, traditionally said to have occurred on Shavuot. Spiritual development remains a key rabbinic teaching of this period.

Sefirah has long been observed as a period of semi-mourning. The customary explanation cites a plague that killed 24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva (BT &quot;Yevamot&quot; 62b). In broad terms, the mourning practices observed include limiting actual celebrations (such as weddings), not listening to music, not wearing new clothing, and not shaving or taking a haircut. There is a wide variety of practice as to the specifics of this observance. See Counting of the Omer (Semi-mourning).
====Lag Ba&#x27;Omer====
* Lag Ba&#x27;Omer: 18 Iyar
&quot;Lag Ba&#x27;Omer&quot; () is the 33rd day in the Omer count ( is the number 33 in Hebrew). By Ashkenazi practice, the semi-mourning observed during the period of Sefirah (see above) is lifted &quot;on&quot; Lag Ba&#x27;Omer, while Sefardi practice is to lift it &quot;at the end of&quot; Lag Ba&#x27;Omer. Minor liturgical changes are made on Lag Ba&#x27;omer; because mourning practices are suspended, weddings are often conducted on this day.

Lag Ba&#x27;Omer is identified as the &quot;Yom Hillula (yahrzeit)&quot; of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, one of the leading &quot;Tannaim&quot; (teachers quoted in the Mishna) and ascribed author of the core text of Kabbalah, the Zohar. Customary celebrations include bonfires, picnics, and bow and arrow play by children. Boys sometimes receive their first haircuts on Lag Ba&#x27;Omer, while Hasidic rebbes hold &quot;tishes&quot; in honor of the day.

In Israel, Lag Ba&#x27;Omer is associated with the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. In Zionist thought, the plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva&#x27;s 24,000 disciples is explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day representing the end of the plague is explained as the day of Bar Kokhba&#x27;s victory. The traditional bonfires and bow-and-arrow play were thus reinterpreted as celebrations of military victory. In this vein, the order originally creating the Israel Defense Forces was issued on Lag Ba&#x27;Omer 1948, 13 days after Israel declared independence.

===Shavuot—Feast of Weeks—Yom HaBikurim===
* Erev Shavuot: 5 Sivan
* Shavuot: 6 (and outside Israel: 7) Sivan

&quot;Shavuot&quot; (), the Feast of Weeks, is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (&quot;Shalosh regalim&quot;) ordained in the Torah. Different from other biblical holidays, the date for Shavuot is not explicitly fixed in the Torah. Instead, it is observed on the day following the 49th and final day in the counting of the Omer. In the current era of the fixed Jewish calendar, this puts the date of Shavuot as 6 Sivan. In Israel and in Reform Judaism, it is a one-day holiday; elsewhere, it is a two-day holiday extending through 7 Sivan.

According to Rabbinic tradition, codified in the Talmud at Shabbat 87b, the Ten Commandments were given on this day. In the era of the Temple, there were certain specific offerings mandated for Shavuot, and Shavuot was the first day for bringing of Bikkurim to the Temple. Other than those, there are no explicit &quot;mitzvot&quot; unique to Shavuot given in the Torah (parallel to matzo on Passover or Sukkah on Sukkot).

Nevertheless, there are a number of widespread customs observed on Shavuot. During this holiday the Torah portion containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical Book of Ruth is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot. In observant circles, all night Torah study is common on the first night of Shavuot, while in Reform Judaism, Shavuot is the customary date for Confirmation ceremonies.

===Mourning for Jerusalem: Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tisha B&#x27;Av===
The three-week period starting on 17 Tammuz and concluding after Tisha B&#x27;Av has traditionally been observed as a period of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple there.

====Fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz====

* Shiva Asar B&#x27;Tammuz: 17 Tammuz
The Seventeenth of Tamuz (שבעה עשר בתמוז, &quot;Shiva Asar B&#x27;Tamuz&quot;) traditionally marks the first breach in the walls of the Jerusalem during the Roman conquest in 70 CE, at the end of the Second Temple period. According to tradition, this day has had negative connotations since Moses broke the first set of tablets on this day. The Mishnah cites five negative events that happened on 17 Tammuz.

This fast is observed like other minor fasts (see Tzom Gedalia, above). When this fast falls out on Shabbat, its observance is postponed until Sunday.

====The Three Weeks and the Nine Days====

* The Three Weeks: 17 Tammuz – 9 Av
* The Nine Days: 1–9 Av
* The Week of Tisha B&#x27;Av (beginning at the conclusion of Shabbat preceding Tisha B&#x27;Av)

The period between the fasts of 17 Tammuz and 9 Av, known as the &quot;Three Weeks&quot; (Hebrew: בין המצרים, &quot;between the straits&quot;), features a steadily increasing level of mourning practices as Tisha B&#x27;Av approaches. Ashkenazi Jews refrain from conducting weddings and other joyful events throughout the period unless the date is established by Jewish law (as for a bris or &quot;pidyon haben)&quot;. They do not cut their hair during this period. Starting on the first of Av and throughout the nine days between the 1st and 9th days of Av, Ashkenazim traditionally refrain from eating meat and drinking wine, except on Shabbat or at a &quot;Seudat Mitzvah&quot; (a Mitzvah meal, such as for a bris or &quot;siyum&quot;). They also refrain from bathing for pleasure. Sefardic practice varies some from this; the less severe restrictions usually begin on 1 Av, while the more severe restrictions apply during the week of Tisha B&#x27;Av itself.

Subject to the variations described above, Orthodox Judaism continues to maintain the traditional prohibitions. In Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued several responsa (legal rulings) which hold that the prohibitions against weddings in this timeframe are deeply held traditions, but should not be construed as binding law. Thus, Conservative Jewish practice would allow weddings during this time, except on the 17th of Tammuz and 9th of Av themselves. Rabbis within Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism hold that halakha (Jewish law) is no longer binding and follow their individual consciences on such matters. Nevertheless, the rabbinical manual of the Reform movement encourages Reform rabbis not to conduct weddings on Tisha B&#x27;Av itself &quot;out of historical consciousness and respect&quot; for the Jewish community.

====Tisha B&#x27;Av—Ninth of Av====
* Tisha B&#x27;Av : 9 Av
&quot;Tisha B&#x27;Av&quot; () is a major fast day and day of mourning. A Midrashic tradition states that the spies&#x27; negative report concerning the Land of Israel was delivered on Tisha B&#x27;Av. Consequently, the day became auspicious for negative events in Jewish history. Most notably, both the First Temple, originally built by King Solomon, and the Second Temple of Roman times were destroyed on Tisha B&#x27;Av. Other calamities throughout Jewish history are said to have taken place on Tisha B&#x27;Av, including King Edward I&#x27;s edict compelling the Jews to leave England (1290) and the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492.

Tisha B&#x27;Av is a major fast. It is a 25-hour fast, running from sundown to nightfall. As on Yom Kippur, not only are eating and drinking prohibited, but also bathing, anointing, marital relations and the wearing of leather shoes. Work is not prohibited, as on biblical holidays, but is discouraged. In the evening, the Book of Lamentations is read in the synagogue, while in the morning lengthy &quot;kinot,&quot; poems of elegy, are recited. From evening until noon mourning rituals resembling those of shiva are observed, including sitting on low stools or the floor; after noon those restrictions are somewhat lightened, in keeping with the tradition that Messiah will be born on Tisha B&#x27;Av.

While the fast ends at nightfall of 9–10 Av, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days continue through noon on 10 Av because the Second Temple continued to burn through most of that day. When 9 Av falls on Shabbat, when fasting is prohibited, the fast is postponed until 10 Av. In that case, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days end with the fast, except for the prohibition against eating meat and drinking wine, which extend until the morning of 10 Av.

===Tu B&#x27;Av===

* Tu B&#x27;Av: 15 Av
&quot;Tu B&#x27;av&quot; (ט״ו באב), lit. &quot;15th of Av&quot;, is a day mentioned in the Talmud alongside Yom Kippur as &quot;happiest of the year&quot;. It was a day celebrating the bringing of wood used for the Temple Service, as well as a day when marriages were arranged. Today, it is marked by a small change in liturgy. In modern Israel, the day has become somewhat of an analog to Valentine&#x27;s Day.

===Other fasts===

Several other fast days of ancient or medieval origin continue to be observed to some degree in modern times. Such continued observance is usually by Orthodox Jews only, and is not universal today even among Orthodox Jews.

* Fasts for droughts and other public troubles. Much of the Talmudic tractate &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; is devoted to the proclamation and execution of public fasts. The most detailed description refers to fasts in times of drought in the Land of Israel. Apparently these fasts included a &quot;Ne&#x27;ilah&quot; (closing) prayer, a prayer now reserved for recitation on Yom Kippur only.
:While the specific fasts described in the Mishnah fell into disuse once Jews were exiled from the land of Israel, various Jewish communities have declared fasts over the years, using these as a model. Two examples include a fast among Polish Jews commemorating the massacre of Jews during the Khmelnytsky Uprising and one among Russian Jews during anti-Jewish pogroms of the 1880s. 
:Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has urged fasting in times of drought. 
* &quot;Fast of Behav&quot; (בה&quot;ב). The fasts of &quot;bet-hey-bet&quot;—Monday-Thursday-Monday—were established as a vehicle for atonement from possible excesses during the extended holiday periods of Passover and Sukkot. They are proclaimed on the first Shabbat of the month of Iyar following Passover, and at some point in Marcheshvan following Sukkot. Based on the model of Mishnah &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot;, they are then observed on the Monday, Thursday and Monday following the Shabbat on which they are announced.
* &quot;Yom Kippur Katan&quot; (&quot;little Yom Kippur&quot;). These fasts originated in the sixteenth-century Kabbalistic community of Safed. They are conceptually linked to the sin-offerings that were brought to the Temple in Jerusalem on each Rosh Chodesh. These fasts are observed on the day before Rosh Chodesh in most months, and usually observed on the previous Thursday if Rosh Chodesh is on Shabbat or Sunday.

==Israeli/Jewish national holidays and days of remembrance==
As a general rule, the biblical Jewish holidays (Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot and Purim) are observed as public holidays in Israel. Chanukah is a school holiday, but businesses remain open. On Tisha B&#x27;Av, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed. Other Jewish holidays listed above are observed in varying ways and to varying degrees.

Between the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and the aftermath of the Six-Day War, the Knesset, generally in consultation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, established four national holidays or days of remembrance:

* &quot;Yom HaShoah:&quot; Holocaust Remembrance Day
* &quot;Yom Hazikaron:&quot; Memorial Day
* &quot;Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut:&quot; Israel Independence Day
* &quot;Yom Yerushalayim:&quot; Jerusalem Day

The status of these days as &quot;religious&quot; events is not uniform within the Jewish world. Non-Orthodox, Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jewish religious movements accept these days as &quot;religious&quot; as well as &quot;national&quot; in nature.

As a rule, these four days are not accepted as religious observances by most Haredi Jews, including Hasidim. Some &quot;ḥaredim&quot; are opposed to the existence of the State of Israel altogether on religious grounds; others simply feel that there are not sufficient grounds under Jewish law to justify the establishment of new religious holidays. For details, see Haredim and Zionism.

Observance of these days in Jewish communities outside Israel is typically more muted than their observance in Israel. Events held in government and public venues within Israel are often held in Jewish communal settings (synagogues and community centers) abroad.

More recently, the Knesset established two additional holidays:

* &quot;Yom HaAliyah&quot;: Aliyah Day
* A day to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran

Finally, the Israeli government also recognizes several ethnic Jewish observances with holiday status.

===Yom HaShoah—Holocaust Remembrance Day===

* Yom HaShoah: (nominally) 27 Nisan

&quot;Yom HaShoah&quot; (lit. &quot;Holocaust Day&quot;) is a day of remembrance for victims of the Holocaust. Its full name is &quot;Yom Hazikaron LaShoah v&#x27;LiGevurah&quot; (lit. &quot;Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day&quot;) (), and reflects a desire to recognize martyrs who died in active resistance to the Nazis alongside those who died as passive victims. Its date, 27 Nisan, was chosen because it commemorates the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the best known of the armed Jewish uprisings.

Places of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Public commemoration of Yom HaShoah usually includes religious elements such as the recitation of Psalms, memorial prayers, and kaddish, and the lighting of memorial candles. In Israel, the most notable observances are the State memorial ceremony at Yad Vashem and the sirens marking off a two-minute silence at 10:00 am. Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews generally participate in such public observances along with secular Jews and Jews who adhere to more liberal religious movements. Outside Israel, Jewish communities observe Yom HaShoah in addition to or instead of their countries&#x27; Holocaust Memorial Days. Probably the most notable commemoration is the March of the Living, held at the site of Auschwitz-Birkenau, attended by Jews from all parts of the world.

Outside Orthodoxy, a liturgy for Yom HaShoah is beginning to develop. The Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist prayer books all include liturgical elements for Yom HaShoah, to be added to the regular weekday prayers. Conservative Judaism has written a scroll, called &quot;Megillat HaShoah,&quot; intended to become a definitive liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah. The Orthodox world–even the segment that participates publicly in Yom HaShoah–has been reluctant to write a liturgy for the day, preferring to compose &quot;Kinnot&quot; (prayers of lamentation) for recitation on Tisha B&#x27;Av.

In order to ensure that public Yom HaShoah ceremonies in Israel do not violate Shabbat prohibitions, the date for Yom HaShoah varies as follows:
*If 27 Nisan occurs on a Friday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is advanced to the previous day (Thursday, 26 Nisan).
*If 27 Nisan occurs on a Sunday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is delayed to the following day (Monday, 28 Nisan).

===Yom Hazikaron—Memorial Day===

* Yom Hazikaron: (nominally) 4 Iyar

&quot;Yom Hazikaron&quot; (lit. &quot;Memorial Day&quot;) is a day of remembrance of the fallen of Israel&#x27;s wars. During the first years of Israel&#x27;s independence, this remembrance was observed on Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut (Independence Day) itself. However, by 1951, the memorial observance was separated from the festive celebration of Independence Day and moved to its current date, the day before Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut. Since 2000, the scope of the memorial has expanded to include civilians slain by acts of hostile terrorism. Its full name is now (&quot;Day of Remembrance for the Fallen of the Battles of Israel and the Victims of Terror&quot;).

Places of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Many schools, businesses and other institutions conduct memorial services on this day, and it is customary to visit the graves of fallen soldiers and to recite memorial prayers there. The principal public observances are the evening opening ceremony at the Western Wall and the morning services of remembrance at military cemeteries throughout the country, each opened by the sounding of sirens. The public observances conclude with the service at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl that serves as the transition to Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut.

Outside Israel, Yom HaZikaron observances are often folded into Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut celebrations. Within Israel, Yom Hazikaron is always the day before Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, but that date moves to prevent violation of Sabbath prohibitions during the ceremonies of either day. See following section for details.

===Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut—Israel Independence Day===
* Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut: (nominally) 5 Iyar

&quot;Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut&quot; () is Israel&#x27;s Independence Day. Observance of this day by Jews inside and outside Israel is widespread, and varies in tone from secular (military parades and barbecues) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies).

Although Israel&#x27;s independence was declared on a Friday, the Chief Rabbinate has long been mindful of the possibility of Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut (and Yom Hazikaron) observances leading to violation of Sabbath prohibitions. To prevent such violations, the dates of Yom Hazikaron and Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut vary as follows:
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Sunday-Monday, the observances are delayed to Monday-Tuesday, 5–6 Iyar.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Tuesday-Wednesday, the observances are not moved.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Thursday-Friday, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 3–4 Iyar.
*If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Friday-Shabbat, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 2–3 Iyar.

Nearly all non-&quot;ḥaredi&quot; Jewish religious communities have incorporated changes or enhancements to the liturgy in honor of Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut and suspend the mourning practices of the period of Sefirat Ha&#x27;Omer. (See Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut—Religious Customs for details.) Within the Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox communities, these changes are not without controversy, and customs continue to evolve.

&quot;Ḥaredi&quot; religious observance of Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut varies widely. A few &quot;ḥaredim&quot; (especially Sefardic Ḥaredim) celebrate the day in a reasonably similar way to the way non-&quot;ḥaredim&quot; do. Most &quot;ḥaredim&quot; simply treat the day indifferently; &quot;i.e.,&quot; as a regular day. And finally others (notably Satmar Ḥasidim and Neturei Karta) mourn on the day because of their opposition to the enterprise of the State of Israel.

===Yom Yerushalayim—Jerusalem Day===
* Yom Yerushalayim: 28 Iyar

Jerusalem Day () marks the 1967 reunification of Jerusalem under Israeli control during the Six-Day War. This marked the first time in 19 years that the Temple Mount was accessible to Jews, and the first time since the destruction of the Second Temple 1897 years earlier that the Temple Mount was under Jewish political control.

As with Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, celebrations of Yom Yerushalayim range from completely secular (including hikes to Jerusalem and a large parade through downtown Jerusalem) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies). Although Haredim do not participate in the liturgical changes, they are somewhat more likely to celebrate Yom Yerushalayim than the other modern Israeli holidays because of the importance of the liberation of the Western Wall and the Old City of Jerusalem.

Outside Israel, observance of Yom Yerushalayim is widespread, especially in Orthodox circles. It has not gained as widespread acceptance as Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut, especially among more politically liberal Jews, because of the continuing conflicts over the future of the city.

Yom Yerushalayim has not traditionally moved to avoid Shabbat desecration, although in 2012 the Chief Rabbinate began some efforts in that direction.

===Yom HaAliyah—Aliyah Day===
* Yom HaAliyah: 10 Nisan
Aliyah Day () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of Nisan. The day was established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim (immigrants) to Israeli society.

Immigration to Israel is a recognized religious value of Judaism, sometimes referred to as the Gathering of Israel. The date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, 10 Nisan, has religious significance: it is the day on which Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into the Promised Land. It was thus the first documented &quot;mass Aliyah&quot;. The alternative date observed in the school system, 7 Heshvan, falls during the week of the Torah portion in which God instructs Abraham to leave his home and his family and go up to the Land of Israel.

At the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.

===Day to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran===
* Day to Mark the Departure and Expulsion of Jews from the Arab Countries and Iran: 30 November (on the Gregorian calendar)

The Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of Mizrahi Jews during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of European Jewry during the Holocaust and in comparison to the Palestinian Nakba. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.

At the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.

===National Remembrance Day for October 7 attack and Gaza war===
* 24 Tishrei (25 Tishrei if 24 Tishrei coincides with Shabbat).

The Israeli government established this national remembrance day in March 2024. It is designed to be a national remembrance day for those who died in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the Israel-Hamas War as a whole.

===Ethnic holidays===

The Israeli government officially recognizes three traditional holidays of ethnic Jewish communities in Israel. These days are also observed by their respective communities outside Israel.
* &quot;Mimouna&quot; began as a holiday among Moroccan Jews, while similar celebrations also exist among Turkish Jews and Persian Jews. These festivals are observed on the day after Passover, when the eating of ordinary food (&quot;chametz&quot;) resumes. In Israel, the observance of Mimouna has spread widely in recent years; it has been estimated that up to two million Jews who live in Israel now participate in Mimouna celebrations.
: On the evening concluding Passover, the celebration centers on visiting the homes of friends and neighbors, Jewish and non-Jewish. A variety of traditional foods are served, and symbols which represent good luck and prosperity are prominently displayed. The next day, barbecues and picnics are among the most widespread activities of the celebration.
* The &quot;Seharane&quot; was celebrated by Kurdish Jews as a multi-day nature festival starting the day after Passover. Communities would leave their villages and camp out for several days, celebrating with eating and drinking, nature walks, singing and dancing. 
: Its observance was interrupted after the relocation of this community to Israel in the 1950s. In recent years it has been revived. But because of the already-widespread celebration of Mimouna in Israel, the celebration of the Seharane was moved to &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot; Sukkot. 
* The &quot;Sigd&quot; began among the Beta Israel (Ethiopian) community as a variation of the observance of Yom Kippur. Currently that community now observes it in addition to Yom Kippur; its date is 29 Heshvan, 49 days after Yom Kippur. It shares some features of Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other holidays.
: The Sigd is modeled on a ceremony of fasting, study and prayer described in Nehemiah 8, when the Jews rededicated themselves to religious observance on return to Israel after the Babylonian exile. In Ethiopia, the community would gather on a mountaintop and pray for a return to Jerusalem. The modern Sigd is centered on a promenade overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem. The day&#x27;s observance ends with a celebratory break fast.

<doc id="16148" wikidata="Q735182" url="?curid=16148" title="John Engler">
<text>John Mathias Engler (born October 12, 1948) is an American politician, lawyer, businessman, and lobbyist who served as the 46th governor of Michigan from 1991 to 2003. Considered one of the country&#x27;s top lobbyists, he is a member of the Republican Party.

Engler was serving in the Michigan Senate when he enrolled at Thomas M. Cooley Law School and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree, having served as a Michigan State senator since 1979. He was elected Senate majority leader in 1984 and served there until being elected governor in 1990. He was reelected in 1994 and 1998, and is the last Michigan governor to serve more than two terms. After his governorship, he worked for Business Roundtable.

Engler served on the board of advisors of the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal, an educational organization that continues the intellectual legacy of noted conservative and Michigan native Russell Kirk. Engler also served on the board of trustees of the Marguerite Eyer Wilbur Foundation, which funds many Kirk Center programs. Engler was a member of the Annie E. Casey Foundation board of trustees until 2014. As of 2018, he serves on the board of directors of Universal Forest Products. Previous board service included serving as a director of Dow Jones and Delta Air Lines and as a trustee of Munder Funds.

==Early life and education==
Engler, a Roman Catholic, was born in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, on October 12, 1948, to Mathias John Engler and his wife, Agnes Marie (née Neyer), but grew up on a cattle farm near Beal City.

He attended Michigan State University, graduating with a degree in agricultural economics in 1971, and Thomas M. Cooley Law School, graduating with a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1981.

He was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives as a state representative in 1970 at the age of 22. He served in the House from 1971 to 1978. His campaign manager in that first election was a college friend, Dick Posthumus. Engler later became the first Republican youth vice-chair for the Michigan Republican Party, defeating future U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. Posthumus later went on to be elected a state senator, Senate Majority Leader and Lieutenant Governor. He was Engler&#x27;s running mate in the 1998 election and served from 1999 to 2003.

==Career==

===Governorship===
Engler&#x27;s administration was characterized by privatization of state services, income tax reduction, a sales tax increase, educational reform, welfare reform, and major reorganization of executive branch departments.

In 1996, he was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and in 2001, he was elected to head the National Governors Association.

In 2002, near the end of his final term, Engler and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality attempted to negotiate a consent order with Dow Chemical that would have resulted in a ninefold increase in the allowable levels of dioxins. The consent order would have resulted in Dow not having to pay to clean up high levels of toxins in Midland, Michigan, near its plant there, as well as in the Tittabawassee flood plain, which had been contaminated by dioxins dumped into the river from the facility and from overflow from waste ponds. The consent order fell through in late 2002.

===Vice presidential speculation===
====1996====
During the 1996 presidential election, Engler was considered to be a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican nominee Bob Dole. However, Dole instead selected Jack Kemp, a former representative and HUD secretary.

====2000====
Engler endorsed Texas Governor George W. Bush in the 2000 Republican primary. After Bush secured the GOP nomination, Engler&#x27;s name was again floated as a possible running mate. In his book &quot;Decision Points&quot;, Bush says that Engler was someone he was &quot;close&quot; with and could &quot;work well with.&quot; Ultimately, Engler was passed over for the running mate position in favor of Dick Cheney. After the election, Engler&#x27;s close political ally Spencer Abraham, who narrowly lost his re-election bid for the Senate to Debbie Stabenow, was chosen as Bush&#x27;s Secretary of Energy.

===2002 elections===
Engler&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Dick Posthumus, sought to succeed Engler in the 2002 gubernatorial race. Posthumus lost the race to the state&#x27;s attorney general, Democrat Jennifer Granholm.

===Election results===
In 1990, Engler, then the state senate majority leader, challenged Governor James Blanchard in his bid for a third term. Political observers viewed his bid as a long shot, and he trailed Blanchard by double digits in the polls the weekend before the election. However, on election day, Engler pulled off the upset, defeating Blanchard by approximately 17,000 votes—a margin of less than one percentage point. In 1994, Engler ran for his second term. The Democrats nominated former Representative Howard Wolpe, who had close ties to the labor movement—a potent force in Democratic politics in Michigan. Engler bested Wolpe 61 to 39 percent, and the state Republican Party made significant gains. Spencer Abraham picked up the Senate seat of retiring Democrat Donald Riegle. Republicans gained a seat to break a tie in the state House of Representatives, taking a 56–54 majority, while also picking up a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republican Candice Miller won an upset victory to win the post of Secretary of State.

Michigan voters re-elected Engler to his third and final term in 1998. He won a landslide victory over lawyer Geoffrey Fieger. Engler took 1,883,005 votes—62 percent of the total—to Fieger&#x27;s 38 percent and 1,143,574 votes. Engler&#x27;s landslide helped the state Republican Party gain six seats in the state House of Representatives, taking control of the chamber they had lost two years previously with a 58–52 margin, as well as picking up an additional seat in the State Senate, for a 23–15 majority. Republicans also gained a seat on the technically non-partisan state Supreme Court, holding a 4–3 majority over the Democrats.

===Electoral history===










===After governorship===
After leaving the governor&#x27;s mansion in January 2003, Engler served as president of the state and local government sector of Electronic Data Systems. Engler left that position in June 2004 to be elected president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. Engler&#x27;s tenure at the NAM ended in January 2011. In January 2011, Engler was named president of the Business Roundtable.
In 2017, Engler was appointed to a four-year term on the governing board of the National Assessment of Educational Progress project.

===Interim presidency of Michigan State University===
On January 30, 2018, Engler was named the interim president of Michigan State University to replace Lou Anna Simon, who was embroiled with the school in the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. The appointment of Engler sparked controversy due to his previous handling of sexual misconduct as governor of Michigan. Engler&#x27;s tenure as interim president was plagued by controversies, brought on by Engler&#x27;s apparent callous statements and actions toward survivors during Board of Trustees meetings and statements that were reported by the press. One of Nassar&#x27;s victims, Rachael Denhollander, said Engler &quot;chose to stand against every child and every sexual assault victim in the entire state, to protect an institution.&quot;

Engler resigned on January 16, 2019 after the Board of Trustees indicated its intent to ask him to resign following a series of embarrassing incidents regarding Nassar&#x27;s victims and his responses to issues in the aftermath. Engler initially indicated he planned to resign on January 23, 2019 but the Board required him to resign the morning after he submitted his resignation letter.

==Personal life==

In 1975, Engler married Colleen House, who served in the Michigan House of Representatives before running for lieutenant governor of Michigan in 1986. The day after she lost the race for lieutenant governor, she filed for divorce. The couple had no children together; she remarried in 2002, and died in 2022.

Engler married Michelle DeMunbrun, a Texas attorney, on December 8, 1990. The couple has triplet daughters, born November 13, 1994. As First Lady, Michelle Engler served as the founding chair of the Michigan Community Service Commission. Michelle Engler was named to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) board in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and re-appointed in 2002.

<doc id="16153" wikidata="Q169906" url="?curid=16153" title="Jacques Lacan">
<text>Jacques Marie Émile Lacan (, ; ; 13 April 1901 – 9 September 1981) was a French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist. Described as &quot;the most controversial psycho-analyst since Freud&quot;, Lacan gave yearly seminars in Paris, from 1953 to 1981, and published papers that were later collected in the book &quot;Écrits&quot;. Transcriptions of his seminars, given between 1954 and 1976, were also published. His work made a significant impact on continental philosophy and cultural theory in areas such as post-structuralism, critical theory, feminist theory and film theory, as well as on the practice of psychoanalysis itself.

Lacan took up and discussed the whole range of Freudian concepts, emphasizing the philosophical dimension of Freud&#x27;s thought and applying concepts derived from structuralism in linguistics and anthropology to its development in his own work, which he would further augment by employing formulae from predicate logic and topology. Taking this new direction, and introducing controversial innovations in clinical practice, led to expulsion for Lacan and his followers from the International Psychoanalytic Association. In consequence, Lacan went on to establish new psychoanalytic institutions to promote and develop his work, which he declared to be a &quot;return to Freud&quot;, in opposition to prevalent trends in psychology and institutional psychoanalysis collusive of adaptation to social norms.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lacan was born in Paris, the eldest of Émilie and Alfred Lacan&#x27;s three children. His father was a successful soap and oils salesman. His mother was ardently Catholic – his younger brother entered a monastery in 1929. Lacan attended the Collège Stanislas de Paris between 1907 and 1918. An interest in philosophy led him to a preoccupation with the work of Spinoza, one outcome of which was his abandonment of religious faith for atheism. There were tensions in the family around this issue, and he regretted not persuading his brother to take a different path, but by 1924 his parents had moved to Boulogne and he was living in rooms in Montmartre.

During the early 1920s, Lacan actively engaged with the Parisian literary and artistic avant-garde. Having met James Joyce, he was present at the Parisian bookshop where the first readings of passages from &quot;Ulysses&quot; in French and English took place, shortly before it was published in 1922. He also had meetings with Charles Maurras, whom he admired as a literary stylist, and he occasionally attended meetings of Action Française (of which Maurras was a leading ideologue), of which he would later be highly critical.

In 1920, after being rejected for military service on the grounds that he was too thin, Lacan entered medical school. Between 1927 and 1931, after completing his studies at the faculty of medicine of the University of Paris, he specialised in psychiatry under the direction of Henri Claude at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, the major psychiatric hospital serving central Paris, at the Infirmary for the Insane of the Police Prefecture under Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault and also at the Hospital Henri-Rousselle.

===1930s===
Lacan was involved with the Parisian surrealist movement of the 1930s, associating with André Breton, Georges Bataille, Salvador Dalí, and Pablo Picasso. For a time, he served as Picasso&#x27;s personal therapist. He attended the &quot;mouvement Psyché&quot; that Maryse Choisy founded and published in the Surrealist journal &quot;Minotaure&quot;. &quot;[Lacan&#x27;s] interest in surrealism predated his interest in psychoanalysis,&quot; former Lacanian analyst and biographer Dylan Evans explains, speculating that &quot;perhaps Lacan never really abandoned his early surrealist sympathies, its neo-Romantic view of madness as &#x27;convulsive beauty&#x27;, its celebration of irrationality.&quot; Translator and historian David Macey writes that &quot;the importance of surrealism can hardly be over-stated... to the young Lacan... [who] also shared the surrealists&#x27; taste for scandal and provocation, and viewed provocation as an important element in psycho-analysis itself&quot;.

In 1931, after a second year at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, Lacan was awarded his &quot;Diplôme de médecin légiste&quot; (a medical examiner&#x27;s qualification) and became a licensed forensic psychiatrist. The following year he was awarded his (roughly equivalent to an M.D. degree) for his thesis &quot;On Paranoiac Psychosis in its Relations to the Personality&quot; (&quot;De la Psychose paranoïaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité&quot;). Its publication had little immediate impact on French psychoanalysis but it did meet with acclaim amongst Lacan&#x27;s circle of surrealist writers and artists. In their only recorded instance of direct communication, Lacan sent a copy of his thesis to Sigmund Freud who acknowledged its receipt with a postcard.

Lacan&#x27;s thesis was based on observations of several patients with a primary focus on one female patient whom he called Aimée. Its exhaustive reconstruction of her family history and social relations, on which he based his analysis of her paranoid state of mind, demonstrated his dissatisfaction with traditional psychiatry and the growing influence of Freud on his ideas. Also in 1932, Lacan published a translation of Freud&#x27;s 1922 text &quot;Über einige neurotische Mechanismen bei Eifersucht, Paranoia und Homosexualität&quot; (&quot;Some Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality&quot;) as &quot;De quelques mécanismes névrotiques dans la jalousie, la paranoïa et l&#x27;homosexualité&quot; in the &quot;&quot;. In Autumn 1932, Lacan began his training analysis with Rudolph Loewenstein, which was to last until 1938.

In 1934 Lacan became a candidate member of the Société psychanalytique de Paris (SPP). He began his private psychoanalytic practice in 1936 whilst still seeing patients at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, and the same year presented his first analytic report at the Congress of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in Marienbad on the &quot;Mirror Phase&quot;. The congress chairman, Ernest Jones, terminated the lecture before its conclusion, since he was unwilling to extend Lacan&#x27;s stated presentation time. Insulted, Lacan left the congress to witness the Berlin Olympic Games. No copy of the original lecture remains, Lacan having decided not to hand in his text for publication in the conference proceedings.

Lacan&#x27;s attendance at Kojève&#x27;s lectures on Hegel, given between 1933 and 1939, and which focused on the &quot;Phenomenology&quot; and the master-slave dialectic in particular, was formative for his subsequent work, initially in his formulation of his theory of the mirror phase, for which he was also indebted to the experimental work on child development of Henri Wallon.

It was Wallon who commissioned from Lacan the last major text of his pre-war period, a contribution to the 1938 &quot;Encyclopédie française&quot; entitled &quot;La Famille&quot; (reprinted in 1984 as &quot;Les Complexes familiaux dans la formation de l&#x27;individu&quot;, Paris: Navarin). 1938 was also the year of Lacan&#x27;s accession to full membership (&quot;membre titulaire&quot;) of the SPP, notwithstanding considerable opposition from many of its senior members who were unimpressed by his recasting of Freudian theory in philosophical terms.

Lacan married Marie-Louise Blondin in January 1934 and in January 1937 they had the first of their three children, a daughter named Caroline. A son, Thibaut, was born in August 1939 and a daughter, Sibylle, in November 1940.

===1940s===
The SPP was disbanded due to Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of France in 1940. Lacan was called up for military service which he undertook in periods of duty at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, whilst at the same time continuing his private psychoanalytic practice. In 1942 he moved into apartments at 5 rue de Lille, which he would occupy until his death. During the war he did not publish any work, turning instead to a study of Chinese for which he obtained a degree from the École spéciale des langues orientales.

In a relationship they formed before the war, Sylvia Bataille (née Maklès), the estranged wife of his friend Georges Bataille, became Lacan&#x27;s mistress and, in 1953, his second wife. During the war their relationship was complicated by the threat of deportation for Sylvia, who was Jewish, since this required her to live in the unoccupied territories. Lacan intervened personally with the authorities to obtain papers detailing her family origins, which he destroyed. In 1941 they had a child, Judith. She kept the name Bataille because Lacan wished to delay the announcement of his divorce until after the war.

After the war, the SPP recommenced their meetings. In 1945 Lacan visited England for a five-week study trip, where he met the British analysts Ernest Jones, Wilfred Bion and John Rickman. Bion&#x27;s analytic work with groups influenced Lacan, contributing to his own subsequent emphasis on study groups as a structure within which to advance theoretical work in psychoanalysis. He published a report of his visit as &#x27;La Psychiatrique anglaise et la guerre&#x27; (&quot;Evolution psychiatrique&quot; 1, 1947, pp.  293–318).

In 1949, Lacan presented a new paper on the mirror stage, &#x27;The Mirror-Stage, as Formative of the I, as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience&#x27;, to the sixteenth IPA congress in Zurich. The same year he set out in the &quot;Doctrine de la Commission de l&#x27;Enseignement,&quot; produced for the Training Commission of the SPP, the protocols for the training of candidates.

===1950s===
With the purchase in 1951 of a country mansion at Guitrancourt, Lacan established a base for weekend retreats for work, leisure—including extravagant social occasions—and for the accommodation of his vast library. His art collection included Courbet&#x27;s L&#x27;Origine du monde, which he had concealed in his study by a removable wooden screen on which an abstract representation of the Courbet by the artist André Masson was portrayed.

In 1951, Lacan started to hold a private weekly seminar in Paris in which he inaugurated what he described as &quot;a return to Freud,&quot; whose doctrines were to be re-articulated through a reading of Saussure&#x27;s linguistics and Levi-Strauss&#x27;s structuralist anthropology. Becoming public in 1953, Lacan&#x27;s 27-year-long seminar was highly influential in Parisian cultural life, as well as in psychoanalytic theory and clinical practice.

In January 1953 Lacan was elected president of the SPP. When, at a meeting the following June, a formal motion was passed against him criticising his abandonment of the standard analytic training session for the variable-length session, he immediately resigned his presidency. He and a number of colleagues then resigned from the SPP to form the Société Française de Psychanalyse (SFP). One consequence of this was to eventually deprive the new group of membership of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

Encouraged by the reception of &quot;the return to Freud&quot; and of his report &quot;The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis,&quot; Lacan began to re-read Freud&#x27;s works in relation to contemporary philosophy, linguistics, ethnology, biology, and topology. From 1953 to 1964 at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he held his Seminars and presented case histories of patients. During this period he wrote the texts that are found in the collection &quot;Écrits&quot;, which was first published in 1966. In his seventh seminar &quot;The Ethics of Psychoanalysis&quot; (1959–60), which according to Lewis A. Kirshner &quot;arguably represents the most far-reaching attempt to derive a comprehensive ethical position from psychoanalysis,&quot; Lacan defined the ethical foundations of psychoanalysis and presented his &quot;ethics for our time&quot;—one that would, in the words of Freud, prove to be equal to the tragedy of modern man and to the &quot;discontent of civilization.&quot; At the roots of the ethics is desire: the only promise of analysis is austere, it is the entrance-into-the-I (in French a play on words between &quot;l&#x27;entrée en je&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;entrée en jeu&quot;). &quot;I must come to the place where the id was,&quot; where the analysand discovers, in its absolute nakedness, the truth of his desire. The end of psychoanalysis entails &quot;the purification of desire.&quot; He defended three assertions: that psychoanalysis must have a scientific status; that Freudian ideas have radically changed the concepts of subject, of knowledge, and of desire; and that the analytic field is the only place from which it is possible to question the insufficiencies of science and philosophy.

===1960s===
Starting in 1962, a complex negotiation took place to determine the status of the SFP within the IPA. Lacan&#x27;s practice (with its controversial indeterminate-length sessions) and his critical stance towards psychoanalytic orthodoxy led, in August 1963, to the IPA setting the condition that registration of the SFP was dependent upon the removal of Lacan from the list of SFP analysts. With the SFP&#x27;s decision to honour this request in November 1963, Lacan had effectively been stripped of the right to conduct training analyses and thus was constrained to form his own institution in order to accommodate the many candidates who desired to continue their analyses with him. This he did, on 21 June 1964, in the &quot;Founding Act&quot; of what became known as the École Freudienne de Paris (EFP), taking &quot;many representatives of the third generation with him: among them were Maud and Octave Mannoni, Serge Leclaire ... and Jean Clavreul&quot;.

With the support of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Louis Althusser, Lacan was appointed lecturer at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. He started with a seminar on &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot; in January 1964 in the Dussane room at the École Normale Supérieure. Lacan began to set forth his own approach to psychoanalysis to an audience of colleagues that had joined him from the SFP. His lectures also attracted many of the École Normale&#x27;s students. He divided the École Freudienne de Paris into three sections: the section of pure psychoanalysis (training and elaboration of the theory, where members who have been analyzed but have not become analysts can participate); the section for applied psychoanalysis (therapeutic and clinical, physicians who either have not started or have not yet completed analysis are welcome); and the section for taking inventory of the Freudian field (concerning the critique of psychoanalytic literature and the analysis of the theoretical relations with related or affiliated sciences). In 1967 he invented the procedure of the Pass, which was added to the statutes after being voted in by the members of the EFP the following year.

1966 saw the publication of Lacan&#x27;s collected writings, the &quot;Écrits&quot;, compiled with an index of concepts by Jacques-Alain Miller. Printed by the prestigious publishing house Éditions du Seuil, the &quot;Écrits&quot; did much to establish Lacan&#x27;s reputation to a wider public. The success of the publication led to a subsequent two-volume edition in 1969.

By the 1960s, Lacan was associated, at least in the public mind, with the far left in France. In May 1968, Lacan voiced his sympathy for the student protests and as a corollary his followers set up a Department of Psychology at the University of Vincennes (Paris VIII). However, Lacan&#x27;s unequivocal comments in 1971 on revolutionary ideals in politics draw a sharp line between the actions of some of his followers and his own style of &quot;revolt.&quot;

In 1969, Lacan moved his public seminars to the Faculté de Droit (Panthéon), where he continued to deliver his expositions of analytic theory and practice until the dissolution of his school in 1980.

===1970s===
Throughout the final decade of his life, Lacan continued his widely followed seminars. During this period, he developed his concepts of masculine and feminine jouissance and placed an increased emphasis on the concept of &quot;the Real&quot; as a point of impossible contradiction in the &quot;symbolic order&quot;. Lacan continued to draw widely on various disciplines, working closely on classical Chinese literature with François Cheng and on the life and work of James Joyce with Jacques Aubert.
The growing success of the &quot;Écrits&quot;, which was translated (in abridged form) into German and English, led to invitations to lecture in Italy, Japan and the United States. He gave lectures in 1975 at Yale, Columbia and MIT.

===Last years===
Lacan&#x27;s failing health made it difficult for him to meet the demands of the year-long Seminars he had been delivering since the fifties, but his teaching continued into the first year of the eighties. After dissolving his School, the EFP, in January 1980, Lacan travelled to Caracas to found the Freudian Field Institute on 12 July.

The Overture to the Caracas Encounter was to be Lacan&#x27;s final public address. His last texts from the spring of 1981 are brief institutional documents pertaining to the newly formed Freudian Field Institute.

Lacan died on 9 September 1981.

==Major concepts==

===Return to Freud===
Lacan&#x27;s &quot;return to Freud&quot; emphasizes a renewed attention to the original texts of Freud, and included a radical critique of ego psychology, whereas &quot;Lacan&#x27;s quarrel with Object Relations psychoanalysis&quot; was a more muted affair. Here he attempted &quot;to restore to the notion of the Object Relation... the capital of experience that legitimately belongs to it&quot;, building upon what he termed &quot;the hesitant, but controlled work of Melanie Klein... Through her we know the function of the imaginary primordial enclosure formed by the &quot;imago&quot; of the mother&#x27;s body&quot;, as well as upon &quot;the notion of the transitional object, introduced by D. W. Winnicott... a key-point for the explanation of the genesis of fetishism&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Lacan systematically questioned those psychoanalytic developments from the 1930s to the 1970s, which were increasingly and almost exclusively focused on the child&#x27;s early relations with the mother... the pre-Oedipal or Kleinian mother&quot;; and Lacan&#x27;s rereading of Freud—&quot;characteristically, Lacan insists that his return to Freud supplies the only valid model&quot;—formed a basic conceptual starting-point in that oppositional strategy.

Lacan thought that Freud&#x27;s ideas of &quot;slips of the tongue&quot;, jokes, and the interpretation of dreams all emphasized the agency of language in subjects&#x27; own constitution of themselves. In &quot;The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, or Reason Since Freud,&quot; he proposes that &quot;the psychoanalytic experience discovers in the unconscious the whole structure of language&quot;. The unconscious is not a primitive or archetypal part of the mind separate from the conscious, linguistic ego, he explained, but rather a formation as complex and structurally sophisticated as consciousness itself. Lacan is associated with the idea that &quot;the unconscious is structured like a language&quot;, but the first time this sentence occurs in his work, he clarifies that he means that both the unconscious and language are structured, not that they share a single structure; and that the structure of language is such that the subject cannot necessarily be equated with the speaker. This results in the self being denied any point of reference to which to be &quot;restored&quot; following trauma or a crisis of identity.

André Green objected that &quot;when you read Freud, it is obvious that this proposition doesn&#x27;t work for a minute. Freud very clearly opposes the unconscious (which he says is constituted by thing-presentations and nothing else) to the pre-conscious. What is related to language can only belong to the pre-conscious&quot;. Freud certainly contrasted &quot;the presentation of the &quot;word&quot; and the presentation of the &quot;thing&quot;... the unconscious presentation is the presentation of the thing alone&quot; in his metapsychology. Dylan Evans, however, in his &quot;Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis,&quot; &quot;... takes issue with those who, like André Green, question the linguistic aspect of the unconscious, emphasizing Lacan&#x27;s distinction between &quot;das Ding&quot; and &quot;die Sache&quot; in Freud&#x27;s account of thing-presentation&quot;. Green&#x27;s criticism of Lacan also included accusations of intellectual dishonesty, he said, &quot;[He] cheated everybody... the return to Freud was an excuse, it just meant going to Lacan.&quot;

===Mirror stage===

Lacan&#x27;s first official contribution to psychoanalysis was the mirror stage, which he described as &quot;formative of the function of the &#x27;I&#x27; as revealed in psychoanalytic experience.&quot; By the early 1950s, he came to regard the mirror stage as more than a moment in the life of the infant; instead, it formed part of the permanent structure of subjectivity. In the &quot;imaginary order&quot;, the subject&#x27;s own image permanently catches and captivates the subject. Lacan explains that &quot;the mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body-image&quot;.

As this concept developed further, the stress fell less on its historical value and more on its structural value. In his fourth seminar, &quot;La relation d&#x27;objet,&quot; Lacan states that &quot;the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship. &quot;

The mirror stage describes the formation of the ego via the process of objectification, the ego being the result of a conflict between one&#x27;s perceived visual appearance and one&#x27;s emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called &quot;alienation&quot;. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize itself in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with its image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the ego. Lacan understood this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares its own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.

Lacan calls the specular image &quot;orthopaedic,&quot; since it leads the child to anticipate the overcoming of its &quot;real specific prematurity of birth.&quot; The vision of the body as integrated and contained, in opposition to the child&#x27;s actual experience of motor incapacity and the sense of his or her body as fragmented, induces a movement from &quot;insufficiency to anticipation.&quot; In other words, the mirror image initiates and then aids, like a crutch, the process of the formation of an integrated sense of self.

In the mirror stage a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; (&quot;méconnaissance&quot;) constitutes the ego—the &quot;me&quot; (&quot;moi&quot;) becomes alienated from itself through the introduction of an imaginary dimension to the subject. The mirror stage also has a significant symbolic dimension, due to the presence of the figure of the adult who carries the infant. Having jubilantly assumed the image as their own, the child turns their head towards this adult, who represents the big other, as if to call on the adult to ratify this image.

===Other===
While Freud uses the term &quot;other&quot;, referring to &quot;der Andere&quot; (the other person) and &quot;das Andere&quot; (otherness), Lacan (influenced by the seminar of Alexandre Kojève) theorizes alterity in a manner more closely resembling Hegel&#x27;s philosophy.

Lacan often used an algebraic symbology for his concepts: the big other (&quot;l&#x27;Autre&quot;) is designated &quot;A&quot;, and the little other (&quot;l&#x27;autre&quot;) is designated &quot;a&quot;. He asserts that an awareness of this distinction is fundamental to analytic practice: &quot;the analyst must be imbued with the difference between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot;, so he can situate himself in the place of Other, and not the other&quot;. Dylan Evans explains that:

* The little other is the other who is not really other, but a reflection and projection of the ego. Evans adds that for this reason the symbol &quot;a&quot; can represent both the little other and the ego in the schema L. It is simultaneously the counterpart and the specular image. The little other is thus entirely inscribed in the imaginary order.
* The big other designates radical alterity, an other-ness which transcends the illusory otherness of the imaginary because it cannot be assimilated through identification. Lacan equates this radical alterity with language and the law, and hence the big other is inscribed in the order of the symbolic. Indeed, the big other &quot;is&quot; the symbolic insofar as it is particularized for each subject. The other is thus both another subject, in its radical alterity and unassimilable uniqueness, and also the symbolic order which mediates the relationship with that other subject.&quot;

For Lacan &quot;the Other must first of all be considered a locus in which speech is constituted,&quot; so that the other as another subject is secondary to the other as symbolic order. We can speak of the other &quot;as a subject&quot; in a secondary sense only when a subject occupies this position and thereby embodies the other for another subject.

In arguing that speech originates in neither the ego nor in the subject but rather in the other, Lacan stresses that speech and language are beyond the subject&#x27;s conscious control. They come from another place, outside of consciousness&quot;the unconscious is the discourse of the Other&quot;. When conceiving the other as a place, Lacan refers to Freud&#x27;s concept of psychical locality, in which the unconscious is described as &quot;the other scene&quot;.

&quot;It is the mother who first occupies the position of the big Other for the child&quot;, Dylan Evans explains, &quot;it is she who receives the child&#x27;s primitive cries and retroactively sanctions them as a particular message&quot;. The castration complex is formed when the child discovers that this other is not complete because there is a &quot;lack (manque)&quot; in the other. This means that there is always a signifier missing from the trove of signifiers constituted by the other. Lacan illustrates this incomplete other graphically by striking a bar through the symbol &quot;A&quot;; hence another name for the castrated, incomplete other is the &quot;barred other&quot;.

===Phallus===
Feminist thinkers have both utilised and criticised Lacan&#x27;s concepts of castration and the phallus. Feminists such as Avital Ronell, Jane Gallop, and Elizabeth Grosz, have interpreted Lacan&#x27;s work as opening up new possibilities for feminist theory.

Some feminists have argued that Lacan&#x27;s phallocentric analysis provides a useful means of understanding gender biases and imposed roles, while others, most notably Luce Irigaray, accuse Lacan of maintaining the sexist tradition in psychoanalysis. For Irigaray, the phallus does not define a single axis of gender by its presence or absence; instead, gender has two positive poles. Like Irigaray, French philosopher Jacques Derrida, in criticizing Lacan&#x27;s concept of castration, discusses the phallus in a chiasmus with the hymen, as both one and other.

===Three orders (plus one)===
Lacan considered psychic functions to occur within a universal matrix. The Real, Imaginary and Symbolic are properties of this matrix, which make up part of every psychic function. This is not analogous to Freud&#x27;s concept of id, ego and superego since in Freud&#x27;s model certain functions take place within components of the psyche while Lacan thought that all three orders were part of every function. Lacan refined the concept of the orders over decades, resulting in inconsistencies in his writings. He eventually added a fourth component, the sinthome.

====The Imaginary====

The Imaginary is the field of images and imagination. The main illusions of this order are synthesis, autonomy, duality, and resemblance. Lacan thought that the relationship created within the mirror stage between the ego and the reflected image means that the ego and the Imaginary order itself are places of radical alienation: &quot;alienation is constitutive of the Imaginary order&quot;. This relationship is also narcissistic.

In &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot;, Lacan argues that the Symbolic order structures the visual field of the Imaginary, which means that it involves a linguistic dimension. If the signifier is the foundation of the symbolic, the signified and signification are part of the Imaginary order. Language has symbolic and Imaginary connotations—in its Imaginary aspect, language is the &quot;wall of language&quot; that inverts and distorts the discourse of the Other. The Imaginary, however, is rooted in the subject&#x27;s relationship with his or her own body (the image of the body). In &quot;Fetishism: the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real&quot;, Lacan argues that in the sexual plane the Imaginary appears as sexual display and courtship love.

Insofar as identification with the analyst is the objective of analysis, Lacan accused major psychoanalytic schools of reducing the practice of psychoanalysis to the Imaginary order. Instead, Lacan proposes the use of the symbolic to dislodge the disabling fixations of the Imaginary—the analyst transforms the images into words. &quot;The use of the Symbolic&quot;, he argued, &quot;is the only way for the analytic process to cross the plane of identification.&quot;

====The Symbolic====

In his Seminar IV, &quot;La relation d&#x27;objet&quot;, Lacan argues that the concepts of &quot;Law&quot; and &quot;Structure&quot; are unthinkable without language—thus the Symbolic is a linguistic dimension. This order is not equivalent to language, however, since language involves the Imaginary and the Real as well. The dimension proper to language in the Symbolic is that of the signifier—that is, a dimension in which elements have no positive existence, but which are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.

The Symbolic is also the field of radical alterity—that is, the Other; the unconscious is the discourse of this Other. It is the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the Oedipus complex. The Symbolic is the domain of culture as opposed to the Imaginary order of nature. As important elements in the Symbolic, the concepts of death and lack (&quot;manque&quot;) connive to make of the pleasure principle the regulator of the distance from the Thing (in German, &quot;das Ding an sich&quot;) and the death drive that goes &quot;beyond the pleasure principle by means of repetition&quot;&quot;the death drive is only a mask of the Symbolic order&quot;.

By working in the Symbolic order, the analyst is able to produce changes in the subjective position of the person undergoing psychoanalysis. These changes will produce imaginary effects because the Imaginary is structured by the Symbolic.

====The Real====

Lacan&#x27;s concept of the Real dates back to 1936 and his doctoral thesis on psychosis. It was a term that was popular at the time, particularly with Émile Meyerson, who referred to it as &quot;an ontological absolute, a true being-in-itself&quot;. Lacan returned to the theme of the Real in 1953 and continued to develop it until his death. The Real, for Lacan, is not synonymous with reality. Not only opposed to the Imaginary, the Real is also exterior to the Symbolic. Unlike the latter, which is constituted in terms of oppositions (i.e. presence/absence), &quot;there is no absence in the Real&quot;. Whereas the Symbolic opposition &quot;presence/absence&quot; implies the possibility that something may be missing from the Symbolic, &quot;the Real is always in its place&quot;. If the Symbolic is a set of differentiated elements (signifiers), the Real in itself is undifferentiatedit bears no fissure. The Symbolic introduces &quot;a cut in the real&quot; in the process of signification: &quot;it is the world of words that creates the world of things—things originally confused in the &#x27;here and now&#x27; of the all in the process of coming into being&quot;. The Real is that which is outside language and that resists symbolization absolutely. In Seminar XI Lacan defines the Real as &quot;the impossible&quot; because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the Symbolic, and impossible to attain. It is this resistance to symbolization that lends the Real its traumatic quality. Finally, the Real is the object of anxiety, insofar as it lacks any possible mediation and is &quot;the essential object which is not an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety &quot;par excellence&quot;.&quot;

====The Sinthome====

The term &quot;sinthome&quot; () was introduced by Jacques Lacan in his seminar &quot;Le sinthome&quot; (1975–76). According to Lacan, &quot;sinthome&quot; is the Latin way (1495 Rabelais, IV,63) of spelling the Greek origin of the French word &quot;symptôme&quot;, meaning symptom. The seminar is a continuing elaboration of his topology, extending the previous seminar&#x27;s focus (&quot;RSI&quot;) on the Borromean Knot and an exploration of the writings of James Joyce. Lacan redefines the psychoanalytic symptom in terms of his topology of the subject.

In &quot;Psychoanalysis and its Teachings&quot; (&quot;Écrits&quot;) Lacan views the symptom as inscribed in a writing process, not as ciphered message which was the traditional notion. In his seminar &quot;L&#x27;angoisse&quot; (1962–63) he states that the symptom does not call for interpretation: in itself it is not a call to the Other but a pure &quot;jouissance&quot; addressed to no-one. This is a shift from the linguistic definition of the symptomas a signifierto his assertion that &quot;the symptom can only be defined as the way in which each subject enjoys (&quot;jouit&quot;) the unconscious in so far as the unconscious determines the subject&quot;. He goes from conceiving the symptom as a message which can be deciphered by reference to the unconscious structured like a language to seeing it as the trace of the particular modality of the subject&#x27;s &quot;jouissance&quot;.

===Desire===
Lacan&#x27;s concept of desire is related to Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Begierde&quot;, a term that implies a continuous force, and therefore somehow differs from Freud&#x27;s concept of &quot;Wunsch&quot;. Lacan&#x27;s desire refers always to unconscious desire because it is unconscious desire that forms the central concern of psychoanalysis.

The aim of psychoanalysis is to lead the analysand to recognize his/her desire and by doing so to uncover the truth about his/her desire. However this is possible only if desire is articulated in speech: &quot;It is only once it is formulated, named in the presence of the other, that desire appears in the full sense of the term.&quot; And again in &quot;The Ego in Freud&#x27;s Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis&quot;: &quot;what is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence. The subject should come to recognize and to name her/his desire. But it isn&#x27;t a question of recognizing something that could be entirely given. In naming it, the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the world.&quot; The truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, although discourse is never able to articulate the entire truth about desire; whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover or surplus.

Lacan distinguishes desire from need and from demand. Need is a biological instinct where the subject depends on the Other to satisfy its own needs: in order to get the Other&#x27;s help, &quot;need&quot; must be articulated in &quot;demand&quot;. But the presence of the Other not only ensures the satisfaction of the &quot;need&quot;, it also represents the Other&#x27;s love. Consequently, &quot;demand&quot; acquires a double function: on the one hand, it articulates &quot;need&quot;, and on the other, acts as a &quot;demand for love&quot;. Even after the &quot;need&quot; articulated in demand is satisfied, the &quot;demand for love&quot; remains unsatisfied since the Other cannot provide the unconditional love that the subject seeks. &quot;Desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction, nor the demand for love, but the difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second.&quot; Desire is a surplus, a leftover, produced by the articulation of need in demand: &quot;desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need&quot;. Unlike need, which can be satisfied, desire can never be satisfied: it is constant in its pressure and eternal. The attainment of desire does not consist in being fulfilled but in its reproduction as such. As Slavoj Žižek puts it, &quot;desire&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; is not to realize its goal, to find full satisfaction, but to reproduce itself as desire&quot;.

Lacan also distinguishes between desire and the drives: desire is one and drives are many. The drives are the partial manifestations of a single force called desire. Lacan&#x27;s concept of &quot;objet petit a&quot; is the object of desire, although this object is not that towards which desire tends, but rather the cause of desire. Desire is not a relation to an object but a relation to a lack (&quot;manque&quot;).

In &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot; Lacan argues that &quot;man&#x27;s desire is the desire of the Other.&quot; This entails the following:
# Desire is the desire of the Other&#x27;s desire, meaning that desire is the object of another&#x27;s desire and that desire is also desire for recognition. Here Lacan follows Alexandre Kojève, who follows Hegel: for Kojève the subject must risk his own life if he wants to achieve the desired prestige. This desire to be the object of another&#x27;s desire is best exemplified in the Oedipus complex, when the subject desires to be the phallus of the mother.
# In &quot;The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious&quot;, Lacan contends that the subject desires from the point of view of another whereby the object of someone&#x27;s desire is an object desired by another one: what makes the object desirable is that it is precisely desired by someone else. Again Lacan follows Kojève. who follows Hegel. This aspect of desire is present in hysteria, for the hysteric is someone who converts another&#x27;s desire into his/her own (see Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria&quot; in SE VII, where Dora desires Frau K because she identifies with Herr K). What matters then in the analysis of a hysteric is not to find out the object of her desire but to discover the subject with whom she identifies.
# &quot;Désir de l&#x27;Autre&quot;, which is translated as &quot;desire for the Other&quot; (though it could also be &quot;desire of the Other&quot;). The fundamental desire is the incestuous desire for the mother, the primordial Other.
# Desire is &quot;the desire for something else&quot;, since it is impossible to desire what one already has. The object of desire is continually deferred, which is why desire is a metonymy.
# Desire appears in the field of the Otherthat is, in the unconscious.

Last but not least for Lacan, the first person who occupies the place of the Other is the mother and at first the child is at her mercy. Only when the father articulates desire with the Law by castrating the mother is the subject liberated from desire for the mother.

===Drive===
Lacan maintains Freud&#x27;s distinction between drive (&quot;Trieb&quot;) and instinct (&quot;Instinkt&quot;). Drives differ from biological needs because they can never be satisfied and do not aim at an object but rather circle perpetually around it. He argues that the purpose of the drive (&quot;Triebziel&quot;) is not to reach a goal but to follow its aim, meaning &quot;the way itself&quot; instead of &quot;the final destination&quot;that is, to circle around the object. The purpose of the drive is to return to its circular path and the true source of &quot;jouissance&quot; is the repetitive movement of this closed circuit. Lacan posits drives as both cultural and symbolic constructs: to him, &quot;the drive is not a given, something archaic, primordial&quot;. He incorporates the four elements of drives as defined by Freud (pressure, end, object and source) to his theory of the drive&#x27;s circuit: the drive originates in the erogenous zone, circles round the object, and returns to the erogenous zone. Three grammatical voices structure this circuit:
# the active voice (to see)
# the reflexive voice (to see oneself)
# the passive voice (to be seen)
The active and reflexive voices are autoeroticthey lack a subject. It is only when the drive completes its circuit with the passive voice that a new subject appears, implying that, prior to that instance, there was no subject. Despite being the &quot;passive&quot; voice, the drive is essentially active: &quot;to make oneself be seen&quot; rather than &quot;to be seen&quot;. The circuit of the drive is the only way for the subject to transgress the pleasure principle.

To Freud sexuality is composed of partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), it is only in puberty that they become organized under the aegis of the genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but (1) he rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organizationthe primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and (2) he argues that drives are partial in that they represent sexuality only partially and not in the sense that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of &quot;jouissance&quot;.

Lacan identifies four partial drives: the oral drive (the erogenous zones are the lips (the partial object the breastthe verb is &quot;to suck&quot;), the anal drive (the anus and the faeces, &quot;to shit&quot;), the scopic drive (the eyes and the gaze, &quot;to see&quot;) and the invocatory drive (the ears and the voice, &quot;to hear&quot;). The first two drives relate to demand and the last two to desire.

The notion of dualism is maintained throughout Freud&#x27;s various reformulations of the drive-theory. From the initial opposition between sexual drives and ego-drives (self-preservation) to the final opposition between the life drives (&quot;Lebenstriebe&quot;) and the death drives (&quot;Todestriebe&quot;). Lacan retains Freud&#x27;s dualism, but in terms of an opposition between the symbolic and the imaginary and not referred to different kinds of drives. For Lacan all drives are sexual drives, and every drive is a death drive (&quot;pulsion de mort&quot;) since every drive is excessive, repetitive and destructive.

The drives are closely related to desire, since both originate in the field of the subject. But they are not to be confused: drives are the partial aspects in which desire is realizeddesire is one and undivided, whereas the drives are its partial manifestations. A drive is a demand that is not caught up in the dialectical mediation of desire; drive is a &quot;mechanical&quot; insistence that is not ensnared in demand&#x27;s dialectical mediation.

==Lacan on error and knowledge==
Building on Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot;, Lacan long argued that &quot;every unsuccessful act is a successful, not to say &#x27;well-turned&#x27;, discourse&quot;, highlighting as well &quot;sudden transformations of errors into truths, which seemed to be due to nothing more than perseverance&quot;. In a late seminar, he generalised more fully the psychoanalytic discovery of &quot;truth—arising from misunderstanding&quot;, so as to maintain that &quot;the subject is naturally erring... discourse structures alone give him his moorings and reference points, signs identify and orient him; if he neglects, forgets, or loses them, he is condemned to err anew&quot;.

Because of &quot;the alienation to which speaking beings are subjected due to their being in language&quot;, to survive &quot;one must let oneself be taken in by signs and become the dupe of a discourse... [of] fictions organized in to a discourse&quot;. For Lacan, with &quot;masculine knowledge irredeemably an erring&quot;, the individual &quot;must thus allow himself to be fooled by these signs to have a chance of getting his bearings amidst them; he must place and maintain himself in the wake of a discourse... become the dupe of a discourse... &quot;les non-dupes errent&quot;&quot;.

Lacan comes close here to one of the points where &quot;very occasionally he sounds like Thomas Kuhn (whom he never mentions)&quot;, with Lacan&#x27;s &quot;discourse&quot; resembling Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;paradigm&quot; seen as &quot;the entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the members of a given community&quot;.

==Clinical contributions==

===Variable-length session===
The &quot;variable-length psychoanalytic session&quot; was one of Lacan&#x27;s crucial clinical innovations, and a key element in his conflicts with the IPA, to whom his &quot;innovation of reducing the fifty-minute analytic hour to a Delphic seven or eight minutes (or sometimes even to a single oracular &quot;parole&quot; murmured in the waiting-room)&quot; was unacceptable. Lacan&#x27;s variable-length sessions lasted anywhere from a few minutes (or even, if deemed appropriate by the analyst, a few seconds) to several hours. This practice replaced the classical Freudian &quot;fifty minute hour&quot;.

With respect to what he called &quot;the cutting up of the &#x27;timing&#x27;&quot;, Lacan asked the question, &quot;Why make an intervention impossible at this point, which is consequently privileged in this way?&quot; By allowing the analyst&#x27;s intervention on timing, the variable-length session removed the patient&#x27;s former certainty as to the length of time that they would be on the couch. When Lacan adopted the practice, &quot;the psychoanalytic establishment were scandalized&quot;—and, given that &quot;between 1979 and 1980 he saw an average of ten patients an hour&quot;, it is perhaps not hard to see why. Psychoanalysis was &quot;reduced to zero&quot;, though the treatments were no less lucrative.

At the time of his original innovation, Lacan described the issue as concerning &quot;the systematic use of shorter sessions in certain analyses, and in particular in training analyses&quot;; and in practice it was certainly a shortening of the session around the so-called &quot;critical moment&quot; which took place, so that critics wrote that &quot;everyone is well aware what is meant by the deceptive phrase &#x27;variable length&#x27; ... sessions systematically reduced to just a few minutes&quot;. Irrespective of the theoretical merits of breaking up patients&#x27; expectations, it was clear that &quot;the Lacanian analyst never wants to &#x27;shake up&#x27; the routine by keeping them for more rather than less time&quot;. Lacan&#x27;s shorter sessions enabled him to take many more clients than therapists using orthodox Freudian methods, and this growth continued as Lacan&#x27;s students and followers adopted the same practice.

Accepting the importance of &quot;the critical moment when insight arises&quot;, object relations theory would nonetheless suggest that &quot;if the analyst does not provide the patient with space in which nothing &quot;needs&quot; to happen there is no space in which something &quot;can&quot; happen&quot;. Julia Kristeva would concur that &quot;Lacan, alert to the scandal of the timeless intrinsic to the analytic experience, was mistaken in wanting to ritualize it as a technique of scansion (short sessions)&quot;.

==Writings and writing style==
According to Jean-Michel Rabaté, Lacan in the mid-1950s classed the seminars as commentaries on Freud rather than presentations of his own doctrine (like the writings), while Lacan by 1971 placed the most value on his teaching and &quot;the interactive space of his seminar&quot; (in contrast to Sigmund Freud). Rabaté also argued that from 1964 onward, the seminars include original ideas. However, Rabaté also wrote that the seminars are &quot;more problematic&quot; because of the importance of the interactive performances, and because they were partly edited and rewritten.

Most of Lacan&#x27;s psychoanalytic writings from the 1940s through to the early 1960s were compiled with an index of concepts by Jacques-Alain Miller in the 1966 collection, titled simply &quot;Écrits&quot;. Published in French by Éditions du Seuil, they were later issued as a two-volume set (1970/1) with a new &quot;Preface&quot;. A selection of the writings (chosen by Lacan himself) were translated by Alan Sheridan and published by Tavistock Press in 1977. The full 35-text volume appeared for the first time in English in Bruce Fink&#x27;s translation published by Norton &amp; Co. (2006). The &quot;Écrits&quot; were included on the list of 100 most influential books of the 20th century compiled and polled by the broadsheet &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

Lacan&#x27;s writings from the late sixties and seventies (thus subsequent to the 1966 collection) were collected posthumously, along with some early texts from the nineteen thirties, in the Éditions du Seuil volume &quot;Autres écrits&quot; (2001).

Although most of the texts in &quot;Écrits&quot; and &quot;Autres écrits&quot; are closely related to Lacan&#x27;s lectures or lessons from his Seminar, more often than not the style is denser than Lacan&#x27;s oral delivery, and a clear distinction between the writings and the transcriptions of the oral teaching is evident to the reader.

An often neglected aspect of Lacan&#x27;s oral and writing style is his influence from his colleague and personal friend Henry Corbin, who introduced Lacan to the thought of Ibn Arabi. Similarities have been pointed out between the writing styles of Lacan and Ibn Arabi.

Jacques-Alain Miller is the sole editor of Lacan&#x27;s seminars, which contain the majority of his life&#x27;s work. &quot;There has been considerable controversy over the accuracy or otherwise of the transcription and editing&quot;, as well as over &quot;Miller&#x27;s refusal to allow any critical or annotated edition to be published&quot;. Despite Lacan&#x27;s status as a major figure in the history of psychoanalysis, some of his seminars remain unpublished. Since 1984, Miller has been regularly conducting a series of lectures, &quot;L&#x27;orientation lacanienne.&quot; Miller&#x27;s teachings have been published in the US by the journal &quot;Lacanian Ink.&quot;

Lacan&#x27;s writing is notoriously difficult, due in part to the repeated Hegelian/Kojèvean allusions, wide theoretical divergences from other psychoanalytic and philosophical theory, and an obscure prose style. For some, &quot;the impenetrability of Lacan&#x27;s prose... [is] too often regarded as profundity precisely because it cannot be understood&quot;. Arguably at least, &quot;the imitation of his style by other &#x27;Lacanian&#x27; commentators&quot; has resulted in &quot;an obscurantist antisystematic tradition in Lacanian literature&quot;.

Although Lacan is a major influence on psychoanalysis in France and parts of Latin America, in the English-speaking world his influence on clinical psychology has been far less and his ideas are best known in the arts and humanities. However, there are Lacanian psychoanalytic societies in both North America and the United Kingdom that carry on his work.

One example of Lacan&#x27;s work being practiced in the United States is found in the works of Annie G. Rogers (&quot;A Shining Affliction&quot;; &quot;The Unsayable: The Hidden Language of Trauma&quot;), which credit Lacanian theory for many therapeutic insights in successfully treating sexually abused young women. Lacan&#x27;s work has also reached Quebec, where The Interdisciplinary Freudian Group for Research and Clinical and Cultural Interventions (GIFRIC) claims that it has used a modified form of Lacanian psychoanalysis in successfully treating psychosis in many of its patients, a task once thought to be unsuited for psychoanalysis, even by psychoanalysts themselves.

==Legacy==
In his introduction to the 1994 Penguin edition of Lacan&#x27;s &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis&quot;, translator and historian David Macey describes Lacan as &quot;the most controversial psycho-analyst since Freud&quot;. His ideas had a significant impact on post-structuralism, critical theory, French philosophy, film theory, and clinical psychoanalysis. Theorists such as Rafael Holmberg have argued that Lacanian psychoanalysis even contributes to a criticism of the idea of Nature.

In 2003, Rabaté described &quot;The Freudian Thing&quot; (1956) as one of his &quot;most important and programmatic essays&quot;.

==Criticism==
===Theory of psychoanalysis===
Social psychologist, psychoanalyst, and humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm rejected Lacan&#x27;s view on psychonalysis whereby &quot;true psychoanalysis is founded on the relation between man and talk [&quot;parole&quot;],&quot; and denounced the reduction of analysis to &quot;a pure and simple exchange of words,&quot; arguing that the relation is instead about an &quot;exchange of signs.&quot; Fromm supports &quot;clarity and unambiguity&quot; in the communication with others (&quot;autrui&quot;) and opposes the Lacanian &quot;wordplay [that] is associated with the provision of meaning.&quot; Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalyst Élisabeth Roudinesco, in her biography of Lacan, writes that some writings of her subject were &quot;incomprehensible&quot; also to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Martin Heidegger.

Former Lacan student Didier Anzieu, in a 1967 article titled &quot;Against Lacan,&quot; described him as a &quot;danger&quot; because he kept his students tied to an &quot;unending dependence on an idol, a logic, or a language,&quot; by holding out the promise of &quot;fundamental truths&quot; to be revealed &quot;but always at some further point ...and only to those who continued to travel with him.&quot; According to Sherry Turkle, these attitudes are &quot;representative of how most members of the Association talk about Lacan.&quot;

By 1977, Lacan was declaring that he was not &quot;too keen&quot; (&quot;pas chaud-chaud&quot;) to claim that &quot;when one practices psychoanalysis, one knows where one goes,&quot; stating that &quot;psychoanalysis, like every other human activity, undoubtedly participates in abuse. One does as if one knows something.&quot;

Lacan&#x27;s charismatic authority has been linked to the many conflicts among his followers and in the analytic schools he was involved with. His intellectual style has also come in for much criticism. Eclectic in his use of sources, Lacan has been seen as concealing his own thought behind the apparent explication of that of others. Thus, his &quot;return to Freud&quot; was called by Malcolm Bowie &quot;a complete pattern of dissenting assent to the ideas of Freud Lacan&#x27;s argument is conducted on Freud&#x27;s behalf and, at the same time, against him&quot;. Bowie has also suggested that Lacan suffered from both a love of system and a deep-seated opposition to all forms of system.

===Therapeutic practice===
Lacan, in his psychoanalytic practice, came to hold sessions of diminishing duration. Eventually, Lacan&#x27;s student relates, they often lasted no more than five minutes, held sometimes with Lacan standing in the typically open door of the room. According to Godin, Lacan sometimes struck patients, once literally kicking out a female patient. Author and Lacanian psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller asserts that &quot;[Lacan]&#x27;s morality derives from a superior cynicism.&quot;

Lacan was criticised for being aggressive with his clients, often physically hitting them, sometimes sleeping with them, and charging &quot;exorbitant amounts of money&quot; for each session. Jean Laplanche argued that Lacan could have &quot;harmed&quot; some of his clients.

Others have been more forceful still, describing him as &quot;The Shrink from Hell&quot; and listing the many associates —from lovers and family to colleagues, patients, and editors— who were left damaged in his wake.

===Feminist criticism===
Many feminist thinkers have criticized Lacan&#x27;s thought. American philosopher Cynthia Willett accuses Lacan for portraying the mother less as a &quot;loving,&quot; &quot;nurturing&quot; presence in the infant&#x27;s world, but rather as a &quot;whore&quot; who abandons the child to a &quot;higher bidder for her affections,&quot; while Judith Butler, philosopher and gender studies scholar, reworks these notions as &quot;gender performativity.&quot;

Psycholinguist and cultural theorist Luce Irigaray &quot;ridicules&quot; through &quot;mimicry and exaggeration&quot; these representations of femininity posited as natural and proper by Lacan. Irigaray accuses Lacan of perpetuating phallocentric mastery in philosophical and psychoanalytic discourse.

Others have echoed this accusation, seeing Lacan as trapped in the very phallocentric mastery his language ostensibly sought to undermine. The result, Castoriadis would maintain, was to make all thought depend upon Lacan himself, and thus to stifle the capacity for independent thought among all those around him.

In an interview with anthropologist James Hunt, Sylvia Lacan said of her late husband: &quot;He was a man who worked tremendously hard. Tremendously intelligent. He was...what is called, well, a domestic tyrant... But he was worth the trouble. I have absolutely no reproaches to make against him. Just the contrary. But it was not possible to be a wife, a mother to my children, and an actress at the same time.&quot;

===Mathematics in psychoanalysis===
In their work &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; (1997), through which their stated intention was to show that &quot;famous intellectuals&quot; abuse scientific terminology and concepts, professors of Physics Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont examine Lacan&#x27;s frequent references to Mathematics. They are highly critical of his use of terms from mathematical fields, accusing him of &quot;superficial erudition&quot;, of abusing scientific concepts that he does not understand, and of producing statements that are &quot;not even wrong.&quot;

In a seminar held in 1959, he confuses the irrational numbers with the imaginary numbers, despite claiming to be &quot;precise.&quot; A year later, the mathematical &quot;calculations&quot; he presents in another seminar are assessed as &quot;pure fantasies.&quot;

Sokal and Bricmont find Lacan to be &quot;fond&quot; of topology, in which, though, they see Lacan committing serious errors. He uses technical terms erroneously, e.g. &quot;space&quot;, &quot;bounded&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, and even &quot;topology&quot; itself, and posits claims about a literal and not just symbolic or even metaphorical relation of topological mathematics with neurosis.

In the book&#x27;s preface, the authors state they shall not enter into the debate over the purely psychoanalytic part of Lacan&#x27;s work. Nonetheless, after presenting their case, they comment that &quot;Lacan never explains the relevance of his mathematical concepts for psychoanalysis,&quot; stating that &quot;the link with psychoanalysis is not supported by any argument.&quot; Equally meaningless they find his &quot;famous formulae of sexuation&quot; offered in support for the maxim &quot;There are no sexual relations.&quot; Considering the &quot;cryptic writings,&quot; the &quot;play on words&quot; and &quot;fractured syntax&quot;, as well as the &quot;reverent exegesis&quot; accorded to Lacan&#x27;s work by &quot;disciples&quot;, they point out a similarity to religiosity.

===Incomprehensibility===
Several critics have dismissed Lacan&#x27;s work wholesale. French philosopher called it an &quot;incoherent system of pseudo-scientific gibberish&quot;, and quoted linguist Noam Chomsky&#x27;s opinion that Lacan was an &quot;amusing and perfectly self-conscious charlatan&quot;. Noam Chomsky, in a 2012 interview on &quot;Veterans Unplugged&quot;, said: &quot;[Q]uite frankly I thought [Lacan] was a total charlatan. He was just posturing for the television cameras in the way many Paris intellectuals do. Why this is influential, I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea. I don&#x27;t see anything there that should be influential.&quot;

Academic and former Lacanian analyst Dylan Evans came to dismiss Lacanianism as lacking a sound scientific basis and as harming rather than helping patients. He criticized Lacan&#x27;s followers for treating Lacan&#x27;s writings as &quot;holy writ&quot;. Richard Webster decries what he sees as Lacan&#x27;s obscurity, arrogance, and the resultant &quot;Cult of Lacan&quot;.

Roger Scruton included Lacan in his book &quot;Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left&quot;, and named him as the only &#x27;fool&#x27; included in the book—his other targets merely being misguided or frauds.

In &quot;Les Freudiens hérétiques&quot;, the 8th tome of his work &quot;Contre-histoire de la philosophie&quot; (&quot;Anti-History of Philosophy&quot;), philosopher and author Michel Onfray describes Lacan&#x27;s &quot;Écrits&quot; as &quot;illegible&quot;. According to Onfray, Lacan engages in constant word play, has a taste for the formulaic, and deploys &quot;incantatory glossolalia&quot; and unnecessary neologisms. He calls Lacan a &quot;charlatan,&quot; and a &quot;dandy figure&quot; who &quot;sinks into autism,&quot; eventually becoming senile.

<doc id="16154" wikidata="Q1713750" url="?curid=16154" title="Jupiter Ace">
<text>The Jupiter Ace by Jupiter Cantab was a British home computer released in 1982. The Ace differed from other microcomputers of the time in that its programming environment used Forth instead of the more popular BASIC. This difference, along with limited available software and poor character based graphic display, limited sales and the machine was not a success.

== History ==
Jupiter Cantab was formed by Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers. Both had been on the design team for the ZX Spectrum: Altwasser worked on ZX81 development and hardware design of the Spectrum. Vickers adapted and expanded the 4K ZX80 ROM to the 8K ZX81 ROM and wrote most of the ROM for the Spectrum.

The Jupiter Ace was named after an early British computer, the Pilot ACE, and went on sale on 22 September 1982 with a price of £89.95.

Sales to the general public were slow. Initially the computer was only available by mail order, and Jupiter Cantab reported that there were production difficulties, but these had been overcome by January 1983 and that units were arriving in shops. 

The use of Forth rather than the more usual choice of BASIC, and the availability and success of the ZX Spectrum, as well as limited published software, the poor case and small initial memory all weighed against wider market acceptance. Eventually Jupiter Cantab ceased trading by the end of October 1983. 

The brand was then acquired by Boldfield Computing Ltd in 1984 that sold the remaining stock by mail order for £26. The brand was again sold to Paul Andrews&#x27;s company Andrews UK Limited in 2015.

=== Sales ===
Sales of the machine were never very large; the reported number of Aces sold before Jupiter Cantab closed for business was around 5,000. As of the early 2000s, surviving machines are uncommon, often fetching high prices as collector&#x27;s items.

Forth, while being structured and powerful, was considered difficult to learn, and a knowledge of BASIC acquired from familiarity with other home computers was of no practical help in learning it. A 1982 review stated that &quot;The success of the Jupiter Ace will depend on the machine-buying public&#x27;s acceptance of another microcomputer language.&quot;

Further, there was only a very limited range of published software either commercial programs or type-in programs printed in hobby magazines for the machine, and these were restricted by the base model&#x27;s small amount of RAM.

Attempts to promote the Ace in the educational market also failed; doubts over whether Forth would be relevant for exam syllabuses, and the lack of support for Forth from teaching staff were key issues. Pupils were more interested in learning the widely used BASIC than a language used by only one (uncommon) machine with a peculiar RPN syntax.

Finally, the tile-based graphics compared poorly to the pixel-based graphics of other machines which were also colour rather than the Ace&#x27;s monochrome. This restricted sales largely to a niche market of technical programming enthusiasts.

== Design ==
The Jupiter Ace is often compared with ZX81 due to its similar size, low cost, and similar form factor. Internally its design is more similar to the ZX Spectrum although the Ace also had a dedicated video memory of 2 KB, partly avoiding the slow down when programs accessed the same bank (same chips) as the video memory. Like the Spectrum, the Ace used black conductive rubber keys although unlike the Spectrum, the keys had a conductive pad that was squashed directly onto tracks on the PCB rather than using a membrane. As a result, the keys would often stop working reliably until they were cleaned or the conductive material was refreshed.

Audio capabilities were CPU-controlled with programmable frequency and duration. Sound output was through a small built-in speaker.

As was common at the time, it used a common tape recorder instead of disk/tape drives. Similarly, a television was needed as a display but this was in black and white only, rather than the colour supported by competing models such as the Spectrum. A secondary (undocumented) edge connector on the back of the case made some video signals available, presumably for a forthcoming colour video card, but no official product that used this connector was ever released.

The Jupiter Ace was based on the Zilog Z80, which the designers had previous experience of from working on the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.

Both graphics and text could be displayed at the same time: (1) redefinition of the character tiles provided standard 256×192 graphics limited to the 128 available (definable) 8×8 chars, concurrent with plotting of 64×48 graphics.

Internal speaker directly controlled by the CPU in single task mode, with control of sound frequency and duration in milliseconds.

Storage was through a cassette-tape interface at 1500 baud. Files could be used for either storage of Forth programs (compiled code) or raw dumps of memory.

=== Memory ===
The Ace had an 8 KB ROM containing the Forth kernel and operating system, and the predefined dictionary of Forth words in about 5 KB. The remaining 3 KB of ROM supported several functionalities: floating-point numbers library and character definitions table, tape recorder access, decompiling and redefining newly re-edited &#x27;words&#x27; (i.e. routines). Some of the ROM was written in Z80 machine code, but some was also coded in Forth.

The next 8 KB was built in RAM that was only partially decoded, with 2 KB of video RAM echoed twice, and 1 KB of user RAM echoed 4 times (with the same memory appearing at several different memory addresses).

Using the lower-address mirror of the video RAM would select CPU priority, resulting in some momentary random pixels on the screen when video subsystem and the CPU accessed the video RAM in the same clock cycle. Using the higher-address would briefly pause the CPU on the interference, affecting the program timing and making this mode unsuitable for I/O operations. Since video RAM was partially separated from the main address and data busses, for the most part the video subsystem and the CPU could operate in parallel.

The first 16 KB of the memory map was used for ROM, Video and User-available RAM, leaving the second 16 KB of the memory map free for RAM extension and the topmost 32 KB undefined.

One 1K bank allowed redefinition of most of its 128 ASCII-based characters in 8×8 pixel bitmap format. The other 1K bank stored the full screen display of 24 rows × 32 columns of characters in black and white. Colour was intended to be achieved as expansion, but although a colour-graphics board was designed, none was ever produced commercially.

1 KB RAM with the option of a 16 KB RAM-Pack, and later a 32 KB one. A PCB was also marketed by Boldfield Computing that converted the edge connector to electrical compatibility with a Sinclair ZX81, allowing use of the ZX81 16K RAM pack.

=== Specifications ===
References to the Ace RAM sometimes include the separate 2 KB video memory, which was not available for programming, thus leading to some confusion. Similarly, it is sometimes argued that because of Forth&#x27;s efficiency, the 1 KB standard RAM was in effect comparable to at least 2 KB on a BASIC system.

== Programming ==
Its most distinctive characteristic was the choice of Forth, a structured language. Threaded compilation allowed programs written to run nearly as fast as many native-compiled languages loaded by more expensive computers. Forth was considered well-adapted to microcomputers with their small memory and relatively low-performance processors. Forth programs are memory-efficient; as they become bigger, they reuse more previously-defined code. Control structures could be nested to any level, limited only by available memory. This allowed complex programs to be implemented, even allowing recursive programming. The Ace&#x27;s Forth was stated to be &quot;ten times faster than Basic&quot; and used less than half the memory (a significant cost percentage of low end computers of the time) of an equivalent program written in interpreted BASIC. It also allowed easy implementation of machine code routines if needed.

Ace&#x27;s Forth was based mostly on Forth-79, with some relevant differences, in particular it added syntax checking to control structures and definer constructions and a few extra words were added based on common BASIC sound, video and tape commands. The implementation lacked some less frequently used Forth words, these being easily implemented if needed. Runtime error checking could be turned off to raise speed by 25% to 50%.

=== Decompiling ===
Its Forth was adapted to the disk-less tape-using home computer hardware by being able to save/load user &quot;compiled vocabularies&quot;, instead of the usual numbered programming blocks used by diskette systems.

Decompiling avoided wasting RAM in simulating an absent Block System, used with both disk and tape drivers (these last not to be confused with tape recorders). As replacement, it included an extra data file, for raw binary data. These solutions were unique to the Jupiter Ace.

=== DEFINER vs COMPILER ===
To allow decompile, it distinguished usual Forth definer and compiler words creation, replacing the codice_1, creation pair with:
# codice_2 : Create new Defining words, usually used to define and build data structures. Similar to codice_3 usage in standard FORTH. (Example: Adding Data Structures as Arrays, Records, ...).
# codice_4 : Create new Compiling words, less frequently used to extend the language with compiler words where codice_5 is FORTH implementation dependent. (Example: New Compiler Control Structures as Case, Infinite Loop, ...).

These two defining pairs, instead of one alone, allowed the Ace to decompile its programs, unlike usual Forth systems. This decompiling ability was a solution to the absence of the more flexible disk system used by Forth. Not storing the source of a Forth program, but compiling the code after editing, it avoided completely the emulation of a disk/tape drive on RAM saving computer memory. It also saved time in reading and writing programs from cassette tape. This tape-friendly and RAM-saving solution was unique to the Jupiter Ace Forth.

The names can be equivocal out of a Forth context, as all Words are compiled when declared.
codice_6 defines a new Class (as an array) that will build (compile) an array Object. These are active on &#x27;Interpreter&#x27;. Pairing this Interaction mode, codice_7 defines a programming structure (usually a pair or a triplet) as codice_8. These &#x27;Structured Programming&#x27; are active on &#x27;Compile&#x27; mode (which is simply building a new Forth Word). In short, &quot;Interpreting mode&quot; means Run stage, while &quot;Compiling mode&quot; refers to an Editing stage.

=== Development ===
Avoiding sources was compensated by storing comments entered in the code with the compiled output, traditional compilation would discard such comments. The comments were then recovered on decompiling. As a result of &quot;code is the source&quot;, modified words (edited) would demand actualization of all code using the one newly edited. This was done with the non standard codice_9 command.

Although not explicitly designed for such a purpose, the compiled Forth could be utilised for ROM extensions to the built in system. External ROMs were developed with Ace Forth to be used as control applications.

== Add-ons ==
The machine was able to use some ZX81 add-ons due to similar RAM locations, and external expansion slot. Jupiter Cantab made a 16 KB RAM pack, and external companies made similar RAM packs as well as other peripherals and interfaces.

<text>The Jacksonville Jaguars are a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida. The Jaguars compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at EverBank Stadium.

Founded alongside the Carolina Panthers in 1995 as an expansion team, the Jaguars competed in the AFC Central until they were moved to the AFC South in 2002. The franchise is owned by Shahid Khan, who bought the team from its original majority owner Wayne Weaver in 2012.

The Jaguars saw early success during their second through fifth seasons, which saw them make the playoff each year, win two division titles, and appear in two AFC Championship Games. They are the youngest NFL expansion team to appear in a conference championship (by their second season in 1996, along with the Panthers) and clinch their conference&#x27;s top seed (by their fifth season in 1999). The Jaguars have been less successful since, with only four playoff appearances and two division titles since 2000. They are one of four NFL franchises that have never played in the Super Bowl alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and Houston Texans.

==History==
===Creation===
In 1989, the prospective ownership group Touchdown Jacksonville! was organized with the intention of bringing an NFL franchise to Jacksonville. In 1991, the NFL announced plans to add two expansion teams. In 1994, Touchdown Jacksonville! announced a bid for a team, and Jacksonville was ultimately chosen as one of five finalists, along with Charlotte, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Memphis. Charlotte was awarded the first franchise, which would become the Carolina Panthers, in October 1993. The decision for selecting the second expansion city was delayed a month. At the time, St. Louis was considered the favorite for the second franchise. However, the NFL owners voted 26–2 in favor of awarding the 30th franchise to Jacksonville. For their opening season in 1995, the Jaguars took part in the 1995 NFL expansion draft to help bolster their roster. The Jaguars, along with the Panthers, alternated picks from lists of unprotected players from existing franchises.

===Tom Coughlin (1995–2002)===
Tom Coughlin was hired to be the first head coach of the franchise on February 21, 1994. The Jaguars took part in their first NFL draft in 1995. Their first pick in franchise history was the second overall pick in the first round, which was used on eventual Hall of Fame offensive tackle Tony Boselli out of USC.

On September 3, 1995, the Jaguars played in their first regular season game, a 10–3 loss to the Houston Oilers. In Week 2, against the Cincinnati Bengals, Randy Jordan caught the first touchdown in franchise history, a 71-yard reception from quarterback Steve Beuerlein. The Jaguars would lose their first four games before breaking through against the Oilers in Week 5 in a 17–16 victory. Over the course of the season, they would suffer through a seven-game losing streak before closing the season out with a 24–21 win over the Cleveland Browns. The Jaguars went 4–12 in their first season. The team saw Mark Brunell and Steve Beuerlein both start games at quarterback.

Prior to their second season, the Jaguars drafted Kevin Hardy with the second overall pick in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft. The team also got Tony Brackens and Aaron Beasley in the draft. With Brunell leading at quarterback, the team improved in 1996. With the team sitting at 4–7, the Jaguars reeled off five straight wins to finish with a 9–7 mark, finish second in the AFC Central, and made the postseason for the first time. The team had two wide receivers go over 1,000 yards in Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith. The Jaguars won their first postseason game in franchise history with a 30–27 victory over the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round. Following a 30–27 win over the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, the Jaguars saw their run end in the AFC Championship with a 20–6 loss to the New England Patriots.

The 1997 season saw the team go 11–5 and finish second in the AFC Central. McCardell and Smith once again both recorded over 1,000 receiving yards. The Jaguars qualified for the postseason, which was short-lived with a 42–17 loss to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round. The 1998 season saw the team win their first divisional title by going 11–5. The team had their first ever player rush for over 1,000 yards, Fred Taylor. The team defeated the New England Patriots 25–10 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the New York Jets, 34–24 in the Divisional Round. The Jaguars reached new heights in the 1999 season with a franchise-best division-winning 14–2 season. The team defeated the Miami Dolphins, 62–7 in the Divisional Round, which would be Dan Marino&#x27;s final game. The Jaguars saw their season end in the AFC Championship with a 33–14 loss to the Tennessee Titans, who were responsible for all three of their losses that year. Despite Taylor, McCardell, and Smith all putting together successful statistical seasons in 2000, the Jaguars took a step back and missed the postseason. The team slipped further in 2001 with a 6–10 record. In the 2002, the team went 6–10 once again and Coughlin was fired following the season.

===Jack Del Rio (2003–2011)===
The Jaguars hired Jack Del Rio to be the team&#x27;s second head coach following the 2002 season. The Jaguars drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft. Leftwich would eventually replace Brunell as starting quarterback. The Jaguars went 5–11 in the 2003 season. One bright spot on the season was Taylor rushing for over 1,500 yards. The team improved to a 9–7 mark in 2004 but missed the postseason. In the 2005 season, Del Rio led the team back into the postseason with a 12–4 finish and 2nd-place finish in the AFC South. The return to the postseason was short-lived with a 28–3 loss to the New England Patriots in the Wild Card Round. The 2006 season saw the arrival of quarterback David Garrard. The Jaguars went 8–8 and missed the postseason. The 2007 season was an improvement to a 11–5 record and return to the postseason. The team defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–29 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the New England Patriots 31–20 in the Divisional Round. The following year saw the team take a major step back with a 5–11 mark and last place finish in the division. In 2009, the team improved with a 7–9 mark but once again finished last in the division. In 2010, the team finished second in the division with an 8–8 mark but missed the postseason. The team used their first round draft pick (#10 overall) on Missouri quarterback Blaine Gabbert prior to the 2011 season. Following a 3–8 start, Del Rio was fired and Mel Tucker finished the year with a 2–3 mark as interim.

===Mike Mularkey (2012)===
Mike Mularkey was hired to be the Jaguars&#x27; third head coach prior to the 2012 season. The team went 2–14, which marked the worst season in franchise history at the time. Mularkey was fired following the season.

===Gus Bradley (2013–2016)===
Prior to the 2013 season, Gus Bradley was hired to be the team&#x27;s fourth head coach. Chad Henne was the starting quarterback for the majority of the 2013 season, which saw the team go 4–12. Prior to the 2014 season, the Jaguars drafted Central Florida quarterback Blake Bortles with the third overall pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft. The change at quarterback did not see instant improvement as the team finished 3–13. The 2015 season saw the team finish 5–11. One bright spot was quarterback Blake Bortles passing for the most yards and touchdowns in franchise history with 4,428 and 35. Following a 2–12 start to the 2016 season, Gus Bradley was fired. Interim coach Doug Marrone split the final two games of the season.

===Doug Marrone (2017–2020)===
Marrone was named the full-time head coach prior to the 2017 season. The 2017 season saw the Jaguars win the AFC South with a 10–6 mark being led by a strong defensive unit. The season marked the first division title for the team since 1999. The team made the playoffs for the first time since the 2007 season. In the Wild Card Round, the Jaguars defeated the Bills 10–3. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 45–42. In their first AFC Championship since the 1999 season, they lost to the New England Patriots 24–20. The game featured a controversial defensive play where Myles Jack recovered a Patriots fumble and had a path for a touchdown but the play was blown dead.

The Jaguars were not able to capitalize on the success of the 2017 season in the following year. The 2018 team went 5–11 and featured Bortles getting benched later in the season. The Jaguars signed Super Bowl LII MVP quarterback Nick Foles prior to the 2019 season. However, Foles was lost for most of the season from a broken collarbone suffered in Week 1 against the Chiefs. The team turned to 2019 sixth-round draft pick Gardner Minshew, who filled in for most of the 6–10 season. The 2020 season was the worst season in the history of the franchise with a 1–15 mark. Minshew suffered multiple injuries to his throwing hand during the season, which forced Mike Glennon and Jake Luton to start at quarterback. Following the end of the 2020 season, Marrone was fired.

===Urban Meyer (2021)===
In what would become one of the most ill-fated coaching hires in NFL history, the Jaguars hired Urban Meyer to be the next coach of the team prior to the 2021 season. The team drafted Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence with the top overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Meyer was fired after a 2–11 start. He was only the fourth head coach since the AFL-NFL merger to not finish a full season. Darrell Bevell finished the year as interim with a 1–3 mark.

===Doug Pederson (2022–2024)===
Prior to the 2022 season, the Jaguars hired Super Bowl LII-winning coach Doug Pederson to be their next head coach. The team saw immediate improvement with a 9–8 record and a division title. The Jaguars defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 31–30 in the Wild Card Round. The game featured the third-largest comeback in NFL postseason history with the Jaguars trailing 27–0 at one point. The Jaguars&#x27; season ended with a 27–20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round.

In the 2023 season, the Jaguars finished with a 9–8 mark once again but failed to qualify for the playoffs.

On January 6, 2025, Pederson was fired after three seasons with the team, during which the team was 22–29 (.431), with one playoff appearance.

===Liam Coen (2025–present)===
On January 24, 2025, the Jaguars hired former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Liam Coen to be their new head coach.

==Logos and uniforms==
===Logos===

The day after the NFL awarded the expansion team to Jacksonville, Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver held up the Jaguars&#x27; proposed silver helmet and teal jersey at the NFL owners&#x27; meeting in Chicago. The team&#x27;s colors were to be teal, gold, and silver with black accents. However, this jersey and helmet design, with a gold leaping jaguar, created controversy. Ford Motor Company, then-parent of the automaker Jaguar, believed that the Jaguars&#x27; logo bore too much resemblance to the automaker&#x27;s logo. Though no lawsuit was brought to trial, lawyers from the team and the automaker negotiated an ultimately amicable agreement whereby Jaguar would be named the official car of the Jaguars, and the Jaguars would redesign their uniforms.

The new logo was a snarling jaguar head with a teal tongue, which Weaver said was his wife&#x27;s touch. He also claimed that the teal tongue came from &quot;feeding Panthers to our Jaguars&quot; — an obvious jab at their expansion brethren. During the Jaguars&#x27; first-ever preseason game teal-colored candies were handed out to all the fans who attended, turning their tongues a teal color just like on the logo. Additionally, raspberry lollipops were handed out by the &quot;Candy Man&quot; in section 142 to also turn the home fans&#x27; tongues teal.

In 2009, Weaver announced that he wanted to &quot;clean up&quot; the team&#x27;s image. This meant the elimination of the full-body crawling Jaguar logo, the clawing Jaguar, and the two previous wordmarks which bent the text around these logos.

In February 2013, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, who had acquired the team in late 2011, introduced a new brand identity for the team that included a new logo, wordmark, and secondary logo. The new Jaguar head logo was intended to be &quot;fiercer&quot; and more realistic. The secondary logo incorporated the new Jaguar head logo along with the first official usage of the team&#x27;s popular nickname &quot;Jags&quot;. The two images were encased in a shield-style shape, designed to be a tribute to Jacksonville&#x27;s military community.

Beginning in 2013, the Jaguars began to feature gold more prominently than in the past. From 2009 to 2012, gold had only been used in the team logo and as a minor accent color.

===Uniforms===

For most of their history, the Jaguars have done what many other NFL teams located in subtropical climates traditionally practice: wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season — forcing opponents to wear their dark ones under the sweltering autumns in Jacksonville. The only exceptions were in 2004 and 2008–2010, when the Jaguars chose to wear teal for all home games. In the preseason, the Jaguars typically wear teal at home, since these games are played at night when there is very little advantage with the heat.

====1995–2001====

Following the logo change, the redesigned uniforms featured an all-black helmet, white pants with teal, black, and gold stripes, and numbers with gold inner trim and black outer trim. The home jersey was teal with white numbers and the away jersey was white with teal numbers. Both jerseys had a black collar and no sleeve stripes.

A prowling jaguar on each sleeve replaced the leaping jaguar going across both shoulders in the original design. The Jaguars in 1995 were the first NFL team to have two-tone borders on their numbers and lettering, and the first NFL team to show a complex logo (the crawling jaguar) on the sleeve.

Minor modifications were introduced to the Jaguars uniform during this time, most notably the font of the jersey numbers, replacing the original block numbers with a unique font. Two stripes were also added to the end of the sleeves below the prowling jaguar.

====2002–2008====
The team introduced a black alternate jersey in 2002. During that same year, the team also introduced alternate black pants, worn with either the white or the teal jersey. After the black pants were introduced, the white pants would only be seen for the first few games of the year, presumably due to the heat. The black pants originally included two teal stripes down each side. The fan reaction to the extra black in the alternate jersey and alternate pants was positive, so in 2004 the Jaguars went through a formal uniform change, which teams are only allowed to do once every five years. These changes were mostly to the away look. Before 2004, the white away jerseys had teal numbers with black and gold trim, but after, the white jerseys had black numbers with teal and gold trim. The black pants were also changed. The teal stripes were replaced with the jaguar logo on each hip. Teal almost disappeared from the away uniform.

The stripes on the white pants were altered in 2008 so that the center, thickest stripe was black, and its accents were teal. In the 2008 year, the gold in the uniforms noticeably shifted from a bright yellow metallic appearance to more beige.

====2009–2012====

The Jaguars unveiled new uniforms for the 2009 season. Team owner Wayne Weaver reportedly wanted to &quot;clean up&quot; the look, feeling that the team had too many uniform styles. The new uniforms were introduced in a press conference on April 22.

At this press conference, Weaver elaborated that different people had taken different liberties with the Jaguars&#x27; image over the years, singling out the &quot;all black&quot; look which the team wore for every prime-time home game from 2003 to 2007 as a point of regret. He also said that the team would wear their teal jerseys at home even on hot days, saying that the practice of choosing to wear white on hot days had also diluted the team&#x27;s image. The new uniform reflected a simpler look overall. The collar and sleeve ends are the same color as the rest of the jersey. The crawling jaguar was removed. The numbers on the jerseys were changed to a simpler, block font with a thicker, single color border. After all of these subtractions, two features were added. The first was a &quot;Jaguars&quot; wordmark underneath the NFL insignia on the chest. The second was two thin &quot;stripes&quot; of off-color fabric which were added to each midseam of the jersey, curling up to the neckline on the front and below the number on the back. The stripe on the home jersey is a white line next to a black line, matching the color of the numbers, and the stripe on the away jersey is a black line next to a teal line, again matching the numbers. The pants have similar stripes, both for the home and away uniform. The away uniforms were still black pants and numbers on a white jersey, but they now used teal as the only accent color as opposed to using gold in previous years. The Jaguars&#x27; identity, in terms of colors, beginning in 2009 is exclusively teal and black, with gold only being used in the logo. The final change made to the Jaguars&#x27; uniforms in 2009 was to the helmet. The new helmet and facemask were black just like the old ones, but when light hit the new ones a certain way, both the helmet and face mask sparkled with a shiny teal appearance. These were the first helmets in professional football which changed color with different angles of light. The logo and number decals also incorporated this effect.

Prior to the 2012 season, new Jaguars owner Shahid Khan announced that the team would once again use a black jersey, something they had not done since 2008. In September of that year, the team announced that it would use the black jersey and black pants as their primary home uniform. The teal jersey was resurrected as an alternate.

====2013–2017====

On April 23, 2013, the Jaguars unveiled new uniforms designed by Nike. The primary home jersey is black with white numerals outlined in teal and gold. The road jersey is white with teal numerals outlined in black and gold, marking the first time since 2003 that the team has used teal numbers on their road jersey. The alternate jersey is teal with black numerals outlined in white and gold. The team had never before used black numbers on their teal jersey. All three jerseys feature a contrasting stripe that bends around the neck, and semi-glossy patches on the shoulders meant to resemble claw marks. The team added their new shield logo onto a patch just above the player&#x27;s heart, meant to pay tribute to Jacksonville&#x27;s military heritage.

The helmet, first of its kind in the NFL, featured a glossy gold finish in the back that fades to matte black in the front, via a color gradient.

The new uniform set includes black and white pants with the Jaguars logo on the hip and a tri-color pattern down the player&#x27;s leg.

In November 2015, as one of eight teams participating in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Color Rush&quot; initiative for four games of &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; during the 2015 season, Jacksonville introduced an all-gold second alternative uniform. The set features a gold jersey with black sleeves and black trim, as well as all gold pants. The white front and back numbers are lined in the teal accent color and bordered by black. The TV numbers on the shoulders are white with black bordering. The set also features gold undershirts and socks.

====2018–present====
On April 19, 2018, the Jaguars again revealed re-designed uniforms. The new design returns to an all-black gloss helmet and removes many of the complicated details from the previous set. For the first time, there are no borders at all on any of the jersey numbers. There are no stripes or team logo on the pants; only an NFL logo and a Nike logo, which is the first and only of its kind in the NFL. Like the 2009 uniform set, the only gold in the uniform set belongs to the jaguar logo itself, and the block number font is not distinct from that used by other teams. The sleeve trim and collar trim are both a different color than the rest of the jersey, that and the solitary jaguar logo are the only distinct markings on the jersey. For the first time, the sock has a teal stripe between the black and white. The black jersey is the primary, as it has been since 2012, and the teal is the alternate. The Jaguars continued to pair the uniforms with either black or white pants, but added alternate teal pants for the first time.

In 2019, the Jaguars began wearing either solid black or white socks as part of a new NFL mandate allowing solid-colored hosiery on the field.

In Week 3 of the 2020 season against the Miami Dolphins, the Jaguars wore an all-teal ensemble for the first time, complete with solid teal socks.

On February 17, 2021, the Jaguars announced that the club would return to wearing teal jerseys as its designated primary home jersey color.

On July 18, 2024, the Jaguars unveiled throwback teal &quot;Prowler&quot; uniforms based on the style worn from 1995 to 2008. The number style used was similar to the one updated in the 1997 season. On July 25, the Jaguars unveiled a new white alternate helmet that would be worn with the alternate black jersey with white pants.

==Stadium==

EverBank Stadium (formerly known as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, Alltel Stadium, EverBank Field, and TIAA Bank Field) is located on the north bank of the St. Johns River, and has been the home of the Jaguars since the team&#x27;s first season in 1995. The stadium has a capacity of 67,814, with additional seating added during Florida–Georgia Game and the Gator Bowl.

The stadium served as the site of Super Bowl XXXIX in addition to five Jaguar playoff games including the 1999 AFC Championship Game. It also hosted the ACC Championship Game from 2005 to 2007 and the River City Showdown in 2007 and 2008.

From 1995 to 1997 and again from 2006 to 2009, the stadium was named Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. From 1997 to 2006, the stadium was referred to as Alltel Stadium. The naming rights were purchased by EverBank prior to the 2010 season. Prior to the 2018 season the Jaguars announced the stadium would be renamed TIAA Bank Field.

The stadium received a substantial upgrade in 2014 with the addition of new scoreboards, pools, cabana seating and premium seating that includes 180 field-level seats. The scoreboards are high and long. The new scoreboards are the world&#x27;s largest video boards. Two by pools were installed in the north end zone along with the cabana seating. The cost of the stadium upgrades were $63 million, of which owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million.

==Rivalries==
The Jaguars&#x27; main rivalries are with the other three teams in the AFC South: the Indianapolis Colts, Houston Texans, and Tennessee Titans. The Jaguars also have geographic rivalries with the two other Florida-based teams: the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Jaguars, Dolphins, and Buccaneers frequently play each other during the preseason. During the AFC Central days of the mid-1990s and early 2000s, the Jaguars had a rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers as the two teams were consistently in playoff contention. The rivalry would reach new heights in the 2000s and 2010s when the Jaguars and Steelers joined the AFC South and North respectively. Jacksonville also defeated Pittsburgh in the playoffs in and .

===Divisional===

==== Indianapolis Colts ====
The rivalry between the Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts is arguably one of the most heated in the AFC South. Both have been divisional rivals since the creation of the AFC South in the 2002 season. Despite often struggling to maintain competitive teams, the Jaguars have managed to achieve significant upsets against the Colts, securing more victories over them then over either the Texans or Titans. Since 2015 the Jaguars have maintained a home winning streak against the Colts, including a stretch between 2019 and 2022 where the team compiled a record of 6–30, with four of those victories occurring against the Colts.

==== Houston Texans ====

The Jaguars share a divisional rivalry with the Houston Texans. Both franchises are two of the youngest in the league, the two teams clashed particularly during Jacksonville&#x27;s notorious &quot;Sacksonville&quot; era defenses while the Texans often fought hard for control of the division. The Texans currently lead the all-time series versus the Jaguars, 31–14.

==== Tennessee Titans ====

The Jaguars&#x27; rivalry with the Tennessee Titans dates back to the Jaguars inaugural season in the NFL prior to the season. when the Titans were then-known as the Houston Oilers. During the 1995 season, the Jaguars recorded their first win as a franchise over the Oilers in Houston. The rivalry intensified in the late 1990s as both teams were consistently near the top of the AFC Central standings. In , the Jaguars posted a 14–2 record with both losses coming to Tennessee. The two teams met in the AFC Championship Game, with Tennessee beating Jacksonville for a third time that season, 33–14. The rivalry continued into the 2000s as both teams were placed in the newly formed AFC South in . The Titans lead the overall series, 34–23, having also won the only playoff game in the series.

===Conference===
==== Miami Dolphins ====
The Jaguars have taken part in a minor rivalry with the Miami Dolphins as both teams are the only two AFC franchises located in Florida. The two teams first met during the 1998 NFL season on a Monday Night Football matchup. Both teams later met in the 1999 AFC Divisional Round in what would ultimately be the final career game for Dolphins&#x27; hall-of-fame quarterback Dan Marino. The Dolphins entered the game as heavy underdogs as they had finished the 1999 season 9–7, securing the lowest wild card berth. Meanwhile; the Jaguars had boasted an impressive 14–2 campaign under pro-bowl quarterback Mark Brunell; culminating in the Jaguars defeating Miami in a 62–7 blowout loss. The Jaguars managed an improbable upset victory during the 2021 season as the team had declined severely under controversial head coach Urban Meyer. Despite this; the Jaguars managed a comeback victory against the Dolphins in London during Week 6. The teams are tied 5–5 all time, though the Jaguars lead 1–0 in the postseason.

====Buffalo Bills====
A new rivalry emerged between the Jaguars and the Buffalo Bills after former Bills head coach Doug Marrone, who had quit the team after the 2014 season, was hired as a coaching assistant for Jacksonville and eventually rose to become the Jaguars&#x27; head coach. The first game between the Marrone led Jaguars was a London game in week 7 of the 2015 season which saw the Jaguars&#x27; win 34–31. The most important game of this series was an ugly, low-scoring Wild Card game in 2017 that saw the Jaguars win 10–3. This game is notable as it was the first Bills playoff appearance in 17 seasons. Prior to this, Jacksonville had handed Buffalo its first playoff loss in Bills Stadium in 1996. Following the 2017 wild card game the Bills and Jaguars have met two additional times. The first was a &quot;rematch&quot; game in week 12 of the 2018 season which saw the Bills win 24–21. During this game trash talk from former Jaguars players such as Jalen Ramsey resulted in a brawl between the teams. The second time was in week 9 of the 2021 season. By now the &quot;point&quot; of the rivalry, Marrone&#x27;s feud with the Bills organization, and the personal drama between Bills and Jaguars players no longer applied as Marrone had been fired and replaced by Urban Meyer and all the players from the 2017 Jaguars team have since moved on to other teams or retired. Regardless, this game was the seventh largest upset at the time in NFL history which saw the 15.5-point favorite Bills lose 9–6. The Jaguars currently lead the series 10–9.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame===
===Pride of the Jaguars===

A contest was held in July 2006 to name the club&#x27;s ring of honor, &quot;Pride of the Jaguars&quot; was chosen with 36% of the vote. It was unveiled during the 2006 season during a game against the New York Jets on October 8. Former offensive tackle Tony Boselli was the first player inducted.

On January 1, 2012, team owner Wayne Weaver and his wife Delores were added to the Pride of the Jaguars in their final game before the sale of the team to Shahid Khan. On June 7, 2012, the Jaguars announced Fred Taylor would be the next inductee into the Pride of the Jaguars. He was inducted on September 30, 2012. Longtime Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell was also inducted into the &quot;Pride of the Jaguars&quot; on December 15, 2013. Former wide receiver Jimmy Smith was inducted in 2016. On November 9, 2023, it was announced that former head coach Tom Coughlin would be inducted sometime during the 2024 season. During halftime of the Week 5 game against the Indianapolis Colts, Coughlin was officially inducted into the Pride.

===Retired numbers===
On October 9, 2022, the Jacksonville Jaguars retired Tony Boselli&#x27;s number 71, at a halftime ceremony against the division-rival Houston Texans. It is the first number retired by the organization.

Also, despite not being formally retired, the Jaguars have not reissued the numbers 8, 28, or 82, worn by Mark Brunell, Fred Taylor, and Jimmy Smith respectively, since they retired or left the team. Additionally, Brunell and Smith are the only players in franchise history to have worn their respective numbers.

===All-time first-round draft picks===
==Head coaches and coordinators==

===Head coaches===
The Jaguars have had ten head coaches (including two interim coaches) throughout their franchise history. Their first head coach was Tom Coughlin, who compiled a 72–64 (.529) overall record with the team from 1995 to 2002.

==Culture==
===Mascot===

Since his introduction in 1996, Jaxson de Ville has served as the Jaguars&#x27; mascot. Jaxson entertains the crowd before and during games with his antics. The mascot has established a reputation for making dramatic entrances including bungee jumping off the stadium lights, sliding down a rope from the scoreboard, and parachuting into the stadium.

Jaxson&#x27;s antics got him into trouble in 1998 and stemmed the changing of the NFL&#x27;s mascot rules, and also caused him to calm down. However, Jaxson was still seen, by some, as a mascot that gets in the way during the game. After the October 22, 2007, game against Indianapolis, Colts President Bill Polian complained to the NFL, and Jaxson was reprimanded again.

Jaxson&#x27;s first appearance was on August 18, 1996, and was played by Curtis Dvorak from his inception until his retirement in June 2015.

===Jacksonville Roar===
The Jacksonville Roar is the professional cheerleading squad of the Jaguars. The group was established in 1995, the team&#x27;s inaugural year, and regularly performs choreographed routines during the team&#x27;s home contests.

In addition to performing at games and pep rallies, members function as goodwill ambassadors of the team, participating in corporate, community, and charitable events in the Jacksonville metropolitan area where they sign autographs and pose for pictures. They also join NFL tours to entertain American servicemen and women around the world.

===Community work===

The Jacksonville Jaguars Foundation was established in 1994, when the franchise deal was first announced. Since then, the Foundation has given over $20 million to area efforts in community improvement. The Foundation focuses on many initiatives, such as Honor Rows, anti-tobacco programs, NFL Play 60, and support for veterans. The Foundation grants over $1 million annually to organizations that assist &quot;economically and socially disadvantaged youth and families&quot;.

The Jaguars&#x27; first head coach, Tom Coughlin, established the Tom Coughlin Jay Fund Foundation in 1996 to help young cancer victims and their families with emotional and financial assistance. The charity remained in Jacksonville after Coughlin left to coach the New York Giants.

<text>The Jutes ( ) were one of the Germanic tribes who settled in Great Britain after the departure of the Romans. According to Bede, they were one of the three most powerful Germanic nations, along with the Angles and the Saxons:

There is no consensus amongst historians on the origins of the Jutes. One hypothesis is that they originated from the Jutland Peninsula but after a Danish invasion of that area, migrated to the Frisian coast. From the Frisian coast they went on to settle southern Britain in the later fifth century during the Migration Period, as part of a larger wave of Germanic migration into Britain.
They were possibly or probably related to the North Germanic tribe Geats.

==Settlement in southern Britain==
During the period after the Roman occupation and before the Norman conquest, people of Germanic descent arrived in Britain, ultimately forming England. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; provides what historians regard as foundation legends for Anglo-Saxon settlement.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; describes how the brothers Hengist and Horsa in the year 449 were invited to Sub-Roman Britain by Vortigern to assist his forces in fighting the Picts. They landed at Wippidsfleet (Ebbsfleet), and went on to defeat the Picts wherever they fought them. Hengist and Horsa sent word home to Germany asking for assistance. Their request was granted and support arrived. Afterward, more people arrived in Britain from &quot;the three powers of Germany; the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes&quot;. The Saxons populated Essex, Sussex and Wessex; the Jutes Kent, the Isle of Wight and Hampshire; and the Angles East Anglia, Mercia and Northumbria (leaving their original homeland, Angeln, deserted).

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; also lists &quot;Wihtgar&quot; and &quot;Stuf&quot; as founders of the &quot;Wihtwara&quot; (Isle of Wight) and a man named &quot;Port&quot; and his two sons &quot;Bieda&quot; and &quot;Maeglaof&quot; as founders of the &quot;Meonwara&quot; (southern Hampshire). In 686 Bede tells us that Jutish Hampshire extended to the western edge of the New Forest; however, that seems to include another Jutish people, the Ytene, and it is not certain that these two territories formed a continuous coastal block.
Towards the end of the Roman occupation of England, raids on the east coast became more intense and the expedient adopted by Romano-British leaders was to enlist the help of mercenaries to whom they ceded territory. It is thought that mercenaries may have started arriving in Sussex as early as the 5th century.

Before the 7th century, there is a dearth of contemporary written material about the Anglo-Saxons&#x27; arrival. Most material that does exist was written several hundred years after the events. The earlier dates for the beginnings of settlement, provided by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, have been contested by some findings in archaeology. One alternative hypothesis to the foundation legend suggests, because previously inhabited sites on the Frisian and north German coasts had been rendered uninhabitable by flooding, that the migration was due to displacement. Under this alternative hypothesis, the British provided land for the refugees to settle on in return for peaceful coexistence and military cooperation.

Ship construction in the 2nd or 3rd century adopted the use of iron fastenings, instead of the old sewn fastenings, to hold together the plank built boats of the Jutland peninsula. This enabled them to build stronger sea going vessels. Vessels going from Jutland to Britain probably would have sailed along the coastal regions of Lower Saxony and the Netherlands before crossing the English Channel. This was because navigation techniques of the time required the ship to be moored up overnight. Marine archaeology has suggested that migrating ships would have sheltered in various river estuaries on the route. Artefacts and parts of ships, of the period, have been found that support this theory.

It is likely that the Jutes initially inhabited Kent and from there they occupied the Isle of Wight, southern Hampshire and also possibly the area around Hastings in East Sussex (Haestingas). J E A Jolliffe compared agricultural and farming practices across 5th century Sussex to that of 5th century Kent. He suggested that the Kentish system underlaid the 5th century farming practices of Sussex. He hypothesised that Sussex was probably settled by Jutes before the arrival of the Saxons, with Jutish territory stretching from Kent to the New Forest. The north Solent coast had been a trading area since Roman times. The old Roman roads between Sidlesham and Chichester and Chichester to Winchester would have provided access to the Jutish settlements in Hampshire. Therefore, it is possible that the German folk arriving in the 5th century that landed in the Selsey area would have been directed north to Southampton Water. From there into the mouth of the Meon valley and would have been allowed to settle near the existing Romano-British people. The Jutish kingdom in Hampshire that Bede describes has various placenames that identify the locations as Jutish. These include Bishopstoke (&quot;Ytingstoc&quot;) and the Meon Valley (&quot;Ytedene&quot;).

===Mercian and South Saxon takeover===
In Kent, Hlothhere had been ruler since 673/4. He must have come into conflict with Mercia, because in 676 the Mercian king Æthelred invaded Kent and according to Bede:
In 681 Wulfhere of Mercia advanced into southern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Shortly after he gave the Isle of Wight and Meonwara to Æthelwealh of Sussex.

In Kent, Eadric was for a time co-ruler alongside his uncle Hlothhere with a law code being issued in their names. Ultimately, Eadric revolted against his uncle and with help from a South Saxon army in about 685, was able to kill Hlothhere, and replace him as ruler of Kent.

===West Saxon invasion===
In the 680s, the Kingdom of Wessex was in the ascendant, the alliance between the South Saxons and the Mercians and their control of southern England, put the West Saxons under pressure. Their king Cædwalla, probably concerned about Mercian and South Saxon influence in Southern England, conquered the land of the South Saxons and took over the Jutish areas in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Bede describes how Cædwalla brutally suppressed the South Saxons and attempted to slaughter the Jutes of the Isle of Wight and replace them with people from &quot;his own province&quot;, but maintained that he was unable to do so, and Jutes remained a majority on the island. 
Cædwalla killed Aruald, the king of the Isle of Wight. Aruald&#x27;s two younger brothers, who were heirs to the throne, escaped from the island but were hunted down and found at Stoneham, Hampshire. They were killed on Cædwalla&#x27;s orders. The Isle of Wight was then permanently under West Saxon control and the &quot;Meonwara&quot; was integrated into Wessex. Cædwalla also invaded Kent and installed his brother Mul as leader. However, it was not long before Mul and twelve others were burnt to death by the Kentishmen. After Cædwalla was superseded by Ine of Wessex, Kent agreed to pay compensation to Wessex for the death of Mul, but they retained their independence.

==Influences and culture==
When the Jutish kingdom of Kent was founded, around the middle of the 5th century, Roman ways and influences must have still had a strong presence. The Roman settlement of &quot;Durovernum Cantiacorum&quot; became Canterbury. The people of Kent were described as &quot;Cantawara&quot;, a Germanised form of the Latin &quot;Cantiaci&quot;.

Although not all historians accept Bede&#x27;s scheme for the settlement of Britain into Anglian, Jutish and Saxon areas as perfectly accurate, the archaeological evidence indicates that the peoples of west Kent were culturally distinct from those in the east of Kent, with west Kent sharing the &#x27;Saxon&#x27; characteristics of its neighbours in the southeast of England. Brooches and bracteates found in east Kent, the Isle of Wight and southern Hampshire showed a strong Frankish and North Sea influence from the mid-fifth century to the late sixth century compared to north German styles found elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon England. There is discussion about who crafted the jewellery (found in the archaeological sites of Kent). Suggestions include crafts people who had been trained in the Roman workshops of northern Gaul or the Rhineland. It is also possible that those artisans went on to develop their own individual style. By the late 6th century grave goods indicate that west Kent had adopted the distinctive east Kent material culture.

The Frankish princess Bertha arrived in Kent around 580 to marry the king Æthelberht of Kent. Bertha was already a Christian and had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel. Æthelberht rebuilt an old Romano-British structure and dedicated it to St Martin allowing Bertha to continue practising her Christian faith. In 597 Pope Gregory I sent Augustine to Kent, on a mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons, There are suggestions that Æthelberht had already been baptised when he &quot;courteously received&quot; the pope&#x27;s mission. Æthelberht was the first of the Anglo-Saxon rulers to be baptised.

The simplified Christian burial was introduced at this time. Christian graves were usually aligned East to West, whereas with some exceptions pagan burial sites were not. The lack of archaeological grave evidence in the land of the &quot;Haestingas&quot; is seen as supporting the hypothesis that the peoples there would have been Christian Jutes who had migrated from Kent. In contrast to Kent, the Isle of Wight was the last area of Anglo-Saxon England to be evangelised in 686, when Cædwalla of Wessex invaded the island, killing the local king Arwald and his brothers.

The Jutes used a system of partible inheritance known as gavelkind, which was practised in Kent until the 20th century. The custom of gavelkind was also found in other areas of Jutish settlement. In England and Wales, gavelkind was abolished by the Administration of Estates Act 1925. Before abolition in 1925, all land in Kent was presumed to be held by gavelkind until the contrary was proved. The popular reason given for the practice remaining so long is due to the &quot;Swanscombe Legend&quot;; according to this, Kent made a deal with William the Conqueror whereby he would allow them to keep local customs in return for peace.

==Homeland and historical accounts==
Although historians are confident of where the Jutes settled in England, they are divided on where they actually came from.

The chroniclers, Procopius, Constantius of Lyon, Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and also the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Alfred the Great and Asser provide the names of tribes who settled Britain during the mid-fifth century, and in their combined testimony, the four tribes mentioned are the &quot;Angli&quot;, &quot;Saxones&quot;, &quot;Iutae&quot; and &quot;Frisii&quot;.

The Roman historian Tacitus refers to a people called the &quot;Eudoses,&quot; a tribe who possibly developed into the Jutes.

The Jutes have also been identified with the &quot;Eotenas&quot; (&quot;ēotenas&quot;) involved in the Frisian conflict with the Danes as described in the Finnesburg episode in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Theudebert, king of the Franks, wrote to the Emperor Justinian and in the letter claimed that he had lordship over a nation called the &quot;Saxones Eucii&quot;. The Eucii are thought to have been Jutes and may have been the same as a little-documented tribe called the &quot;Euthiones&quot;. The Euthiones are mentioned in a poem by Venantius Fortunatus (583) as being under the suzerainty of Chilperic I of the Franks. The Euthiones were located somewhere in northern Francia, modern day Flanders, an area of the European mainland opposite to Kent.

Bede inferred that the Jutish homeland was on the Jutland peninsula. However, analysis of grave goods of the time have provided a link between East Kent, south Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, but little evidence of any link with Jutland. There is evidence that the Jutes who migrated to England came from northern Francia or from Frisia. Historians have posited that Jutland was the homeland of the Jutes, but when the Danes invaded the Jutland Peninsula in about AD 200, some of the Jutes would have been absorbed by the Danish culture and others may have migrated to northern Francia and Frisia. In Scandinavian sources from the Middle Ages, the Jutes are only sporadically mentioned, now as subgroup of the Danes.

There is a hypothesis, suggested by Pontus Fahlbeck in 1884, that the Geats were Jutes. According to this hypothesis the Geats resided in southern Sweden and also in Jutland (where Beowulf would have lived).

The evidence adduced for this hypothesis includes:
* Primary sources referring to the Geats (&quot;Geátas&quot;) by alternative names such as &quot;Iútan&quot;, &quot;Iótas&quot;, and &quot;Eotas&quot;.
* Asser in his &quot;Life of Alfred&quot; (Chapter 2) identifies the Jutes with the Goths (in a passage claiming that Alfred the Great was descended, through his mother, Osburga, from the ruling dynasty of the Jutish kingdom of Wihtwara, on the Isle of Wight).
* The Gutasaga is a saga that charts the history of Gotland prior to Christianity. It is an appendix to the &quot;Guta Lag&quot; (Gotland law) written in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. It says that some inhabitants of Gotland left for mainland Europe. Large burial sites attributable to either Goths or Gepids were found in the 19th century near Willenberg, Prussia.

However, the tribal names possibly were confused in the above sources in both &quot;Beowulf&quot; (8th–11th centuries) and &quot;Widsith&quot; (late 7th – 10th century). The &quot;Eoten&quot; (in the Finn passage) are clearly distinguished from the &quot;Geatas&quot;.
The Finnish surname &quot;Juutilainen&quot;, which comes from the word &quot;juutti&quot;, is speculated by some to have had a connection to Jutland or the Jutes.

===Possible synonymy with the Frisians===
While there is no definitive proof that the Frisians and Jutes were the same people, there is compelling evidence suggesting that they were either a single group known by different names or closely related tribes with overlapping territories, cultures, and identities. The fluidity of ethnic designations during the Migration Period makes it plausible that the distinction between &quot;Frisians&quot; and &quot;Jutes&quot; was more of a practical simplification by later chroniclers than a strict ethnic separation. In several Old English and early medieval sources, such as the Finnsburg Fragment and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the terms &quot;Frisians&quot; and &quot;Jutes&quot; appear to be used interchangeably. This suggests that, at least from the perspective of the authors of these texts, the two groups were not clearly distinguishable culturally or ethnically.

Moreover, archaeological findings point to strong cultural similarities between the two groups, as burial practices, material goods (such as weapons, pottery, and jewelry), and settlement patterns in Jutland and Frisian territories show remarkable parallels.

In the field of linguistics, the linguist Elmar Seebold argued that the relatively sharp linguistic boundary between Frisian and Dutch is attributable to migrants from Jutland, with the Jutes simultaneously leaving behind a sharp linguistic boundary between West Germanic and North Germanic in Denmark.
===Language and writing===

The runic alphabet is thought to have originated in the Germanic homelands that were in contact with the Roman Empire, and as such was a response to the Latin alphabet. In fact some of the runes emulated their Latin counterpart. The runic alphabet crossed the sea with the Anglo-Saxons and there have been examples, of its use, found in Kent. As the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were evangelised the script of the Latin alphabet was introduced by Irish Christian missionaries. However, they ran into problems when they were unable to find a Latin equivalent to some of the Anglo-Saxon phonetics. They overcame this by modifying the Latin alphabet to include some runic characters. This became the Old English Latin alphabet. The runic characters were eventually replaced by Latin characters by the end of the 14th century.

The language that the Anglo-Saxon settlers spoke is known as Old English. There are four main dialectal forms, namely Mercian, Northumbrian, West Saxon and Kentish. Based on Bede&#x27;s description of where the Jutes settled, Kentish was spoken in what are now the modern-day counties of Kent, Surrey, southern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. However, historians are divided on what dialect it would have been and where it originated from. The Jutish peninsula has been seen by historians as a pivotal region between the Northern and the Western Germanic dialects. It has not been possible to prove whether Jutish has always been a Scandinavian dialect which later became heavily influenced by West Germanic dialects, or whether Jutland was originally part of the West Germanic dialectal continuum. An analysis of the Kentish dialect by linguists indicates that there was a similarity between Kentish and Frisian. Whether the two can be classed as the same dialect or whether Kentish was a version of Jutish, heavily influenced by Frisian and other dialects, is open to conjecture.

<text>Jewish prayer (,  ; plural ; , plural ; Yinglish: davening from Yiddish &#x27;pray&#x27;) is the prayer recitation that forms part of the observance of Rabbinic Judaism. These prayers, often with instructions and commentary, are found in the &quot;Siddur&quot;, the traditional Jewish prayer book.

Prayer, as a &quot;service of the heart,&quot; is in principle a Torah-based commandment. It is mandatory for Jewish women and men. However, the rabbinic requirement to recite a specific prayer text does differentiate between men and women: Jewish men are obligated to recite three prayers each day within specific time ranges (&quot;zmanim&quot;), while, according to many approaches, women are only required to pray once or twice a day, and may not be required to recite a specific text.

Traditionally, three prayer services are recited daily:

* Morning prayer: &quot;Shacharit&quot; or &quot;Shaharit&quot; (, &quot;of the dawn&quot;)
* Afternoon prayer: &quot;Mincha&quot; or &quot;Minha&quot; (), named for the flour offering that accompanied sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem,
* Evening prayer: &quot;Arvit&quot; (, &quot;of the evening&quot;) or &quot;Maariv&quot; (, &quot;bringing on night&quot;)
Two additional services are recited on Shabbat and holidays:
* &quot;Musaf&quot; (, &quot;additional&quot;) are recited by Orthodox and Conservative congregations on Shabbat, major Jewish holidays (including Chol HaMoed), and Rosh Chodesh.
* &quot;Ne&#x27;ila&quot; (, &quot;closing&quot;), was traditionally recited on communal fast days and is now recited only on Yom Kippur.

A distinction is made between individual prayer and communal prayer, which requires a quorum known as a &quot;minyan&quot;, with communal prayer being preferable as it permits the inclusion of prayers that otherwise would be omitted.

According to tradition, many of the current standard prayers were composed by the sages of the Great Assembly in the early Second Temple period (516 BCE – 70 CE). The language of the prayers, while clearly from this period, often employs biblical idiom. The main structure of the modern prayer service was fixed in the Tannaic era (1st–2nd centuries CE), with some additions and the exact text of blessings coming later. Jewish prayerbooks emerged during the early Middle Ages during the period of the Geonim of Babylonia (6th–11th centuries CE).

Over the last 2000 years, traditional variations have emerged among the traditional liturgical customs of different Jewish communities, such as Ashkenazic, Sephardic, Yemenite, Eretz Yisrael and others, or rather recent liturgical inventions such as Nusach Sefard and Nusach Ari. However the differences are minor compared with the commonalities. Much of the Jewish liturgy is sung or chanted with traditional melodies or trope. Synagogues may designate or employ a professional or lay &quot;hazzan&quot; (cantor) for the purpose of leading the congregation in prayer, especially on Shabbat or holy holidays.

==Origin and history==

===Biblical origin===
According to the Babylonian Talmud, prayer is a biblical command:

Based on this passage, Maimonides categorizes daily prayer as one of the 613 commandments. He rules that the commandment is fulfilled by any prayer at any time in the day, not a specific text; and thus is not time-dependent, and is mandatory for both Jewish men and women. In contrast, the requirement to say specific prayers at specific times is based not on biblical law, but rather rabbinic decree.

===The number of prayers per day===

Additional references in the Hebrew Bible have been interpreted to suggest that King David and the prophet Daniel prayed three times a day. In Psalms, David states:

And in the Book of Daniel:

The Talmud gives two reasons why there are three basic prayers each day:
# Each service was instituted parallel to a sacrificial act in the Temple in Jerusalem: the morning &quot;Tamid&quot; offering, the afternoon &quot;Tamid&quot; offering, and the overnight burning of this last offering.
# According to Rabbi Jose bar Hanina, each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the afternoon and Jacob the evening prayers. This view is supported with biblical quotes indicating that the Patriarchs prayed at the times mentioned. However, even according to this view, the exact times of when the services are held, and moreover the entire concept of a &quot;mussaf&quot; service, are still based on the sacrifices.

===Development of the prayer text===

The earliest parts of Jewish prayer are the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; and the Priestly Blessing, which are in the Torah.

Maimonides asserts that until the Babylonian exile, all Jews composed their own prayers. After the exile, however, when the exiles&#x27; understanding of Hebrew diminished and they found it difficult to compose prayers in Hebrew, Ezra and his court composed the &quot;Amidah&quot; prayer. Modern scholarship dating from the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement of 19th-century Germany, as well as textual analysis influenced by the 20th-century discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, suggests that dating from the Second Temple period there existed &quot;liturgical formulations of a communal nature designated for particular occasions and conducted in a centre totally independent of Jerusalem and the Temple, making use of terminology and theological concepts that were later to become dominant in Jewish and, in some cases, Christian prayer.&quot;

The structure of the modern Jewish prayer service was established during the period of the Tannaim, &quot;from their traditions, later committed to writing, we learn that the generation of rabbis active at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE) gave Jewish prayer its structure and, in outline form at least, its contents.&quot; This liturgy included the twice-daily recitation of the Shema, the Amidah, and the cycle of public Torah reading.

The &quot;Amidah&quot; (or &quot;Shemoneh Esreh&quot;) prayer is traditionally ascribed to the Great Assembly (in the time of Ezra, near the end of the biblical period), though other sources suggest it was established by Simeon HaPakoli in the late 1st century. Even in the 1st century, though, the precise wording of the blessings was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. By the Middle Ages the texts of the blessings was nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today.

Readings from the Torah (five books of Moses) and the Nevi&#x27;im (&quot;Prophets&quot;) are specified in the Mishnah and Talmud, as are the order of blessings surrounding the &quot;Shema&quot;. Other parts of the service, such as Pesukei dezimra, have little mention in early sources, but became established by custom.

The oldest prayer books date from the time of the Geonim of Babylonia; &quot;some were composed by respected rabbinic scholars at the request of far-flung communities seeking an authoritative text of the required prayers for daily use, Shabbat, and holidays.&quot; The earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav Amram Gaon of Sura, Babylon, about 850 CE. Half a century later Rav Saadia Gaon, also of Sura, composed a siddur, in which the rubrical matter is in Arabic. These were the basis of Simcha ben Samuel&#x27;s Machzor Vitry (11th-century France), which was based on the ideas of his teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by Maimonides to the laws of prayer in his Mishneh Torah: this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this point forward, all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents.

The siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy as early as 1486, though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The siddur began appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first English translation, by Gamaliel ben Pedahzur (a pseudonym), appeared in London in 1738; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.

Over the last 2000 years, the various branches of Judaism have resulted in small variations in the Rabbinic liturgy customs among different Jewish communities, with each community having a slightly different nusach (customary liturgy). The principal difference is between Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs, although there are other communities (e.g., Yemenite and Italian Jews, and in the past Eretz Yisrael), and rather recent liturgical inventions such as Hassidic, Chabad and other communities also have distinct customs, variations, and special prayers. However, the differences between all these customs are quite minor compared with the commonalities. Reform Judaism also has its own version.

===Text and language===
According to halakha, all individual prayers and virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the &quot;Mishnah&quot; mentions that the &quot;Shema&quot; need not be said in Hebrew. A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the others are prayers that are to be said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a priest, or by a reigning King.

Despite this, the tradition of most Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogues is to use Hebrew for all except a small number of prayers, including Kaddish and Yekum Purkan in Aramaic, and Gott Fun Avraham, which was written in Yiddish. In other streams of Judaism there is considerable variability: Sephardic communities may use Ladino or Portuguese for many prayers, although usually only for added prayers and not for the established prayers; Conservative synagogues tend to use the local language to a varying degree; and at some Reform synagogues almost the whole service may be in the local language.

The language of the prayers, while clearly being from the Second Temple period, often employs biblical idiom, and according to some authorities it should not contain rabbinic or Mishnaic idiom apart from in the sections of Mishnah that are featured.

==Denominational variations==

Conservative services generally use the same basic format for services as Orthodox Judaism, with some doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English. In practice, there is wide variation among Conservative congregations. In traditionalist congregations the liturgy can be almost identical to that of Orthodox Judaism, almost entirely in Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers for the restoration of the sacrificial system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the service in English; abbreviation or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are some changes for doctrinal reasons, including egalitarian language, fewer references to restoring sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem, and an option to eliminate special roles for Kohanim and Levites.

The liturgies of Reform and Reconstructionist are based on traditional elements, but contain language more reflective of liberal belief than the traditional liturgy. Doctrinal revisions generally include revising or omitting references to traditional doctrines such as bodily resurrection, a personal Jewish Messiah, and other elements of traditional Jewish eschatology, Divine revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai, angels, conceptions of reward and punishment, and other personal miraculous and supernatural elements. Services are often from 40% to 90% in the vernacular.

Reform Judaism has made greater alterations to the traditional service in accord with its more liberal theology including dropping references to traditional elements of Jewish eschatology such as a personal Messiah, a bodily resurrection of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of Shabbat (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are inapplicable to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental or recorded music with prayers on the Jewish Sabbath. All Reform synagogues are Egalitarian with respect to gender roles.

==Philosophy of prayer==
In Jewish philosophy and in Rabbinic literature, it is noted that the Hebrew verb for prayer— ()—is in fact the reflexive form of (), to judge. Thus, &quot;to pray&quot; conveys the notion of &quot;judging oneself&quot;: ultimately, the purpose of prayer— ()—is to transform oneself.

This etymology is consistent with the Jewish conception of divine simplicity. It is not God that changes through one&#x27;s prayer—man does not influence God as a defendant influences a human judge who has emotions and is subject to change—rather it is man himself who is changed. It is further consistent with Maimonides&#x27; view on Divine Providence. Here, Tefillah is the medium which God gave to man by means of which he can change himself, and thereby establish a new &quot;relationship&quot; with God—and thus a new destiny for himself in life; see also under Psalms.

===Kabbalistic view===
Kabbalah (esoteric Jewish mysticism) uses a series of &quot;kavanot&quot;, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialogue with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalism ascribes a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.

This approach has been taken by the Chassidei Ashkenaz (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the Zohar, the Arizal&#x27;s Kabbalist tradition, the Ramchal, most of Hassidism, the Vilna Gaon and Jacob Emden.

Hassidism, although incorporating the kabbalistic worldview and its corresponding kavanot, also emphasized straightforward sincerity and depth of emotional engagement in prayer. The Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s great-grandson, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, particularly emphasized speaking to God in one&#x27;s own words, which he called Hitbodedut (self-seclusion) and advised setting aside an hour to do this every day.

==Methodology and terminology==

===Terms for praying===
&quot;Daven&quot; is the originally exclusively Eastern Yiddish verb meaning &quot;pray&quot;; it is widely used by Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews. In Yinglish, this has become the Anglicised &quot;davening&quot;.

The origin of the word is obscure, but is thought by some to have come from Arabic (from &quot;diwan&quot;, a collection of poems or prayers), French (from &quot;devoner&quot;, &#x27;to devote&#x27; or &#x27;dedicate&#x27; or possibly from the French &#x27;devant&#x27;- &#x27;in front of&#x27; with the idea that the person praying is mindful of before whom they stand), Latin (from &quot;divin&quot;, &#x27;divine&#x27;) or even English (from &quot;dawn&quot;). Others believe that it derives from a Slavic word meaning &quot;to give&quot; (). Some claim that it originates from an Aramaic word, &quot;de&#x27;avuhon&quot; or &quot;d&#x27;avinun&quot;, meaning &#x27;of their/our forefathers&#x27;, as the three prayers are said to have been invented by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Another Aramaic derivation, proposed by Avigdor Chaikin, cites the Talmudic phrase, &quot;ka davai lamizrach&quot;, &#x27;gazing wistfully to the east&#x27;. Kevin A. Brook cited Zeiden&#x27;s suggestion that the word &quot;daven&quot; comes from the Turkic root &quot;tabun-&quot; meaning &#x27;to pray&#x27;, and that in Kipchak Turkic, the initial &quot;t&quot; morphs into &quot;d&quot;, but also cited Beider&#x27;s opinion that Zeiden&#x27;s etymology is unlikely.

In Western Yiddish, the term for &quot;pray&quot; is &quot;oren&quot;, a word with clear roots in Romance languages, similar to Spanish and Portuguese &quot;orar&quot; and Latin &quot;orare&quot;.

===Minyan (quorum)===

Individual prayer is considered acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten Jewish adults—a &quot;minyan&quot;—is the most highly recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means over the age of 12 or 13 (&quot;bat&quot; or &quot;bar mitzvah&quot;). Judaism had originally counted only men in the &quot;minyan&quot; for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan.

Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the &quot;minyan&quot;. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a &quot;minyan&quot; mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a &quot;minyan&quot;. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors.

There is a publicly said prayer, called Birkhat HaGomel, for giving thanks for surviving an illness or danger. which, in addition to needing a &quot;Minyan&quot;, also needs a Torah scroll taken out for a scheduled Torah reading.

===Attire===
* &quot;Head covering&quot;. In most synagogues, it is considered a sign of respect for male attendees to wear a head covering, either a dress hat or a kippa (skull cap, plural &quot;kipot&quot;, also known by the Yiddish term &quot;yarmulke&quot;). It is common practice for both Jews and non-Jews who attend a synagogue to wear a head covering. Some Conservative synagogues may also encourage (but rarely require) women to cover their heads. Many Reform and Progressive temples do not require people to cover their heads, although individual worshipers, both men and women, may choose to. Many Orthodox and some conservative men and women wear a head covering throughout their day, even when not attending religious services.
* &quot;Tallit&quot; (prayer shawl) is traditionally worn during all morning services (with the exception of Tisha B&#x27;av in many communities), during Aliyah to the Torah, as well as during all the services of Yom Kippur. In many communities, the &quot;hazzan&quot; alone wears a tallit during the daily afternoon and evening services. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men who are halakhically Jewish and though in some Conservative synagogues they should be worn only by men, in other Conservative synagogues both men and women who are halakhically Jewish should wear a tallit. In most Orthodox Ashkenazi synagogues (except for those who follow German or Hungarian customs) they are worn only by men who are or have been married.
* &quot;Tefillin&quot; (phylacteries) are a set of small cubic leather boxes painted black, containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. They are tied to the head and arm with leather straps dyed black, and worn by Jews only, during weekday morning prayers. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men; in Conservative synagogues they are also worn by some women. The Karaite Jews, however, do not don tefillin.
* &quot;Tzeniut&quot; (modesty) applies to men and women. When attending Orthodox synagogues, women will likely be expected to wear long sleeves (past the elbows), long skirts (past the knees), a high neckline (to the collar bone), and if married, to cover their hair with a wig, scarf, hat or a combination of the above. For men, short pants or sleeveless shirts are generally regarded as inappropriate. In some Conservative and Reform synagogues the dress code may be more lax, but still respectful.

===Other laws and customs===
In the event one of the prayers was missed inadvertently, the Amidah prayer is said twice in the next service—a procedure known as &quot;tefillat tashlumin&quot;.

Many Jews sway their body back and forth during prayer. This practice, referred to as &quot;shuckling&quot; in Yiddish, is not mandatory.

Many are accustomed to giving charity before, during (especially during Vayivarech David) or after prayer, in the hopes that this will make their prayer more likely to be heard.

According to the Talmud, during prayer one should face toward Jerusalem, and specifically the site of the Temple in Jerusalem. This is based on Solomon&#x27;s prayer &quot;...and they will pray to You toward their land, which You gave to their fathers; the city which You have chosen; and the house which I have built for Your name&quot; ().

==Daily prayers==
===Shacharit===

The &quot;Shacharit&quot; (from &quot;shachar&quot;, morning light) prayer is recited in the morning. &quot;Halacha&quot; limits parts of its recitation to the first three (Shema) or four (Amidah) hours of the day, where &quot;hours&quot; are 1/12 of daylight time, making these times dependent on the season.

Shacharit is generally the lengthiest prayer of the day. Its components include Birkot hashachar, Korbanot, Pesukei dezimra, the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; and its blessings, the Amidah, and Tachanun. Of these, the recitation of Shema Yisrael and the Amidah constitute the core of the Shacharit service. Those Jews who wear tallit and tefillin generally only do so during the Shacharit prayer.

===Mincha===

&quot;Mincha&quot; or &quot;Minha&quot; may be recited from half an hour after &quot;halachic&quot; noontime, until sunset. Sephardim and Italian Jews start the Mincha prayers with Psalm 84 and &quot;Korbanot&quot;, and usually continue with the &quot;Pittum hakketoret&quot;. The opening section is concluded with Malachi 3:4.

Ashrei is recited, followed by half-Kaddish, the Amidah (including repetition), &quot;Tachanun&quot;, and then the full Kaddish. Sephardim insert a Psalm, followed by the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish. After this follows, in most modern rites, the &quot;Aleinu&quot;. Most Ashkenazim then conclude with the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish. In Ashkenazic, Italian and Yemenite communities, the service leaders often wears a tallit.

===Ma&#x27;ariv/Arvit===
Generally, the time when &quot;Maariv&quot; can first be recited is when the time for reciting &quot;Mincha&quot; ends. But there are varying opinions on this. &quot;Maariv&quot; should not begin before 1¼ hours before sunset. Others delay &quot;Maariv&quot; until after sunset or after dusk. If &quot;Maariv&quot; is recited prior to dusk, individuals repeat the Shema later in the evening.

The main components of Maariv are the recitation of the Shema (with two blessings before it and two after it), followed by the Amidah (which is not repeated, unlike with other recitations of the Amidah). Some communities add a third blessing between the Shema and Amidah. Some additional prayers and biblical verses are recited as well; these vary by community and occasion.

==Prayer on Shabbat==
On Shabbat (the Sabbath), prayers are similar in structure to those on weekdays, although almost every part is lengthened. One exception is the &quot;Amidah&quot;, the main prayer, which is abridged. The first three and last three blessings are recited as usual, but the middle thirteen are replaced with a single blessing known as &quot;sanctity of the day,&quot; describing the Sabbath. Atypically, this middle blessing is different for each of the prayers.

===Friday night===
Shabbat services begin on Friday afternoon with the weekday Mincha. Tachnun is omitted. In some Ashkenazic communities, Aleinu is omitted since it will be followed immediately by Kabbalat Shabbat. In recent times, some prefer to daven early mincha on Friday.

Some communities recite the Song of Songs, and then in most communities followed by the &quot;Kabbalat Shabbat&quot;, the mystical prelude to Shabbat services composed by 16th-century Kabbalists. Although the service was composed in the 16th century, some communities did not adopt it until much later; for example, it was not recited in the main synagogue in Frankfurt am Main until the mid-19th century, and it was not recited in Worms even later. This Hebrew term literally means &quot;Receiving the Sabbath&quot;. In recent decades, some communities have adopted the practice to sing the piyut &quot;Yedid Nefesh&quot; before (or occasionally after) the Kabbalat Shabbat prayers.

In Ashkenazic and some Sephardic communities, Kabbalat Shabbat is begins with six Psalms, representing the six weekdays. In Italian Nusach and many Sephardic communinties (including Spanish and Portuguese Jews and many Middle Eastern Sephardic communities) only Psalm 29 is recited (some add Psalm 100). Some then recite Ana BeKoach. After that, the poem &quot;Lekha Dodi&quot; is recited. It based on the words of the Talmudic sage Hanina: &quot;Come, let us go out to meet the Queen Sabbath&quot;. Kabbalat Shabbat is concluded by Psalm 92 (in most communities, the recital of which constitutes acceptance of the current Shabbat with all its obligations) and Psalm 93. Many add a study section here, including &quot;Bameh Madlikin&quot; and &quot;Amar rabbi El&#x27;azar&quot; and the concluding &quot;Kaddish deRabbanan&quot; (in the Western Ashkenazic rite, a mourners kaddish is instead recited after &quot;Bameh Madlikin&quot;) and is then followed by the Maariv service; other communities delay the study session until after Maariv. According to Nusach Sefard, a passage from the Zohar, entitled &quot;Kegavna&quot; is recited instead of &quot;Bameh Madlikin&quot;. In modern times the Kabbalat Shabbat has been set to music by many composers including: Robert Strassburg and Samuel Adler

The Shema section of the Friday night service varies in some details from the weekday services—mainly in the different ending of the &quot;Hashkivenu&quot; prayer and the omission of Baruch HaShem Le&#x27;Olam prayer in those traditions where this section is otherwise recited. In the Italian rite, there are also different versions of the &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv aravim&quot; prayer (beginning &quot;asher killah&quot;) and the &quot;Emet Ve-Emunah&quot; prayer.

Most commemorate the Shabbat at this point with &quot;VeShameru&quot;. The custom to recite these verses appears in many early sources such as Siddur Rav Saadya Gaon (who recited the blessing Yiru Eineinu after these verses) and is found in the vast majority of old prayer books of a variety of rites. However, it is absent from the Yemenite &quot;Baladi&quot; tradition (although has been added in most Baladi communities in the last few hundred years), and it is not recited according to the traditions of the Vilna Gaon or Chabad who are opposed to adding additional readings to the siddur which are not mentioned in the Talmud.

On Friday night, the middle blessing of the &quot;Amidah&quot; discusses the conclusion of creation, quoting the relevant verses from Genesis. The Amidah is then followed by the Seven-Faceted Blessing, the hazzan&#x27;s mini-repetition of the Amidah. In some Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogues the second chapter of Mishnah tractate Shabbat, &quot;Bameh Madlikin&quot;, is read at this point, instead of earlier. Kiddush is recited in the synagogue in many Ashkenazic Italian communities. Some communities recite Psalm 23 and the service then follows with Aleinu. Most Sephardic and many Ashkenazic synagogues end with the singing of &quot;Yigdal&quot;, a poetic adaptation of Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles of Jewish faith. Other Ashkenazic synagogues end with &quot;Adon Olam&quot; instead, and some do not recite either poem.

===Shacharit===

Shabbat morning prayers differ from weekday morning prayers in several ways: an expanded version of Pesukei dezimra, a longer version of the Yotzer ohr blessing (in most communities), the seven-blessing Shabbat version of the Amidah, no Tachanun, a longer Torah reading including the reading of the Haftarah, and some additional prayers after the Torah reading. In many communities, the rabbi (or a learned member of the congregation) delivers a sermon at the very end of Shacharit and before Mussaf, usually on the topic of the Torah reading.

===Mussaf===

The &quot;Musaf&quot; service starts with the silent recitation of the &quot;Amidah&quot;. The middle blessing includes the &quot;Tikanta Shabbat&quot; reading on the holiness of Shabbat (in Yemenite communities, as well as some Sephardic communities &quot;Le-Mosheh Tsivita&quot; is recited instead of &quot;Tikanta Shabbat&quot;), and then by a reading from the biblical Book of Numbers about the sacrifices that used to be performed in the Temple in Jerusalem. Next comes &quot;Yismechu&quot;, &quot;They shall rejoice in Your sovereignty&quot;, and &quot;Eloheynu&quot;, &quot;Our God and God of our Ancestors, may you be pleased with our rest&quot; (which is recited during all &quot;Amidah&quot;s of the Sabbath). After the silent prayer, the leader repeats the prayer, adding an expanded version of Kedushah. In some Sephardic and Yemenite communities, rather than the silent prayer and repetition, the leader recited his own prayer aloud and the congregation prays along with him.

After the &quot;Amidah&quot; comes the full Kaddish, followed by &quot;Ein keloheinu&quot;. In Orthodox Judaism this is followed by a reading from the Talmud on the incense offering called &quot;Pittum Haketoreth&quot; and daily psalms that used to be recited in the Temple in Jerusalem. These readings are usually omitted by Conservative Jews, and are always omitted by Reform Jews.

The &quot;Musaf&quot; service culminates with the Rabbi&#x27;s Kaddish (in the Western Ashkenazic rite, the Mourners Kaddish is recited instead), the &quot;Aleinu&quot;, followed in many communities by the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish. Some synagogues conclude with the reading of Shir Hayichud, Anim Zemirot (sometimes followed by a Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish), the Psalm of the Day (sometimes followed by a Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish) - in some communities, these are recited before the Torah reading or at the beginning of services instead. Many communities conclude with either Adon Olam or Yigdal.

===Mincha===
Mincha commences with Ashrei and the prayer Uva letzion, after which the first section of the next weekly portion is read from the Torah scroll. The &quot;Amidah&quot; follows the same pattern as the other Shabbat &quot;Amidah&quot; prayers, with the middle blessing starting &quot;Attah Echad&quot;. The short prayer Tzidkatcha is recited after the &quot;Amidah&quot;, followed by Kaddish and Aleinu.

===Ma&#x27;ariv===
At the conclusion of the Sabbath, the weekday Ma&#x27;ariv is recited. Some communities recite (sometimes sing) Psalm 144 and Psalm 67. In the amidah, ata chonantanu is added in the fourth blessing. After the conclusion of the Amidah, &quot;Vihi No&#x27;am&quot;, &quot;Veyiten Lecha&quot;, and &quot;Havdalah&quot; are recited, followed by Aleinu; some delay the recitation of Ve-Yitten lekha until after the recitation of Havdalah at home.

==Special observances and circumstances==

===Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur===
The services for the Days of Awe, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, take on a solemn tone as befits these days. Traditional solemn tunes are used in the prayers.

The musaf service on Rosh Hashana has nine blessings; the three middle blessings include biblical verses attesting to sovereignty, remembrance and the &quot;shofar&quot;, which is sounded during the service.

Yom Kippur is the only day in the year when there are five prayer services. The evening service, containing the Ma&#x27;ariv prayer, is widely known as &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot;, the opening declaration made preceding the prayer. During the daytime, shacharit, musaf (which is recited on Shabbat and all festivals) and mincha are followed, as the sun begins to set, by Ne&#x27;ila, which is recited just this once a year.

===Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot===
The services for the three festivals of Pesach (&quot;Passover&quot;), Shavuot (&quot;Feast of Weeks&quot; or &quot;Pentecost&quot;), and Sukkot (&quot;Feast of Tabernacles&quot;) are alike, except for interpolated piyyutim and readings for each individual festival. The preliminaries and conclusions of the prayers are the same as on Shabbat. The Amidah on these festivals only contains seven benedictions, with &quot;Attah Bechartanu&quot; as the main one. After the Shacharit Amidah, Hallel (communal recitation of Psalms 113–118) follows; on the last six days of Passover, Hallal is recited in its abbreviated form and customs vary as to whether a blessing is recited.

The Musaf service includes Umi-Penei Hata&#x27;enu, with reference to the special festival and Temple sacrifices on the occasion.

The Priestly Blessing (&quot;dukhening&quot;) is pronounced during the repetition of the Amidah. While this occurs daily in Israel and most Sephardic congregations, it occurs only on Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur in Ashkenazic (and some Sephardic communities) congregations of the Jewish diaspora. Even when it is omitted, or when there are no kohanim present, a special prayer is instead recited by the &quot;hazzan&quot; after the &quot;Modim&quot; (&quot;Thanksgiving&quot;) prayer) in commemoration of the priestly blessing. (American Reform Jews omit the Musaf service.)

==Role of women==

===Number of obligatory prayers===
According to halakha, Jewish men are obligated to perform public prayer three times a day, within specific time ranges (zmanim), plus additional services on Jewish holidays.

According to the Talmud, women are generally exempted from obligations that have to be performed at a certain time. (This has interpreted as being due to the need to constantly care for small children, or due to women&#x27;s alleged higher spiritual level which makes it unnecessary for them to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God.) In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, women are not required to recite the morning and evening Shema (though &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; suggests that they say it anyway), and most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from reciting Maariv.

Authorities have disagreed on whether this exemption applies to additional prayers. According to (Ashkenazi) Magen Avraham and more recently (Sephardi) Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, women are only required to pray once a day, in any form they choose, so long as the prayer contains praise of (brakhot), requests to (bakashot), and thanks of (hodot) God. However, most Orthodox authorities agree that women are not completely exempt from time-bound prayer. The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot;, an important code of Ashkenazic Jewish law, holds that the Men of the Great Assembly obligated women to recite &quot;Shacharit&quot; and &quot;Minchah&quot; each day, &quot;just like men&quot;. Nonetheless, even the most liberal Orthodox authorities hold that women cannot count in a minyan for purposes of public prayer.

Traditionally, women were also reciting individual tkhine prayers in Yiddish.

Conservative Judaism regards the &quot;halakhic&quot; system of multiple daily services as mandatory. Since 2002, Jewish women from Conservative congregations have been regarded as having undertaken a communal obligation to pray the same prayers at the same times as men, with traditional communities and individual women permitted to opt out. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations do not regard &quot;halakha&quot; as binding and hence regard appropriate prayer times as matters of personal spiritual decision rather than a matter of religious requirement.

===Seating===

Throughout Orthodox Judaism, including its most liberal forms, men and women are required to sit in separate sections with a mechitza (partition) separating them. Historically, a learned woman in the &quot;weibershul&quot; (women&#x27;s section or annex) of a synagogue took on the informal role of precentress or firzogerin for the women praying in parallel to the main service led in the men&#x27;s section. Conservative/Masorti Judaism permits mixed seating (almost universally in the United States, but not in all countries). All Reform and Reconstructionist congregations have mixed seating.

===Prayer leaders===
Haredi and the vast majority of Modern Orthodox Judaism has a blanket prohibition on women leading public congregational prayers. Conservative Judaism has developed a blanket justification for women leading all or virtually all such prayers, holding that although only obligated individuals can lead prayers and women were not traditionally obligated, Conservative Jewish women in modern times have as a collective whole voluntarily undertaken such an obligation. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations permit women to perform all prayer roles because they do not regard halakha as binding.

A small liberal wing within Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly rabbis friendly to the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA), has begun re-examining the role of women in prayers based on an individual, case-by-case look at the historical role of specific prayers and services, doing so within classical &quot;halakhic&quot; interpretation. Accepting that where obligation exists only the obligated can lead, this small group has typically made three general arguments for expanded women&#x27;s roles:

# Because women were required to perform certain korbanot (sacrifices) in the Temple in Jerusalem, women today are required to perform, and hence can lead (and can count in the &quot;minyan&quot; for if required), the specific prayers substituting for these specific sacrifices. &quot;Birchat Hagomel&quot; falls in this category.
# Because certain parts of the service were added after the Talmud defined mandatory services, such prayers are equally voluntary on everyone and hence can be led by women (and no &quot;minyan&quot; is required). &quot;Pseukei D&#x27;Zimrah&quot; in the morning and &quot;Kabbalat Shabbat&quot; on Friday nights fall in this category.
# In cases where the Talmud indicates that women are generally qualified to lead certain services but do not do so because of the &quot;dignity of the congregation&quot;, modern congregations are permitted to waive such dignity if they wish. Torah reading on Shabbat falls in this category. An argument that women are permitted to lead the services removing and replacing the Torah in the Ark on &quot;Shabbat&quot; extends from their ability to participate in Torah reading then.

A very small number of Modern Orthodox congregations accept some such arguments, but very few Orthodox congregations or authorities accept all or even most of them. Many of those who do not accept this reasoning point to &quot;kol isha&quot;, the tradition that prohibits a man from hearing a woman other than his wife or close blood relative sing. JOFA refers to congregations generally accepting such arguments as Partnership Minyanim. On Shabbat in a Partnership Minyan, women can typically lead &quot;Kabbalat Shabbat&quot;, the &quot;P&#x27;seukei D&#x27;Zimrah&quot;, the services for removing the Torah from and replacing it to the Ark, and Torah reading, as well as give a &quot;D&#x27;Var Torah&quot; or sermon.

The first Orthodox Jewish women&#x27;s prayer group was created on the holiday of Simhat Torah at Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan in the late 1960s.

Ephraim Mirvis, an Orthodox rabbi who serves as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, supports Shabbat prayer groups for Orthodox women, saying, &quot;Some of our congregations have women prayer groups for Friday night, some Saturday mornings. This is without women reading from the Torah. But for women to come together as a group to pray, this is a good thing.&quot;

However, many Modern Orthodox rabbis, including Rabbi Hershel Schachter, Rabbi Mordechai Willig, Rabbi Nisson Alpert and others have ruled that this practice is not permitted. These practices are also unheard of in the Hareidi world

==Role of minors==
In most divisions of Judaism boys prior to bar mitzvah cannot act as a Chazzen for prayer services that contain &quot;devarim sheb&#x27;kidusha&quot;, i.e. Kaddish, Barechu, the amida, etc., or receive an &quot;aliya&quot; or chant the Torah for the congregation. Since &quot;Kabbalat Shabbat&quot; and &quot;Pesukei D&#x27;zimra&quot; do not technically require a chazzan at all, it is possible for a boy prior to bar mitzvah to lead these services. The conclusion of the service on Shabbat and &quot;chagim&quot; may also be led by children. Under the Moroccan, Yemenite, and Mizrachi customs, a boy prior to bar mitzvah may lead certain prayers, read the Torah, and have an aliyah. It is customary among many Ashkenazim to have children sing &quot;Adon &#x27;Olam&quot; after Mussaf and &quot;Yigdal&quot; after Shabbat and Holiday Maariv. Among Sefardim, Mizrachim, Yemenites, and some Askenazim, a child leads the congregation in Kiryat Shema.

==Denominational variations==

Conservative services generally use the same basic format for services as in Orthodox Judaism, with some doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English. In practice, there is wide variation among Conservative congregations. In traditionalist congregations the liturgy can be almost identical to that of Orthodox Judaism, almost entirely in Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers for the restoration of the sacrificial system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the service in English; abbreviation or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are some changes for doctrinal reasons, including egalitarian language, fewer references to restoring sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem, and an option to eliminate special roles for Kohanim and Levites.

The liturgies of Reform and Reconstructionist are based on traditional elements, but contains language more reflective of liberal belief than the traditional liturgy. Doctrinal revisions generally include revising or omitting references to traditional doctrines such as bodily resurrection, a personal Jewish Messiah, and other elements of traditional Jewish eschatology, Divine revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai, angels, conceptions of reward and punishment, and other personal miraculous and supernatural elements. Services are often from 40% to 90% in the vernacular.

Reform Judaism has made greater alterations to the traditional service in accord with its more liberal theology including dropping references to traditional elements of Jewish eschatology such as a personal Messiah, a bodily resurrection of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of Shabbat (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are inapplicable to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental or recorded music with prayers on the Jewish Sabbath. All Reform synagogues are egalitarian with respect to gender roles.

<doc id="16162" wikidata="Q2411408" url="?curid=16162" title="Jewish eschatology">
<text>Jewish eschatology is the area of Jewish theology concerned with events that will happen in the end of days and related concepts. This includes the ingathering of the exiled diaspora, the coming of the Jewish Messiah, the afterlife, and the resurrection of the dead. In Judaism, the end times are usually called the &quot;end of days&quot; (&quot;aḥarit ha-yamim&quot;, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh.

These beliefs have evolved over time, and according to some authors there is evidence of Jewish belief in a personal afterlife with reward or punishment referenced in the Torah.

==Sources==
In Judaism, the main textual source for the belief in the end of days and accompanying events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. The roots of Jewish eschatology are to be found in the pre-exile prophets, including Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the exilic prophets Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah. The main tenets of Jewish eschatology are the following, in no particular order, elaborated in the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah and the Book of Ezekiel.
==The End of Days==

===War of Gog and Magog===

According to Ezekiel chapter 38, the &quot;war of Gog and Magog&quot; is a climactic war that will happen at the end of the Jewish exile. According to biblical commentator and rabbi David Kimhi, this war will take place in Jerusalem.

===Events to occur===

* God redeems the Jewish people from their captivity that began with the Babylonian Exile, in a new Exodus (Kibbutz Galuyot)
* God returns the Jewish people to the Land of Israel
* God restores the kingly House of David and the Temple in Jerusalem
* God appoints a regent from the House of David (i.e. the Messiah) to lead the Jewish people and the world, and usher in the Messianic Age, characterised by justice, righteousness, and peace
* All nations recognize that the God of Israel is the only true God and gather to the mount Zion
* God resurrects the dead and judges all people (and sends some for a year to Gehinnom)
* God creates a new heaven and a new earth

==Biblical Sheol==

The Hebrew Bible reflects the belief of the Israelites in an arguably Hades-like afterworld, where both the righteous (see Samuel) and the sinners continue their existence in a miserable manner.

==World to come==

The afterlife is known as &quot;olam ha-ba&quot; (), and is related to concepts of &quot;Gan Eden&quot;, the Heavenly &quot;Garden in Eden&quot;, or Paradise, and &quot;Gehinnom&quot;. The phrase &quot;olam ha-ba&quot; itself does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. The accepted halakha is that it is impossible for living human beings to know what the world to come is like.

===Second Temple period===
In the late Second Temple period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of an individual were diverse. The Pharisees and Essenes believed in the immortality of the soul, but the Sadducees did not. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish pseudepigrapha and Jewish magical papyri all reflect this variety of opinions.

===Medieval rabbinical views===
While all classical rabbinic sources discuss the afterlife, Medieval scholars dispute the nature of existence in the &quot;End of Days&quot; after the Messianic Age. While Maimonides describes an entirely spiritual existence for souls, which he calls &quot;disembodied intellects&quot;, Nachmanides discusses an intensely spiritual existence on Earth, where spirituality and physicality are merged. Both agree that life after death is as Maimonides describes the &quot;End of Days&quot;. This existence entails an extremely heightened understanding of and connection to the Divine Presence. This view is shared by all classical rabbinic scholars.

According to Maimonides, any non-Jew who lives according to the Seven Laws of Noah is regarded as a righteous gentile, and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.

There is a great deal of surviving rabbinic material concerning the fate of the soul after death, its experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: &quot;Hibbut ha-kever&quot;, the pains and experiences of the physico-spiritual dissolution or reconfiguration within the grave; &quot;Dumah&quot;, the angel in charge of funerary matters; Satan as the angel of death or other equally grim figure; the &quot;Kaf ha-Kela&quot;, the ensnarement or confinement of the stripped-down soul within various ghostly material reallocations (devised for the purpose of cleansing a soul of contamination but not severe enough to warrant Gehinnom, see Tanya Chapter 8)); &quot;Gehinnom&quot; (pure purgatory); and &quot;Gan Eden&quot; (heavenly respite or paradise, a purified state). All classical rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding, so these ideas are expressed throughout rabbinic literature via parables and analogies.

&quot;Gehinnom&quot; is fairly well defined in rabbinic literature. It is sometimes translated as &quot;hell&quot;, but is more similar to the Nicene Christian view of Purgatory than to its Hell. Rabbinic thought maintains that souls are not tortured in Gehinnom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be eleven months, with the exception of heretics and extremely sinful Jews. This is why Jews mourning for near relatives will not recite mourner&#x27;s kaddish for more than eleven months after a death. &quot;Gehinnom&quot; is considered a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to &quot;Gan Eden&quot; (&quot;Garden of Eden&quot;).

===Rabbinic legends===
Rabbinic literature includes many legends about the World to Come and the two Gardens of Eden. As compiled by Louis Ginzberg in the book &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, these include the world to come, which is called Paradise and said to have a double gate made of carbuncle guarded by 600,000 shining angels. Seven clouds of glory overshadow Paradise, and under them, in the center of Paradise, stands the tree of life. The tree of life overshadows Paradise too, and it has fifteen thousand different tastes and aromas that winds blow all across Paradise. Under the tree of life are many pairs of canopies, one of stars and the other of sun and moon, while a cloud of glory separates the two. In each pair of canopies sits a rabbinic scholar who explains the Torah to one. When one enters Paradise, one is proffered by Michael the archangel to God on the altar of the Temple in the heavenly Jerusalem. One is transfigured into an angel, with the ugliest person becoming as beautiful and shining as &quot;the grains of a silver pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun&quot;. The angels that guard Paradise&#x27;s gate adorn the soul in seven clouds of glory, crown it with gems and pearls and gold, place eight myrtles in the hand, and praise it for being righteous while leading it to a garden of eight hundred roses and myrtles watered by many rivers. In the garden is one&#x27;s canopy, its beauty according to one&#x27;s merit, but each canopy has four riversmilk, honey, wine, and balsamflowing out from it, and has a golden vine and thirty shining pearls hanging from it. Under each canopy is a table of gems and pearls attended to by sixty angels. The light of Paradise is the light of the righteous people therein. Each day in Paradise, one wakes up a child and goes to bed an elder to enjoy the pleasures of childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age. In each corner of Paradise is a forest of 800,000 trees, the least among these greater than the best herbs and spices, attended to by 800,000 sweetly singing angels. Paradise is divided into seven sub-paradises, each one 120,000 miles long and wide. Depending on one&#x27;s merit, a soul is assigned to one of these sections of Paradise: the first is made of glass and cedar and is for converts to Judaism; the second is of silver and cedar and is for penitents; the third is of silver, gold, gems and pearls, and is for the Patriarchs, Moses and Aaron, the Israelites that left Egypt and lived in the wilderness, and the kings of Israel; the fourth is of rubies and olive wood and is for the holy and steadfast in faith; the fifth is like the third, except a river flows through it and its bed was woven by Eve and the angels, and it is for the Messiah and Elijah; and the sixth and seventh divisions are not described, except that they are respectively for those who died doing pious acts and those who died from illness in expiation for Israel&#x27;s sins.

Above this Paradise is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains 310 worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is made open to a soul based on its merit. The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for &quot;Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai and his disciples&quot;, the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned, and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.

===Resurrection of the dead===
An early explicit mention of resurrection in Hebrew texts is the Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones in the Book of Ezekiel, dated somewhere around 539 BCE. Alan Segal argues that this narrative was intended as a metaphor for national rebirth, promising the Jews&#x27; return to Israel and reconstruction of the Temple, not as a description of personal resurrection.

The Book of Daniel promised literal resurrection to the Jews, in concrete detail. Alan Segal interprets Daniel as writing that with the coming of the Archangel Michael, misery would beset the world, and only those whose names were in a divine book would be resurrected. Moreover, Daniel&#x27;s promise of resurrection was intended only for the most righteous and the most sinful because the afterlife was a place for the virtuous individuals to be rewarded and the sinful individuals to receive eternal punishment.

Greek and Persian culture influenced Jewish sects to believe in an afterlife between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segal 2004 https://archive.org/details/lifeafterdeathhi00sega_1/page/281 281&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible, at least as seen through interpretation of Bavli Sanhedrin, contains frequent references to resurrection of the dead. The Mishnah (c. 200) lists belief in the resurrection of the dead as one of three essential beliefs necessary for a Jew to participate in it:
In the late Second Temple period, the Pharisees believed in resurrection, while Essenes and Sadducees did not. During the Rabbinic period, beginning in the late first century and carrying on to the present, the works of Daniel were included into the Hebrew Bible, signaling the adoption of Jewish resurrection into the officially sacred texts.

Jewish liturgy, most notably the &quot;Amidah&quot;, contains references to the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead. In contemporary Judaism, both Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism maintain the traditional references to it in their liturgy. However, many Conservative Jews interpret the tenet metaphorically rather than literally. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have altered traditional references to the resurrection of the dead in the liturgy (&quot;who gives life to the dead&quot;) to refer to &quot;who gives life to all&quot;.

===The last judgment===
In Judaism, the day of judgment happens every year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day of judgment for all mankind is disputed. Some rabbis hold that there will be such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that there is no need for that because of Rosh Hashanah. Yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Other rabbis hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.

===In contemporary Judaism===

Irving Greenberg, representing an Open Orthodox viewpoint, describes the afterlife as a central Jewish teaching, deriving from the belief in reward and punishment. According to Greenberg, suffering Medieval Jews emphasized the World to Come as a counterpoint to the difficulties of this life, while early Jewish modernizers portrayed Judaism as interested only in this world as a counterpoint to &quot;otherworldly&quot; Christianity. Greenberg sees each of these views as leading to an undesired extremeoveremphasizing the afterlife leads to asceticism, while devaluing the afterlife deprives Jews of the consolation of eternal life and justiceand calls for a synthesis, in which Jews can work to perfect this world, while also recognizing the immortality of the soul.

Conservative Judaism both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the &quot;Amidah&quot; and Maimonides&#x27; thirteen principles of faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism affirm belief in the afterlife, though they downplay the theological implications in favor of emphasizing the importance of the &quot;here and now&quot;, as opposed to reward and punishment. The Union for Reform Judaism believes the righteous of any faith have a place in heaven but does not believe in a concept of hell.

==Jewish messianism==

The Hebrew word &quot;mashiach&quot; (or &quot;moshiach&quot;) refers to the Jewish idea of the messiah. In biblical times the title &quot;mashiach&quot; was awarded to someone in a high position of nobility and greatness. For example, &quot;Cohen ha-Mašíaḥ&quot; means High Priest. While the name of the Jewish Messiah is considered to be one of the things that precede creation, he is not considered divine, in contrast to Christianity where Jesus is both divine and the Messiah.

In the Talmudic era the title &quot;Mashiach&quot; or מלך המשיח, &quot;Méleḵ ha-Mašíaḥ&quot; literally means &quot;the anointed King&quot;. The Messiah is to be a human leader, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule and unite the people of Israel and will usher in the Messianic Age of global and universal peace.

===Early Second Temple period (516 BCE – c.220 BCE)===

Early in the Second Temple period hopes for a better future are described in the Jewish scriptures. After the return from the Babylonian exile, Cyrus the Great was called &quot;messiah&quot; in Isaiah, due to his role in the return of the Jews exiles.

===Later Second Temple period (c.220 BCE – 70 CE)===

A number of messianic ideas developed during the later Second Temple Period, ranging from this-worldy, political expectations, to apocalyptic expectations of an endtime in which the dead would be resurrected and the Kingdom of Heaven would be established on earth. The Messiah might be a kingly &quot;son of David&quot; or a more heavenly &quot;son of man&quot;, but &quot;Messianism became increasingly eschatological, and eschatology was decisively influenced by apocalypticism,&quot; while messianic expectations became increasingly focused on the figure of an individual savior. According to Zwi Werblowsky, &quot;the Messiah no longer symbolized the coming of the new age, but he was somehow supposed to bring it about. The &quot;Lord&#x27;s anointed&quot; thus became the &quot;savior and redeemer&quot; and the focus of more intense expectations and doctrines.&quot; Messianic ideas developed both by new interpretations (&quot;pesher&quot;, &quot;midrash&quot;) of the Jewish scriptures, but also by visionary revelations.

===Talmud===

The Babylonian Talmud (200–500 CE), tractate Sanhedrin, contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah. Throughout their history Jews have compared these passages (and others) to contemporary events in search of signs of the Messiah&#x27;s imminent arrival, continuing into present times.

The Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah, some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from Elijah the Prophet and the Messiah.

===Rabbinic commentaries===

In rabbinic literature, the rabbis elaborated and explained the prophecies that were found in the Hebrew Bible along with the oral law and rabbinic traditions about its meaning.

Maimonides&#x27; commentary to tractate Sanhedrin stresses a relatively naturalistic interpretation of the Messiah, de-emphasizing miraculous elements. His commentary became widely (although not universally) accepted in the non- or less-mystical branches of Orthodox Judaism.

===Contemporary views===
====Orthodox Judaism====
The belief in a human Messiah of the Davidic line is a universal tenet of faith among Orthodox Jews and one of Maimonides&#x27; thirteen principles of faith.

Some authorities in Orthodox Judaism believe that this era will lead to supernatural events culminating in a bodily resurrection of the dead. Maimonides, on the other hand, holds that the events of the Messianic Era are not specifically connected with the resurrection.

====Conservative Judaism====
Conservative Judaism varies in its teachings. While it retains traditional references to a personal redeemer and prayers for the restoration of the Davidic line in the liturgy, Conservative Jews are more inclined to accept the idea of a Messianic Era:

====Reform Judaism====
Reform Judaism generally concurs with the more liberal Conservative perspective of a future Messianic Era rather than a human Messiah.

<doc id="16164" wikidata="Q232024" url="?curid=16164" title="John Macleod (physiologist)">
<text>John James Rickard Macleod, (6 September 1876 – 16 March 1935), was a Scottish biochemist and physiologist. He devoted his career to diverse topics in physiology and biochemistry, but was chiefly interested in carbohydrate metabolism. He is noted for his role in the discovery and isolation of insulin during his tenure as a lecturer at the University of Toronto, for which he and Frederick Banting received the 1923 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. Awarding the prize to Macleod was controversial at the time, because according to Banting&#x27;s version of events, Macleod&#x27;s role in the discovery was negligible. It was not until decades after the events that an independent review acknowledged a far greater role than was attributed to him at first.

==Biography==
Macleod was born in Clunie, near Dunkeld in Perthshire. Soon after he was born, his father Robert Macleod, a minister of the Free Church, was transferred to Aberdeen, where John attended Aberdeen Grammar School and enrolled in the study of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. At the University of Aberdeen, one of MacLeod&#x27;s principal teachers was the young professor John Alexander MacWilliam. He was awarded his medical degree with honours in 1898 and then spent a year studying biochemistry at the University of Leipzig, Germany, on a travelling scholarship. He became a demonstrator at the London Hospital Medical School, where in 1902 he was appointed lecturer in biochemistry. In the same year, he was awarded a doctorate in public health from Cambridge University. Around that time he published his first research article, a paper on phosphorus content in muscles.

In 1903, Macleod became a lecturer in physiology at the Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained for 15 years. This was the period when he developed an interest in carbohydrate metabolism that was to last for the rest of his career.

In 1910, he delivered a lecture on various forms of experimental diabetes and their significance for diabetes mellitus at the joint meeting of the section on Pharmacology and Therapeutics and the section on Pathology and Physiology of the American Medical Association.

In 1916, he was a Professor of Physiology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. After the First World War, he went on to teach physiology at the University of Toronto, where he became director of the physiology lab and an assistant to the dean of the medical faculty. He researched various topics in physiology and biochemistry, among which were the chemism of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, electroshocks, creatinine metabolism and blood circulation in the brain. 

In 1905 he became interested in carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes, publishing a series of scientific papers and several monographs on the subject from then on. Additionally, Macleod was a popular lecturer and an influential contributor to the development of the six-year course in medicine at the University of Toronto.

===Frederick Banting and the discovery of insulin===
At the end of 1920, Macleod was approached by Frederick Banting, a young Canadian physician who had the idea of curing diabetes using an extract from a pancreas whose functioning had been disrupted. Macleod was not enthusiastic, because (unlike Banting) he knew about unsuccessful experiments in this direction by other researchers. He thought it more likely that the nervous system had a crucial role in regulating blood glucose concentration. Even though Banting had virtually no experience of physiology, he managed to convince Macleod to lend him laboratory space during a holiday in Scotland that summer. In addition to the laboratory, Macleod provided experimental animals and his student Charles Best, who worked as a demonstrator. Macleod also advised on project planning and the use of analytical techniques, and assisted with the operation on the first dog. While Macleod was away, Banting and Best achieved a breakthrough: they isolated an internal secretion of the pancreas and succeeded in reducing the blood sugar level of another dog, whose pancreas had been surgically removed.

On his return, Macleod was surprised and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod&#x27;s instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting came to believe that he wanted to take all the credit. This was exemplified by a December 1921 presentation to the American Physiological Society at Yale, which took a toll on Banting&#x27;s nerves due to the &quot;prestige of the audience&quot; causing him to freeze up, and as a result the &quot;audience was highly critical of the findings presented&quot;. Macleod who was &quot;desperate to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat&quot; stepped in and finished the presentation. From Banting&#x27;s viewpoint, &quot;this was a brazen coup by Macleod to rob him of the credit for having discovered insulin – and to rub salt into the wound, it had been done in front of the most eminent doctors in the field&quot;.

Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of &quot;The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine&quot;. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting&#x27;s and Best&#x27;s work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.

The first human clinical trial was unsuccessful. Banting was insufficiently qualified to participate and felt sidelined. By the winter of 1922, he was certain that all Macleod&#x27;s colleagues were conspiring against him. There was a reported physical altercation between Banting and Collip, as Banting saw Collip&#x27;s breakthrough on alcohol purification as a threat, while Collip was reluctant to share the details. Collip threatened to leave because of the strained atmosphere but the encouragement of others who saw the potential of their research prevented escalation of the conflict. In January 1922, the team performed the first successful clinical trial, on 13-year-old Leonard Thompson, and it was soon followed by others.

Although all the team members were listed as co-authors of their publications, Banting still felt overlooked, because Macleod took over the coordination of clinical trials and the acquisition of larger amounts of extract. Macleod&#x27;s presentation at a meeting of the Association of American Physicians in Washington, D.C., on 3 May 1922 received a standing ovation, but Banting and Best refused to participate in protest. At that time, demonstrations of the method&#x27;s efficiency drew huge public interest, because the effect on patients, especially children, who until then were bound to die, seemed almost miraculous. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly &amp; Co. took over mass production, but without an exclusive license, as the patent was transferred to the Medical Research Council to prevent exploitation.

In the summer of 1923 Macleod resumed other research. He took interest in teleost fish, which have separate regions of islet and acinar tissue in their pancreas. Working at the Marine Biological Station in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, he made extracts from each of those parts separately and proved that insulin is derived from the insular and not the acinar tissue of the pancreas. Meanwhile, Banting remained in Toronto and relationships soon deteriorated again because of conflicting press accounts. Banting eventually started to claim that he deserved all the credit and that Macleod had only hindered him the whole time and had made no contribution other than to leave the keys to the laboratory when he went on vacation. MacLeod wrote a report on the discovery in 1922 to explain his side of the story, but otherwise refrained from active involvement in controversy about credit. Banting hated him passionately, and the two never spoke again. When Macleod left the University of Toronto in 1928, Banting harbored such enmity that he refused to attend the farewell dinner for Macleod.

===Later years===
Macleod returned to Scotland in 1928 to become Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen (in succession to his former teacher, John Alexander MacWilliam who retired in 1927) and later Dean of the University of Aberdeen Medical Faculty. Between 1929 and 1933 he was also a member of the Medical Research Council.

Macleod did not continue to work on insulin, but he remained active as a researcher, lecturer and author. His last major contribution was a proof that the central nervous system does have an important role in maintaining carbohydrate metabolism balance, as was his original hypothesis. His theory about conversion of fats into carbohydrates remained unproven, despite his provision of several indirect proofs. He devoted his spare time to golf, motorcycling and painting. 

He was married to Mary W. McWalter, but they never had children. He died in 1935 in Aberdeen after several years of suffering from arthritis, despite which he remained active almost until his death. In 1933 he made a lecture tour of the US, and in 1934 he published the 7th edition of his book &quot;Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine&quot;.

==Works==
Macleod was a prolific writer. His first academic article was a paper on phosphorus content in muscles published in 1899. During his career he authored or co-authored over 200 papers and eleven books. Among them are:

* &quot;Practical Physiology&quot; (1903)
* &quot;Recent Advances in Physiology&quot; (with Leonard E. Hill, 1905)
* &quot;Diabetes: its Pathological Physiology&quot; (1913)
* &quot;Physiology for dental students&quot; (with R. G. Pearce, 1915)
* &quot;Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine&quot; (1st edition 1918)
* &quot;Insulin and its Use in Diabetes&quot; (with W. R. Campbell, 1925)
* &quot;Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin&quot; (1926)
* &quot;The Fuel of life: Experimental Studies in Normal and Diabetic Animals&quot; (1928)

==Awards and honours==
John Macleod was a distinguished physiologist even before the discovery of insulin. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1919 and president of American Physiological Society in 1921. In 1923, Macleod was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. Among the recognitions he received after 1923 were memberships of the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, corresponding membership of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and honorary membership of the Regia Accademia Medica.

After Banting&#x27;s death in a plane crash in 1941, Best, with the help of his friends, continued to spread Banting&#x27;s account of the discovery and tried to &quot;write out&quot; Macleod and Collip from the history books. Only in 1950 was the first independent revision of all sides of the story made, and it gave credit to all four members of the team. However, Macleod&#x27;s public image remained tainted for decades after that. The 1976 ITV television drama &quot;Comets Among the Stars&quot;, with Ralph Richardson in the Macleod role, portrayed him as dark and repulsive. The second dramatization of the discovery, &quot;Glory Enough for All&quot; (1988), at last portrayed him more objectively. By then it was commonly accepted that Banting&#x27;s and Best&#x27;s story was distorted, since more documentation had been made publicly available, and it made a precise reconstruction of the events possible. Until Best died, this documentation had been kept secret for over 50 years by the University of Toronto, whose administration wanted to avoid fueling the controversy.

Macleod&#x27;s reputation in Canada remained under the influence of Banting and Best&#x27;s story for decades, so Macleod was not esteemed there. It was only in the 1980s that it became commonly accepted that Banting&#x27;s and Best&#x27;s story was distorted, since more documentation had been made publicly available, and it made a precise reconstruction of the events possible. Until Best died, this documentation had been kept secret for over 50 years by the University of Toronto, whose administration wanted to avoid fuelling the controversy. Macleod&#x27;s contribution to science is now recognized by the broad public, even in Canada. The auditorium of the Toronto University Medical Research Centre was named in his honour, as was Diabetes UK&#x27;s award for patients who survive for 70 years with diabetes. In 2012, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

===Nobel Prize===
The Nobel Committee reacted almost immediately to the first successful clinical trials. In the autumn of 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, even though the long-term importance of the discovery was not yet apparent. They were nominated by the Danish physiologist and Nobel laureate August Krogh, who had a diabetic wife and had visited Macleod&#x27;s laboratory and taken the method back to Denmark. Banting &quot;had well-placed friends in Toronto&quot; and &quot;knowing that a Nobel Prize might well be awarded for insulin, they worked very hard to have Banting honoured, at home and abroad, as the discoverer of insulin&quot;. However, &quot;among experienced scientists there was more support for the view that Banting and Best’s somewhat fumbling researches would not have reached the goal without the contributions of both Macleod and Collip&quot;. The committee judged that Macleod&#x27;s work in interpreting the data, managing the clinical trials and providing a high level of public presentation were crucial for success, and &quot;concluded that Banting would not have found the way to insulin without the guidance of Macleod&quot;, so they awarded the Nobel prize to both. Banting was furious, as he was convinced that Best should have received the other half, and he even thought of rejecting the prize. He was finally persuaded to accept it but gave half of his prize money to Best. Macleod in turn gave half of his to Collip. In 1972 the Nobel Foundation officially conceded that omitting Best was a mistake.

A second controversial aspect of the award was the fact that eight months before Banting&#x27;s and Best&#x27;s paper, the Romanian physiologist Nicolae Paulescu had reported the discovery of a pancreas extract that he dubbed &quot;pancrein&quot;, which lowered blood glucose concentration. Banting and Best even cited him in their paper, but misinterpreted his findings, purportedly because of an error in translation from French. Best publicly apologized for that mistake many years later.

<doc id="16167" wikidata="Q28198" url="?curid=16167" title="Jackson, Mississippi">
<text>Jackson is the capital of and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Mississippi. Along with Raymond, Jackson is one of two county seats for Hinds County. The city had a population of 153,701 at the 2020 census, a significant decline from 173,514, or 11.42%, since the 2010 census, representing the largest decline in population during the decade of any major U.S. city. Jackson is the anchor for the Jackson metropolitan statistical area, the largest metropolitan area located entirely in the state and the tenth-largest urban area in the Deep South. With a 2020 population of nearly 600,000, metropolitan Jackson is home to over one-fifth of Mississippi&#x27;s population. The city sits on the Pearl River and is located in the greater Jackson Prairie region of Mississippi. Jackson is the only city in Mississippi with a population exceeding 100,000 people.

Founded in 1821 as new state capital for Mississippi, Jackson is named after General Andrew Jackson, a war hero in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812 and subsequently the seventh U.S. president. Following the Battle of Vicksburg, which was fought near Jackson during the American Civil War in 1863, Union forces commanded by General William Tecumseh Sherman launched the siege of Jackson and set the city on fire.

During the 1920s, Jackson surpassed Meridian to become the most populous city in the state following a speculative natural gas boom in the region. The current slogan for the city is &quot;The City with Soul&quot;. It has had numerous musicians prominent in blues, gospel, folk, and jazz. The city is located in the deep south halfway between Memphis and New Orleans on Interstate 55 and Dallas and Atlanta on Interstate 20.

The city has a number of museums and cultural institutions, including the Mississippi Children&#x27;s Museum, Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, Mississippi Museum of Art, Old Capital Museum, Museum of Mississippi History. Other notable locations are the Mississippi Coliseum and the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, home of the Jackson State Tigers football team.

In 2020, the Jackson metropolitan area held a GDP of 30 billion dollars, accounting for 29% of the state&#x27;s total GDP of 104.1 billion dollars.

==History==

===Founding and antebellum period (to 1860)===
The Jackson area was historically populated by the Choctaw, the majority of whom were forcibly removed to Oklahoma following Andrew Jackson&#x27;s signing of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. Located on the historic Natchez Trace trade route, the Choctaw town that stood where Jackson is today was called , meaning &quot;Among the post oaks.&quot; The city&#x27;s first European American settler was Louis LeFleur, a French-Canadian trader. The village became known as LeFleur&#x27;s Bluff. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, this site had a trading post. It was connected to markets in Tennessee. Soldiers returning to Tennessee from the military campaigns near New Orleans in 1815 built a public road that connected Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana to this district. A United States treaty with the Choctaw, the Treaty of Doak&#x27;s Stand in 1820, formally opened the area for non-Native American settlers.

LeFleur&#x27;s Bluff was developed when it was chosen as the site for the new state&#x27;s capital city. The Mississippi General Assembly decided in 1821 that the state needed a centrally located capital (the legislature was then located in Natchez). They commissioned Thomas Hinds, James Patton, and William Lattimore to look for a suitable site. The absolute center of the state was a swamp, so the group had to widen their search.

After surveying areas north and east of Jackson, they proceeded southwest along with the Pearl River until they reached LeFleur&#x27;s Bluff in today&#x27;s Hinds County. Their report to the General Assembly stated that this location had beautiful and healthful surroundings, good water, abundant timber, navigable waters, and proximity to the Natchez Trace. The Assembly passed an act on November 28, 1821, authorizing the site as the permanent seat of the government of the state of Mississippi. On the same day, it passed a resolution to instruct the Washington delegation to press Congress for a donation of public lands on the river for improved navigation to the Gulf of Mexico. One Whig politician lamented the new capital as a &quot;serious violation of principle&quot; because it was not at the absolute center of the state.

The capital was named for General Andrew Jackson, to honor his January 1815 victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. He was later elected as the seventh president of the United States.

The city of Jackson was originally planned, in April 1822, by Peter Aaron Van Dorn in a &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern advocated by Thomas Jefferson. City blocks alternated with parks and other open spaces. Over time, many of the park squares have been developed rather than maintained as green space. The state legislature first met in Jackson on December 23, 1822. In 1839, the Mississippi Legislature passed the first state law in the U.S. to permit married women to own and administer their own property.

Jackson was connected by public road to Vicksburg and Clinton in 1826. Jackson was first connected by railroad to other cities in 1840. An 1844 map shows Jackson linked by an east–west rail line running between Vicksburg, Raymond, and Brandon. Unlike Vicksburg, Greenville, and Natchez, Jackson is not located on the Mississippi River, and it did not develop during the antebellum era as those cities did from major river commerce. The construction of railroad lines to the city sparked its growth in the decades following the American Civil War.

===American Civil War===

Despite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the Confederacy. In 1863, during the military campaign which ended in the capture of Vicksburg, Union forces captured Jackson during two battles—once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.

On May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first Battle of Jackson, forcing Confederate forces to flee northward towards Canton. On May 14, Union troops under the command of William Tecumseh Sherman burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the Confederacy. After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the Battle of Champion Hill in nearby Edwards. The Union forces began their siege of Vicksburg soon after their victory at Champion Hill. Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the siege. The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive fortifications encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.

Confederate forces marched out of Jackson in early July 1863 to break the siege of Vicksburg. But, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863. General Ulysses S. Grant dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated into Jackson. Union forces began the siege of Jackson, which lasted for approximately one week. Union forces encircled the city and began an artillery bombardment. One of the Union artillery emplacements has been preserved on the grounds of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. John C. Breckinridge, former United States vice president, served as one of the Confederate generals defending Jackson. On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.

Union forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time. The city was called &quot;Chimneyville&quot; because only the chimneys of houses were left standing. The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as Fortification Street.

Because of the siege and following destruction, few antebellum structures have survived in Jackson. The Governor&#x27;s Mansion, built in 1842, served as Sherman&#x27;s headquarters and has been preserved. Another is the Old Capitol building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of secession from the Union there on January 9, 1861, becoming the second state to secede from the United States. The Jackson City Hall, built in 1846 for less than $8,000, also survived. It is said that Sherman, a Mason, spared it because it housed a Masonic Lodge, though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.

===Reconstruction===
During Reconstruction, African Americans were granted civil rights. Schools were established and African Americans held political offices. Eugene Welborne, Charles Reese, Weldon Hicks, and George Caldwell Granberry were among the legislators who represented Hinds County in the legislature. African Americans also served in local offices, as judges, and as marshalls.

Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain white supremacy. Jackson&#x27;s appointed mayor Joseph G. Crane was stabbed to death in 1869. The assailant, Edward M. Yerger, was arrested by military authorities but, after a U.S. Supreme Court case (Ex parte Yerger), he was bonded out, moved to Baltimore and was never tried.

The economic recovery from the Civil War was slow through the start of the 20th century, but there were some developments in transportation. In 1871, the city introduced mule-drawn streetcars which ran on State Street, which were replaced by electric ones in 1899. In 1875, the Red Shirts were formed, one of the second waves of insurgent paramilitary organizations that essentially operated as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party&quot; to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive black people from the polls (Mississippi Plan).

===Post-Reconstruction===
Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced Mississippi&#x27;s Constitution of 1890, was held at the capitol. This was the first of new constitutions or amendments ratified in each Southern state through 1908 that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites, through provisions making voter registration more difficult: such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests. These provisions survived a Supreme Court challenge in 1898. As 20th-century Supreme Court decisions later ruled such provisions were unconstitutional, Mississippi and other Southern states rapidly devised new methods to continue disfranchisement of most black people, who comprised a majority in the state until the 1930s. Their exclusion from politics was maintained into the late 1960s.

The so-called New Capitol replaced the older structure upon its completion in 1903. Today the Old Capitol is operated as a historical museum.

===Early 20th century (1901–1960)===


Author Eudora Welty was born in Jackson in 1909, lived most of her life in the Belhaven section of the city, and died there in 2001. Her memoir of development as a writer, &quot;One Writer&#x27;s Beginnings&quot; (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early 20th century. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel, &quot;The Optimist&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; and is best known for her novels and short stories. The main library of the Jackson/Hinds Library System was named in her honor, and her home has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

Richard Wright, a highly acclaimed African-American author, lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s. He related his experience in his memoir &quot;Black Boy&quot; (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and Northern ghettos such as Chicago under segregation in the early 20th century.

Jackson had significant growth in the early 20th century, which produced dramatic changes in the city&#x27;s skyline. Jackson&#x27;s new Union Station downtown reflected the city&#x27;s service by multiple rail lines, including the Illinois Central.

Across the street, the new, luxurious King Edward Hotel opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect William T. Nolan. It became a center for prestigious events held by Jackson society and Mississippi politicians. Nearby, the 18-story Standard Life Building, designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion.

Jackson&#x27;s economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of natural gas fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state&#x27;s insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state&#x27;s property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.

Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo stated:

This enthusiasm was subdued when the first wells failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success. The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of saltwater, which lessened the quality. The governor&#x27;s prediction was wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry did provide an economic boost for the city and state. The effects of the Great Depression were mitigated by the industry&#x27;s success. At its height in 1934, there were 113 producing wells in the state. The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.

Due to provisions in the federal Rivers and Harbors Act, on October 25, 1930, city leaders met with U.S. Army engineers to ask for federal help to alleviate Jackson flooding. J.J. Halbert, city engineer, proposed a straightening and dredging of the Pearl River below Jackson.

====Jackson&#x27;s Gold Coast====
During Mississippi&#x27;s extended Prohibition period, from the 1920s until the 1960s, illegal drinking and gambling casinos flourished on the east side of the Pearl River, in Flowood along with the original U.S. Route 80 just across from the city of Jackson. Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly black-market businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.

The Gold Coast declined and businesses disappeared after Mississippi&#x27;s prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go &quot;wet&quot;. In addition, integration drew off business from establishments that earlier had catered to African Americans, such as the Summers Hotel. When it opened in 1943 on Pearl Street, it was one of two hotels in the city that served black clients. For years its Subway Lounge was a prime performance spot for black musicians playing jazz and blues.

In another major change, in 1990 the state-approved gaming on riverboats. Numerous casinos have been developed on riverboats, mostly in Mississippi Delta towns such as Tunica Resorts, Greenville, and Vicksburg, as well as Biloxi on the Gulf Coast. Before the damage and losses due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the state ranked second nationally in gambling revenues.

====World War II and later development====
During World War II, Hawkins Field (at that time, also known as the Jackson Army Airbase) the American 21st, 309th, and 310th Bomber Groups that were stationed at the base were re-deployed for combat. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands and the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies, between 688 and 800 members of the Dutch Airforce escaped to the UK or Australia for training and, out of necessity, were eventually given permission by the United States to make use of Hawkins Field.

From May 1942 until the end of the war, all Dutch military aircrews trained at the base and went on to serve in either the British or Australian Air Forces.

In 1949, the poet Margaret Walker began teaching at Jackson State University, a historically black college. She taught there until 1979 and founded the university&#x27;s Center for African-American Studies. Her poetry collection won a Yale Younger Poets Prize. Her second novel, &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She has influenced many younger writers.

===Civil rights movement in Jackson===
The civil rights movement had been active for decades, particularly mounting legal challenges to Mississippi&#x27;s constitution and laws that disfranchised black people. Beginning in 1960, Jackson as the state capital became the site for dramatic non-violent protests in a new phase of activism that brought in a wide variety of participants in the performance of mass demonstrations.

In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Jackson&#x27;s population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black. At the time, public facilities were segregated and Jim Crow was in effect. Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began when nine Tougaloo College students tried to read books in the &quot;white only&quot; public library and were arrested. Founded as a historically black college (HBCU) by the American Missionary Association after the Civil War, Tougaloo College helped organize both black and white students of the region to work together for civil rights. It created partnerships with the neighboring mostly white Millsaps College to work with student activists. It has been recognized as a site on the &quot;Civil Rights Trail&quot; by the National Park Service.

The mass demonstrations of the 1960s were initiated with the arrival of more than 300 Freedom Riders on May 24, 1961. They were arrested in Jackson for disturbing the peace after they disembarked from their interstate buses. The interracial teams rode the buses from Washington, D.C., and sat together to demonstrate against segregation on public transportation, as the Constitution provides for unrestricted public transportation. Although the Freedom Riders had intended New Orleans as their final destination, Jackson was the farthest that any managed to travel. New participants kept joining the movement, as they intended to fill the jails in Jackson with their protest. The riders had encountered extreme violence along the way, including a bus burning and physical assaults. They attracted national media attention to the struggle for constitutional rights.

After the Freedom Rides, students and activists of the Freedom Movement launched a series of merchant boycotts, sit-ins and protest marches, from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers. For instance, at the time, department stores did not hire black salesclerks or allow black customers to use their fitting rooms to try on clothes, or lunch counters for meals while in the store, but they wanted them to shop in their stores.

In Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers, civil rights activist and leader of the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP, was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist associated with the White Citizens&#x27; Council. Thousands marched in Evers&#x27; funeral procession to protest the killing. Two trials at the time both resulted in hung juries. A portion of U.S. Highway 49, all of Delta Drive, a library, the central post office for the city, and Jackson–Evers International Airport were named in honor of Medgar Evers. In 1994, prosecutors Ed Peters and Bobby DeLaughter finally obtained a murder conviction in a state trial of De La Beckwith based on new evidence.

During 1963 and 1964, civil rights organizers gathered residents for voter education and voter registration. Black people had been essentially disfranchised since 1890. In a pilot project in 1963, activists rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote. In 1964 they created the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party as an alternative to the all-white state Democratic Party, and sent an alternate slate of candidates to the national Democratic Party convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that year.

Segregation and the disfranchisement of African Americans gradually ended after the Civil Rights Movement gained Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In June 1966, Jackson was the terminus of the James Meredith March, organized by James Meredith, the first African American to enroll at the University of Mississippi. The march, which began in Memphis, Tennessee, was an attempt to garner support for full implementation of civil rights in practice, following the legislation. It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper&#x27;s bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.

In September 1967 a Ku Klux Klan chapter bombed the synagogue of the Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson, and in November bombed the house of its rabbi, Dr. Perry Nussbaum. He and his congregation had supported civil rights.

Gradually the old barriers came down. Since that period, both whites and Black Americans in the state have had a consistently high rate of voter registration and turnout. Following the decades of the Great Migration, when more than one million black people left the rural South, since the 1930s the state has been majority white in total population. African Americans are a majority in the city of Jackson, although the metropolitan area is majority white. African Americans are also a majority in several cities and counties of the Mississippi Delta, which are included in the 2nd congressional district. The other three congressional districts are majority white.

===Mid-1960s to present===
The first successful cadaveric lung transplant was performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson in June 1963 by Dr. James Hardy. Hardy transplanted the cadaveric lung into a patient suffering from lung cancer. The patient survived for eighteen days before dying of kidney failure.

In 1966 it was estimated that recurring flood damage at Jackson from the Pearl River averaged nearly a million dollars per year. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spent $6.8 million on levees and a new channel in 1966 before the project completion to prevent a flood equal to the December 1961 event plus an additional foot.

Since 1968, Jackson has been the home of Malaco Records, one of the leading record companies for gospel, blues, and soul music in the United States. In January 1973, Paul Simon recorded the songs &quot;Learn How to Fall&quot; and &quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot;, found on the album &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot;, in Jackson at the Malaco Recording Studios. Many well-known Southern artists recorded on the album, including the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, Roger Hawkins, Barry Beckett), Carson Whitsett, the Onward Brass Band from New Orleans, and others. The label has recorded many leading soul and blues artists, including Bobby Bland, ZZ Hill, Latimore, Shirley Brown, Denise LaSalle, and Tyrone Davis.

On May 15, 1970, Jackson police killed two students and wounded twelve at Jackson State College after a protest of the Vietnam War included students&#x27; overturning and burning some cars. These killings occurred eleven days after the National Guard killed four students in an anti-war protest at Kent State University in Ohio, and were part of national social unrest. &quot;Newsweek&quot; cited the Jackson State killings in its issue of May 18 when it suggested that U.S. President Richard Nixon faced a new home front.

The influx of illegal drugs occurred nationally as smugglers used the highways, seaports, and airports of the Gulf region. The 1980s in Jackson were dominated by Mayor Dale Danks Jr. until he was unseated by lawyer and legislator J. Kane Ditto, who criticized the deficit funding and the politicized police department of the city. Federal investigations of drug trafficking at Jackson&#x27;s Hawkins Field airport were a part of the &quot;Kerry Report,&quot; the 1986 U.S. Senate investigation of public corruption and foreign relations.

As Jackson has become the medical and legal center of the state, it has attracted Jewish professionals in both fields. Since the late 20th century, it has developed the largest Jewish community in the state.

In 1997, Harvey Johnson, Jr. was elected as Jackson&#x27;s first African-American mayor. During his term, he proposed the development of a convention center to attract more business to the city. In 2004, during his second term, 66 percent of the voters passed a referendum for a tax to build the Convention Center.

Mayor Johnson was replaced by Frank Melton on July 4, 2005. Melton generated controversy through his unconventional behavior, which included acting as a law enforcement officer. A dramatic spike in crime ensued during his term, despite Melton&#x27;s efforts to reduce crime. The lack of jobs contributed to climb. In 2006 a young African-American businessman, Starsky Darnell Redd, was convicted of money laundering in federal court along with his mother, other associates, and Billy Tucker, the former airport security chief.

In 2007, Hinds County sheriff Malcolm McMillin was appointed as the new police chief in Jackson, setting a historic precedent. McMillin was both the county sheriff and city police chief until 2009, when he stepped down due to disagreements with the mayor. Mayor Frank Melton died in May 2009, and City Councilman Leslie McLemore served as acting mayor of Jackson until July 2009, when former Mayor Harvey Johnson was elected and assumed the position.

On June 26, 2011, 49-year-old James Craig Anderson was killed in Jackson after being beaten, robbed, and run over by a group of white teenagers. The district attorney described it as a &quot;hate crime&quot;, and the FBI investigated it as a civil rights violation.

On March 18, 2013, a severe hailstorm hit the Jackson metro area. The hail caused major damage to roofs, vehicles, and building siding. Hail ranged in size from golfball to softball. There were more than 40,000 hailstorm claims of homeowner and automobile damage.

In 2013, Jackson was named as one of the top 10 friendliest cities in the United States by &quot;CN Traveler&quot;. The capital city was tied with Natchez as Number 7. The city was noticed for friendly people, great food, and green and pretty public places.

On July 1, 2013, Chokwe Lumumba was sworn into office as mayor of the city. After eight months in office, Lumumba died on February 25, 2014. Lumumba was a popular yet controversial figure due to his prior membership in the Republic of New Afrika, as well as being a co-founder of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America.

Lumumba&#x27;s son, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, ran for the mayoral seat following his father&#x27;s death, but lost to Councillor Tony Yarber on April 22, 2014. In 2017, however, Chokwe Antar Lumumba ran for mayor again, and won. Following his victory, on June 26 he was interviewed by Amy Goodman on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, at which time he declared a commitment to make Jackson the &quot;Most Radical City on the Planet&quot;.

For several years, the city water supply failed to meet federal drinking water standards and was subject to many boil water orders in 2021 and 2022. Due to deteriorating water infrastructure, some parts of the city experienced low water pressure, and in some neighborhoods residents reported untreated sewage flowing in city streets. In August 2022, Jackson lost access to water when its largest water treatment plant failed, leaving tap water untreated.

==Geography==

The city of Jackson is located primarily in northeastern Hinds County. Jackson also includes around 3,000 acres (12.1 km2) in Rankin County comprising Jackson-Medgar Evers International Airport and a small portion of Madison County. The Pearl River forms most of the eastern border of the city. A small portion of the city containing Tougaloo College is the portion of Jackson that lies in Madison County, bounded on the west by Interstate 220 and on the east by the U.S. Route 51 and Interstate 55. In the 2010 census, only 622 of the city&#x27;s residents lived in Madison County, and only 1 lived within the city limits in Rankin County. The city is bordered to the north by Ridgeland in Madison County, to the northeast by Ross Barnett Reservoir on the Pearl River, to the east by Flowood and Richland in Rankin County, to the south by Byram in Hinds County, and to the west by Clinton in Hinds County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.94% of the total, are water.

=== Cityscape ===

Downtown Jackson is situated directly on the banks of the Pearl River. The downtown district has direct connections to both Interstate 55 via Pearl Street and Pasagoula Street and Interstate 20 via State Street (US 51). Much of the downtown was constructed before the 1980s and only small additions to the skyline have been made since then.

===Geology===
For the most part, Jackson is built on acidic, variably drained silt loam soil. Loess forms the topsoil in western sections, where the Loring soil series is common. The Tippo series, also a silt loam, is found in the central flood plain. Farther east, common soil series include Guyton silt loam, Providence silt loam and Smithdale fine sandy loam.

Jackson sits atop the extinct Jackson Volcano, located underground. It is the only capital city in the United States to have this feature. The buried peak of the volcano is located directly below the Mississippi Coliseum. The municipality is drained on the west by tributaries of the Big Black River and on the east by the Pearl River, which is higher than the Big Black near Canton. The artesian groundwater flow is not as extensive in Jackson for this reason. The first large-scale well was drilled in the city in 1896, and the city water supply has relied on surface water resources.

===Climate===
Jackson is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). Rain occurs throughout the year, though the winter and spring are the wettest seasons, while September and October are usually the driest months. Snow is rare, and accumulation very seldom lasts more than a day. Average annual precipitation is , see climate table. Much of Jackson&#x27;s rainfall occurs during thunderstorms. Thunder is heard on roughly 70 days each year. Jackson lies in a region prone to severe thunderstorms which can produce large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. Among the most notable tornado events was the F5 Candlestick Park tornado on March 3, 1966, which destroyed the shopping center of the same name and surrounding businesses and residential areas, killing 19 in South Jackson.

The record low temperature is , set on January 27, 1940, and the record high is , recorded on September 6–7, 1925, July 29, 1930, and August 30, 2000.
==Demographics==
Jackson remained a small town for much of the 19th century. Before the American Civil War, Jackson&#x27;s population remained small, particularly in contrast to the river towns along the commerce-laden Mississippi River. Despite the city&#x27;s status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, excluding slaves, which were not returned separately.

By 1900 the population of Jackson was still less than 8,000. Although it expanded rapidly, during this period Meridian became Mississippi&#x27;s largest city, based on trade, manufacturing, and access to transportation via railroad and highway.

In the early 20th century, Jackson had its largest rates of growth but ranked second to Meridian in Mississippi. By 1944, Jackson&#x27;s population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants, and it became the largest city in the state. For several decades, Jackson had the most thriving business districts and the largest public school system in Mississippi. It achieved its peak population in the 1980 census of more than 200,000 residents in the city. Since 1980, Jackson has declined in population due to several factors while its surrounding suburban population has increased.

===Race and ethnicity===
According to the 2010 census, the racial and ethnic makeup of the city was predominantly Black and African American, and non-Hispanic white; in 2020, they remained the largest racial and ethnic composition for the city. This Hispanic or Latino population is the fastest growing racial and ethnic group in the city.

=== Income ===
According to census statistics in 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $30,414, and the median income for a family was $36,003. Males had a median income of $29,166 versus $23,328 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,116. About 19.6% of families and 23.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.7% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over. At the publication of the 2020 American Community Survey, the city&#x27;s median household income increased to $35,070; families had a median income of $44,348, married-couple families $74,893, and non-families $22,061.

=== Crime ===
High criminal activity, particularly the homicide rate, is a major reoccurring issue in the city. Crime has had a negative impact on the city&#x27;s economy and population. Most parts of Jackson are considered a food desert because important grocery stores and restaurants have closed down or left the city as theft and other crimes have worsened since 2000.

In 2020, the city&#x27;s homicide rate reached its highest in history with 79.69 homicides per 100,000 residents, with a total of 128 homicides. Of major U.S. cities, only St. Louis surpassed Jackson&#x27;s homicide rate. The homicide rate in 2020 represented a significant spike after years of declining homicide rates in the early 2000s. Property crime remains much lower than in the 1990s and overall violent crime has not increased as significantly as homicide in recent years and is below the peak in 1994 as of 2020.

In 2021, a record number of homicides (160) were recorded, and at a rate of 104 per 100,000 was the highest in the United States. In late 2020, Police Chief James Davis along with the Mayor and other city leaders unveiled the virtual policing concept. After months of struggling to move the concept forward, Chief Davis began discussions with Eric B. Fox, a veteran Jackson Police Officer to return to the department. Fox returned officially in January 2022, and launched a new concept, the Real Time Command Center.

Also in 2021, the Jackson Police Department stated that the city had a serious street gang problem which is a major contributor to violent crimes. The city has had a gang presence since the 1980s but it has seemingly grown over the years. Several gangs from Chicago have settled in the city and are heavily involved in drug-selling territory wars and many other crimes.

In 2022, for the second year in a row Jackson had the highest homicide rate per capita in the United States, with the city reporting a total of 138 murders giving the city a slightly lower homicide rate of 89.8 per 100,000.

In 2023, Jackson murders dropped by 15% with 118 homicides being reported but the city still had the nation&#x27;s highest homicide rate per capita with 78.8 per 100,000 residents. In 2023, Mayor Lumumba announced the opening of the Jackson Crime Center which is a facility that houses monitoring cameras strategically placed around the city to better identify criminals so they can be held accountable for their actions. The Jackson Police Department is short-staffed so the center will help the department as they work to increase recruitment and retention. 

In February 2024, Governor Reeves announced a new and tougher plan to lower rampant crime in the city and protect innocent residents.

==Economy==
Jackson is home to several major industries; these include electrical equipment and machinery, processed food, and primary and fabricated metal products. The surrounding area supports the agricultural development of livestock, soybeans, cotton, and poultry.

According to the city&#x27;s government, Jackson&#x27;s top three employers are the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson Public Schools, and Nissan North America as of 2020. Other notable corporations with a large presence in the city and area include C Spire and Amazon in nearby Madison County.

The city is home to Cooperation Jackson, which is an economic development vehicle for worker-owned cooperative business. The organization has led to the creation of several businesses including lawn care provider The Green Team, organic farm Freedom Farms, print shop The Center for Community Production, and The Balagoon Center, which is a cooperative business incubator.

They will be relocating to Columbus, Georgia. 

==Government and infrastructure==
===Municipal government===
In 1985, Jackson voters opted to replace the three-person mayor-commissioner system with a city council and mayor. This electoral system enables a wider representation of residents on the city council. City council members are elected from each of the city&#x27;s seven wards, considered single-member districts. The mayor is elected at-large citywide.

Jackson&#x27;s mayor is Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D), who was elected on July 3, 2017.
Jackson&#x27;s City Council members are:

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====
Jackson Public School District (JPS) operates 60 public schools. It is one of the largest school districts in the state with about 30,000 students in thirty-eight elementary schools, thirteen middle schools, seven high schools, and two special schools. Jackson Public Schools is the only urban school district in the state.

 the public schools have few children who are middle or upper class, as 99% of the students in JPS qualify for free or reduced school lunches. In 2017 Susan Womack, president of the Parents for Public Schools Jackson (PPSJ) from 2000 to 2012, stated that middle to upper-class families in Jackson tended to leave public school after elementary school, with parents who remained in Jackson enrolling their children in private school, and those who wished to continue enrolling their children in public schools moving to Madison County. The PPSJ decided circa the mid-2000s that it was not feasible to encourage middle and upper-class parents to put their children in JPS schools.

The district&#x27;s high schools include:

* Callaway High School
* Capital City Alternative School
* Career Development Center
* Forest Hill High School
* Jim Hill High School
* Lanier High School
* Murrah High School
* Provine High School

==Infrastructure==
On March 27, 2015, Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency for transportation (potholes) and water infrastructure (breaks in water mains). The quality of Jackson&#x27;s water infrastructure system decreased after the severe winter weather of 2014–2015. Jackson&#x27;s office estimated the cost to fix the roads and water pipes at $750 million to $1 billion.

After issuing the state of emergency, the City of Jackson filed a letter of intent to Department of Health to borrow $2.5 million to repair broken water pipes. The Jackson City Council must approve the mayor&#x27;s proposal. Additionally, Mayor Yarber asked for help from both FEMA and the state Governor&#x27;s office.

Calling for a state of emergency increases the likelihood that the U.S. Department of Transportation would give the city money from a &quot;quick release&quot; funding account.

In late August 2022, the Pearl River overflowed, flooding much of the city and contaminating the water supply. Mayor Lumumba declared a state of emergency and shut down all businesses and schools.

=== Transportation ===
In 2015, 11 percent of the city of Jackson households lacked a car, which decreased to 7.6 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Jackson averaged 1.68 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

Jackson has an increasing number of bicycle lanes.

Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport, the busiest commercial airport in Mississippi, is located east of city in Rankin County between Flowood and Pearl.

Jackson&#x27;s Union Station serves Amtrak&#x27;s daily overnight train, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; from Chicago to New Orleans. The intermodal station also serves Greyhound Lines intercity buses and is the primary station for Jackson&#x27;s municipal buses.

The city is at the intersection of major Interstate and Federal Highways: north-south I-55, US 49, US 51, east–west I-20 and US 80.

=== Major highways ===

* US 51
* US 49
* US 80

==In popular culture==

<doc id="16175" wikidata="Q40715" url="?curid=16175" title="Jennifer Lopez">
<text>Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname J.Lo, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and businesswoman. Lopez is regarded as one of the most influential Latin entertainers of her time, credited with breaking barriers for Latino Americans in Hollywood and helping propel the Latin pop movement in music. She is also noted for her impact on popular culture through fashion, branding, and shifting mainstream beauty standards.

Lopez began her career as a dancer, making her television debut as a Fly Girl on the sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot; in 1991. She later rose to prominence as an actress, with leading roles in the films &quot;Selena&quot; (1997), &quot;Anaconda&quot; (1997) and &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998) establishing her as the highest-paid Latin actress. She successfully ventured into the music industry with her debut album, &quot;On the 6&quot; (1999). In 2001, she became the first woman to simultaneously have the number one album and film in the United States with her second album, &quot;J.Lo&quot;, and romantic comedy &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;. She has since become known for starring in romantic comedies, including &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (2004), and &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; (2005). Lopez released two albums in 2002: &quot;J to tha L–O! The Remixes&quot; and &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot;, the former becoming the first remix album to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Media scrutiny and the failure of her film &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003) preceded a career downturn. Her subsequent albums included &quot;Rebirth&quot; (2005) and &quot;Como Ama una Mujer&quot; (2007); the latter broke first-week sales records for a debut Spanish album. In 2011, Lopez returned to prominence as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; and released the album &quot;Love?&quot;. In the latter 2010s, she embarked on a concert residency titled Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, starred in the police drama series &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; (2016–2018), served as a judge on &quot;World of Dance&quot; (2017–2020), and garnered critical praise for her performance in the crime drama &quot;Hustlers&quot; (2019). She has since produced and starred in the films &quot;Marry Me&quot; (2022), &quot;The Mother&quot; (2023), &quot;This Is Me... Now: A Love Story&quot;, and &quot;Atlas&quot; (both 2024), which were successful on streaming services.

With over 80 million records sold, Lopez&#x27;s most successful singles include: &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny&quot;, &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot;, &quot;All I Have&quot;, &quot;Get Right&quot;, and &quot;On the Floor&quot;. Her accolades include a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. She has been ranked among the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; and the World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women by &quot;Forbes&quot;. Lopez has a large social media following, being one of the most-followed individuals on Instagram. Her other ventures include a lifestyle brand, beauty and fashion lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation.

==Early life==
Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in the Bronx, a borough of New York City, and raised in its Castle Hill neighborhood. Her parents, Guadalupe Rodríguez and David Lopez, were born in Puerto Rico and met in New York City. After serving in the Army, David worked as a computer technician at Guardian Insurance Company. Guadalupe was a homemaker for the first ten years of Lopez&#x27;s life and later worked as a Tupperware salesperson and a kindergarten and gym teacher. They divorced in the 1990s after 33 years of marriage.

Lopez is a middle child; she has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda. The three shared a bedroom. Lopez has described her upbringing as &quot;strict&quot;. She was raised in a Catholic family; she attended Mass every Sunday and received a Catholic education, attending Holy Family School and the all-girls Preston High School, a private school. In school, Lopez ran track on a national level, participated in gymnastics and was on the softball team. She danced in school musicals and played a lead role in a production of &quot;Godspell&quot;. She described herself as a &quot;tomboy&quot; and &quot;very athletic&quot;.

There was &quot;lots of music&quot; in the typically Puerto Rican household, and Lopez and her sisters were encouraged to sing, dance, and create their own plays for family events. &quot;West Side Story&quot; made a particular impression on the young Lopez, who wanted to be an entertainer from an early age. As a teenager, she learned flamenco, jazz, and ballet at the Kips Bay Boys &amp; Girls Club and taught dance to younger students, including Kerry Washington. After graduating from high school, she had a part-time secretarial job at a law firm and studied business at New York&#x27;s Baruch College for one semester. At age 18, she enrolled as a full-time student at Manhattan&#x27;s Phil Black Dance Studio, where she had already taken night classes in jazz and tap dance. Her parents were unhappy with her decision to leave college to pursue a dance career. According to Lopez, her parents felt it was &quot;foolish&quot; because &quot;no Latinas did that&quot;. Her mother asked her to move out of the family home and they stopped speaking for eight months. Lopez moved to Manhattan, sleeping in the dance studio&#x27;s office for the first few months.

== Career ==
===1989–1996: Professional dancing and early acting roles===
Lopez&#x27;s first professional job came in 1989 when she spent five months touring Europe with the musical revue show &quot;Golden Musicals of Broadway&quot;. She was upset at being the only member of the chorus not to have a solo, and later characterized it as a pivotal moment where she had to &quot;try harder and become that much more committed&quot;. In 1990, she danced alongside MC Hammer in an episode of &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, and traveled around Japan for four months as a chorus member in &quot;Synchronicity&quot;. When she returned to the United States, she was hired as a backup dancer for New Kids on the Block&#x27;s performance of &quot;Games&quot; at the 1991 American Music Awards. She also traveled around America with regional productions of the musicals &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. During this period, Lopez also danced in music videos including Doug E. Fresh&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot;, Richard Rogers&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, EPMD&#x27;s &quot;Rampage&quot;, and Samantha Fox&#x27;s &quot;(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!) But the Pants Stay On&quot;. Lopez stated: &quot;I&#x27;d dance in a piece-of-garbage rap or pop video for 50 bucks and make the money last a whole month.&quot;

Her most high-profile job as a professional dancer was as a Fly Girl jazz-funk dancer on the sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot;. The show&#x27;s choreographer, Rosie Perez said she chose Lopez because &quot;she had that look that I knew the audience would tune in to&quot;. Lopez moved to Los Angeles in late 1991 for the job; she filmed &quot;In Living Color&quot; during the day and attended acting classes taught by Aaron Speiser at night. Lopez felt ostracized by the other Fly Girls because of her &quot;voluptuous figure&quot;, and also clashed with Perez. The head of Virgin Records considered signing The Fly Girls as a girl group to rival the Spice Girls, but the deal fell apart. After appearing as a Fly Girl in seasons three and four of &quot;In Living Color&quot;, Lopez left to work as a backup dancer for Janet Jackson, and appeared in the music video for &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot;. She was scheduled to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but opted to pursue an acting career instead. Lopez hired &quot;In Living Color&quot; producer Eric Gold as her manager. He advised Lopez to lose weight if she wanted to succeed as an actress.

Lopez&#x27;s first professional acting job was a small recurring role on the television show &quot;South Central&quot; (1994). She was invited to audition for the pilot by a casting director who had seen her speak to camera during a behind-the-scenes &quot;In Living Color&quot; segment. She then acquired an agent and was cast in the CBS show &quot;Second Chances&quot;; the series was quickly cancelled, but her popularity with viewers led to her being cast in its spin-off &quot;Hotel Malibu&quot;. She subsequently appeared in the television film &quot;Lost in the Wild&quot; (1993). For her first major movie role, in Gregory Nava&#x27;s 1995 drama &quot;Mi Familia&quot;, Lopez received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then starred in the action comedy &quot;Money Train&quot; (1995). The film was not a box office success, though her performance was reviewed positively, which led to her being further noticed in Hollywood. In 1996, Lopez had a supporting role opposite Robin Williams in the comedy &quot;Jack&quot;, which director Francis Ford Coppola cast her in after seeing her performance in &quot;Mi Familia&quot;. She next starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the neo-noir thriller &quot;Blood and Wine&quot; (1996), where David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; felt she delivered in &quot;juggling&quot; the &quot;smoldering and soulful sides&quot; of the character.

===1997–1999: Breakthrough with &quot;Selena&quot; and &quot;On the 6&quot;===
With her casting as the singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez in the biopic &quot;Selena&quot; (1997), Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn $1 million. She described her salary for the film as a &quot;statement to the world&quot;, but expressed disappointment that other Latina actors were not being afforded the same opportunities. Despite having previously worked with the film&#x27;s director Gregory Nava on &quot;Mi Familia&quot;, Lopez participated in an intense auditioning process and spent time with the late singer&#x27;s family in Corpus Christi, Texas before filming began. &quot;Selena&quot; was a box office hit, and Lopez&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described it as &quot;a star-making performance&quot; and wrote: &quot;She has the star presence to look convincing in front of 100,000 fans.&quot; Lopez received her first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. Nava asked the heads of Warner Bros. to fund an Academy Award campaign for Lopez but was told the Academy would &quot;never nominate a Latina.&quot; Later in 1997, Lopez starred opposite Ice Cube in the horror film &quot;Anaconda&quot;, which received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; found the film &quot;silly&quot; but said it deserved &quot;a little credit&quot; for being &quot;the first movie of its kind to have a Latina and an African-American&quot; as its stars. In the crime film &quot;U Turn&quot; (1997), Lopez appeared topless in a sex scene that was added by director Oliver Stone during filming. Speaking in 2003, Lopez said it was not something &quot;I would have chosen to do&quot; and that she and Stone fought over it: &quot;It&#x27;s hard being the only woman on a set.&quot;

Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in the crime caper &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s adaptation of the Elmore Leonard 1996 novel. Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, she won rave reviews for her performance. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as her &quot;best movie role thus far, and she brings it both seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working, pistol-packing bombshell on the page, it couldn&#x27;t be easier here.&quot; Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Lopez as &quot;an actress who can be convincingly tough and devastatingly erotic&quot; and said the film solidified &quot;her position as a woman you can confidently build a film around.&quot; In 2021, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; named Lopez and Clooney&#x27;s partnership as one of the best examples of on-screen chemistry in cinema history. Also in 1998, Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the animated film &quot;Antz&quot;, and ventured into product endorsement, becoming a national spokesperson for Coca-Cola and L&#x27;Oréal.

Lopez decided to pursue a music career after working on &quot;Selena&quot;, realizing that she had missed &quot;the excitement of the stage&quot;. Her new manager Benny Medina sought to position her as &quot;a brand name that will cross over into all media.&quot; Lopez, who was &quot;really feeling [her] Latin roots&quot;, recorded a Spanish-language demo for circulation among prospective labels. With Lopez being a high-profile personality, a bidding war ensued. Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music&#x27;s Work Group, signed her but suggested that she sing in English instead. Her record deal with Sony was described as &quot;lucrative&quot;, having outbid other offers from Capitol Records and EMI Latin. While Lopez worked on her debut album, Sony &quot;began a major push&quot; to feature her with other high-profile entertainers, leading her to appear in the Sean Combs music video &quot;Been Around the World&quot; (1997).

Her debut album, &quot;On the 6&quot; (1999), named after the 6 Subway line which connected her childhood home in the Bronx to Manhattan, was met with positive reviews and further propelled her public profile. The album was a success and Lopez&#x27;s debut single, &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;, topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, with another single, &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, reaching number eight and becoming a celebratory anthem for the new millennium. Other singles from the album included &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot;, which became one of Lopez&#x27;s signature songs, and &quot;No Me Ames&quot;, a duet with future husband Marc Anthony. In July 1999, she performed &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot; at the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup closing ceremony. It was watched by over one billion viewers worldwide, exposing Lopez&#x27;s music career to a larger international audience.

===2000–2002: International success===
In February 2000, Lopez and then-boyfriend Sean Combs attended the Grammy Awards, with Lopez wearing a plunging green Versace silk chiffon dress. The dress generated worldwide attention and became the most popular search query in Google&#x27;s history, leading to the creation of Google Images, while boosting Lopez&#x27;s album and movie ticket sales. Later that year, Lopez starred in the psychological thriller &quot;The Cell&quot;, for which she received a $4 million salary. The film, where Lopez played a psychologist who uses radical experimental therapy to enter the mind of a killer, received mixed reviews but was a box office success. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; remarked that the &quot;imperious&quot; Lopez was &quot;trying to look waifishly expectant&quot; while Amy Taubin of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted that she appeared to be engaged &quot;in some kind of pouting competition&quot; &quot;in lieu of acting.&quot;

Lopez became the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in January 2001, with the release of her second album, &quot;J.Lo&quot;, and her romantic comedy &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;, which co-stars Matthew McConaughey. &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; received highly negative reviews but became a box office success. Jessica Winter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found Lopez miscast as a &quot;buttoned down, celibate&quot; woman in the film. Lopez titled her album &quot;J.Lo&quot; after the nickname which her fans and the media had been increasingly referring to her as. She also adopted J.Lo as her stagename. &quot;J.Lo&quot; received polarized reviews from critics but became the most successful album of her career, selling 12 million copies worldwide. It included the singles &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, which reached number one in various countries, &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot; featuring Ja Rule, which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny&quot;, and &quot;Play&quot;. In support of the album, Lopez performed two-concert residency in Puerto Rico, which was later broadcast in November 2001 as an NBC special, &quot;Jennifer Lopez in Concert&quot;. It was one of the most-watched concert specials of the year in the United States, with an audience of almost 12 million.

In other 2001 work, Lopez launched her first business venture, the clothing line J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez. The line catered to women of all sizes, as Lopez felt &quot;the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored&quot; in the fashion industry. She also founded her production company, Nuyorican Productions, with manager Benny Medina. Her next film was the romantic drama &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, starring opposite Jim Caviezel. Lopez&#x27;s performance was well-reviewed, though the film was a critical and commercial disappointment. She was slated to star alongside Ricky Martin in a remake of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, but this did not eventuate.

Lopez released two albums in 2002. The first was &quot;J to tha L–O! The Remixes&quot;, which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its singles included &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny (Murder Remix)&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Alright&quot;, which reached number one and ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. Lopez&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot;, was released in late 2002, and was heavily influenced by her relationship with then-fiancé Ben Affleck. It received mixed critical reviews; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Michael Paoletta noted the &quot;considerable growth she reveals as a performer and tunesmith&quot; on the album, while Jon Caramanica called it &quot;the least interesting music on the pop charts today.&quot; The album became a commercial success, achieving the highest opening sales week of her career. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot;, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, was viewed as a response to the notion that Lopez had alienated her &quot;core fan base: the black and Hispanic hip-hop community.&quot; The album also spawned the number one single &quot;All I Have&quot;.

Lopez starred as an abused wife who fights back in the thriller &quot;Enough&quot; (2002), a role which required her to learn Krav Maga. An overworked Lopez suffered a nervous breakdown in 2001 while filming it. The film received negative reviews; Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; felt it was &quot;tacky material&quot; and was surprised to see &quot;an actress like Jennifer Lopez&quot; involved with the project. Her next film was the romantic comedy, &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), in which Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes as a maid and single mother from the Bronx. It became the highest-grossing film of her career. Reviewing &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot;, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoyed Lopez as a romantic lead and said &quot;her greatest skill as an actress&quot; was &quot;her ability to melt without cracking the hard shell of composure she wears.&quot; In 2002 business ventures, Lopez opened Madre&#x27;s, a Los Angeles restaurant serving Latin cuisine, and released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It became the top-selling fragrance in the U.S.

===2003–2009: Media scrutiny and career downturn===
Lopez became the subject of widespread media criticism in 2003 due to her public relationship with Ben Affleck and the tabloid depiction of her as a demanding diva. She fired both her personal manager Benny Medina and her publicist in mid-2003; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that movie executives had become frustrated by having their communications with Lopez &quot;largely filtered&quot; through Medina. That year, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy &quot;Gigli&quot;, which was a box-office bomb and is considered one of the worst films of all time. Rex Reed of &quot;The Observer&quot; criticized the lead actors, calling them &quot;pathetically incompetent&quot; in both &quot;craft and talent&quot;. Roger Ebert agreed that the movie &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite work&quot;, but found Lopez and Affleck &quot;appealing in their performances&quot; and noted the couple&#x27;s chemistry. Later in 2003, she released her second fragrance Still Jennifer Lopez, and became the face of Louis Vuitton&#x27;s fall advertising campaign.

Lopez had a minor role opposite Affleck in the film &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; (2004). Following test audiences&#x27; negative reactions to the onscreen couple, her screen time was halved. Lopez later described this as the lowest point of her career and admitted she felt &quot;eviscerated&quot; by the media coverage surrounding &quot;Gigli&quot;: &quot;I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.&quot; Months later, she starred opposite Richard Gere in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, which was a box-office success. Lopez&#x27;s clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004.

The marketing for the romantic comedy &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; (2005), in which Lopez starred opposite Jane Fonda, played up her &quot;&quot;Gigli&quot;-and-tabloid tarnished image&quot;, and it became a box office success. She released her fourth studio album, &quot;Rebirth&quot;, in early 2005. Its title was symbolic of Lopez&#x27;s hopes for &quot;a new professional beginning&quot;. It was recorded during a period where Lopez felt &quot;a little bit lost, trying to get my footing in a new life&quot;, &quot;I had just gotten married [to singer Marc Anthony] ... I wasn&#x27;t with Benny [Medina].&quot; In a review of &quot;Rebirth&quot;, journalist Alexis Petridis remarked that the title &quot;suggests even Lopez has realised that something is amiss with her career ... Despite the highlights, you&#x27;re still left pondering the question: what happened to Jennifer Lopez?&quot; The album reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but failed to replicate the sales of her previous albums. Its lead single, &quot;Get Right&quot;, however, reached number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming one of her most successful songs. Also in 2005, Lopez launched her second fashion label, Sweetface, which was geared towards &quot;high fashion&quot; in comparison, and appeared in a &quot;Kill Bill&quot;-inspired Pepsi commercial with Beyoncé and David Beckham. The next year, she returned to the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a featured artist on &quot;Control Myself&quot;, the lead single from LL Cool J&#x27;s twelfth studio album.

Lopez&#x27;s next three movie projects were box office failures. She starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in the drama &quot;An Unfinished Life&quot; (2005). Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; predicted that the typical review would be unkind: &quot;It will have no respect for Jennifer Lopez, because she is going through a period right now when nobody is satisfied with anything she does ... Give Lopez your permission to be good again; she is the same actress now as when we thought her so new and fine.&quot; In 2006, she reunited with director Gregory Nava to star in the crime drama &quot;Bordertown&quot; as a journalist investigating female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The film was negatively reviewed and received a direct-to-video release. David D&#x27;Arcy of &quot;Screen Daily&quot; found Lopez &quot;unconvincing&quot; as a journalist. In 2007, she starred opposite her then-husband Marc Anthony in the music biopic &quot;El Cantante&quot;, which told the story of Puerto Rican salsa singer Héctor Lavoe and his wife Puchi. It did not perform well at the box office and received mixed reviews from film critics; Lopez&#x27;s performance, which she expressed pride in, drew both praise and criticism.

Lopez released two studio albums in 2007. Her fifth album, &quot;Como Ama una Mujer&quot;, was her first to be recorded entirely in Spanish. Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; acknowledged that the album offered &quot;fairly persuasive proof&quot; that Lopez can sing, but was unimpressed by the &quot;flaccid torch songs.&quot; It became the fifth Spanish album to debut in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and achieved the highest first-week sales for an artist&#x27;s debut Spanish album at the time. The lead single, &quot;Qué Hiciste&quot;, reached number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 while the second single, &quot;Me Haces Falta&quot;, failed to chart. Lopez&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Brave&quot;, released later that year, was her lowest-charting album worldwide. Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was disappointed that Lopez had returned to &quot;listless vocals&quot; for her &quot;back-to-the-dance-floor album.&quot; The album debuted at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced two singles, &quot;Do It Well&quot; and &quot;Hold It Don&#x27;t Drop It&quot;. The first peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to chart. While pregnant with twins, Lopez embarked upon her first ever concert tour, a show co-headlined by Anthony, in September 2007; the tour was well received. She also created, produced and was featured in the MTV show &quot;DanceLife&quot;, which she described as a &quot;passion project&quot;.

After giving birth to twins in February 2008, Lopez took a career break. Her restaurant Madre&#x27;s closed permanently, as did her two fashion lines. After rehiring former manager Medina, Lopez released two songs in late 2009, &quot;Louboutins&quot; and &quot;Fresh Out of the Oven&quot;. The songs were intended for her seventh studio album but failed to make an appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, leading to her departure from Sony Music and Epic Records.

===2010–2015: &quot;American Idol&quot; and career revival===
Lopez&#x27;s first theatrical role in three years was in the romantic comedy &quot;The Back-up Plan&quot; (2010). Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unimpressed by the movie and described Lopez as &quot;an appealing screen presence with a disappointing big-screen track record. That&#x27;s probably not all her fault: romantic roles for women often are the provenance of the bland or the blonde.&quot; A &quot;big turning point&quot; in Lopez&#x27;s career came when she joined the judging panel of the singing competition series &quot;American Idol&quot; for its tenth season, replacing Simon Cowell. Despite being advised that it was a &quot;huge gamble&quot;, she accepted the job, as she was &quot;not getting offered a whole bunch of movies&quot;. Lopez&#x27;s appearance on &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2011 returned her to prominence. Hannah Elliot of &quot;Forbes&quot; described it as &quot;a remarkable comeback&quot;, writing: &quot;&quot;Idol&quot; humanized her. Viewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother, who got emotional when contestants did well and when they failed.&quot;

Lopez subsequently experienced what &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;the most impressive reality-TV-based rejuvenation of a music career ever.&quot; After signing a new recording contract with Island Records, her seventh studio album, &quot;Love?&quot;, was released in early 2011. While the album itself was a moderate commercial success, the single &quot;On the Floor&quot; was the year&#x27;s highest-selling single by a female artist. It reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting single as a lead artist since &quot;All I Have&quot;. The album produced two more singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Into You&quot; and &quot;Papi&quot;, which did not achieve similar success . Around this time, Lopez became a brand ambassador for L&#x27;Oréal, Gilette Venus, Tous and Fiat. She also launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and homeware line with Tommy Hilfiger for Kohl&#x27;s; the collection generated an estimated $3 billion in sales during its first year.

Lopez returned as a judge for &quot;American Idol&quot;″s eleventh season in 2012, earning a reported $20 million. That year, she released her greatest hits album, &quot;Dance Again... the Hits&quot;, to fulfil her contractual obligations with her former label Epic Records. Lopez, who was divorcing Anthony and navigating the &quot;breakup of a family&quot;, felt as if the album&#x27;s sole single, &quot;Dance Again&quot;, had come to her at the &quot;perfect moment&quot;. &quot;Dance Again&quot; reached number 17 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, in mid-2012. It grossed over $1 million per show. Also that year, she launched Teeology, a luxury T-shirt brand.

Lopez returned to the big screen in 2012, starring alongside an ensemble cast in the film &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot;, which is based on the 1984 book &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot;. Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot;, the fourth film in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise. Also in 2012, a talent show, &quot;¡Q&#x27;Viva! The Chosen&quot; followed Lopez, Anthony, and director-choreographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent for a Las Vegas show. In 2013, Lopez starred alongside Jason Statham in the crime thriller &quot;Parker&quot;, in which she played Leslie. Her performance earned positive reviews, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commending the role for giving Lopez &quot;an opportunity to be dramatic, romantic, funny, depressed, euphoric and violent. The audience stays with her all the way&quot;. That year, Lopez released the single &quot;Live It Up&quot;, founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, and was named chief creative officer of NuvoTV. She also served as an executive producer of the television series &quot;The Fosters&quot; (2013–2018), a show about a lesbian couple raising a family. Lopez&#x27;s desire to work on the series was driven by her late aunt, who was gay.

After a one-season absence, Lopez returned to &quot;American Idol&quot; for its thirteenth season, earning a reported $17.5 million. Her eighth studio album, &quot;A.K.A.&quot;, was released in mid-2014 through Capitol Records, experiencing lacklustre sales, becoming her lowest-selling album in the U.S. The album produced three singles: &quot;I Luh Ya Papi&quot;, featuring French Montana, &quot;First Love&quot;, and &quot;Booty&quot;, featuring Iggy Azalea. They reached 77, 87 and 18 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Also that year, Lopez released &quot;We Are One (Ole Ola)&quot;, the official song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup along with Pitbull and Claudia Leitte. Lopez partnered with Endless Jewelry on a range of jewelry, and released a book, &quot;True Love&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

2015 saw the release of &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;, an erotic thriller that Lopez both co-produced and starred in as a high school teacher who becomes involved with a student, which eventually leads to his dangerous obsession with her. The film received negative reviews from critics. Despite this, it became her most successful opening at the box office for a live action film since &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot;. Lopez had a voice role in the animated feature &quot;Home&quot; and contributed the single &quot;Feel the Light&quot; to the film&#x27;s official soundtrack. She also starred in the independent drama film &quot;Lila &amp; Eve&quot;, alongside Viola Davis.

===2016–2021: Television work, &quot;Hustlers&quot; and Super Bowl LIV===

In January 2016, Lopez commenced a concert residency show, All I Have, at Planet Hollywood&#x27;s Zappos Theater in Las Vegas. She performed 120 shows during the three-year run, grossing over $100 million in ticket sales. At the beginning of the residency, Lopez signed a multi-album deal with her former label Epic Records, and released &quot;Ain&#x27;t Your Mama&quot;, one of her most successful singles during the 2010s. Also in 2016, she began starring in NBC&#x27;s crime drama series &quot;Shades of Blue&quot;, which she also executive produced. She played Harlee Santos, a single mother and police detective who goes undercover for the FBI to investigate her own squad. The series&#x27; premiere brought NBC its most-watched Thursday debut in seven years. Starring alongside Ray Liotta, Lopez&#x27;s performance received critical praise. That year, she also reprised her voice role as Shira in the animated film &quot;Ice Age: Collision Course&quot; (2016), and designed a capsule collection of shoes and jewelry in collaboration with Giuseppe Zanotti.

Lopez was executive producer and judge on NBC&#x27;s dance competition series &quot;World of Dance&quot;, which was a ratings success upon its May 2017 premiere. That year, Lopez released the singles &quot;Ni Tú Ni Yo&quot; and &quot;Amor, Amor, Amor&quot;, which were intended to be included on her second Spanish-language album, &quot;Por Primera Vez&quot;, which was ultimately shelved. In late 2017, she was announced as the new face of clothing company Guess, becoming the oldest spokeswoman in the company&#x27;s history.

In 2018, Lopez released a string of Spanish and Spanglish singles: &quot;Se Acabó el Amor&quot;, &quot;El Anillo&quot;, &quot;Dinero&quot; featuring DJ Khaled and Cardi B, and &quot;Te Guste&quot; with Bad Bunny. &quot;Forbes&quot; noted that the songs were unable to &quot;completely connect on a crossover, mainstream level&quot;, but were more successful on US-based Latin charts, nearly all of them reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Airplay chart. In collaboration with Inglot Cosmetics, she launched a limited-edition makeup collection. She later starred in and executive produced the comedy film &quot;Second Act&quot; (2018), directed by Peter Segal; she also recorded the single &quot;Limitless&quot; for its soundtrack. &quot;Second Act&quot; earned mixed reviews from critics, but performed well at the box office, grossing $72.3 million during its theatrical run.

In the first half of 2019, Lopez embarked on an international concert tour, It&#x27;s My Party, to celebrate her 50th birthday. The tour grossed an estimated $54.7 million from thirty-eight shows. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that most shows were sold out. She also signed with new label Hitco Entertainment and released the single &quot;Medicine&quot; featuring French Montana. In other 2019 activities, she became the global face of the Coach brand, launched a collection of sunglasses with the brand Quay Australia, and modeled an updated version of her Green Versace dress at Milan Fashion Week. She also became executive producer of two television series, &quot;Good Trouble&quot; and &quot;Thanks a Million&quot;.

Lopez executive produced and starred in the crime drama film &quot;Hustlers&quot; (2019). Directed by Lorene Scafaria, the film is inspired by a true story, following a group of Manhattan strippers who con wealthy male Wall Street clientele. Lopez&#x27;s portrayal of a veteran stripper in &quot;Hustlers&quot; garnered acclaim from critics, with some deeming it the best performance of her acting career. The film also gave Lopez her highest opening weekend at the box office for a live action film, grossing $33.2 million. Her performance received nominations for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globe Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards and Independent Spirit Awards. The success of &quot;Hustlers&quot; was regarded by various media outlets as a comeback as an actress for Lopez.

In February 2020, Lopez co-headlined the Super Bowl LIV halftime show in Miami, Florida alongside Shakira; the performance included an appearance by her child Emme Muñiz. The performance was widely praised and became the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show to date. Later that year, Lopez released the singles &quot;Pa&#x27; Ti&quot; with Maluma―which became her most successful song since 2017―and &quot;In the Morning&quot;, before headlining the 2021 &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve with Ryan Seacrest&quot; special live from Times Square on ABC.

In January 2021, she performed at the 2021 inauguration of President Joe Biden in Washington, D.C. In business, Lopez focused on investments and creating her own brands. She launched her skin care line, JLo Beauty, released a shoe collection in partnership with DSW, and invested in companies including Hims &amp; Hers Health, Bodyarmor SuperDrink, Goli nutritional supplements and meal delivery service Wonder. In mid-2021, she signed a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce a range of films and television shows through her own Nuyorican Productions, and released the reggaeton Spanish single &quot;Cambia el Paso&quot; with Rauw Alejandro.

=== 2022–present: Focus on film and &quot;This Is Me... Now&quot; ===
Lopez co-produced and starred opposite Owen Wilson and Maluma in the romantic comedy &quot;Marry Me&quot;, which was released in February 2022. The film grossed over $50 million at the box office while becoming the most-streamed day-and-date film on Peacock, and received generally mixed reviews from critics. Lopez also released a soundtrack for the film, with Maluma, which generated the singles &quot;On My Way&quot; and &quot;Marry Me&quot;. In March 2022, Lopez was appointed as the chief &quot;entertainment and lifestyle&quot; officer of the cruise line, Virgin Voyages. Her next project was the documentary &quot;Jennifer Lopez: Halftime&quot;, which focuses on her life following the release of &quot;Hustlers&quot; and in preparation for her Super Bowl performance. Released on Netflix in June 2022 following its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival, it garnered generally positive reviews from film critics. In September, Lopez was announced as the global ambassador of Italian lingerie label Intimissimi. The following month, Jimmy Fallon and Lopez released a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Con Pollo: A Bilingual Playtime Adventure&quot;, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

Lopez co-produced and starred opposite Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Coolidge in the action-comedy &quot;Shotgun Wedding&quot;, which was released on Amazon Prime Video in January 2023. It became one of the top-streamed films on Prime Video that year. She also led and co-produced the action thriller feature &quot;The Mother&quot;, directed by Niki Caro and released on Netflix in May 2023. The film received mixed reviews, but became the most-watched film on the platform in 2023 and one of the most-watched original films on the service of all time. That September, she entered a &quot;recording and publishing&quot; partnership with BMG Rights Management, in conjunction with her Nuyorican Productions. Lopez&#x27;s business ventures in 2023 included: launching a spritz brand named Delola, a collaboration between her lifestyle brand J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez and fashion retailer Revolve, and a footwear line, JLO Jennifer Lopez, which was released as three collections in March, May, and June.

Lopez&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;This Is Me... Now&quot;, a sequel album to &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot; (2002), was released by Nuyorican and BMG on February 16, 2024. The album formed part of a &quot;three-part multimedia project&quot; which included a companion musical film, &quot;This Is Me... Now: A Love Story&quot; directed by Dave Meyers, and a documentary, &quot;The Greatest Love Story Never Told&quot;, both of which were released on Prime Video. Lopez plays a fictionalized version of herself in &quot;A Love Story&quot;, which was described as an &quot;autobiographical musical rom-com action sci-fi&quot;; Tim Jonze of &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that Lopez had possibly invented the &quot;therapy-musical biopic&quot; genre. After potential partners backed out, Lopez financed the film herself for $20 million before Amazon subsequently purchased it. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single, followed by &quot;Rebound&quot; featuring rapper Anuel AA. To promote the album, Lopez performed &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; with Latto and Redman, and the album&#x27;s title track on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 3, 2024; she also conducted an exclusive concert at the Orpheum Theatre in LA, which was recorded and released as a concert film on Apple Music and Apple TV+ on February 21. Additionally, she released a lingerie collection with Intimissimi which was inspired by the album. In May 2024, Lopez co-hosted the annual Met Gala in Manhattan, marking her 14th attendance at the haute couture event. Also that month, she and Australian music producer Fisher released a &quot;contemporary&quot; remix of &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, 25 years after the song&#x27;s release. Lopez was set to embark on the This Is Me... Live North American tour beginning June 2024, but cancelled it in order to spend more time with her family. 

Lopez co-produced and starred in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Atlas&quot;, the third project under her Netflix deal. Released in May 2024, &quot;Atlas&quot; received negative reviews from critics, but was successful on Netflix where it was the most-watched movie in 71 countries on its first day. In a positive review of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lopez&#x27;s performance and called the film &quot;an intriguing concept.&quot; Lopez starred alongside Jharrel Jerome in the biographical wrestling drama &quot;Unstoppable,&quot; based on the life of wrestler Anthony Robles, produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. The feature premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, followed by a limited theatrical release in December 2024. Lopez portrayed Judy, Robles&#x27;s mother, in the film; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the fullest screen performance she has ever given&quot;.

==== Upcoming projects ====
Lopez starred in and executive produced the Bill Condon-directed &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, a film adaption of the Broadway 1993 musical of the same name. It is her first role in a full-fledged musical; filming occurred from April to May 2024 in New Jersey. Lopez will co-produce and star opposite Brett Goldstein in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Office Romance&quot;. She will also co-produce a series adaptation of Emily Henry&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;Happy Place&quot; for Netflix. She has also committed to lead and co-produce Netflix&#x27;s film adaptation of the bestselling novel, &quot;The Cipher&quot;. Lopez has several projects in the works as a producer.

==Personal life==
Lopez was in a nearly decade-long relationship with David Cruz, her high-school boyfriend, until the mid-1990s. They were engaged at one point, and Cruz relocated to Los Angeles to be with her when she began pursuing her career. She later said of Cruz, &quot;You get lucky, you have a first love like that.&quot; She was married to Cuban waiter Ojani Noa from February 1997 to January 1998. In subsequent court cases, Noa was prevented from publishing a book about their marriage and from using private honeymoon footage of Lopez in a documentary.

Lopez was in an on-again, off-again relationship with record producer and rapper Sean Combs (then known as &quot;Puff Daddy&quot;) from 1999 to early 2001. On the night of December 27, 1999, Lopez and Combs were arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and possession of stolen property, after leaving the scene of a shooting at a Times Square nightclub. Charges against Lopez were dropped within an hour while Combs was acquitted of all charges at trial in March 2001. They broke up shortly thereafter. Lopez later said that, while she had &quot;cared very much&quot; about Combs, their &quot;crazy, tumultuous&quot; relationship &quot;was always something I knew would end.&quot; She was married to Cris Judd, her former backup dancer, from September 2001 to January 2003.
Before her divorce with Judd was finalized, Lopez was in a relationship with actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck from mid-2002 to early 2004. Although they had crossed paths several times before (including at the 70th Academy Awards and at the premiere of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, both in 1998), their first major meeting was on the set of &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003) in December 2001. They later worked together on the music video for &quot;Jenny from the Block&quot; and the film &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; (2004). Her album &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot; was dedicated to and inspired by Affleck. Their relationship was extensively publicized. Tabloids referred to the couple as &quot;Bennifer&quot;, a portmanteau &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described as &quot;the first of that sort of tabloid branding&quot;. They became engaged in November 2002, but their planned wedding on September 14, 2003, was postponed with four days&#x27; notice because of &quot;excessive media attention&quot;. They ended their engagement in January 2004. Years later, Lopez said Affleck&#x27;s discomfort with media scrutiny was one reason for their split and described it as her &quot;first real heartbreak&quot;: &quot;I think different time, different thing, who knows what could&#x27;ve happened, but there was a genuine love there.&quot;

After her relationship with Affleck, Lopez stopped discussing her personal life in interviews. She was married to singer Marc Anthony from June 2004 to June 2014; they had previously worked together and dated for a few months in the late 1990s. Their wedding took place five months after the end of her relationship with Affleck. During their marriage, they collaborated on music and performed together, as well as co-starring in &quot;El Cantante&quot; (2006). Lopez gave birth to fraternal twins, a boy and a girl, in Long Island in February 2008. &quot;People&quot; paid a reported US$6 million for the first photographs of the twins, making them the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken at the time. In 2009, Anthony and Lopez purchased a stake in the Miami Dolphins. They announced their separation in July 2011. Anthony filed for divorce in April 2012 and it was finalized in June 2014. Lopez retained primary physical custody of the two children. Lopez occasionally performs with her daughter.

Lopez had an on-again, off-again relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016. She dated New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez from February 2017 to early 2021. They became engaged in March 2019 but postponed their wedding twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to tabloid speculation about the state of their relationship, they released a statement in March 2021, saying they were &quot;working through some things&quot;. They announced the end of their relationship in April 2021.

In April 2021, Lopez and Affleck were reported to be dating again, with Lopez publicly confirming their rekindled relationship that July. In April 2022, Lopez announced their second engagement, 20 years after the first proposal. They were married in Las Vegas on July 16, 2022, and held a wedding celebration for family and friends the following month. On August 20, 2024, Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck, citing April 26, 2024, as the date of their separation. She also requested that her legal name be changed back to Jennifer Lynn Lopez. On January 6, 2025, the divorce was finalized.

==Other ventures==
===Philanthropy===
Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and &quot;El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)&quot;, which benefited people affected by the tragedy. In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by Amnesty International for her work in &quot;Bordertown&quot;, which shed light on the hundreds of feminicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity&quot;. That year, one dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony&#x27;s co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to the Run for Something Better program, which fights childhood obesity.

Lopez has been a long-time supporter of the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles. Her album &quot;Rebirth&quot; (2005) is dedicated to Paige Peterson, an eleven-year-old cancer patient she befriended at the hospital who died in 2004. Lopez stated that &quot;[she doesn&#x27;t] like to do [her] charity work in public. That&#x27;s not what you do it for.&quot; In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The organization works to increase healthcare access for underprivileged women and children, including through a telemedicine program in partnership with the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has facilitated the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.

In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive to benefit her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles and the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy. In May 2015, she became the first celebrity spokesperson for the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children&#x27;s Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled &quot;Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are&quot;. That September, she became the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation. This role sees her mobilizing action to address issues including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.

In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez donated $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico. Along with Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria. Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, &quot;One Voice: Somos Live!&quot;, which raised over $35 million. She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s charity single &quot;Almost Like Praying&quot;, which benefits Puerto Rico.

As of 2021, Lopez continues to regularly donate to and support charities. In September 2021, she launched her own philanthropic organization, Limitless Labs, that supports and empowers Latina entrepreneurs and business owners. Lopez announced a partnership between the venture and the 10,000 Small Businesses initiative. In June 2022, Lopez and Limitless Labs partnered with nonprofit Grameen America as a national ambassador to empower women-led Latina businesses with $14 billion in business loans and &quot;6 million hours of financial education and training by 2030.&quot; Lopez has performed at charity concerts throughout her career, including the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation&#x27;s Blue Diamond Gala in 2022, which raised $3.6 million for education, health care, homelessness and social justice causes.

===Political views and activism===
A supporter of the Democratic Party, Lopez has a long history of backing Democratic candidates for public office. She endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending fundraising events for Obama. She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.

Lopez has been critical of President Donald Trump. During her Super Bowl halftime show performance in 2020, she performed her song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot; while cloaked in a large Puerto Rican flag, with children in metal cages displayed on the field. It was interpreted as a statement about the Mexico–United States border crisis and Trump&#x27;s immigration policy. The NFL attempted to remove the cages from the performance but Lopez refused. She endorsed President Joe Biden in his 2020 presidential campaign. She later performed at Biden&#x27;s 2021 inauguration, where she sang &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, while reciting the last phrase of the Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish. She also worked &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot; into the performance as a &quot;reprise&quot; to her political message at the Super Bowl. Lopez endorsed Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential campaign. She spoke at a Las Vegas rally for Harris, pushing back on remarks made at Trump&#x27;s rally at Madison Square Garden which were deemed offensive to Puerto Ricans.

Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research. In June 2013, amfAR presented her with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work. That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community. The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award. In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled &quot;Love Make the World Go Round&quot;, a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. She was also featured on the song &quot;Hands&quot; along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting. Lopez signed an open letter from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.

In June 2020, Lopez attended a Black Lives Matter movement protest in Los Angeles, in connection with the broader George Floyd protests. Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time&#x27;s Up movement. In January 2022, she became one of the co-chairs for Michelle Obama&#x27;s When We All Vote. She expressed solidarity with the people of the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. As part of a group called Artists4Ceasefire, she signed a letter urging President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

==Artistry==
===Influences===

Lopez has cited Madonna as her &quot;first big musical influence&quot;, explaining &quot;It was all about Madonna for me. She inspired me to want to sing, to dance, to work hard.&quot; Her other major influences include Tina Turner, James Brown, and Michael Jackson. Another major influence on Lopez is Barbra Streisand, stating that, &quot;watching her career over the years, watching her sing and act and direct, was very inspiring to me.&quot; Lopez has cited Janet Jackson as a major inspiration for her own dance and videos, stating that she &quot;probably started dancing&quot; because of Jackson&#x27;s music video for &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. She also looked to the careers of Cher, Bette Middler and Diana Ross, and has been inspired by younger artists such as Lady Gaga.

Growing up, she was influenced by Latin music styles ranging from salsa to bachata, and artists including Celia Cruz and Tito Puente. However, it was the hip hop song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1979) by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life. Another key inspiration for Lopez in her youth was Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno&#x27;s performance in the musical film &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). Moreno was the only performer Lopez was able to identify with, at a time when Latinos were rarely on television.

===Musical style===
Musically, Lopez is described as a &quot;chameleon&quot; by outlets like &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot;, having been known to experiment and jump between genres. Her music strongly identifies with hip hop while exploring the &quot;romantic innocence&quot; of Latin music. &quot;Billboard&quot; observed that she has &quot;never been one to downplay her Latinidad, and always makes sure to display it&quot; in her music, &quot;regardless of genre&quot;. &quot;On the 6&quot; and &quot;J.Lo&quot;, described by Lopez as Latin soul, fuse a wide range of Latin genres with R&amp;B and hip hop, while also containing dance-pop. While mostly English, the albums include some Spanish and bilingual songs such as &quot;Cariño&quot;, with Lopez also speaking in Spanish and asserting her Latin identity on songs like &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot;. A departure from her previous work, &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot; blends 1970s soul with &quot;streetwise&quot; hip hop. &quot;Rebirth&quot; was noted for its &quot;relaxing&quot; atmosphere, while &quot;Como Ama una Mujer&quot; was characterized as &quot;silkily Spanish Sade worship&quot;.

Described as autobiographical, much of Lopez&#x27;s music has centered around the &quot;ups and downs&quot; of love. Lyrically, &quot;This Is Me... Then&quot; is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song &quot;Dear Ben&quot; being described as the album&#x27;s &quot;glowing centerpiece&quot;. Its sequel album, &quot;This Is Me... Now&quot;, was informed by her reunion and marriage with Affleck; Lopez called it an &quot;emotional, spiritual, and psychological journey of the past two decades&quot;. &quot;Como Ama una Mujer&quot; features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing. Regarding &quot;Love?&quot;, Lopez stated: &quot;There&#x27;s still so much to learn and that&#x27;s why the question mark.&quot; Other recurrent themes in Lopez&#x27;s music have included her upbringing in the Bronx, social class and women&#x27;s empowerment.

Lopez has received mixed reviews for her &quot;light&quot; soubrette voice, which critics have deemed limited, &quot;radio-friendly&quot; and overshadowed by her music&#x27;s production. With &quot;On the 6&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; regarded Lopez as having a &quot;breathy&quot; stylistic range but lacking personality, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked: &quot;Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&amp;B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn&#x27;t need to belt because she knows you&#x27;re already paying attention ... She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.&quot;

In reviewing &quot;Love?&quot;, AllMusic called her voice &quot;slight&quot; and wrote: &quot;Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described her &quot;notoriously serviceable, airy and light&quot; voice as being &quot;stronger than ever&quot; on &quot;This Is Me... Now&quot;, while noting that &quot;the thinness of the voice has often been beside the point, if not a boon to her early career&quot;, which was marked by &quot;Bronx regularness&quot;. Lopez has been criticized for her use of background vocals from demo singers, prompting rumors of ghost singers&#x27; vocals being used in place of her own. The rumors have been debunked by producers and background singers who worked with Lopez. Christina Milian, who is credited as a writer and background singer on &quot;Play&quot;, called the controversy &quot;funny&quot; and said: &quot;It&#x27;s no different than Michael Jackson having background singers on songs or Britney Spears. This is what music is made of.&quot;

===Dance, videos and stage===

Considered one of dance&#x27;s &quot;greatest success stories&quot;, Lopez has received praise for her highly choreographed dancing, and is noted for her technical skill. Lopez, who felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, has been trained in a range of dance styles, including ballet, jazz, flamenco, ballroom, pole dancing, breakdancing, street dance, and hip hop. A dominant figure on MTV since early in her career, she is known for her body-emphasizing music videos and provocative choreography. CNN&#x27;s Holly Thomas stated that &quot;Lopez&#x27;s years of professional dance experience gave her a captivating, commanding presence in her videos.&quot; Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: &quot;Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century&quot;, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Brittany Spanos observing that her &quot;dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium&#x27;s pop canon&quot;. Her videography has sometimes attracted controversy for its sexual suggestiveness, and has been noted for its influence on 2000s fashion trends.

On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship, sex appeal, and costumes, which often include bodysuits. Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in &quot;Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom&quot; (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who &quot;used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies&quot;. Troy Patterson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, &quot;She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.&quot; Her signature movements include &quot;clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations&quot;. While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez&#x27;s Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously. In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is &quot;undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show&quot;.

Her provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. Robin Givhan of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; criticized Lopez&#x27;s performance at the 2011 American Music Awards where she wore a nude bodysuit, stating that it &quot;cried out for attention in all the wrong ways&quot; and was &quot;banal exhibitionism&quot;. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom. Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;disgraceful&quot;, while an education group claimed that she &quot;disturbed public order and tarnished women&#x27;s honor and respect&quot;.

===Acting and screen===
Lopez&#x27;s films often see her playing &quot;relatable everywomen&quot;, with Cady Lang of &quot;Time&quot; writing: &quot;A longtime hallmark of Lopez&#x27;s filmography is her penchant for stories about survivors. Her characters are never shrinking violets.&quot; Discussing the roles she is drawn to, Lopez said in 1998: &quot;I don&#x27;t think of them as strong women ... I like characters that are really part of the story as opposed to window dressing, but I think the interesting thing is that they are real people. Nobody walks around being strong all the time.&quot;

Film critic Stephanie Zacharek described Lopez as &quot;one of the most gifted and appealing performers of the past two decades ... and yet the movies have rarely known what to do with her and her significant gifts as an actor.&quot; While Lopez received acclaim for her early film work, &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Kyle Buchanan noted that her tendency to star in romantic comedies, and her pop music career, &quot;lowered her critical bona fides&quot;. Taylor Hackford, who directed Lopez in &quot;Parker&quot;, said she &quot;can really act&quot;: &quot;She knows how to transmit nuances, to make the subtlest of shifts. Does she have humor? Yes. But at the same time she can get into the deepest dramatic areas.&quot; Lopez, who identifies the romantic comedy as her favorite film genre, has been referred to as the &quot;Patron Saint of Romantic Comedies&quot; and the &quot;Queen of Romantic Comedies&quot;.

In her early films, Lopez played stereotypical roles which signified her as a &quot;racialized, exoticized&quot; other. In films such as &quot;Blood and Wine&quot; and &quot;U Turn&quot;, her body is fetishized &quot;through extreme close-ups&quot; and &quot;framed as animalistic, primitive, and irresistibly dangerous to the Anglo American male characters.&quot; This shifted with her role in &quot;Selena&quot;, which &quot;affirmed her Latinx identity, and won her the loyalty of that significant section of the U.S. and global audience.&quot; She has also been criticized for playing ethnically ambiguous parts and tapping into &quot;the ability to perform a panethnic other&quot; to commodify herself. Her role as an Italian woman in &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; has been described as &quot;a case of classic Hollywood whitewashing.&quot;

==Public image==
Lopez has been a polarizing figure in popular culture. Andrew Barker of &quot;Variety&quot; writes that she &quot;exhibits a plethora of contradictions&quot;, observing: &quot;Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles &#x27;I&#x27;m Real&#x27; and &#x27;Jenny From the Block&#x27;.&quot; In 2002, Lynette Holloway of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Lopez&#x27;s image as including &quot;a dash of &quot;ghetto fabulousness&quot;&quot; and &quot;middle-class respectability&quot; for mass appeal. The media discerned a shift in her public image upon joining &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2011, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writing: &quot;Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth &quot;&quot;.&quot; &quot;People&quot; editor Peter Castro said &quot;American Idol&quot; made Lopez &quot;a celebrity of the people&quot; whereas before, &quot;there was a huge distance with the American public.&quot;
Lopez is widely celebrated for her curvaceous hourglass figure, which earned her the nickname &quot;La Guitarra&quot; (the guitar). &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described her buttocks as &quot;in and of themselves, a cultural icon&quot;. Recounting her experience on early films, Lopez stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve always had costume people looking at me a little weary and immediately fitting me out with things to hide my bottom.&quot; She often wears revealing outfits to accentuate her curves. Author Mary Beltrán opined that for Lopez to &quot;unashamedly display her well-endowed posterior during this time period&quot; could be viewed as &quot;a revolutionary act with respect to Anglo beauty ideals&quot;. However, she was also criticized for perceived changes in her image upon launching her music career, which included &quot;weight loss and lightening her hair&quot;.

Considered a fashion icon, Lopez is known for her sense of style and &quot;breaking fashion rules&quot;. She is recognized for both her &quot;bold&quot; red carpet fashion, including fourteen appearances at the haute couture Met Gala in New York City, and her everyday street style, which is &quot;discussed ad infinitum by the fashion press.&quot; &quot;British Vogue&quot; said she &quot;added megawatt glamour to every outfit she wore&quot;, with &quot;Billboard&quot; describing her style as &quot;scantily clad&quot;. Lopez&#x27;s style has been influenced by &quot;women who epitomize old Hollywood glamour like Rita Hayworth&quot;, as well as her Bronx upbringing and Nuyorican identity. Described as the &quot;ultimate sex symbol&quot; of the early 21st century, various publications have ranked her as the most beautiful or sexiest woman in the world, including &quot;People&quot;, &quot;People en Español&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, and &quot;FHM&quot;, with Lopez topping the latter&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women list twice. Lopez has criticized &quot;this funny notion in America that you can&#x27;t be a mom and be sexy&quot;, stating: &quot;The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.&quot; She has a large following on social media, being the 14th most-followed individual on Instagram and having one of the 50 most-followed accounts on Twitter. On the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)&#x27;s &quot;Music Fuels&quot; ranking, Lopez is the eighth-most-followed musician across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. She is the richest Latin actress, with an estimated net worth of US$400million.

Described as &quot;one of the most photographed women in the world&quot;, Lopez has long been a tabloid fixture, and admits to having a &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; public image. Frances Negrón-Muntaner wrote that by 1999, &quot;Internet chat rooms exploded with anti-Lopez babble&quot; and she became &quot;one of the easiest moving targets for cheap laughs as well as anxieties about working-class &#x27;loud&#x27; sexuality and specifically Latino visibility.&quot; Much of the media coverage surrounding Lopez in the 2000s &quot;focused on her dramatic private life&quot;, with several writers describing her as overexposed at the time, despite her continued success. Media outlets often liken her to actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships and glamorous public persona. Her high-profile relationship with Combs was described as having &quot;defined an age&quot;, with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writing that they entered &quot;the pantheon of slightly notorious celebrity couples: Liz and Dick, Frank and Ava.&quot;

Throughout her career, she has also received a bad reputation as being a demanding and outspoken &quot;diva&quot;, something which she denies, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by how much more well-behaved we have to be than men.&quot; Some of the backlash and fabricated tabloid stories surrounding Lopez have been attributed to her 1998 interview with &quot;Movieline&quot;, in which she was quoted as criticizing various actors and directors. Lopez, who &quot;cried for hours&quot; after the article was published, said the comments were made in jest and she was &quot;so misquoted and so taken out of context&quot;. In 2003, Lawrence Donegan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; posited that &quot;indefensible&quot; misogyny and racism were to blame for her position as &quot;the most vilified woman in modern popular culture&quot;. In 2021, Ben Affleck said: &quot;People were so fucking mean about her; sexist, racist, ugly vicious shit was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now, you would literally be fired for saying some of the things you said.&quot;

==Legacy and cultural impact==
===Entertainment industry===
Lopez is regarded as one of the most influential Latin entertainers of all time, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry. She was described as &quot;the first Latina superstar&quot; by writer Ned Zeman, and the &quot;embodiment of the American Dream&quot; by Robert C. Cottrell in &quot;Icons of American Popular Culture&quot; (2009). Often dubbed the &quot;Queen of Dance&quot;, she is considered a triple threat performer, and was one of few actors to successfully cross over into music. Rachel Sklar of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called Lopez a trailblazer, writing: &quot;Beyoncé, Miley, Gaga, any actress who&#x27;s ever released an album — they are all standing on the shoulders of J.Lo. She was a true triple threat — actress, singer, dancer ... and packaged it sometimes outrageously but always sexily.&quot; Lopez is considered a pop icon, with VH1 ranking her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music, and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.

The highest-paid Latina actress in history, Lopez&#x27;s film career has been credited with paving the way for greater representation of Latino Americans in Hollywood, which was historically a &quot;whites-only preserve&quot;. Biographer Kathleen Tracy opined that &quot;Lopez blazed a trail no openly Latin actress had gone before&quot;, noting that previous Latina stars cosmetically downplayed their ethnicity and changed their names. With &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), she achieved &quot;ethnic &#x27;blind&#x27; casting&quot;, making her an &quot;anomaly in the traditionally white space&quot; of mainstream Hollywood. By deliberately avoiding stereotypical roles, biographer James Robert Parish said Lopez &quot;helped minimize racial boundaries in show business.&quot; Her perceived Academy Award snub for &quot;Hustlers&quot; (2019) was referenced by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti when announcing a new initiative for Latino representation in Hollywood.

With her musical debut, Lopez contributed to the 1990s &quot;Latin explosion&quot; in entertainment; The Recording Academy called her the &quot;breakout female star&quot; of the Latin pop movement in American music. Historian Roger Bruns considered her &quot;an influential force in driving a growing Latin cultural influence in popular music&quot; at the time. Her career ascent has been credited with paving the way for American-born Latina pop artists including Selena Gomez and Becky G, and for Latin American pop artists to venture into English music, including Shakira, Thalía and Paulina Rubio. Along with Ricky Martin, she helped increase the visibility of Latin music in international markets including East Asia and Canada. Due to her &quot;multi-tasking career&quot;, she has been described as &quot;the next-generation Madonna&quot;, and &quot;the first woman to demonstrate that a Madonna could be a Latina&quot;.

Lopez&#x27;s music has been credited with helping influence the trajectory of 2000s music, including dance music, Latin music, R&amp;B, and pop rap collaborations. &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the Greatest Pop Star of the year 2001. Scholar Miriam Jiménez Román suggested that Lopez, who represents the &quot;often-suppressed&quot; history of Puerto Ricans in hip hop culture, was &quot;able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries&quot;. In 2011, following her return to prominence, Lopez was deemed the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest musical comeback act&quot;, based on a study which analysed over one billion Google searches since 2004. In 2019, she was named among the most powerful people in entertainment by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. From 2022 to 2024, Lopez was included in the magazine&#x27;s Power 100 list, as one of the most powerful women in entertainment. In July 2023, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax figure of Lopez inspired by her performance at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show. In 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; included Lopez among the honorable mentions of its 25 Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century listicle; the magazine stated that &quot;no one defined celebrity at the beginning of the 21st century quite like [Lopez]&quot; and that she &quot;helped define an era where hip-hop, R&amp;B and pop all got more cuddly together than ever before&quot;.

===Cultural influence===

Lopez was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as the world&#x27;s most powerful celebrity and the 38th most powerful woman. &quot;Latina&quot; magazine founder Christy Haubegger attributed Lopez&#x27;s influence to her being &quot;the first icon that generationally fits&quot; young Latino Americans who followed celebrity culture. Lopez was featured on the first cover of &quot;Latina&quot; in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza writing in 2011 that there is &quot;no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer&quot;.

Jonathan Van Meter of &quot;Vogue&quot; described Lopez as having &quot;changed the face of modern celebrity.&quot; Her ability to start trends has prompted the usage of the phrase &quot;the J.Lo effect&quot; in popular culture, which has been used in various different contexts, including the trend of networks hiring &quot;big name&quot; judges for reality competition programs after Lopez&#x27;s successful casting on &quot;American Idol&quot;. With her moniker J.Lo, Lopez started a trend of celebrities being given abbreviated nicknames, while &quot;Bennifer&quot; began the convention of celebrity couple name blending.

Described by scholar Helene A. Shugart of the University of Utah as &quot;arguably the most visible Latina in contemporary mainstream popular culture&quot;, Lopez has been the subject of considerable academic analysis, including in relation to ethnicity, class, &quot;body politics&quot;, race, Latin culture, and gender. While credited with opening &quot;the door to [Latino culture having a] broader appeal&quot;, Lopez has also been a polarizing figure, generating &quot;often vehement disagreement about what is and isn&#x27;t Latino.&quot;

As a result of the public emphasis on her curvaceous figure, Lopez has been credited with influencing a shift in cultural beauty standards. The surge in popularity of buttock augmentation surgery in the early 2000s was attributed to Lopez. In &quot;Latin Sensations&quot; (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: &quot;Because she wasn&#x27;t rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold ... Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.&quot; This has been considered a sign of Lopez&#x27;s social power in &quot;changing cultural standards within the mainstream media as a whole&quot;.

In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, &quot;Litarachna lopezae&quot;, after Lopez. In Tok Pisin, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, the term palopa is used to describe non-heteronormative people whose identities may correlate with western definitions of homosexual men or trans women; its etymology is derived from the name Jennifer Lopez. In 2019, she was presented with keys to the city of Miami Beach, with July 24 being declared &quot;Jennifer Lopez Day&quot;.

===Fashion and branding===
The Council of Fashion Designers of America presented Lopez with its Fashion Icon Award in 2019 for her &quot;long-standing and global impact on fashion&quot;. Her green Versace &quot;Jungle Dress&quot; was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The dress had a significant impact on the fashion industry, celebrity endorsements, and the evolution of red carpet fashion. The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google&#x27;s image search. Lopez has been credited with popularizing various fashion and beauty trends throughout her career. In 2003, she inspired a trend of curvier mannequins being designed, which fuelled a rise in sales for manufacturers and retailers. Lopez&#x27;s personal style and brand deals have had a considerable effect on sales in the fashion industry. The success of Louis Vuitton&#x27;s fall 2003 campaign, for which Lopez was the brand&#x27;s model, led to more Hollywood stars &quot;becoming image models of fashion and cosmetic labels&quot;. In 2021, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that she was among ten celebrities whose personal style choices drove the greatest spikes in searches and news coverage for brands. Her appearance at Milan Fashion Week in 2019 generated over $31.8 million in total media impact value.

Described as a &quot;branding pioneer&quot;, Lopez has been credited with ushering in a new era of celebrity branding. Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, influenced the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s. Her fragrance line became the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion . Lopez&#x27;s clothing brand was one of the first celebrity fashion lines; scholars have credited her with redefining &quot;how fashion is produced and entwined with other artistic endeavors&quot;, and popularizing a trend of utilizing racial ambiguity for branding purposes in fashion and cosmetics. As of 2022, her business ventures have cumulatively earned over US$5 billion in sales globally.

==Achievements==
, Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide and amassed over 15 billion streams; her films have grossed a cumulative total of while her business ventures have cumulatively made over in consumer sales. She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States. With &quot;J.Lo&quot; (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953. &quot;J to tha L-O! The Remixes&quot; (2002) was acknowledged by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the first number one remix album on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Lopez&#x27;s single &quot;On the Floor&quot; is among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video was recognized as the &quot;Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2012. &quot;Billboard&quot; named Lopez the top Hot 100 female artist and the greatest pop star of 2001. The magazine ranked her as the ninth-greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016, having scored 18 number-one songs on its Dance Club Songs chart. She was named the top Latin touring artist of the decade by &quot;Pollstar&quot; in 2021. 

In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts. In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions, and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud. In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award. In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards. In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to receive the honor since its introduction in 1984. In 2022, she received the Generation Award at the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards for her contributions to film and television, and the Icon Award at the iHeart Radio Music Awards.

<text>Jock Taylor (9 March 1954 – 15 August 1982) was a Scottish World Champion motorcycle sidecar racer.

John Robert (Jock) Taylor was born in Pencaitland, East Lothian, and entered his first sidecar race at the age of 19, as the passenger to Kenny Andrews (1974). The following year, he took part in his first race as a driver. Taylor died in Finland in a racing incident in 1982.

==Racing career==
Taylor was the Scottish Sidecar Champion with passenger Lewis Ward in 1977. He won races at East Fortune near Haddington, Beveridge Park in Kirkcaldy and at Knockhill near Dunfermline as well as events in England with some success. In 1978, he decided to tackle the odd Grand Prix race and the British Championships and parted company with Ward and teamed up with a new passenger from nearby Haddington called Jimmy Neil. It took some time for the new partnership to gel, but by the end of the season they were regularly winning races in England. In 1979, Taylor acquired a Seymaz hub steering type outfit. He found it not to his liking after two accidents that left Jimmy Neil with a fractured wrist and caused the death of stand-in passenger Dave Powell at Oulton Park in a high-speed crash. With Neil still injured, Taylor used veteran passenger Jimmy Law for the German GP at Hockenheim on his old Windle framed Yamaha, where they finished fifth. Although Neil returned to Assen in Holland, it was when he teamed up with Swedish former125 cc rider Benga Johansson that Taylor took his first Grand Prix victory at the Swedish TT at Karlskoga shortly after. There were further successes towards the end of 1979 in Britain, where he finished runner-up in the British Championship behind Dick Greasley. In 1980, Taylor and Benga Johansson won 4 Grand Prix races, and finished on the podium in all seven events they finished. He won the British Championship and won the Isle of Man Sidecar B race to win the Sidecar TT overall. In 1981, he retained his British title and went on to become a four-time TT race winner. In 1982 Taylor and Johansson raised the sidecar lap record at the Isle of Man TT to 108.29 mph (174.27 km/h), a lap record which stood for 7 years.

==Death==
In the 1982 Finnish Grand Prix, held in Imatra under very wet conditions, Taylor and Johansson&#x27;s bike began to aquaplane and slid off the road, colliding with a telephone pole. Emergency services attempted to remove him from the wreckage until a second sidecar team slid off into them, killing Taylor. He was buried in the local cemetery at Pencaitland, and a memorial to him was erected in the village in December 2006. A memorial also stands in Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy, overlooking Railway Bend on the old motorcycle racing circuit. Jock Taylor also has a memorial in Imatra, near the paddock of Finnish championship racetrack.
==Restoration==
Jock&#x27;s World championship, and TT 108.29 mph (174.27 km/h) lap record-winning sidecar was bought by friend and fellow competitor Jack Muldoon from Jock&#x27;s sponsor Dennis Trollope. Jack rescued Jock&#x27;s outfit from the 5-man consortium who were supposed to restore the bike to its original condition and display it in a museum in Alford, Aberdeenshire. That never happened in the four years that it lay up in Alford in bits in a shed.

Jack Muldoon and family bought Jock&#x27;s bike in March 2012 and started the restoration work immediately. The sidecar was completely stripped to a bare chassis, with months spent with emery cleaning and polishing the chassis. Due to the 26 years it lay at Donington in the museum and then 4 years up in Aberdeen, the chassis and all components were covered in rust and everything was seized: every component on the bike had to be stripped and cleaned, all bearings in all parts of the chassis were replaced, and the engine was completely rebuilt. It was done with the help of Bill Howarth and Dennis Trollope for all the Yamaha TZ700 parts required in the engine rebuild; Terry Windle, Stuart Mellor, Lockheed, HEL Performance Brake Pipes, Paul Drake Koni Shockers, Yolst Silkoline Oils. By August the restoration was 90% complete – it was the first time in 30 years that the TZ700 engine had run, and it was paraded at the Jock Taylor Memorial race weekend at East Fortune near Edinburgh in August 2012, a few miles from where Jock was born and brought up.

==Annual Jock Taylor Memorial Race==
In the year following his death, an annual end of season race was established at Knockhill called the Jock Taylor Trophy, and it has always attracted the very best crews. Every year, sidecar racers travel from all over the UK to race in what has become a prestigious race. In 2012, the race was held at East Fortune, where Taylor started his racing career nearly 40 years ago.
