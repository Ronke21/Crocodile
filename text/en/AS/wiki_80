<text>Boiling Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 8,219 at the 2010 census.

==Namesake==
The area became known as Boiling Springs because of a small spring in its heart that, up until the land was commercially developed, actually appeared as if it were boiling and would sometimes shoot water into the air. The geyser diminished gradually over the years. In the 1930s it had become a shallow, barely bubbling stream and today the water is still. The spring is located at the corner of McMillian Boulevard and Highway 9 on the same lot as the (formerly) Bi-Lo Shopping Center and the Verizon Mobile store. Once the land was developed and the shopping center was built, the springs ceased to boil. After the spring was cleaned up and dug out, a small park was built around it with benches, flags, and a memorial to a citizen of Boiling Springs.

<text>Duncan is a town in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States. Its population was 3,181 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1811, a post office was established on what is now S.C. Highway 290. A tiny settlement sprung up around it, and both the post office and community were named New Hope. In 1854, the town changed its name to Vernonville or Vernonsville in honor of local physician J.J. Vernon.

In the mid-1850s, plans were under way to put a railroad line through Duncan, but the impending Civil War disrupted them. It was not until 1873 that the Atlanta and Richmond Railroad laid a line through the town.

Shortly after the Civil War, Leroy Duncan came to town and began buying land. Duncan was an ambitious man who craved recognition. During celebrations for the new railroad line, he promised townspeople he would provide land for city streets if they would agree to rename the town after him. In 1881, the name change became official.

Duncan became the site of an important footnote in Spartanburg County&#x27;s African-American history when the Rock Hill Negro School opened in Duncan in 1881.

Within two years of its name change, Duncan boasted a population of 200, along with several general stores, saw and flour mills and a cotton gin. The town received its charter in 1889.

The Hughes Hotel, opened in 1892, became a focal point of the town and drew travelers from the Greenville-Spartanburg road.

<text>Inman is a city in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States, part of the Spartanburg metropolitan area.

The city contains a historic main street district, several houses of worship, and a school district.

==History==
Inman was incorporated by South Carolina on December 22, 1882 at the crossroads of Howard Gap and Blackstock. William Gowan, a local landowner, founded the town by volunteering to build a railroad depot which convinced the railroad to create a stop at the city. Since there was already a town named Gowansville, some local historians have said town was named after the president of the railroad or a surveyor However, according to geographer Henry Gannett, the town was named after a local resident. The town emerged as a small settlement, with businesses such as a blacksmith, a bank, and even a barber shop springing up around the depot. During the 1930s Inman was considered the fresh peach capital of the world. The Bush House and Shiloh Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1901, James A. Chapman founded Inman Mills, a company that still spins and weaves fabric. The mill was designed by W.B. Smith Whaley and was one of the city&#x27;s major employers for many years. The original mill was closed in 2001 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The building has been converted into apartments.

In 1935, a local man named Bryson Hammet found a large stone off South Carolina highway 292 with various markings and the year 1567 carved into it. Historians have debated the authenticity and meaning of the stone for decades with many attributing the stone to Spanish Explorer and gold seeker Captain Juan Pardo.

<text>Lyman is a town in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States. Its population was 6,173 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Lyman originally grew around a general store owned by Augustus Belton Groce, which opened in the mid-1870s. This led to the community becoming known as Groce&#x27;s Stop. In 1923, the Groce family sold over to Pacific Mills. By the following year the Lyman Printing and Finishing Mill had been constructed, and by 1927, Pacific Mills had built 375 homes as housing for their employees. The town was then renamed in memory of Arthur T. Lyman, a former president of the mill. Lyman prospered for years as a textile town, but by 2005 the last mill was closed.

The Pacific Mills company kept up their employees&#x27; houses, the streets and the back alleys. The back alleys were dirt, so crews from the plant would bring dump trucks of cinders from the burnt coal at the boiler room, and spread them up and down the back alleys to keep them from getting muddy. The houses were finished on the outside, with cypress wood for the underpinning. In the late 1940s the company removed the lattice-work and put brick underpinning in its place. The houses were four, five and six room houses with modern designs. Pacific Mills broke from the usual, salt-box style house design of most cotton mill villages. When the village of Lyman was built, it was a showcase for cotton mill villages. Ridge Road was set aside for the executive staff of the company. The houses there were made out of the same materials as the other houses, but they were larger and of nicer designs.

===Neighborhoods of Pacific Mills===


When Pacific Mills built the village of Lyman, they laid water mains and sewer pipes under the streets. All of the houses and buildings were hooked up to these. They therefore had indoor plumbing, with running water and sewage disposal (which in 1923 could have been considered a luxury item), then a rarity for many people in South Carolina. The sewage pipes ran from the village down to a concrete holding tank next to the river, across from where the library is today.

McMakin&#x27;s Tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==Arts and culture==
Cultural events and institutions in the city include:
* Chapman Cultural Center, Spartanburg&#x27;s cultural anchor for history, art, theatre, dance, music, and science, is located in a three-building complex on the northern edge of downtown. Opened in October 2007, the Center was designed by David M. Schwarz Architects of Washington, D.C. It houses the Spartanburg Art Museum, Spartanburg County Regional History Museum, Science Center, Little Theatre, Ballet, Music Foundation, and other groups that were formerly located in The Arts Center on South Spring Street. It is owned and operated by The Arts Partnership of Greater Spartanburg, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting arts and cultural agencies in Spartanburg County.
* Converse University is a nationally known four-year liberal arts institution recognized for its strong music and visual art programs. It hosts events open to the community throughout the year. Twichell Auditorium is located on the campus of Converse University. Home of the Greater Spartanburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Twichell Auditorium has served as hosts to other groups such as the Spartanburg All-County High School Band and Boston Brass. Twichell Auditorium was built in 1899 and renovated for the school&#x27;s centennial celebration in 1989. The 1500-seat auditorium is home to a 57-rank Casavant organ with 2,600+ pipes. Theatre Converse puts on several plays a year, and Converse puts on an opera annually, as well as opera scenes.

===Points of interest===
* Cottonwood Trail, walking trail located in the Edwin M. Griffin Nature Preserve that runs along part of Lawson&#x27;s Fork Creek. The trail includes picnic areas, a raised path over an extensive wetlands area and access to sporadic sandbars. Located just east of downtown, it is used frequently by cyclists, joggers and walkers. Since the Lawson&#x27;s Fork floodplain is not suitable for development, wildlife populate the area. Larger animals that can be found here include white-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, pileated woodpeckers, mallard ducks, Canada geese and snapping turtles.
* Hampton Heights Historic District, the city&#x27;s oldest intact downtown neighborhood, located a couple of blocks south of Morgan Square. Architectural styles in this neighborhood range from large Queen Anne and Neoclassical homes to cozy early 20th-century bungalows.
* Hatcher Garden and Woodland Preserve, preserve located in the midst of an urban environment. Retired social activist Harold Hatcher and his wife Josephine transformed an eroding gully into a thick woods and flower garden which now provides a haven for birds and other wildlife.

Early European settlers to this area included French fur trappers, English woodsmen, and Scots-Irish farmers. Few remnants survive from these early pioneering days, but traces can be found in the more rural areas of the county.

* Lawson&#x27;s Fork Creek, tributary of the Pacolet River, was once known for its plentiful wildlife and crystal clear waters. Parks and woodlands line much of its banks (which lie entirely within Spartanburg County), and rocky shoals and natural waterfalls can be found throughout its course. It stretches from the northern end of the county to the eastern end, where it empties into the Pacolet River.
* Jammie Seay House, another 18th-century home, is a more typical representative of a pioneer home. Its single stone fireplace and simple construction were common traits of farmsteads from this period.

First established in the 1780s as a courthouse village, Spartanburg may have been named for the Spartan regiment of the South Carolina militia. The city was incorporated in 1831, at the time of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Cowpens, a pivotal fight of the American Revolution that took place only a few miles away. The city&#x27;s streets and architectural record reflect the changes of the 19th and 20th centuries.

* Magnolia Street Train Depot, one of the older buildings in Spartanburg and stands as a reminder of Spartanburg&#x27;s old nickname &quot;the Hub City,&quot; referring to the many transportation routes that connected Spartanburg with cities throughout the region. It is now the home of the Amtrak station, the Hub City Railroad Museum, and the Hub City Farmers&#x27; Market.
* Morgan Square, the city&#x27;s primary downtown hub, is the original courthouse village. It was founded adjacent to a small spring (now underground) on the western slope of a ridge, which forms the border of the Tyger and Pacolet River watersheds. The square&#x27;s name derives from Daniel Morgan, the general who commanded the American forces at Cowpens. A statue of Morgan was placed in the square in 1881. The oldest existing buildings on Morgan Square date to the 1880s.
* The Price House, the third 18th-century home maintained by the Historical Association, is unique. Its sturdy Flemish-bond brick construction and three stories are less common in this area. By carefully examining the original inventory lists of the house, the Historical Association has been able to retrieve period pieces that approximate the original contents of the house.
* Walnut Grove Plantation, an 18th-century farmhouse, has been preserved by The Spartanburg County Historical Association. The site of a locally famous skirmish during the American Revolutionary War, it was the home of the Moore family. The plantation lies south of Spartanburg near the town of Roebuck, and is open to the public for tours and during annual festivals.

Cotton mills have abounded in the Spartanburg area since 1816, earning Spartanburg the reputation as the &quot;Lowell of the South.&quot; Although there were few mills in the area before the Civil War, technological advances, northern capital, and out-migration from the poor farms that made white labor available, created a wave of postbellum mill development here and in much of the Piedmont South. Additionally, the abundant streams and rivers in the area are just beginning their descent towards the lower-lying Midlands region. In many places, these waterways descend abruptly, providing a source for plentiful waterpower. Cotton mills were built along these rivers to harness this power, and so began the region&#x27;s servitude to King Cotton. These mills, their owners and their slaves dominated the politics and economy of the region for nearly a century. Although nearly all abandoned, many mills remain along the riverbanks, the Piedmont equivalent of Gothic ruins.

* Beaumont Mill, north of the downtown, has recently been purchased by Spartanburg Regional Healthcare who moved their billing, human resources, and medical records to the mill. The adjacent mill village has been designated as a local historic district.
* Converse Mill, located east of the city along the Pacolet River. It has recently been purchased by a developer. The mill was reconstructed in 1903 after a huge flood washed away the original mill. The dam is still in use by Converse Energy Inc as a hydroelectric plant.

* Glendale Mill, located off Lawson&#x27;s Fork Creek, southeast of the city. Although gutted by fire in 2004, a few towers and smokestacks remain, providing a dramatic backdrop to the dam, shoals and waterfalls of the creek below. The former company store now serves as the home of the Wofford College Environmental Studies Center. The Glendale Shoals bridge will be getting a $600,000 makeover, and will ultimately connect to the state&#x27;s Palmetto Trail.

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, one of the sixteen divisional cantonments for the training of National Guard troops was Camp Wadsworth, which is located in the vicinity of Westgate Mall. Large numbers of New York National Guardsmen trained there in addition to many southern troops. During World War II, Camp Croft south of the city trained Army recruits. This is now a South Carolina state park with the same name. Some portions of the park contain the original quonset huts.

<text>Woodruff is a city in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 4,333 at the 2020 census. The city is part of the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1787, Joseph Woodruff, his brothers, and other family were listed as members and deacons in the earliest minutes of the Church of Christ at Jamey’s Creek, which would later become Woodruff Baptist Church. As early as 1789, Woodruff purchased two hundred acres of land on Jamey’s Creek, including the present site of Woodruff. By 1825, Woodruff post office (which took its name from the postmaster Thomas Woodruff, Joseph’s son) and Woodruff’s Tavern dominated the crossroads.

Situated in the midst of an expanding cotton region, Woodruff developed as a trade center for the rural farming communities. By the 1850s the town was hosting substantial fairs for the exchange of livestock and domestic manufactures. Woodruff was incorporated in 1874 with a population estimated at 150, but with the coming of the railroad in 1885 the population had grown to an estimated 1,600 by 1886. As a terminus on the rail line, the station at Woodruff included a turntable that would return trains to Augusta, Georgia.

A fair that began in the 1870s grew into a major annual event by the 1890s, drawing visitors from as far away as North Carolina. During the 1880s and 1890s construction steadily progressed along Main Street, with the popular Leatherwood Hotel as the focal point. Industry came to town in 1898 with the arrival of Woodruff Cotton Oil Company, and within three years the newly chartered Woodruff Cotton Mill began operation. By 1907 the W.S. Gray Cotton Mill was established, further expanding Woodruff’s residential base with additional mill houses. Until World War II the major diversion from textiles in the area was peaches, with more than 200,000 trees within a ten-mile radius. During the 1950s, with industries settling near large cities, Woodruff saw a four percent drop in population. But with the 1962 opening of the Jeffery Manufacturing Company plant costing US$2,500,000 (), the town’s industrial base grew and diversified. New jobs attracted residents, and Woodruff’s population reached 4,576 by 1970.

==History==
The town was named for the Mayes family of early settlers after the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad cut through the Mayes&#x27; property and began as Mayes Station in 1852, replacing an earlier name of Bradleyville, South Carolina.

Fortunes made in cotton and tobacco created wealthy landowners in this area of South Carolina. Mayesville served the local area as a place to process and sell these products and to obtain supplies. Merchants such as I.W. Bradley, Witherspoon Cooper and Isaac Strauss opened some of the earliest businesses in town. The town suffered greatly during the Civil War but thrived again for several decades beginning in about 1880.

The patriarch of the Mayes family, Matthew Peterson Mayes II, known as &quot;the Squire,&quot; had been a merchant in Raleigh, North Carolina, was wounded in the War of 1812, and then turned to farming. Purchasing an existing plantation prior to 1819, he turned this small beginning into an empire that would survive the Civil War. He died in 1879 and was buried in the historic cemetery at Salem Black River Presbyterian Church. His great-great grandson James Edgar Mayes, known locally as “Bubba Jim&quot; presided over an 8,000-acre cotton plantation in Mayesville and served as president of the National Cotton Council before his death in 1994. His passing was recognized by the South Carolina Legislature.

<text>Sumter ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Sumter County, South Carolina, United States. The city makes up the Sumter, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sumter County, along with Clarendon and Lee counties, form the core of Sumter–Lee–Clarendon tri-county (or East Midlands) area of South Carolina that includes three counties straddling the border of the Sandhills (or Midlands), Pee Dee, and Lowcountry regions. The population was 43,463 at the 2020 census, making it the 9th-most populous city in the state.

==History==
Incorporated as Sumterville in 1845, the city&#x27;s name was shortened to Sumter in 1855. It has grown and prospered from its early beginnings as a plantation settlement. The city and county of Sumter bear the name of General Thomas Sumter, the &quot;Fighting Gamecock&quot; of the American Revolutionary War.

During the Civil War, the town was an important supply and railroad repair center for the Confederacy. After the war, Sumter grew and prospered, using its large railroad network to supply cotton, timber, and by the start of the 20th century, tobacco to the region.

During the 20th century, Sumter grew into a major industrial center. Still a unique business founded in 1923, Palmetto Pigeon Plant has grown into one of the largest producers of squab, poussin (chicken), cornish game hen, and silkie chickens in the world. Starting with the opening of Shaw Air Force Base (now home to the 9th Air Force, 20th Fighter Wing, and United States Army Central) in 1941, industry grew, especially after World War II. Sumter became increasingly known for textiles, manufacturing, biotech industries, special chemistry (Branch of Swiss-based Ems-Chemie), thriving retail environment, and medical center of its region in addition to agricultural products, which makes it a hub for business in the east-central portion of South Carolina.

Swan Lake Iris Gardens is the only public park in the United States containing all eight known species of swan. The lake is dotted with islands and wildlife. The park is also home to some of the nation&#x27;s most intensive plantings of Japanese Iris, which bloom yearly in mid to late May and last until the beginning of June. The garden is also planted with camellias, azaleas, day lilies, and Japanese magnolias. A Braille Trail enables the sight-impaired to enjoy the scents and sensations of the gardens.

This area was first developed in 1927 as a private fishing retreat by Hamilton Carr Bland, a local businessman. At the same time he was developing the of swamp on what is now the north side of West Liberty Street, he was landscaping the grounds of his home with Japanese iris. They failed miserably, and after consulting expert horticulturists from as far away as New York, he ordered his gardener to dig up the bulbs and dump them at the swamp. The following spring, they burst into bloom.

The park is host to events and festivals throughout the year, including the annual &quot;Iris Festival&quot; which is held every Memorial Day weekend in May.

Jonesville High School and Lockhart High School were closed, and the students were reassigned to Union High School, which has been renamed Union County High School.

The city is also home to the University of South Carolina Union (USC Union), a satellite campus of the University of South Carolina. USC Union was founded in 1965 and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

Union has a public library, the Union County Carnegie Library. This Carnegie library provides services and resources for both the community and USC Union students. It was named 2009&#x27;s Best Small Library in America by Library Journal.

<doc id="134701" wikidata="Q1999913" url="?curid=134701" title="Greeleyville, South Carolina">
<text>Greeleyville is a town in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 438 at the 2010 census. The town was originally chartered on December 20, 1893. Greeleyville&#x27;s seal and flag feature a depiction of the first Town Hall, which was built in the 1890s, as well as two arms, one black and one white, holding a tobacco leaf and a cotton boll. These symbols represent the unity and cooperation among all the people of Greeleyville and pay tribute to the town&#x27;s agricultural heritage.

Since 1982, the town has hosted an annual Flag Day celebration each Memorial Day weekend that features bingo, street dances, barbecue, as well as various other types of vendors.

==History==
The area surrounding Greeleyville was once home to several Native American tribes, including the Wee Nee, Wee Tee, and Mingoes, who inhabited and utilized the region as hunting grounds into the eighteenth century. A remnant population of Native Americans, known as the Goins Indian Community, has lived just north of Greeleyville since the mid-nineteenth century, predating the town of Greeleyville. The community once maintained its own church and during the era of racial segregation, had a state-funded school that operated until 1949. The community today still exists and alleges to be descended from the Wee Nee, among other historic tribes of the Carolinas.

The settlement of Greeleyville traces back to the late nineteenth century, when Samuel J. Taylor, a veteran of the American Civil War, came to the present site of the town with his partner, S.J. Hudson. The two together bought several hundred acres of timber and began the manufacture of turpentine and rosin. Three years later Taylor bought out his partner and began to work with his brother-in-law, W.S. Varner. Taylor used his expertise in the mercantile industry to bring prosperity to the area and although his timber holdings became exhausted within the first fifteen years, opted to remain in the emerging town for both financial and sentimental reasons. Taylor owned 1,200 acres within present-day town limits and, in the pursuit of promoting a town community, would donate land to every industrious and capable man willing to build a home in the area. He also gave land freely for streets, churches, and schools within the town. Greeleyville obtained its name when Taylor, who was depending on the turpentine industry, had ordered a bill of goods for his store and was in need of an address. When Taylor, who was a staunch supporter of Horace Greeley, presented the idea of naming the town to local residents, the majority voted in favor of naming the town in honor of Greeley. It is local lore that Greeley once visited the town and became stranded there, while campaigning for presidency. On December 20, 1893, the town was officially chartered as Greeleyville.

Thomas Walter Boyle was a key figure in the development of Greeleyville during the early 20th century. He held several important positions in the town, including vice-president of the Mallard Lumber Company and president of the Bank of Greeleyville and the Greeleyville Land &amp; Improvement Company. In 1904, Mallard Lumber Company had become the main enterprise of Greeleyville, shipping a variety of types of lumber north for sale. Boyle&#x27;s efforts in local manufacturing, merchandising, and other fields significantly contributed to the growth and prosperity of Greeleyville. Before Boyle&#x27;s arrival in 1886, the town was relatively small, with only a saw mill, a single store, and two dwelling houses. The nearest school and telegraph office were located several miles away in Foreston, South Carolina. Within thirty-five years, Greeleyville was characterized by various forms of industry and enterprise.

By the mid twentieth century, most sources of employment once available to residents of Greeleyville were no longer existent and this led many to begin seeking work in other communities throughout the state. In 1978, the town gained a medical center and four years later, in 1982, a pharmacy was opened on the site of the town&#x27;s former mule and livery stable. The town&#x27;s only chain grocery store, IGA, moved to a larger location with expanded parking in 1984. The store later closed and a Super G Foods Store opened in the same location before going out of business in 2008. During the twenty-first century, many shops once located in downtown Greeleyville became abandoned due to competition with big-box stores and other businesses located along nearby U.S. Highway 521.

On May 21, 2021, the town of Greeleyville gathered for the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Jonte-Sabb Farmer&#x27;s Market and Pavilion. The structure is named for senator Ronnie A. Sabb and the late Leonard Jonte, the former CEO and president of the Bank of Greeleyville, who died in 2008. Jonte devoted countless hours to preserving and bettering the town, having co-founded the Greeleyville Flag Day Festival and having served on the Greeleyville Beautification Committee. He also purchased the Varner House, the former home of Samuel J. Taylor, which is thought to be the oldest structure in the town, and opened it to the public as a museum housing historical memorabilia.

===Burning of Mt. Zion AME Church===
On the night of June 20, 1995, during a string of over thirty suspicious fires at African American churches between 1995 and 1996, Mount Zion AME Church was burned as the result of arson by two Ku Klux Klan members. President Bill Clinton traveled to Greeleyville in June 1996 to attend the dedication of the rebuilt church, vowing to enlist the full power of the federal government to put an end to the mass burnings of African American churches prevalent at the time. The church became a national symbol of arsons following Clinton&#x27;s visit to Greeleyville.

<text>Hemingway is a town in Williamsburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 504 as of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Hemingway was created from a crossroads community named Lamberts in 1911 by Dr. W. C. Hemingway, in an effort to secure a depot for the proposed Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which was to run from Mullins to Andrews. Land owned by Dr. Hemingway was surveyed and the lots auctioned off. Subsequently, the railroad established a Hemingway depot, and the post office name was changed to Hemingway.

With rail access, Hemingway grew into a market town for local agricultural products. Cotton declined after 1921, when the boll weevil arrived, but was already being replaced by flue-cured tobacco as the primary money crop for farmers. Other local products were naval stores from the pine forests (later replaced by timbering), corn, soybeans, wheat, and vegetables.

Hemingway is near the Pee Dee River, which was the main commercial route for the area until the coming of the railroad. Snows Lake is near Hemingway. This is also a site in the Revolutionary War camp of US war hero General Francis Marion. The river was named by early explorers after the Pee Dee tribe. A major tributary is the Waccamaw River, likewise named.

Pleasant Hill Consolidated School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, 573 people, 259 households, and 182 families resided in the town. The population density was . The 278 housing units averaged 316.9 per square mile (122.0/km). The racial makeup of the town was 80.80% White, 18.50% African American, 0.35% Native American, 0.17% from other races, and 0.17% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 0.17% of the population. 
Of the 259 households, 26.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.4% were married couples living together, 15.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.7% were not families. About 29.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.21 and the average family size was 2.71.

In the town, the population was distributed as 22.3% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 21.3% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 23.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 82.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.2 males.

==Economy==
Besides agriculture, the manufacture of textiles has been important in the past, with numerous sewing factories, but most of these have since closed. Talous, where insect-resistant suits for sportsmen are sewed, and Hemingway Apparel, are exceptions. Important industries today are Tupperware (plastic kitchenware), House of Raeford (meat products), C-V Unlimited (remanufactured auto parts), Don&#x27;s Scrap Iron and Metal Co., Southeastern Wire Fabricators, Inc. (manufactured wire products), and Palmetto Paper Tube. Some people commute to Wellman Industries in Johnsonville, South Carolina or to International Paper Company or Georgetown Steel in Georgetown. Williamsburg County runs a bus service for workers who commute to nearby Myrtle Beach, which offers jobs in the hospitality industry and construction.

In June 2024, Tupperware announced the closure of its factory in Hemingway and the layoff of almost 150 people. The factory had opened in April 1976, but layoffs previously occurred of 300 people in 1996 and 250 in 2005. Tupperware itself was in bankruptcy by September 2024.

Hemingway has always been associated with Johnsonville, which, though divided by a county line, is only north, and they are sometimes referred to locally as the twin cities. Hemingway recently completed a new industrial park midway between the two cities, with a deep well and sewer service.

== Arts and culture ==
Hemingway hosts the annual Bar-B-Q Shag Festival held in the spring. This features a cookoff of low country-style pork barbecue, and dancing of the official state dance of South Carolina - the Carolina shag.

Hemingway has a public library, a branch of the Williamsburg County Library.

<text>Kingstree is a city in and the county seat of Williamsburg County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 3,328 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The original town was laid out as Williamsburg by the Lords Proprietors in colonial times, but a lone, unusually large white pine was found along the Black River. Since tall white pines were ideal for use as masts for ships, it was claimed by the Crown on behalf of the king. The broad arrow mark was carved into the tree to prevent any colonists from cutting it. Though white pines are native to the Appalachians as far south as Georgia, it is the only tree of King George’s ever found in the South. Over time, the county kept the name Williamsburg, but the county seat became known as the King&#x27;s Tree. In 1867 Twenty-two African-American prisoners were killed in a fire at the jail.

===Battles===
====Battle of the Lower Bridge====

Williamsburg Presbyterian Church was founded in August 1736. The church consisted of three structures. Its founders built the first church in 1738 across from the Williamsburg Cemetery in town; the second building was constructed in 1828 and was across from the Williamsburg Cemetery as well. The third, the current structure of the church located on North Academy Street was built in 1914. The stained glass windows on the roof of the church today were imported from Austria. One of the stained glass windows on the roof was removed in 1989 during a renovation and was placed behind the pulpit of the sanctuary. The first person to be buried in the church cemetery was John Witherspoon(1670–1737), the father of James Witherspoon, builder of Thorntree.

Witherspoon was a part of Francis Marion&#x27;s brigade. After Witherspoon&#x27;s death, Witherspoon&#x27;s son inherited the plantation home. The British occupied the home during the revolution when it was at its original location, on the Black River. Gavin Witherspoon was the owner at the time. The house was later moved to its current location in 1969 when it was being restored by the Williamsburg Historical Society and is currently registered by the National Historic Register.

<doc id="134706" wikidata="Q2230289" url="?curid=134706" title="Clover, South Carolina">
<text>Clover is a town in York County, South Carolina, United States. It is located in the greater Charlotte metropolitan area. As of 2020, the population was at 6,671 within the town limits.
Clover is twinned with the Northern Irish town of Larne on County Antrim&#x27;s East Coast.

== History ==
Clover was founded just north of an earlier settlement, New Centre, which had waned during the Civil War. The pivotal American Revolutionary War battle of Kings Mountain occurred approximately eight miles to the west of modern-day Clover, on October 7, 1780.

Prior to Clover&#x27;s founding, Bethany and Bethel, communities to the west and east, respectively, were primary population centers in northern York District, with well-established Presbyterian churches, post offices and stores serving the area&#x27;s numerous cotton farms.

The village of Clover began as a railway stop in 1876, midway between Yorkville, and modern-day Gastonia, North Carolina, when the first railroad tracks were laid through the northern section of the county.

Before the Civil War, the Kings Mountain Railroad had operated as far north as Yorkville from Chester, but the tracks were destroyed during the war. In 1873, the Chester and Lenoir Narrow Gauge Railroad was officially chartered and acquired the Kings Mountain rights of way. By 1875, new, narrow-gauge railway replaced the remnants of the former Kings Mountain line, and the following year the tracks were extended from Yorkville to Gaston County, North Carolina. A water tank for the railway&#x27;s steam locomotives was constructed midway between Gastonia and Yorkville.

According to lore, the overflow of water from the railway&#x27;s water tank fertilized a patch of clover, and the stop was called &quot;the clover patch.&quot; The town was officially incorporated in 1887.

It later became the home of several cotton mills, many of which operated until after World War II.

The Bethel Presbyterian Church and Clover Downtown Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography and climate==
Clover is located at (35.112194, -81.226848).

Henry&#x27;s Knob, a mountain west of Clover, is the site of a former open-pit mining operation for what was formerly the world&#x27;s largest deposit of kyanite. The mountain stands at 1120 ft above sea level. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) records, the mine is listed as a Superfund Alternative Site for acid mine drainage and groundwater contamination.

<doc id="134707" wikidata="Q2291273" url="?curid=134707" title="Fort Mill, South Carolina">
<text>Fort Mill, also known as Fort Mill Township, is a town in York County, South Carolina, United States. It is a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 24,521. Some businesses and residents in the Indian Land community of neighboring Lancaster County share a Fort Mill mailing address, but the official town boundary extends only within York County.

The Fort Mill area is home to notable businesses such as the headquarters of Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps (who were DCI World Champions in 2013), LPL Financial, Continental Tire the Americas (Lancaster County), LLC., CompuCom Systems, Diversey, Inc., Sunbelt Rentals, Domtar, Springs Industries, Shutterfly, Red Ventures (Lancaster County), Daimler Trucks North America, and Puckerbutt Pepper Company, known for originally producing the Carolina Reaper and Pepper X.

==History==
The town of Fort Mill was established in 1873, getting its name from its location between two points, the first, a fort constructed by British in colonial times to protect the Catawba Indians from marauding tribes to the north, and the second point of Webb&#x27;s Mill. The Catawba Indians made their home in present-day Fort Mill for many years. Scots-Irish settlers began arriving in the 1750s and 1760s and a small settlement soon developed. Fort Mill grew rapidly in the late 19th century as textile mills were established. After many textile mill shut-downs the town continued to grow rapidly and became a major suburb of Charlotte.

Highlights in Fort Mill&#x27;s history include:
* In the mid-18th century, Thomas Spratt and his wife Elizabeth were traveling through upper South Carolina in their wagon. They spent a night among the friendly Catawba Indians and were invited to stay and live in the area on a large tract of land given to them. They became the first white settlers in the Fort Mill area and their descendants still reside there. Their descendant, John Spratt, represented the area in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2011.
* The town of Fort Mill was the site of the last Confederate Government Cabinet meeting (1865). Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Cabinet passed through the area during their flight from Richmond in 1865. The last meeting of the full Confederate Cabinet was held at the White Homestead in Fort Mill. Fort Mill&#x27;s Confederate Park contains the nation&#x27;s only monument to slaves laboring on the Confederate side of the American Civil War.
* In the 1970s and 1980s, Fort Mill was the home to TV evangelist Jim Bakker&#x27;s now defunct Heritage USA (now reopened as Heritage International Ministries).

The Banks-Mack House, Fort Mill Downtown Historic District, Mack-Belk House, Mills House, Nation Ford Road, National Guard Armory, Spratt Cemetery, Springfield Plantation House, Thornwell-Elliott House, Unity Presbyterian Church Complex, John M. White House, William Elliott White House, and Wilson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Lake Wylie is a census-designated place (CDP) in York County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 8,841 at the 2010 census. Lake Wylie is located on a peninsula along the shore of Lake Wylie, a reservoir that was named for Dr. W. Gil Wylie in 1960. It is a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Geography==
Lake Wylie is located on a peninsula along the shore of Lake Wylie in the Piedmont of both North and South Carolina, at (35.105973, -81.056978). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (26.58%) is water. The average elevation of the town is 512 feet.

As a result of the community&#x27;s proximity to the state line between North and South Carolina, it has been significantly affected by recent efforts to resurvey the state line using modern global positioning system technology. The process moved the state line approximately southward in the Lake Wylie area, resulting in several properties in the community now being located in South Point Township in North Carolina — including one property where the new state line falls between the owner&#x27;s house and his back deck, and a gas station and convenience store whose owner has noted that differences in gas prices and retail regulations between the two states will probably force him out of business.

The Post Office considers much of the CDP to be unincorporated Clover.

==Climate==
Lake Wylie has a humid subtropical climate, characterized by humid summers and cool dry winters. Precipitation does not vary greatly by amount between seasons with snow, rain, and sleet in the winter months and mostly rain in the summer months with occasional hail from strong thunderstorms. July is the hottest month, with an average high temperature of below and an average low temperature of around . The coldest month of the year is January, when the average high temperature is below and the average low temperature is below .

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 13,655 people, 4,869 households, and 3,894 families residing in the CDP.

===2010 census===
At the 2010 census, there were 8,841 people, 1,458 households and 1,039 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 1,610 housing units at an average density of . The racial make-up was 97.68% White, 1.05% African American, 0.26% Native American, 0.75% Asian, 0.07% from other races and 0.02% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.82% of the population.

There were 1,458 households, of which 16.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.3% were married couples living together, 3.8% had a female with no husband present, and 28.7% were non-families. 24.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10 and the average family size was 2.47.

13.5% of the population were under the age of 18, 4.4% from 18 to 24, 21.9% from 25 to 44, 36.9% from 45 to 64, and 23.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 51 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.8 males.

The median household income was $76,819 and the median family income was $88,208. Males had a median income of $50,208 and females $32,679. The per capita income was $43,567. None of the families and 0.8% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

Lake Wylie&#x27;s population grew to around 12,000 during the 2010s as younger families were drawn there from all over the U.S. by low tax rates and the local schools. As a result, local infrastructure such as the roads and the water supply system were stressed by the demand, with traffic congestion regularly occurring on local roads and frequent boil-water advisories. York County has declared a moratorium on all new construction in order to better plan the area&#x27;s development.

==Education==
Lake Wylie has a public library, a branch of the York County Library.

The CDP is part of York County School District 2 (Clover School District).

<text>Rock Hill is the most populous city in York County, South Carolina, United States, and the 5th-most populous city in the state. It is also the 4th-most populous city of the Charlotte metropolitan area, behind Charlotte, Concord, and Gastonia (all located in North Carolina). As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 74,372.

The city is located approximately south of Charlotte and approximately north of Columbia.

Rock Hill offers scenic riverfront views along the Catawba River and is home to numerous nature trails, restaurants, and thirty-one parks which are used for both national and local events. Its historic downtown consist of twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1840 offering dining and retail options. The city is also home to three colleges, including Winthrop University, a public liberal arts university founded in 1886 which enrolls nearly 6,000 students annually.

==History==
===Founding===
Although some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of Ebenezerville which was squarely between Charlotte, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it &quot;rocky hill.&quot;

Some of Rock Hill&#x27;s early founding families—the White family, the Black family, and the Moores—believed that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As they were the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. George Pendleton White contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.

Now that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers. Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.

Rock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. Ann Hutchinson White, wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband&#x27;s death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.

Prior to 1857, the &quot;Indian Land Chronicle&quot; was Rock Hill&#x27;s first newspaper. It was renamed &quot;The Rock Hill Chronicle&quot; in 1860. Prior to 1860, Rock Hill had at least two doctors.

===American Civil War===
Shortly before the American Civil War began, a census had been taken of the population in York County where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district&#x27;s 21,800 residents were enslaved people, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men had died, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.

Due to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or General Sherman&#x27;s troops, also came to Rock Hill.

Beginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food. Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the Confederate paper money.

Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865. He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.

When General Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Court House, it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by General James Longstreet to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.

===Post-Civil War===
The Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South. Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight in the war. The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially. Town life would begin to become more important than rural life.

Most of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over. In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one story tall, and there were no sidewalks along the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s. A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town&#x27;s first paved sidewalk.

===Incorporation===
The town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.

The first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855. No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.

The second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, &quot;eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.&quot; The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring. They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary. The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.

The third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868&#x27;s failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.

===Civil rights movement===
Rock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the civil rights movement. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the York County prison farm after staging a sit-in at a segregated McCrory&#x27;s lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill. The current location is now known as &quot;Kounter&quot; which has the names of the activists engraved. Their offense was reported to be &quot;refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions.&quot; The event gained nationwide attention as the men followed an untried strategy called &quot;jail, no bail.&quot; Rejecting bail was a way to lessen the huge financial burden which civil rights groups were facing as the sit-in movement spread across the South. As their actions gained widespread national news coverage, the tactic was adopted by other civil rights groups. The men became known as the Friendship Nine because eight of the nine men were students at Rock Hill&#x27;s Friendship Junior College.

Later in 1961, Rock Hill was the first stop in the Deep South for a group of 13 Freedom Riders, who boarded buses in Washington, DC, and headed South to test the 1960 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court outlawing racial segregation in all interstate public facilities. When the civil rights leader John Lewis and another black man stepped off the bus at Rock Hill, they were beaten by a white mob that was uncontrolled by police. The event drew national attention.

In 2002, Lewis, by then a US Congressman from Georgia, returned to Rock Hill, where he had been invited as a speaker at Winthrop University and was given the key to the city. On January 21, 2008, Rep. Lewis returned to Rock Hill again and spoke at the city&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr. Day observance. Mayor Doug Echols officially apologized to him on the city&#x27;s behalf for the Freedom Riders&#x27; treatment in the city.
===20th century to present===
Rock Hill experienced steady growth in the twentieth century. The city boundary expanded far beyond its original limits. Four unincorporated communities of York County were annexed into the city including Boyd Hill in the late 1940s, Ebenezer and Mexico in the 1960s, and Oakdale in the 1980s.

Rock Hill celebrated its centennial in 1952 and its sesquicentennial in 2002.

Rock Hill hosted the 2017 UCI BMX World Championships at the Rock Hill BMX Supercross Track in Riverwalk with an estimated direct economic impact of $19.2 million.

On April 7, 2021, former NFL player Phillip Adams shot and killed six people, including two children, at a house in Rock Hill. He committed suicide the next day.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.36%) is water.

Rock Hill is located along the Catawba River in the north-central section of the Piedmont of South Carolina, south of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina. The city sits at an elevation of around above sea level. It is located approximately from the Atlantic Ocean and from the Blue Ridge Mountains. The northern limits of the city reside along Lake Wylie, a large man-made reservoir.

===Neighborhoods===
Rock Hill consists of numerous neighborhoods, some of which were independent towns and communities at one time that were later annexed into Rock Hill city limits.

*Downtown, the city&#x27;s central business district that is home to twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1870. It is also home to the city&#x27;s government offices and numerous restaurants.
*Ebenezer, located north of downtown along Ebenezer Road. This area is home to Piedmont Medical Center as well as both newly developed subdivisions and historic neighborhoods.
*Oakdale, southern city limits located south of downtown and bordered by S.C. Highway 901 to the north and east. The area is home to South Pointe High School and the Rock Hill Country Club golf course.
*Newport, while still considered to be a census-designated place, has been mostly annexed into the city. This fast-growing area with numerous subdivisions is home to the Rock Hill Aquatic Center and located northwest of Ebenezer along S.C. Highway 161.
*Boyd Hill, historic neighborhood bordered by downtown to the south, Ebenezer to the north and S.C. Highway 901 to the west. While the neighborhood is often considered a low-income portion of the city, it is also home to the city&#x27;s municipal football and soccer stadium.

===Natural disasters===
Four notable major natural disasters have struck the city since 1926.

====1926 Rock Hill tornado====
On November 26, 1926, a destructive tornado struck downtown Rock Hill. It was the day after Thanksgiving, late in the season for such a violent storm. The &quot;black as ink twister&quot; took less than 10 minutes to change the face of the business section. The storm touched down in western York County, and entered Rock Hill from the west. Once in the town, the twister cut a path about three blocks wide, leaving 60 homes heavily damaged, the hospital roof removed, and cars flipped or crushed. By the end, the total damage for the whole town was $150,000. The tornado was responsible for one death and 12 injuries within Rock Hill.

====Hurricane Hugo====
Hurricane Hugo struck the city on the morning of September 22, 1989. The storm ripped through the city with sustained winds over , toppling massive oak and pine trees. Schools were closed for weeks because of widespread damage to roads and facilities. The total damage cost for the entire state of South Carolina was around $4.2 billion. The storm was a category 3 when it entered the county and was a category 2 as it left the county.

====The &quot;Great Carolina Snowstorm&quot; of 2004====
A complex series of low pressure systems moved across South Carolina from February 25–27 of 2004. Starting as a mix of snow and sleet, the storm became all snow as the low pulled off the Carolina coast. Cold arctic air settled over the Carolinas and dumped of snow, with lightning, gusty winds, and some areas getting up to . Sustained winds over across Rock Hill knocked out power, resulting in schools&#x27; closing for a week. It was the worst overall blizzard to hit the area.

====2011 Rock Hill Tornado====
During the Tornado outbreak of November 14–16, 2011, a deadly EF-2 tornado struck about south and southwest of Rock Hill that travelled for after touchdown. The storm, which left a wide path of destruction and had wind speeds of up to , left 3 people dead, caused 5 injuries, and 7-8 damaged homes. This event caused the first ever tornado related deaths to be recorded in York Country history.

<text>York is a city in and the county seat of York County, South Carolina, United States. The population was approximately 6,985 at the 2000 census and up to 7,736 at the 2010 census. York is located approximately southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina and west of Rock Hill, South Carolina.

== History ==

The first European settlers came to York in the early 1750s, having migrated south from Pennsylvania and Virginia. Of the three major groups settling Pennsylvania, the English came first, then the Germans, and then the Scots. The county names of Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire had been brought from England to Pennsylvania, and then on to South Carolina by the early settlers.

Prior to this, the first known inhabitants of York County were the Catawba Indians.

The town of York was originally known as Fergus&#x27;s Crossroads for a tavern, owned by two brothers, William and John Fergus, that was located at the intersection of the road from Rutherfordton to Camden and the road from Charlottesburg (Charlotte) to Augusta. When the county of York was established in 1785 the state statute required each county to erect a courthouse and public buildings in the most convenient part of the county, with a tax levied to cover the cost of &quot;building the court houses, prisons, pillories, whipping posts and stocks.&quot; Fergus&#x27;s Crossroads was near the geographic center of the newly formed county and was chosen for the site of the new county seat.

The town of Yorkville was established as the County seat in 1785. Situated between two Revolutionary battle sites, the Battle of Kings Mountain and the Battle of Williamson&#x27;s Plantation, York was the only county in South Carolina to remain undefeated during that war.

In 1823, there were 451 people living in Yorkville, 292 white and 159 black, with 80 houses in the town, eight stores, five taverns, one male academy and one female academy and a printing office. The town could boast 52 mechanics, eight lawyers, two physicians and one clergyman.

Yorkville was officially incorporated on December 7, 1841. W. I. Clawson was the first mayor, and Stanhope Sadler, F. M. Galbraith, T. H. Simril and B. T. Wheeler were . The population was about 800. Over the next two decades, before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Yorkville&#x27;s population swelled to 2,000. In 1860 a gas works was installed on West Liberty Street, below the old county jail; Yorkville was the first town in the Upcountry with gas lighting.

In 1853, Lewis Grist bought his father&#x27;s newspaper and changed the name to the &quot;Yorkville Enquirer&quot;, which was published weekly until 2006, when it was merged with the &quot;Clover Herald&quot; to form the &quot;Enquirer-Herald&quot;, a weekly newspaper covering western York County.

In 1915, the residents of the town voted to shorten its name to &quot;York&quot;.

===Antebellum education===
Private academies operated on and off during Yorkville&#x27;s early years. In 1854, the Yorkville Female Academy was established on East Jefferson Street. The next year, Micah Jenkins and Asbury Coward, young Citadel graduates, established the King&#x27;s Mountain Military Academy. It was closed during the Civil War, during which Jenkins was killed, but Coward returned to Yorkville and reopened the school. The original buildings no longer stand, but it became the site of the Episcopal Church Home for Children, an orphanage located for many years in York, which is today a treatment center for emotionally disturbed children named York Place.

=== Historic sites ===
Allison Plantation, Hart House, Wilson House, Witherspoon-Hunter House, York County Courthouse, and York Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Rose Hotel was built in 1852, by Dr. E.A. Crenshaw and was referred to in the Lowcountry as one of the most palatial hotels in the Upcountry. Today it has been restored and completely renovated as apartments.

The First Presbyterian Church was designed in 1846 by Robert Walker, a noted architect from Charleston, but construction wasn&#x27;t begun until several years later and wasn&#x27;t completed until after the Civil War. A gallery originally lined three sides of the sanctuary, part of it remains as a rear balcony, and the chancel originally featured a single uplifted pulpit that was converted in 1949 to a divided chancel and choir loft. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the American Presbyterian and Reformed Historical Sites.

The present York County Courthouse was completed in 1914 and an annex was built in 1955, which completes the present structure, the fourth courthouse to occupy the site. The third courthouse, which was torn down in 1912 to make way for the present one, was designed by Robert Mills, the architect of the Washington Monument and the U.S. Treasury Building, as well as many other courthouses in South Carolina. Most county court functions are conducted now at the Moss Justice Center, on the eastern edge of town.

In 1976, as a part of the National Bicentennial, downtown York was designated a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places, one of the largest historic districts in the state, consisting of and containing over 180 historic structures and landmarks.

Huron was founded during railroad and land booms in the 1880s. The early history of the town is closely linked with the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. At the direction of Marvin Hughitt, general manager of the railroad, the west bank of the James River was selected as the railway&#x27;s division headquarters. The company gained title to of land at that location. Huron was named for the Huron Indians.

The original plat covered 11 blocks, and Huron&#x27;s first settler was John Cain, a practical printer from Troy, New York. He learned in Chicago, from the railroad people, that they would have their chief town and operating headquarters at their James River crossing.

Beginning in 1880, Huron and Pierre vied to be selected as the state capital, until Pierre was chosen in 1904. Campbell Park and Winter Park in Huron were previously designated as properties for the capital grounds, and a city block of land between the parks with Victorian houses was originally slated for the capitol building.

==Sports==

The only two sports teams in Aurora are both baseball teams, American Legion Baseball Post 230 (2002–Present) &amp; the Aurora A&#x27;s (2000-2018), who became the Aurora Aces (2019–present). Both programs play their home games at Langland Field (formerly referred to as Aurora Ballpark), dedicated on October 19, 2019, in memorial to Jake Langland (June 29, 1985 - June 1, 2019), who played three season with Post 230 (2003–05), co-managed the team in 2006, and played for the A&#x27;s 2006–07. Langland Field is located two blocks west of the city water tower, on Maple Ave., with the left field bordered by W. Pine St. and right field bordered by Oak Ave.

The ballpark&#x27;s concession stand, bathrooms, and in-ground dugouts were installed for the 2002 season, its original Dakotronics scoreboard was installed for the 2003 season, its lights during the 2004 season (purchased by the city, with crane installation donated by the then new local ethanol plant, Verasun Energy. Players and their families provided volunteer labor for the lighting install. Due to inoperability, the original scoreboard was replaced with an equivalent model, refurbished Dakotronics scoreboard in late 2019, during the Langland dedication (thanks to the orchestration of Alex Ohm, friend and legion teammate of Jake Langland). In 2021, Bob Shelden Field (Brookings, SD) was renovated, and half of the original &quot;Wenande Pressbox” (named for donator, Rick Wenande) was relocated by Terry Anderson to Langland Field and installed on an elevated platform behind the home plate bleachers. Prior to this, Langland Field had no pressbox. In 2022, and due to city drainage issues, the city extracted the in-ground dugouts in favor of above-ground dugouts to-be-built for the 2023 season.
Post 230 is classified as a District 1A team, as it plays within the geographical area designated as District 1 by the state ‘legion&#x27; commission and obtains at least a portion of its players from neighboring Brookings High School (a school possessing an &quot;A&quot; enrollment status under American Legion by-laws, which are based on population. Despite the 1A designation, Post 230 plays the majority of its regular season games against &quot;B&quot; division opponents. However, if electing to compete at the district tournament, Post 230 must compete against its 1A opponents, which are Brookings, Aberdeen, Watertown, and Huron. The team&#x27;s colors have historically been blue with white, grey, and/or black.

At its peak (2006-2010), the Aurora A&#x27;s won the EDL district championship multiple times, and simultaneously possessed up to six current or former collegiate baseball players on its roster at once, from schools such as South Dakota State University (Brookings, SD), Minnesota State Community &amp; Technical College (Fergus Falls, MN), Gallaudet University (Washington D.C.), Ridgewater University (Wilmar, MN), &amp; Augustana University (Sioux Falls, SD). Over the years, other current and former collegiate players would play for the organization from colleges, such as St. Cloud Technical &amp; Community College (St. Cloud, MN), Century College (White Bear Lake, MN), &amp; Northern State University (Aberdeen, SD). In 2008, the team featured its first and only Major League Baseball draftee, Spearfish native, Derek Ver Helst (LHP), who was selected out of high school by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 21st round of the 1999 MLB draft. Derek had previously also played with the Clark Traders (Clark, SD) of the EDL.

<text>Brookings is a city in and the county seat of Brookings County, South Dakota, United States. Brookings is South Dakota&#x27;s fourth most populous city, with a population of 23,377 at the 2020 census. It is home to South Dakota State University, the state&#x27;s largest institution of higher education. Also in Brookings are the South Dakota Art Museum, the Children&#x27;s Museum of South Dakota, the annual Brookings Summer Arts Festival, and the headquarters of several manufacturing companies and agricultural operations.

==History==

===Pioneer===
The county and city were both named after one of South Dakota&#x27;s pioneer promoters, Wilmot Brookings. Brookings set out for the Dakota Territory in June 1857. He arrived at Sioux Falls on August 27, 1857, and became one of the first settlers there. He and his group represented the Western Town Company. After a time in Sioux Falls, Brookings and a companion set out for the Yankton area to locate a town in an area that was soon to be ceded by the Native Americans. This trip began in January 1858, and the two soon encountered a blizzard that froze Brookings&#x27;s feet, which both had to be amputated.
Brookings rose to a high position in the Territory, becoming a member of the Squatter Territorial Legislature and later elected Squatter Governor. He then was appointed superintendent of a road that was to be built from the Minnesota state line west to the Missouri River about 30 miles north of Ft. Pierre. It was during this road&#x27;s construction that Brookings came into contact with land that was part of this county at the time. He made settlement of this area possible for many people.

===Medary===
The first real town organized in Brookings County was Medary, in 1857. Before that, the area had been traveled and utilized only by Native Americans, with a few indistinct traces left showing the penetration of the area by explorers, missionaries, trappers, and traders. Along with Sioux Falls and Flandreau, Medary was one of the first three European settlements established in South Dakota.

The first site of Medary was located by the Dakota Land Company of Minnesota, led by Alpheus G. Fuller and Franklin J. DeWitt and accompanied by engineer Samuel A. Medary, Jr. In 1857, the men put up quarters in preparation to live out the winter in Medary. Many other settlers moved into the area in 1858. But in the spring of that year, a large group of Yankton and Yanktonnia Indians drove the settlers from the area, and Medary remained nearly abandoned for the next 11 years.

In 1869, a group of 10 Norwegian pioneers moved west into the Dakota Territory and resettled the area of Medary, about four and a half miles south of present-day Brookings. The county of Brookings was formally organized in Medary in Martin Trygstad&#x27;s cabin on July 3, 1871. The county&#x27;s original boundaries extended to two miles south of Flandreau. The territorial legislature established the current boundaries on January 8, 1873. Two other small settlements, Oakwood and Fountain, appeared in the Brookings County area around this time. All three hoped to be the town the railroad would decide to run through as it moved westward. The railroad bypassed Medary, so it became a ghost town.

===Railroad===
In fact, the railroad bypassed all three towns. When the businessmen of Medary and Fountain found out that the railroad had no plans to run through the two towns, they began a push to find a central location. Many private meetings and much effort on the part of the men of Medary and Fountain led the railroad to lay its tracks through what became the city of Brookings.

In a letter sent to Chicago on September 30, 1879, Land Commissioner Charles E. Simmons communicated the layout of the series of towns in Brookings County for the railroad to pass through: Aurora, Brookings, and Volga. Many merchants of Medary and Fountain packed up their businesses and belongings and moved to Brookings, which was surveyed and platted on October 3 and 4, 1879. Fountain ceased to exist; Medary and Oakwood remained for a while but eventually faded away. A monument still stands at the site of the old Medary as a reminder of the people who once lived there.

The railroad crossed the Minnesota state line into Brookings County on October 2, 1879. With tracks being built at about one mile per day, the track and first train reached Brookings&#x27;s Main Street on October 18, 1879. The railroad station opened a month later.

Brookings was laid out in 1880.

==Employment==

<text>Volga ( ) is a city in Brookings County, South Dakota, United States with a population of 2,113 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Volga was founded by the Western Town Lot Company on December 27, 1879, by Col. Arthur Jacoby, who had platted the area in September of that year. It was originally named &quot;Bandy Town&quot; after the Bandy family, early settlers there. In December 1879, the railroad assigned it the name &quot;Volga&quot;, either after the Volga River in Russia, or the town (and river) of Volga, Iowa. From November 1879 to May 1880, Volga was at the end of the railroad, which stimulated the settlement&#x27;s growth. By 1881, there were around 400 inhabitants. By the next year, Volga had five general stores and two hardware stores, as well as two hotels and three lumber yards. By sometime in the early 1880s, there were four hotels, chief of which was the Farrington. The lumber yard owned by the Laird, Norton Company was closed in 1884.

Volga is mentioned in the 1940 novel &quot;The Long Winter&quot; by Laura Ingalls Wilder in the chapter titled &quot;Pa Goes to Volga&quot;.

In November 1994, it was decided that a soybean processing plant – expected to create 67 jobs – would be built in Volga. Groundbreaking took place in mid-1995. In September 1996, a $32.5 million soybean processing plant opened in Volga, the first such facility in South Dakota. Described as &quot;a major agricultural hub in the Brookings area&quot;, it is able to process 85,000 bushels daily. The facility is operated by South Dakota Soybean Processors, who have since also opened a soybean plant near Miller, with plans for a plant in Mitchell. Prairie AquaTech, a fish feed company, built a facility to the south of the Volga plant in 2019.

<doc id="134758" wikidata="Q1295341" url="?curid=134758" title="Kimball, South Dakota">
<text>Kimball is a city in Brule County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 572 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Kimball was first known as Stake 48 on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad line going west out of Mitchell. In 1880, the first homestead claims were made in the vicinity of Stake 48. Kimball was organized as a village in the spring of 1883. The town was named for J. W. Kimball, a railroad surveyor.

The 1895 Holy Trinity Church is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The two major fires that hit Kimball, South Dakota, were significant events in the town’s history, both causing extensive damage to its downtown area.
The first fire occurred in 1890. At that time, the town&#x27;s buildings were primarily made of wood, which made them highly susceptible to fire. The cause of this fire isn&#x27;t well-documented, but it&#x27;s likely that an accident involving a stove, chimney, or open flame—common sources of fire in those days—started the blaze. Due to the lack of a fully developed firefighting infrastructure, the fire spread quickly, destroying many businesses and homes in the heart of Kimball&#x27;s downtown area. This fire caused significant economic damage, but the town began to rebuild afterward.

The second fire struck in 1905 and, like the first, caused widespread destruction to the downtown area. Many of the buildings that were rebuilt after the 1890 fire were damaged or destroyed once again. This fire reinforced the need for better fire safety measures, and after this second incident, more buildings were constructed using fire-resistant materials like brick and stone, which helped reduce the risk of future fires.

<doc id="134762" wikidata="Q947052" url="?curid=134762" title="Belle Fourche, South Dakota">
<text>Belle Fourche (; ) is a city in and the county seat of Butte County, South Dakota, United States. Its population was 5,617 at the 2020 census. It is near the geographic center of the United States, which moved some 550 miles (885 km) northwest from the geographic center of the contiguous United States in Lebanon, Kansas with the admission of Alaska and Hawaii in the mid-20th century.

==History==
Belle Fourche, French for &quot;beautiful fork&quot;, was named by French explorers from New France, referring to the confluence of what is now known as the Belle Fourche and Redwater Rivers and the Hay Creek. Beaver trappers worked these rivers until the mid-19th century, and Belle Fourche became a well known fur-trading rendezvous point. During and after the gold rush of 1876, farmers and ranchers settled in the fertile valleys, growing food for the miners and their animals. At the time, the open plains for hundred of miles in all directions were also being filled with huge herds of Texas and Kansas cattle. Towns sprang up to serve the ever-changing needs of the farmers and ranchers. In 1884, the Marquis de Mores, a French nobleman and contemporary of Theodore Roosevelt, established a stagecoach line between Medora, North Dakota and Deadwood, South Dakota. The Belle Fourche way station included a stage barn and a saloon.

Knowing the cattle barons and the railroad would need a place to load cattle onto freight cars for shipment to packing plants in the Midwest, Seth Bullock effectively founded the city of Belle Fourche. After serving in the Montana legislature in 1871–1873 (and being instrumental in the establishment of a National Park at Yellowstone), he had come to the Black Hills to sell supplies to the Deadwood miners. He arrived there August 2, 1876, the day Wild Bill Hickok was murdered.

During the next 14 years, Bullock acquired land as homesteaders along the Belle Fourche River &quot;proved up&quot; and sold out. When the railroad came to the Hills and refused to pay the prices demanded by the nearby township of Minnesela, he was ready. He offered the railroad free right-of-way and offered to build the terminal if the railroad placed it on his land, near the present Belle Fourche Livestock Exchange. In 1890, the first trainload of cattle headed east. By 1895, Belle Fourche was shipping 2,500 carloads of cattle per month in the peak season, making it the world&#x27;s largest livestock-shipping point. This was the start of the agriculture center of the Tri-State area for which Belle Fourche would become known.

After winning a competition with Minnesela over the railroad which now goes through Belle Fourche, Bullock&#x27;s town went on to win the county seat in the election of 1894. Still, cowboys rode into Minnesela and stole the county books.
Belle Fourche today serves a large trade area of ranches and farms. The wool, cattle, and bentonite industries have been important to the growth of Belle Fourche. The city serves as gateway to the northern Black Hills.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Geographic center of U.S.===
In 1959, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey officially designated a point 20 miles (32 km) north of Belle Fourche as the geographic center of the United States. It is the center of the nation because the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the United States moved the location of the official center of the nation. The geographic center of the 48 contiguous U.S. states is Lebanon, Kansas.

===Climate===
Belle Fourche has a climate lying on the boundary between humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Dfa&quot;) and cool semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;). It is characterized, like most of South Dakota, by summers with mild mornings giving way to very warm to hot and occasionally sweltering afternoons, and chilly, though extremely variable, winters. When cold arctic air masses move south from the Yukon unhindered by geographic obstacles, winter temperatures can fall below for prolonged periods: in the extremely cold month of January 1950 all but six mornings fell below . Contrariwise, when warm chinook winds descend from the Rocky Mountains and the Black Hills, winter temperatures can become extremely warm given the latitude and far inland location. On average, twenty afternoons in the three winter months top but in the record warm February 1954 23 of 28 afternoons topped that maximum and was reached on the 8th. The extreme warming effect of the chinook winds can be seen in – the hottest winter temperature recorded in the city – being reached on December 18, 1979 only two days after the minimum had been . The coldest month has been January 1937 with a mean of and the coldest temperature on record on December 22, 1989 – following which a chinook drove temperatures up to the following afternoon, or an increase of in less than 48 hours.

Spring warms up in fits and starts, with the first maximum of expected on March 24, and the first of expected on April 17; however, the last frost is not expected to have passed until May 10. Owing to frequent thunderstorms, the spring season is the wettest part of the year, and the wettest months since records began in 1908 has been May 1982 with of precipitation, and the highest daily precipitation has been on May 20, 1982. The summer is generally more settled than the spring, although heavy rains can occur in this period, as when fell in August 1923. Extremely hot and dry spells sometimes occur in the summer: the hottest month of July 2012 averaged and July 1936 had a mean maximum of ; in contrast, the summer of 1993 got no hotter than . The wettest calendar year in Belle Fourche has been 1946 with and the driest 1931 with , and 1931 also saw Belle Fourche reach its record high of on July 27.

Fall cooling is rapid: the first freeze can be expected on September 22, the first measurable snowfall on October 25 and the first zero temperature on November 28. Snowfall is moderate throughout the winter and spring: the annual mean is . The snowiest month has been October 2013 with and the most snowfall in one day during that month’s early cold snap on the 5th. The snowiest season has been from July 1970 to June 1971 with .

The railroad requested citizens rename the town. H.T. Mayo replied that he didn&#x27;t care what they renamed it, sarcastically suggesting, &quot;You can call it &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; for all I care.&quot;

<text>Geddes is a city in central Charles Mix County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 156 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

==Geddes Historic District==

The Geddes Historic District is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
It includes the majority of the historic small town of Geddes, which &quot;stopped growing, for the most part, by 1920,&quot; due to factors including the railroad not coming through, and its failure to win the county seat of Charles Mix County. Geddes had tried to wrest the county seat from Wheeler in 1900, 1904, and 1908, and the seat eventually went to Lake Andes, South Dakota (about away), where Charles Mix County Courthouse was built in 1918.
The oldest building in the district is the Papineau Trading Post, built in 1857 of squared plains cottonwood logs; it is actually probably the oldest building in the entire state of South Dakota. In the 1860;s it was a store, tavern, bawdy house, and county seat of Charles Mix County. It was moved from a few miles away to an open lot in what is now the southern edge of the historic district.

The other contributing buildings were mostly built during 1900-1920. These include:
*Livery Stable (1910)
*Padley Hotel, sometimes known as the Hotel Castle, a 3-story brick building, which had sun porches added to its second and third stores in 1916 when it served as a community hospital
*St. Anna&#x27;s Catholic Church (completed 1903), a two-story wooden structure with medieval-style stained glass windows, and carved exterior woodwork, still in use at date of NRHP listing.
*St. Anna&#x27;s School (completed 1917), a three-story brick building with a full basement, in plan, which was a boarding school until 1935, no longer in use as a school
*the blacksmith shop (1910), a wooden structure which was dilapidated at time of NRHP listing, but which is nice for having period tools and machinery
*The &quot;Old Dormitory&quot; (1905), which provided boarding for children of farm families during the week, for the original high
school (which was replaced in 1925).
Numerous private houses, &quot;basically the same as when they were built&quot;, are included in the district.

<doc id="134775" wikidata="Q1983451" url="?curid=134775" title="Platte, South Dakota">
<text>Platte is a city in Charles Mix County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 1,311 at the 2022 census. The community is named after the Platte Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River reservoir Lake Francis Case. Platte is located 15 miles east of Lake Francis Case on the Missouri River.

==History==
Lewis and Clark were told to watch for ‘burning bluffs’ in the area. Settlement began in the early 1880s. A fur trader named Bernard Pratte once lived at the mouth of what was then known as the ‘Fish Creek’. Pratte&#x27;s last name was mistakenly transcribed as Platte on an early map of the creek and the spelling error stuck. The town that would become Platte was named after the creek.

For 12 years, Charles Mix County was the only county in the state of South Dakota without a railroad. Platte originated in the summer of 1900 after it was selected as the terminus for a Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul railroad branch line from Yankton. The railroad arrived in October and buildings were moved from the nearby settlements of Castalia, Old Platte, and Edgerton. The Platte Enterprise newspaper was founded in 1900 and is still published today.

The Great Depression and drought of the 1930s led to unemployment and out-migration in the area. A dam was constructed on the Platte Creek during this time. The area became a place for picnics and recreation. In 1956, the Fort Randall Dam was completed creating Lake Francis Case. In 1966, the Platte-Winner Bridge was completed over the lake giving travelers a new route to and from the Black Hills.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The community is situated at the junction of Routes 44 and 45.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Platte has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Clark is a city in and county seat of Clark County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 1,148 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A post office was established at Clark in 1880. Clark was platted in 1882. The city took its name from Clark County. An early variant name was Clark Center.

In 1882, railroad tracks were first built through the middle of Clark. The Burlington Northern railroad and County Highway 212 ran parallel to one another and divided Clark into halves - the north half and the south half. Highway 212 similarly runs through the middle of Clark, and provides a direct travel route starting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, into Clark, then went to the Black Hills and to Yellowstone National Park.

Clark was officially founded in 1886, three years before South Dakota became a state. Not long after in June 1899, the local government took action, and the Clark City Council passed Ordinance No. 26. Serving as one of the first regulations enacted in Clark, Ordinance No. 26 made it unlawful for a person to ride a horse or bicycle, faster than eight miles an hour down Commercial Street. Eighteen years later, in 1917, residents from Elrod, a small town east of Clark, made a failed effort to move the county seat from Clark to Elrod. As of 2019, Clark still serves as the county seat and houses the modest Clark County Courthouse and a public library.

As for Clark&#x27;s population, the highest number of residents was during the 1950s and early 1960s, which peaked at nearly 1,500 residents. In 1970, the numbers decreased to approximately 1,356 residents, and has decreased each decade thereafter. In 2016, the estimated population of Clark was 1,050 residents, or nearly a 30% population drop from the 1960s.

In the 1960s, when the town reached its peak population, residents from surrounding municipalities commonly traveled to Clark for work, entertainment, and to attend school with the Clark Public School System. Neighboring Townships, including Thorpe, Carpenter, and Garfield, bused their students to attend school at one of the three school buildings which offered a K through 12 education.

Many residents who called Clark home lived on family farms on the outskirts of town. Those living in town mostly resided in relatively modest homes, and often worked in the retail stores on Commercial Street.

Through the 1960s, the Clark community was able to support a variety of small businesses, including two hardware stores, two banks, two grain elevators, two clothing stores, a jewelry store, a movie theater, a bakery, a restaurant, and a dry cleaners.

As the years passed and the economy of Clark changed, various stores on Commercial Street came and went. The Burlington Northern Railroad stopped servicing Clark. However, the Clark water tower, the oft used grain elevators, and County Highway 212 remained in full use.

In the spring of 2018, only 12 students graduated from Clark High School, significantly less than the 66 students who graduated from Clark High School near its peak in 1968. However, recent numbers show that enrollment in the Clark Elementary School kindergarten class is at 28 students for the 2017–2018 school year.

==Geography==
The town of Clark is located almost exactly in the geographical center of Clark County. The highest point in Clark County is located near the Township of Maydell, and the unnamed peak rises to 1,930 ft.

<text>Vermillion (; &quot;The Place Where Vermilion is Obtained&quot;) is a city and the county seat of Clay County. It is in the southeastern corner of South Dakota, United States, and is the state&#x27;s 12th-most populous city. According to the 2020 census, the population was 11,695. The city lies atop a bluff near the Missouri River.

The area has been home to Native American tribes for centuries. French fur traders first visited in the late 18th century. Vermillion was founded in 1859 and incorporated in 1873. The name refers to the Lakota name: &quot;wa sa wak pa&#x27;la&quot; (red stream). Home to the University of South Dakota, Vermillion has a mixed academic and rural character: the university is a major academic institution for the state, with its only law and medical schools and its only AACSB-accredited business school. Major farm products include corn, soybeans, and alfalfa.

==History==
Lewis and Clark camped at the mouth of the Vermillion River near the present-day town on August 24, 1804. The previous day, they had killed their first bison; the next day, they climbed Spirit Mound. In May 1843, John James Audubon visited the Vermillion ravine to view the bird life. The town was considered for the site of South Dakota&#x27;s first mental institution (now the Human Services Center) in 1873, but the hospital was eventually awarded to nearby Yankton. The original town was entirely below the bluffs on the banks of the Missouri River, and three-quarters of it washed away in the Great Flood of 1881.

William Jennings Bryan and William Howard Taft—candidates for the U.S. presidency in the 1908 election—spoke in Vermillion on September 28 and 29, 1908, respectively. Along with Eugene Chafin, they toured South Dakota by train, including stops in Mitchell, Tripp, Yankton, and Elk Point.

John Philip Sousa conducted the Sousa Band on October 26, 1926, at the facility that in 1929 became known as Slagle Auditorium.

On March 24, 1967, in Vermillion, Thomas James White Hawk and William Stands murdered jeweler James Yeado and raped his wife.
