<text>Cheyenne is a town in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 771. It is the county seat of Roger Mills County.

==History==
Cheyenne is the location of the Battle of Washita River (also called Battle of the Washita; Washita Battlefield; Washita Massacre), where George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked the sleeping Cheyenne village of Black Kettle on the Washita River on November 26, 1868.

Cheyenne has been a county seat since 1895. But construction of the nearest railroad into the area, the Clinton and Oklahoma Western Railway (&quot;C&amp;OW&quot;) terminated in 1912 at Strong City, and that township was laid out with a rocky knoll in the center reserved for the County Courthouse should Strong City become the county seat instead of Cheyenne. To keep their town&#x27;s position, the citizens of Cheyenne responded by building the Cheyenne Short Line Railroad up the Washita River valley to Strong City to connect to the C&amp;OW. In 1914 the courthouse in Cheyenne burned, and the fear again arose in Cheyenne that the citizens of Strong City would manage to have the new courthouse built there. But Cheyenne came up with the funding, and a new two-story brick courthouse was constructed in that town. Strong City remained a competitor for a while, and in 1932 managed to route a state highway (Oklahoma State Highway 33) through the locale, thus missing Cheyenne. But in the 1930s several business houses relocated from Strong City to Cheyenne, losing that town population and businesses while Cheyenne grew during the decade.

During the 1970s Cheyenne and the surrounding area benefited from the natural gas and oil development in the Panhandle-Hugoton field, the largest-volume gas field in the United States, and the world&#x27;s largest known source of helium. Between 1973 and 1993 the field produced over eight trillion cubic feet (230,000,000 m3) of gas.

===1985–1987 Lady Bears===
The Cheyenne High School girls six-on-six basketball team of 1985-1986-1987 won three straight state Class A titles going 88–4 over that time, including winning their last 42 games. Prior to the 1985 season, the team had won only two district titles in 20 years, and had never been to the state tournament. The 42 game streak included the last half of the 1986 season and all of the 1987 season, going 30–0. The four loses were by a combined 5 total points. After winning their third straight title, the Lady Bears (coached by David Sanders), tied a record that stood for 49 years, held by Byng, 1936–1937–1938.

For their first title in 1985 Cheyenne went 29–2, including winning their final 23 games, and defeated Lookeba-Sickles, 45–42, in the championship. The following season they shot 73.0% from the field for the year, went 29–2 again, and beat Amber-Pocasset 61–49 in the championship game. In the final championship game of the three-year run, the undefeated Bears beat the 1980s best Class A team, the Thomas Terrierettes, 65–42.

Cheyenne was led by Jodi Fisher (26.7 points per game), Cindy Smith, Jenny Shockey, Leana Burrows, and Sherry Hillman (also contributing one season each to the three-year run: Julie Barton—1985, Lori Sanders—1987, and Cindy Hay—1987). Fisher, Hillman, Burrows were named to the 1985 and 1986 Class A Girls All-Tournament team. In the first round of the 1986 finals Fisher scored 52 points against Macomb, setting an Oklahoma state girls basketball tournament&#x27;s single-game scoring record. Fisher ended the three state tournament games with 121 points, needing just eight more to tie Thomas&#x27;s Kelli Litsch&#x27;s tournament point record, and was named to the 1986 Class A Girls All-Tournament 1st Team. Fisher was also named to &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Super 6&quot; team for 1987, and coach Sanders was named the 6-on-6 &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; that same season.

B.C. Scouting Service rated Fisher as the top women&#x27;s basketball recruit in the state of Oklahoma for the 1987 season and she was named an All-American honorable mention by &quot;USA Today&quot;. For the 1987 Class A Girls All-Tournament 1st Team Cheyenne had three of the six selections, forwards Jodi Fisher and Cindy Smith, and guard Cindy Hay (Thomas had two, forward Staci Litsch [scored 100 points in three state tournament games and is Kelli&#x27;s little sister] and guard Deena Garner; Johnna Ellis, of Tupelo received the other selection).

Fisher went on to play for the Oklahoma State Cowgirls where she tied a school record for career games played with 124 (with Lisa McGill and Liz Brown), she also set the OSU record for field-goal percentage in a season with 61.3% in the 1990–91 season. She left OSU ranked second in block shots (77), number eight on the all-time rebound list (525), 16th in field goals made with 334, collected 113 career steals from 1987 to 1991 (18th), 20th in career assists (150), and 823 career points (20th on the school&#x27;s all-time scoring list). She tied a school record for rebounds by an individual in an NCAA Tournament game with 12 against DePaul in the opening round game in 1991. On January 24, 1990, Fisher scored 23 points in a 99–94 win over the Oklahoma Sooners. She was on the 1991 OSU team that made it to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament, the first OSU team to make it that far, and averaged 10.9 points a game that season.

===2010–2013 Cheyenne Bears===

<doc id="130557" wikidata="Q10750565" url="?curid=130557" title="José Luis Rodríguez (singer)">
<text>José Luis Rodríguez González, nicknamed El Puma (Cougar) (; January 14, 1943), is a Venezuelan singer and actor who is known for having recorded many international super hits and participated in a handful of telenovelas. He has also served as a coach and mentor on the Peruvian, Argentinian, and Chilean versions of &quot;The Voice&quot;, as well as a judge on &quot;The X Factor Chile&quot;.

==Life and career==
José Luis Rodríguez was born in Caracas, Venezuela to José Antonio Rodríguez from the Canary Islands, Spain and Ana González a Venezuelan housewife. He lost his father at the age of six, and was raised by his mother (an illiterate then, learned to read as an adult to read the Bible) along with 11 brothers and sisters. He grew up in very modest conditions, having to shine shoes, and pack bags in a supermarket for a living at an early age. Without an academic formation, he shaped himself as a singer and actor by empirical means.

As his mother participated in the revolt against Marcos Pérez Jiménez (holding weapons and hiding politicians in her home), Rodríguez lived in exile in Ecuador with her and his brother, for a couple of years.

In 1974, Rodriguez was selected by Venevision to represent Venezuela in the third edition of the prestigious OTI Festival which was held in the Mexican city of Acapulco. There, his entry, the song &quot;Vuélvete&quot; (Return) found a warm reception, therefore gaining recognition for his country by winning the third-place prize with 11 points.

Rodríguez surfaced in his homeland in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was able to build a fan base there. He also participated in a famous commercial, along with his family during that time, for Ace detergents. Rodríguez went to Puerto Rico, where he participated in the &quot;Telenovela&quot; Cristina Bazán, alongside Johanna Rosaly and young Adamari López. It was there that he received his nickname, &quot;El Puma&quot;. Later, he also made the telenovela, &quot;El ídolo&quot;, with Cuban actress Marilyn Pupo, playing Omar Contreras (a.k.a. &quot;El Puma&quot;).

Rodríguez&#x27;s main money revenue, however, was his singing career. His hits included &quot;Dueño de nada&quot;, &quot;Pavo real&quot; and &quot;Agárrense de las manos&quot;. With the second, he caused controversy at the 1982 contest of Miss Universe, which was being held in Lima, Peru; the song&#x27;s main issue was interracial marriage.

Later, Rodríguez participated in the Latin American Spanish version of &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, &quot;La Familia del Futuro&quot;, as Wilbur Robinson&#x27;s father. &quot;El Puma&quot; also starred in an advertising campaign for Wrigley&#x27;s Eclipse gum, with the spot drawing on his persona, using humor and kitsch to highlight the tagline, &quot;Libera el Puma que hay en tí&quot; (Free the puma within). Another commercial that drew on his puma persona during that era was one for Snickers chocolate bars.

In May 2009, Rodriguez joined the cast of the miniseries, &quot;Gabriel&quot;, produced for the Hispanic audience in the United States by Megafilms and transmitted by Mega TV. The miniseries, released in November of the same year is based on the themes of vampirism and occultism.

In July 2012, he was a judge and voice trainer on La Voz... Argentina (Argentine version of The Voice) that was broadcast on Telefe. Along with co-presenters Fernán Martínez and Carolina Ramírez, he served as a judge on a dance program called La Pista which was aired on Caracol TV in Colombia. In the same year he also made a cameo appearance in the film, Casa de mi Padre, starring Will Ferrell.

In August 2013, Rodríguez was part of the first season of La Voz Perú, where he was coach for one of the four teams. On December 20, one of his pupils, young Daniel Lazo, placed first in the competition, making Rodríguez the first winning coach in the history of La Voz Perú.

In September 2013 in an interview with the Peruvian newspaper, La República, Rodríguez expressed that he would continue to perform music but cease to produce records because of piracy.

==Personal life==
Rodríguez was married to Lila Morillo from 1966 to 1986. They are the parents of actresses Lilibeth Morillo and Liliana Rodríguez. Rodríguez fathered Génesis Rodríguez with Cuban-born model Carolina Pérez, whom he ultimately married in 1997.

==Health==
He underwent a double lung transplant due to pulmonary fibrosis in December 2017.

<text>Reydon is a town in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, United States.

Reydon was established in 1928 after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway put down rails in the area, purchased land from local farmers, and laid out a townsite. The site was two miles north of a settlement called Rankin, and Rankin merchants moved to the site because of the rail connection. However, the name “Rankin” was considered confusing because Rankin, Texas was also along the railline. So the town was named Reydon instead, either in honor of a railroad executive in Chicago, or in honor of the village of Reydon in Suffolk County, England.

The population of the town peaked at 331 in 1950. In December 2003 the New York Times featured Reydon on the front page, in an article regarding dwindling small towns on the Great Plains. The population was 137 at the time of the 2020 census.

<text>Strong City is a town in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town’s population was 33.

==History==
The town of Strong City was formally established June 25, 1912. It was named for Clint Strong, a railroad official and entrepreneur instrumental in the town&#x27;s organization. While Cheyenne, Oklahoma was originally designated as the county seat for Roger Mills County, construction of the nearest railroad into the area, the Clinton and Oklahoma Western Railway (“C&amp;OW”) terminated in August 1912 at Strong City. More troubling to the people of Cheyenne was the fact that Strong City had been laid out with a rocky knoll in the center, reserved for the County Courthouse should Strong City become the county seat instead of Cheyenne. Strong City also grew to become bigger than Cheyenne or any other town in the county, within a year of the railroad&#x27;s arrival.

To keep their town&#x27;s position, the citizens of Cheyenne responded by building the Cheyenne Short Line Railroad up the Washita River valley to Strong City to connect to the C&amp;OW. In 1914 the courthouse in Cheyenne burned, and the fear again arose in Cheyenne that the citizens of Strong City would manage to have the new courthouse built there. But Cheyenne came up with the funding, and a new two-story brick courthouse was constructed in that town. Strong City nevertheless remained a competitor, and in 1932 managed to route a state highway (Oklahoma State Highway 33) through the town, passing well north of Cheyenne. However, extension of the C&amp;OW to Cheyenne and eventually into the Texas Panhandle caused trade to shift to the west of the town. The 1930s were not kind to the municipality: in 1934 and 1935 several business houses relocated from Strong City to Cheyenne, losing the town population and businesses while Cheyenne grew during the decade. Today, Strong City is much smaller and Cheyenne remains the county seat.

<text>Chelsea is a town in Rogers County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,964 at the 2010 census, a decline of 8.3 percent from the figure of 2,136 recorded in 2000. Chelsea was named after the area in London, England, by Charles Peach, a railroad official who was a native of London. The town was the site of the Chelsea-Alluwe Oil Field, which produced a significant amount of oil from &quot;circa&quot; 1910 until the early 1920s, before it played out. Will Rogers attended a subscription school on Cherokee Land in Chelsea. 

==History==
In 1881, Chelsea began as a stop on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. A post office was established in November 1882. The community incorporated as a town in the Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory, in 1889. The town was surveyed and platted in 1902. The Bank of Chelsea, the first state bank in Indian Territory, began operation in March 1896.

The town economy has historically rested on farming, ranching and oil production. Important farm products were oats, corn, wheat and pecans. A flour mill built circa 1892 was one of Chelsea&#x27;s original industries. Chelsea became noted as a shipping point for cattle and hay before statehood in 1907. The Chelsea-Alluwe oil field was discovered southwest of Chelsea in 1889 by the United States Oil and Gas Company.

According to the American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society, Edward Byrd, whose wife was a Cherokee woman, discovered oil seeps in 1882 southwest Chelsea, which was then part of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory. He apparently took no action to exploit his discovery until 1887, when he and William B. Linn, a Pennsylvanian, and a group of investors from Kansas organized the United States Oil and Gas Company (USOGC). The company subsequently leased drilling rights from the Cherokee Nation on of land lying west of Chelsea between the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad and the Verdigris River. USOGC completed its first well in 1890, on Spencer Creek. It was a rudimentary operation, compared to productive sites completed a few years later. The well began producing a half barrel of good-quality crude per day from a depth of only . This was enough for USOGC enthusiasts to claim it was, &quot;... the first oil well in Oklahoma.&quot;

Chelsea&#x27;s claim to the first oil well proved to be untrue. Although USOGC drilled ten other wells on its lease in the next two years, the total production was said to be only 12 barrels, economically insignificant, after which the company ceased operating. The Cherokee Oil and Gas Company then took over the lease. By then, the Cherokee government had limited the size of each lease to . It and other companies later drilled more productive wells which proved economically viable. The whole area became known as the Chelsea-Alluwe Oil Field. Significant production dropped after 1916 and the oil companies stopped work in this field shortly after.

<text>Claremore is a city in and the county seat of Rogers County in northeastern Oklahoma, United States. The population was 19,580 at the 2020 census, a 5.4 percent increase over the figure of 18,581 recorded in 2010. Located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. It is home of Rogers State University and is part of the Tulsa metropolitan area.

This area was part of the territory of the Osage, but they were forced out under a treaty with the United States. During the Indian Removal period and until statehood, this area was a reserve of the Cherokee Nation, which had been removed from its territory in the Southeast United States. This was within what was known as the Cherokees&#x27; Cooweescoowee District.

== History ==

Around 1802, bands of Osage Indians settled in this area of what is now northeastern Oklahoma. Black Dog was the chief of a band that settled at &quot;Pasona&quot;, where Claremore later developed. He shared power with chiefs Clermont (aka Claremore), and Pawhuska. Clermont, named by French traders, settled with his band in a village known as &quot;Pasuga&quot;, meaning &quot;Big Cedar&quot;, which was located on an ancient platform earthwork mound in this area.

The Osage village of Pasuga was destroyed by Cherokee in June 1817, during the Battle of Claremore Mound, also known as the Battle of the Strawberry Moon. These Western Cherokee had moved into the region from the southeastern United States and were perpetually competing with the Osage, who looked down on them. At the time of the attack, most of the men were out of the villages to hunt bison on the plains. The Cherokee killed the men in the village, and took more than 100 women and children captive, selling them to eastern Cherokee. Accounts differ as to whether chief Clermont was killed in the raid.

After the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was passed by Congress, this area was designated as part of Indian Territory and the Cherokee Nation were assigned much of this territory. Claremore and the mound were within a part of the Cooweescoowee District in the northwestern part of the Cherokee Nation.

The Rogers family, for whom the county is named, were among the first European-American settlers. Clem Rogers, father of the famous entertainer Will Rogers, was born of mixed-blood parents in the Cherokee Nation as was his wife. He moved to the county in 1856 and acquired lands for his Dog Iron Ranch that eventually consisted of more than . The Clem Rogers home (Will Rogers&#x27; birthplace), still stands outside Oologah, and is considered an important historical site. Clem Rogers was a major advocate of Oklahoma statehood; he was the oldest delegate to the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention in 1907 at age 69. He and other members of his family were buried at the Will Rogers Memorial.

A post office was established on June 25, 1874. The coming of railways to Indian Territory was the driving factor in early growth. Two early lines intersected in the center of town. The town changed the spelling of its name from Clermont to Claremore on September 19, 1882. A clerk recording the town as having a post office had spelled the name incorrectly, and it stuck. The town was incorporated in the Cherokee Nation on May 2, 1903. newspaper, the &quot;Claremore Daily Progress&quot;, was founded in 1893 by cowboy Joe Klein and is still published daily. It is the oldest business in Rogers County.

Growth was aided by the popularity of sulphur springs among Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They believed bathing in such springs to have medical benefits. George Eaton had settled with his family in the Claremore area in 1874 and conducted farming and cattle raising. He later branched into the mercantile business, real estate, and oil exploration. While drilling just east of Claremore in 1903, Easton struck an underground pool of water that smelled of sulfur. Local physician Dr. W. G. Williams tested the water and marketed it as a cure. Known as &quot;Radium Water&quot;, it contained no radium, but hydrogen sulfide and sulfur compounds that were believed to make it medically useful. Eaton built a bath house and promoted the pool area as Radium Town. Radium Town was centered on 9th Street between Seminole and Dorothy. Bath houses were built by promoters all over this area of Claremore, and for a time attracted travelers and tourists for the waters. Only one was still standing as of 2008. The first hospital was established in the early 1900s along what is now known as Will Rogers Boulevard, or Oklahoma State Highway 20. The building is standing and is currently being renovated.

The town has many historic homes and other buildings, with several located in the old business district. In 2002, Claremore received a grant from the state&#x27;s Oklahoma Main Street program to redevelop its business district with improved urban design and enhancement of historic properties. Renovation work on the downtown was completed in 2007. On July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States determined in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; that the reservations of the Five Tribes, comprising much of Eastern Oklahoma, were never disestablished by Congress and thus are still &quot;Indian Country&quot; for the purposes of criminal law.

On the night of May 25th, 2024, a EF3 tornado impacted Claremore and caused considerable damage to the city and the areas surrounding it.

==In popular culture==
The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; is set in Claremore and the surrounding area, in 1906 (the year before Oklahoma became a state); it was based on the play Green Grow the Lilacs by playwright Lynn Riggs who grew up on a farm in the Claremore area. The &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; season 3 episode &quot;8½ Months&quot; is also set near Claremore. The movie &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; fictionally portrays Rogers County and the area surrounding Claremore.

Claremore was featured in the &quot;Supernatural&quot; season 14 episode &quot;Nightmare Logic,&quot; where Maggie tracks a ghoul to the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.96%) is water.

The city is located in Green Country, a popular nickname and marketing label for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region&#x27;s green vegetation and relatively high number of hills and lakes, compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma. Claremore lies near the Verdigris River with undulating terrain producing hills and valleys. The town primary water sources are the Claremore and Oologah lakes, both within the drainage basin of the Verdigris River.

===Climate===
Claremore experiences a humid subtropical climate with cold winters and hot summers.

==Transportation==

Claremore is a major intersection of heavily traveled highways. Interstate 44 crosses the town to its southeast. State Highway 66 (historic US-66) was designated along with one of the main east–west roads of the town. State Highway 88 and State Highway 20 intersect within the town.

Two railroad lines, the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway line (now owned by Union Pacific) and the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway or &quot;Frisco&quot; line (now owned by BNSF) intersect in Claremore. The traffic problems resulting from the intersection of two major national rail lines have led to discussions among town officials about how best to improve traffic flow.

Claremore Regional Airport (KGCM; FAA ID GCM), is located about 7 miles east of Claremore, and features a paved 5200 x 75 ft. runway.

Commercial air transportation is available out of Tulsa International Airport, about 22 miles southwest.

The first school in the Claremore area was opened to students in 1870. The first major high school was built in 1919; it was the most expensive public school building in the state of Oklahoma at the time. The building was used as a school for almost 80 years, until 1999. The increasing costs of maintenance of the old building forced its closure.

== Economy ==
Claremore&#x27;s economy is diversified. Baker Hughes, an oil field services company, has a large presence in the town. Together with several other large companies, it is located in Claremore Industrial Park. This is only a few miles from the Tulsa Port of Catoosa, located on the Verdigris and Arkansas rivers. Coal mining is also an important industry; strip-style mines are operating on both the north and south sides of town.

== Media ==
Claremore has a website called moreClaremore.com, which focuses on positive community journalism. It was launched in April 2013 and centers on community events, local businesses, people, and schools. It also features the central community calendar for the area. The site has an average of 40,000 visitors per month and has an active social media presence, with more than 29,000 followers on Facebook. 

The daily newspaper (and one of the oldest ongoing businesses in the county) is the &quot;Claremore Daily Progress&quot;, first published as a weekly in 1892 and as a daily in 1893. As of September 2020, the Claremore Daily Progress only publishes two print editions a week.

<text>:&quot;Inola&quot; is also a spider genus (Pisauridae).
Inola is a town in Rogers County, Oklahoma, United States. It is included in the Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area (TMSA). The population was 1,788 at the 2010 census with a 12.5 percent increase from 1,589 at the 2000 census. &quot;Inola&quot; is a Cherokee word meaning &quot;Black Fox.&quot; The town styles itself as &quot;The Hay Capital of the World.&quot;

==History==
In 1889, the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later acquired by the Missouri Pacific Railway) built a line from Wagoner through the Foyil area onto the Kansas state line. The area was then just inside the northeastern corner of the Creek Nation in Indian Territory. A post office was established in March 1890 with the name Foyil. It was closed in September 1890 but reopened in April 1891. By 1901, the population was estimated at 100 people. The Dawes Commission had the town platted in 1902, before the Creek allotment.

Strip mines began producing coal nearby before statehood in 1907, causing a small boom in population. Inola&#x27;s population was 405 in 1920. As the coal industry began to decline, so did the town&#x27;s population. The 1930 census reported only 399 residents. The decline continued through the post World War II era, reaching 294 in 1950. A turnaround began in the 1950s as residents began commuting to Tulsa. Inola&#x27;s population grew to 584 in 1960 and 984 in 1970. The 1980 census showed 1,550 residents, increasing to 1,589 in 2000 and 1,788 in 2010.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.91%) is water.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
The town has emerged as a bedroom community for Tulsa, about 28 miles to the west.

In October 2020, tissue paper maker Sofidel opened a $360 million production factory in Inola. The 1.8 million-square-foot plant includes a mill that transforms pulp into paper and a conversion facility that makes the finished product. The factory employs more than 300 people, and this number is expected to double with a second operational phase.

== Black Fox Power Plant ==

The Black Fox Nuclear Power Plant was a nuclear power plant proposed by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) in May 1973. The facility was to be built approximately outside of Inola and encompass the use of two General Electric (GE) Boiling Water Reactors. PSO argued that there would be great economic growth and better schools in the town. Many residents as well as outsiders were convinced that it would be dangerous to locate such a facility in their backyards. After nine years of court battles and minor earthquakes in the area, the decision was abandoned in 1982 and no complex was built.

<text>Oologah ( ) is a town in Rogers County, Oklahoma, United States. Renowned humorist Will Rogers was born on a ranch two miles east of Oologah, although he usually claimed Claremore as his birthplace &quot;because nobody but an Indian can pronounce &#x27;Oologah.&#x27;&quot;
There has been disagreement about the proper spelling for the town name. The official spelling is now Oologah. It was often spelled Oolagah before statehood, and this spelling appears on some old buildings.

==History==
In 1889, the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, subsequently a part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and currently, the Union Pacific Railroad) laid tracks through the area and established a townsite named Oologah, Indian Territory. Oologah was named for &quot;Oologah&quot; (Dark Cloud), a Cherokee chief. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot; says that the Oklahoma Federal Writers&#x27; Project claimed the name translates from the Cherokee language as &quot;red horse fish&quot;, while some other sources say that the name means &quot;cloudy weather&quot; or just &quot;clouds.&quot; The post office was opened May 25, 1891. 
Early in the 20th century, the town flourished because of agriculture, coal mining, and oil and gas production. However, these were hard hit during the Great Depression. The town&#x27;s population declined from 324 in 1910 to 236 in 1940. The population had recovered to 299 in 1960. Construction of Oologah dam and lake in 1963, east of town, revitalized the town, which has continued to grow.

In 1963, the Army Corps of Engineers completed the first phase of Oologah Lake.

In 1991, an F4 tornado which was part of the Andover, Kansas tornado outbreak destroyed the north side of Oologah, including the town&#x27;s school.

The Talala Post Office was established June 23, 1890. Talala was named for Captain John Talala of the 3rd Regiment, Indian Home Guard and a prominent Cherokee. It is mentioned in the Talala History Book that the word ta la la is associated with the tapping of a woodpecker&#x27;s bill, which the woodpecker is a red-headed woodpecker that had these numerous birds there and even today. &quot;Talala&quot; is a Cherokee word for the Red-Headed Woodpecker. An Indian made this discovery and so the town has taken this bird as part of its legacy, erecting signs on the North and South end of the town, and on its stationery at Town Hall and in the Museum.

<text>Cromwell is a town in Seminole County, Oklahoma, United States. It is within the jurisdiction of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. The population was 238 at the time of the 2020 census. It was named for oilman Joe I. Cromwell, who platted the original town in 1923. The population soared to several thousand people in a few weeks, and lawlessness was rampant in the community. Retired legendary Old West lawman Bill Tilghman was hired as Town Marshal to restore order. Tilghman was shot to death the following year, the most notable event in Cromwell&#x27;s history.

==History==
Founded in 1923, and named for Muscogee oilman, Joe I. Cromwell, Cromwell had a post office on May 17, 1924.

Cromwell was a wild and wooly town in the early 1920s. The town was said to be full of saloons, brothels and outlaws. About 150 businesses operated in Cromwell during the 1920s, many selling moonshine alcohol and narcotics to residents of the surrounding area. However, about seventy of these were permanently closed during an enforcement drive. The illegal sales continued because a Federal Prohibition Unit agent named Wiley Lynn was connected to mobster Arnold Killian.

On Halloween night, 1924, Cromwell Town Marshal and legendary Old West lawman Bill Tilghman was shot outside of a cafe called &quot;Ma Murphy&#x27;s&quot;, by the corrupt prohibition agent Wiley Lynn. Tilghman died in the early morning hours of the first of November. Tilghman had been brought in to help bring the town under control. One month later the town of Cromwell was torched, with every brothel, bar, flop house and pool hall burned to the ground, allegedly by friends of Tilghman. There was no investigation into the massive fire, and Cromwell never recovered its former wild status, or size.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Schoolton is a populated place now located within the official boundaries of Cromwell. It is located north about 4 miles from the central district of Cromwell on Oklahoma State Highway 56, just north of Interstate 40.

The settlement had a post office from December 19, 1907, to June 30, 1917; an earlier post office named Irene was situated at this same approximate location until November 28, 1907. The Schoolton name was chosen by one William P. Weston, a local educator, in recognition of plans for a fine school system in the town.

<text>Konawa is a city in Seminole County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,288 at the time of the 2020 census. &quot;Konawa&quot; is a Seminole word meaning, &quot;string of beads.&quot;

==History==
Located in southwestern Seminole County, Konawa, a Seminole word meaning &quot;string of beads,&quot; lies at the intersection of State Highways 9A and 39. On January 7, 1904, Tom West, a mixed-blood Seminole, sold George Northrup a plot of land that became the Konawa townsite. The post office was established on July 15, 1904, with Robert C. Lovelace as postmaster. Early-day establishments included the first newspaper, the Konawa Chief, hardware and drug stores, lumberyards, a blacksmith, and a bank. In 1903, the Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad (later the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway) bypassed the nearby town of Violet Springs. Most families and businesses moved to other towns. Some moved their houses to Konawa, and many of these buildings continued to stand at the turn of the twenty-first century.

Konawa served as a trade center for a surrounding agricultural region. At 1907 statehood, population stood at 620. The Konawa Leader has informed the citizens since 1917. During the 1920s streets were paved, several oil wells were discovered, and a new high school was built. In November 1931, Konawa attracted the attention of Pretty Boy Floyd, who robbed the First National Bank. During World War II, the Konawa National Guard Armory (National Register of Historical Places, NR 94000483), a WPA project, housed German prisoners of war. On February 17, 1961, a tornado destroyed downtown Konawa and injured five individuals.

The Sacred Heart Mission, which was the forerunner of St. Gregory&#x27;s University moved in 1876 from its original location in Atoka to a location near Konawa and became an abbey and later a school. After a disastrous fire in 1901 that destroyed the school and the monastery, the monks accepted an offer from the town of Shawnee and began construction of the Catholic University of Oklahoma and St. Gregory&#x27;s Abbey in 1910. In 1927, the abbey completely relocated from Konawa to Shawnee.

The energy industry remained a mainstay of the local economy, with oil-field service companies still important. In May 1968, Oklahoma Gas and Electric Corporation broke ground for the Seminole Power Plant, creating the 1,350-acre Konawa Reservoir at a cost of $45 million. By 1975, the third power unit with an output of more than 1.6 million kilowatts was built. Konawa Reservoir is one of Oklahoma&#x27;s top trophy lakes.

In August 1963, Konawa hosted its first All-Night Gospel Singing. During its heyday, an estimated twenty-five thousand people attended the annual event. The town maintains a council-city manager type of government. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Konawa had 1,479 residents.

<text>Wewoka is a city in Seminole County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,271 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Seminole County.

Founded by a Black Seminole, John Coheia, and Black Seminoles in January 1849, Wewoka is the capital of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.

==History==

Wewoka&#x27;s history begins with Black Seminole John Horse, who was also known as Gopher John. In the spring of 1849, Horse and a group of Black Seminoles founded a settlement near modern-day Wewoka. Seeking safety and autonomy from the Creek Nation, they established a community located at the falls of a small stream, lying in the fertile lands between the North and South Canadian Rivers. The steady rush of water over the falls gave rise to the name &quot;We-Wo-Ka&quot; – meaning &quot;Barking Water&quot; in the Mvskoke (Seminole) language. Other historians say he named the settlement &quot;Wewokea&quot; after Osceola&#x27;s second wife who was of both Seminole and African ancestry.

In autumn of 1849, Horse and Seminole chief Wild Cat led Seminole families into Mexico to avoid the attempts of slavers to raid families and capture people of African descent. The Mexican government offered Wild Cat, Horse and other Seminoles land in Mexico if they could rid the land of renegades who were terrorizing Mexican citizens. Wild Cat was the next hereditary chief of the Seminole Nation but the government appointed its first chief John Jumper instead. The descendants of Wildcat and his band were split for a time between Wewoka, Texas, and Mexico until 1918.

The city was founded in 1866 when Elijah J. Brown, an employee of the federal government led Seminole refugees from Leroy, Kansas to Indian Territory. During the American Civil War, the Seminole Nation had sided with the Confederacy, although many tribe members fled to the relative safety of Kansas, where they remained for the duration of the war. In 1866, after the Confederacy surrendered, the United States government required the Seminole Nation to sign a new treaty, which required them to emancipate their slaves, give freedmen who wanted to stay in the territory full rights as citizens, including voting in the tribe. Brown led the refugees back to Wewoka, here he built himself a house and established a trading post. Freedmen settled in Wewoka along with the Seminole and Elijah Brown was the only legal white settler in the town. The trading post had several subsequent proprietors before it was bought by two Seminole brothers, John Frippo Brown and A. J. Brown, and became the Wewoka Trading Company in 1891. Rev. James Ross Ramsey, a Presbyterian missionary, founded the Ramsey Mission (considered the first school in present Seminole County) in 1866. A post office was established on May 13, 1867, with E. J. Brown as first postmaster. The Seminole Nation made Wewoka their capital city and Seminole Governor John Brown had a log house erected at Wewoka as the Seminole capitol in 1877.

During the existence of the Seminole Nation as a political entity, the federal government was required by treaty to make payments directly to qualified tribe members. A popular sight was the pay wagon, accompanied by several armed Seminole light horsemen who rapidly unloaded the gold bullion, silver coins and paper money, and make a mad dash from the train station to the Wewoka Trading Company building, where it was delivered to A. J. Brown, who was also the Treasurer of the Seminole Nation. Brown kept the bulk payment in the company vault until he distributed it directly to the proper recipients.

The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (C O &amp; G) built a railroad line from McAlester to Oklahoma City that passed through Wewoka.

The city was formally platted in 1897. The Seminole National Council ordered that decreed that the lots could be sold only to American Indians. However, the decision was overturned in 1902 and sales were opened to white settlers.

In 1907, Wewoka became part of the state of Oklahoma, which was admitted to the union. In 1908 it was designated as the county seat of Seminole County, Oklahoma, winning out in an election against the city of Seminole, Oklahoma. Early newspapers were the &quot;Wewoka Herald&quot;, &quot;Wewoka Democrat&quot;, and the &quot;Seminole County Capital&quot;.

The city developed around the house that Andrew Jackson Brown and his wife Mannie Lou built at 11th Avenue and Muskogee. Brown was the brother of Seminole Governor John Brown and the two owned and operated the Wewoka Trading Company. They were prominent Seminole of Creek and Scottish ancestry. Descendants included two prominent Seminole chiefs, Lucy Brown McKellop and her husband John F. McKellop. The house still stands, the last remaining structure of the Nineteenth Seminole Republic. It straddles the border between the Seminole and Creek nations and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On March 16, 1923, oil was discovered two miles southeast of Wewoka by R. H. Smith, part of the Greater Seminole Oil Field. Great wealth was realized by many Seminole in 1925 with the exploration of the Magnolia Petroleum Company. In the 1920s and 30s the great Seminole Oil Fields were the largest suppliers of oil anywhere in the world. In 1925 the population of Wewoka was 1,520. By 1927 the population increased to over 20,000, as adventurers and workers came, to make their fortunes. It rapidly had become the third-largest city in Oklahoma.

From 1927 to the present, the oil companies took out as much as they could get. As the oil decreased, jobs and people left the city. By 1950 the population of Wewoka was 6,753 and in 1960 it was 6,300. The population continued a steady decline, but the city has continued as the commercial center of the region. The 1980s and 1990s were difficult for the city. Businesses left town and poverty greatly increased.

The city leaders tried to protect themselves by refusing to allow competition, like Wal-Mart, to enter the city. Holdenville and Seminole do have Wal-Mart stores. Seminole&#x27;s Wal-Mart has the super-center configuration offering groceries as well as dry goods.

The crime rate in Wewoka during the 1980s increased; the radio commentator Paul Harvey called Wewoka &quot;Little Chicago,&quot; because it had a higher crime rate per capita than the city of Chicago. The violence in the city caused people to avoid coming to Wewoka and gave the city a reputation that continues to linger.

By the mid-1990s, new leadership began to turn commerce around in the city. The police force was increased and began to get the crime rate under control. The crime rate by 2001 was below average for the state of Oklahoma. The historic downtown received a face lift of new sidewalks, streets, lights and flowers. Wewoka was selected as one of Channel 5&#x27;s Top Five Cities in 2004.

The city of Wewoka continues to work to attract businesses and maintain population. The current population of Wewoka is just over 3,500. The projections show that the city will continue to decrease in the coming years. The ethnic diversity continues, with 52% white, 22% American Indian and 18% African American. The average household income is approximately $37,000 a year, a substantial increase over 2002. According to the demographic comparison, the number of households is decreasing, but the income of those living in Wewoka is increasing.

==Economy==
The first successful oil well in the Wewoka area, Betsy Foster Number One, began producing in March, 1923, leading to a boom in the population of oil field workers. Lake Wewoka was built as a reservoir to assure the city water supply, and an amusement park at the lake soon followed. Agriculture was a major component of the Wewoka economy, with important products being cotton, peaches, peanuts, pecans, and Silvermine variety of corn. Cattle raising was also important. Although the population declined significantly during and right after World War II, it began to stabilize later in the 20th century. Major employers in the city have included Wewoka Brick Company, the Wewoka Packing Plant, the Oklahoma Clothing Manufacturing Company, Lillian Russell (dress manufacturing), Acker Industries (steel products), and Plasteck Central (aircraft parts).

==Culture==

===Post office===
In 1941, as part of the New Deal projects of the Works Progress Administration, Marjorie Rowland Clarke won a federal commission from the Section of Painting and Sculpture′s projects, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department to paint a mural for the Wewoka post office. The painting, &quot;Historical Background of Wewoka&quot; can still be seen in the building.

===Museums===
The Seminole National Museum opened in 1974, after about ten years of planning by the Seminole community in Oklahoma. It is housed in a native stone building that initially served as the Wewoka Community Center, after it was built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1934. It operates as a non-profit organization, and does not charge an admission fee to visitors. The building has expanded from the original to and includes display space, a research library, an arts and crafts center, an art gallery, a small office and a gift shop. The museum offers educational courses both on site and on the road (both in Oklahoma and in other parts of the United States. The museum estimates that it has had over half a million visitors from every state in the U.S. and over 100 other countries, since its opening.

Vance Trimble, a Pulitzer Prize winning news reporter, editor and author, donated an extensive collection of research materials he used in writing his book, &quot;Alice &amp; J. F. B.&quot;, a biography of Seminole chiefs Alice Brown Davis and John F. Brown. Trimble had turned down a request for these materials from the University of Oklahoma Western History Collection because the subjects of the book were central to the history of the Seminoles and the city of Wewoka.

===Events===
Wewoka is home to an annual Sorghum Days celebration in the fall. Sorghum molasses is prepared on-site at the Seminole Nation Museum grounds. The sorghum is cooked from cane juice pressed in an authentic mule-driven cane press, a rarity today. Sorghum is sold on fry-bread on the museum grounds for visitors to enjoy. Sorghum is not an agricultural crop of the Wewoka area; a small patch is grown for this celebration. Past Sorghum Day parade marshals include actor Ken Curtis, best known for his portrayal of Festus Haggen on the long-running CBS western television series &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot;

The population was 55 at the 2010 census, a 71.9 percent gain over the figure of 32 recorded in 2000. It is currently the home of Dwight Mission Presbyterian Camp &amp; Retreat Center.

==History==

The original Dwight Mission was established in August 1820 on Illinois Bayou, near present-day Russellville, Arkansas, in the Cherokee settlements. It was named after Rev. Timothy Dwight, President of Yale University and an influential member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

In 1828 the Western Cherokees were forced to move out of Arkansas into Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). As a result of this move, Dwight Mission was reestablished on Sallisaw Creek, in Sequoyah County in the Marble City, Oklahoma area. The mission was sited about above the junction of Sallisaw Creek and the Arkansas River and thirty miles east of Fort Gibson.

Dwight Mission reopened in Indian Territory on Sallisaw Creek on May 1, 1830. The mission consisted of twenty-one houses, a large dining hall, a barn, and outbuildings.

A series of parochial and tribal schools existed on the site until 1948 (with the exception of the Civil War years when the site was abandoned) and 1884–1886).

In 1950, Presbyterian Church USA purchased the property. Since that time, Dwight Mission has served as a church camp and retreat center.

<text>Gore is a town in western Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 977 at the 2010 census, an increase of 15 percent over the figure of 850 recorded in 2000.

Gore claims to be the &quot;trout capital of Oklahoma&quot;, with great fishing in Lake Tenkiller, the Illinois River, and the Arkansas River.

==History==
This community began as a small settlement in Indian Territory known as Campbell, named for Dr. W. W. Campbell, who, along with Joe Lynch, operated a ferry across the Arkansas River between Campbell and Webbers Falls. Tahlonteskee, the capital of the Western Cherokee from 1828–1839, was near here, just two miles to the north of town. In 1829, John Jolly, chief of the Cherokee Nation–West, built a home in this area.

The settlement was also known as Illinois Station or &quot;Illinois Station, Campbell Post Office.&quot; It became a stage stop on the route between Fort Gibson and Fort Smith. A post office designation of Campbell was assigned to Dr. Campbell&#x27;s store in 1888. Also in 1888, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway) built a rail line through the settlement.

By 1909, the town had a bank, two lumber companies, a flour mill, a cotton gin, two hotels, and numerous retail outlets. The town changed its name on October 22, 1909, in honor of Oklahoma Senator Thomas Gore, who was serving as one of Oklahoma&#x27;s U. S. senators immediately after statehood. A fire destroyed most of the business district in 1909. Gore had a population of 319 by the 1910 U. S. census.

The town almost got a second rail line in 1917 when Congress approved construction by the Webbers Falls Railroad of a bridge over the Arkansas from Webbers Falls. However, that railroad was instead scrapped in 1918.

Kerr-McGee built the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation uranium mill on a tract located east of Gore to convert uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride (UF6). The UF6 plant was bought by General Atomics in 1988, and closed in 1993.

<text>Town of Marble City (often simply called Marble) is a town in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 263 at the 2010 census, an increase of 8.7 percent over the figure of 242 recorded in 2000, making it the seventh-largest town by population in Sequoyah County, after Gans and before Moffett.
==History==
The area around what is now the Town of Marble City was considered part of Lovely County, Arkansas Territory until 1829. In that year, the Federal Government began moving the Western Cherokees from other parts of Arkansas Territory into this area, then called Nicksville. Non-Indian settlers were ordered to vacate, and the Arkansas Territorial Legislature ended its claim to the land. Dwight Mission took over Nicksville. The area became part of Indian Territory.

A post office named Kidron was established in this area in 1835, to serve the Cherokee settlers in this area. The office moved to another location in 1858, where it was named Marble Salt Works. Another Kidron post office opened near Dwight Mission in 1859, but was discontinued in 1869. In 1869, the Post Office opened a new location named Kedron. By 1895, when commercial-scale quarrying of marble began in this area, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (later known as the Kansas City Southern Railway) laid tracks through the area, the Kedron post office moved closer to the railroad and a marble quarry, and was renamed as Marble. The name was chosen because of its proximity to Oklahoma&#x27;s only true marble outcrops. Commercial quarrying began there in 1895. The Ozark Marble Company operated the quarry from 1906 to 1914, producing material for building construction. 

One major project using marble from Marble City was the Oklahoma City&#x27;s Pioneer Telephone Building. Another was the Administration Hall at Rice Institute, which is now Lovett Hall at Rice University: it is made of red St. Joe bricks made in Louisiana with clay from Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas; pink granite from Llano, Texas; and gray marble from Marble City, Oklahoma.

Watie Davault served as mayor of Marble City for 47 years, when he retired in 1961.

<text>Moffett is a town in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 128 at the 2010 census, a decline of 28.5 percent from the figure of 179 recorded in 2000.

==History==
After the Civil War, several Cherokee and Cherokee freedmen settled around the present community of Moffett. A post office was established in 1908 and was named for Martha Moffett Payne, wife of Dr. Samuel Payne. The town became an agricultural center, especially for cotton farmers.

Moffett incorporated in 1928. Its population was 340 at the 1930 census, and peaked at 538 in 1940. Before and during World War II, the town&#x27;s bars and gambling establishments attracted soldiers from nearby Fort Smith, Arkansas and Camp Chaffee. The U.S. Army declared Moffett &quot;off limits&quot; during the war, and kept the ban in place until the mid-1970s. The town began a long decline after World War II. The 1960 census counted 357 residents, and the decline has continued to the present.

Moffett&#x27;s history has included several damaging floods. The most notable of these occurred in 1943, 1957, 1986, 1990, and 2019.

In 2007, the town filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy after Oklahoma&#x27;s attorney general declared it was operating a speed trap, and barred local police from issuing speeding citations. Without the steady stream of citation revenue generated from motorists passing through on U.S. Highway 64, the town was unable to manage the $200,000 in debts incurred by the former mayor.

<text>Sallisaw is a city in and the county seat of Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 Census, it had a population of 8,510, a 4.2 percent decrease over the figure of 8,880 recorded in 2010. Sallisaw is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas–Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
French explorers and traders named this part of North America in the seventeenth century.

In the 1840s and 1850s, Sallisaw was the name of one of the 22 Arkansas River steamboat landings between Fort Smith and Fort Gibson. Modern Sallisaw&#x27;s beginning as a permanent community began in 1887–1888, when Argyle Quesenbury, a white man, and Will Watie Wheeler, a collateral relative of noted Cherokee leader Stand Watie, laid out lots for a town. Several post offices had existed in the area nearby, even before there was a named community. The site of present-day Sallisaw fell within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation after the tribe was forced to emigrate from its former home in the Southeastern U.S. It had a post office called Childer&#x27;s Station from 1873 to 1888, when the name was changed to Sallisaw. Another community fifteen miles north bore the name Sallisaw for a period until 1888, when the name of the post office there was changed to Mays, but it closed in 1896.

Will Watie Wheeler established several businesses in the town during the 1880s and 1890s. These included a cotton gin, saw mill, grist mill and lumberyard. In 1896, he opened the Coffin Shop, which later became the Wheeler Funeral Home. The latter was still doing business in Sallisaw in the twenty-first century.

The Kansas &amp; Arkansas Valley Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad) built an east–west line from Van Buren, Arkansas to Sallisaw in 1888–1890. The Kansas City, Pittsburgh &amp; Gulf Railroad (later named the Kansas City Southern Railroad) built a north–south line through Sallisaw in 1895–96, where the two intersected.

Other early businesses included the Economy Store and McDonald Mercantile Company, operated by William Henry McDonald, who also owned a bank; Matthews Brothers, a grocery, was opened in 1898 by Henry and Arch Matthews; W. D. Mayo and E. M. Pointer founded Mayo and Company, a mercantile and farm implement business. Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Ivey established a long-standing drug store (she also owned hotels). By 1900, Sallisaw recorded a population of 965, which increased to 2,255 in 1920. During this time, the community&#x27;s economy rose and fell with the price of cotton.

After 1920, lumber and its byproducts began playing a major role in the town&#x27;s economy, along with coal and petroleum products (including natural gas). The local newspaper, &quot;Sequoyah County Times&quot;, began publication in 1932. It was founded by Wheeler and Florence Mayo. Wheeler was the son of an earlier Sallisaw businessman. As of 2019, the paper was still owned by the Mayo family.

==Etymology==
The name Sallisaw was taken from the French word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;salt provisions&quot; in English. The French, who hunted in the area long before the town was founded, called Sallisaw Creek &quot;Salaiseau&quot; because hunters salted bison meat there. English naturalist Thomas Nuttall recorded the name as &quot;Salaiseau&quot;, in his journal during his exploration of the area in 1819.

==Geography==

Sallisaw is located in the central area of the county, from Muldrow, from Vian, from Roland and from Fort Smith, Arkansas.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, nearby geographic features include Wildhorse Mountain to the south, Badger Mountain to the northwest, and Lone Pine Mountain to the northeast.

==Economy==
The local economy was based on cotton farming during the town&#x27;s early years. During the 1920s, the focus of the economy shifted to the production of lumber, oil and natural gas. A prison camp was established here during World War II. After the war, a variety of industrial and retail businesses were established.

The &quot;Sequoyah County Times&quot;, founded by Wheeler Mayo in 1932, is called &quot;the largest-circulation, non-metro, non-daily newspaper in Oklahoma.&quot; It was still owned by the Mayo family as of 2019.

East Cherokee Avenue is a business loop, with Sallisaw&#x27;s only mall, the Eastgate Shopping Center, originally a Walmart store, which was moved to 1101 W. Ruth Avenue in 2001. The Sallisaw Municipal Airport is located a half mile south of the intersection of I-40 and U.S. 59.

Blue Ribbon Downs (BRD), a horse racing venue, was established in Sallisaw during the 1960s by Bill Hedge. He sold the track to an investment group in 1973. Legalization of gambling on horse racing did not occur until 1982, so the first pari-mutuel race occurred August 30, 1984. This caused a short-term boom in track-related businesses. However, the popularity waned and the track struggled financially. The Choctaw Nation bought the facility in 2003 for $4.25 million, put in more capital and converted it to a &quot;racino&quot; that combined the race track with a casino. Despite the improvements, BRD was not a financial success and closed permanently in 2010. the Choctaw Nation tried to sell the operation on two occasions, but the deals fell through. Then, just one day before the track was to be sold at a sheriff&#x27;s auction in November 2003, the Cherokee Nation purchased the property for $2.5 million. The Cherokee chief, Chad Smith, said that his nation did not plan to resume horse racing at the site, but is considering other options for using the land. He admitted that using the track as a training facility would also be considered.

The only commercial manufacturing reported in Sallisaw has been the BorgWarner Morse Tech, a maker of auto parts and plastic foam packing materials.

<text>Vian () is a town in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, United States, adjacent to Interstate 40 at the intersection of U.S. Route 64 and Oklahoma State Highway 82. The population was 1,374 at the 2020 census, a 6.3 percent decline from the figure of 1,466 recorded in 2010. It is part of the Fort Smith Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
At the time of European contact, the area around what is now Vian was inhabited and controlled, but not settled, by the Osage, who used it as hunting ground. The name &quot;Vian&quot; is a corruption of , the French word for &quot;meat&quot;; French traders called Vian Creek &quot;bayou viande&quot;, literally &quot;meat bayou&quot;.

The area was part of the controversial Lovely&#x27;s Purchase made in 1816, which opened pre-removal Cherokee settlement in the area, then part of the Missouri Territory; the area became part of the Arkansas Territory in 1819. After the Indian Removal Act, Cherokees were given control of the area under the original jurisdiction of the pre-statehood Cherokee Nation, within the Indian Territory. In the process, Dwight Mission was moved to the area from Russellville.

Vian was initially settled as a trading post between Big Vian and Little Vian creeks in the Illinois District of the Cherokee Nation. When a post office was established in 1886, the first postmaster, Mahala Thompson, wanted to name the town Round Mountain, which was already in use; the post office was thus named Vian, for the two creeks. After the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway and eventually the Missouri Pacific Railroad) laid tracks through the town in 1888, it became an important shipping point for cotton, with an estimated 2,500-3,000 bales shipped annually by 1901. When Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907, Vian became part of the new state as the Cherokee Nation was all but dissolved. Today, the town lies within the jurisdiction of the modern-day Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

Vian&#x27;s education system dates back to the late 1880s, when a mission school for Cherokee children was established; a white school was established in the 1890s. Vian was also home to the Douglass High School, which served the region&#x27;s African-American students. The district was integrated in the mid-1950s.

Today, Vian&#x27;s economy is based largely around tourism and services, owing to its location along Interstate 40 and its proximity to Sequoyah National Wildlife Refuge, Robert S. Kerr Reservoir and Tenkiller Ferry Lake. Agriculture remains prominent in the local economy as well.

<text>Central High is a town in Stephens County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,181 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==
The town was named in 1921, because it was near the center of a consolidated high school district (District 34), created from four smaller districts in Stephens County: Wolf Creek, Nellie, Prairie Center, and Pleasant Hill. Until then, students living in the area only had access to eighth grade education in each of the old districts. When Central High was formed, it built a four-room junior high and a senior high school named Central High School. Lower-grade students attended elementary schools in their former districts. This arrangement lasted until the late 1930s. A fire in 1952 destroyed the original Central High School.

The town incorporated in 1995. Supporters of incorporation wanted this so Central High could prevent annexation by surrounding towns, notably Duncan, Lawton or Marlow. Incorporation would also permit Central High to apply for municipal grants.

<text>Comanche is a city in Stephens County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,378 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Comanche is a small city in southwest Oklahoma, set in rolling prairie land interspersed with oil fields, ranches, farms, pecan orchards, and timbered areas.

Comanche is located in what was once the famous Louisiana Purchase, a part of which was later in 1855 designated Indian Territory and set aside for the Five Civilized Tribes. Comanche then became part of the Chickasaw Nation and was identified as Comanche, Indian Territory, until statehood in 1907.

The city has had a series of names. The first settlers lived north of the present site and called the settlement Tucker. With the coming of the Rock Island Railroad in 1892, Indian landowner Johnny D. Wilson gave the city its present site on the railroad, and the Tucker post office was moved here in 1893. Many had wanted to call it Wilson Town, and some called it Border Queen because of the annual large celebrations, carnivals, bands, and Indian activities. Mr. Wilson, however, insisted it be named Comanche because of the Comanche Indians who roamed here.

Comanche was incorporated November 23, 1898, and began its progress located about east of present-day Comanche. The cattle were driven from Texas, through Indian Territory to Kansas for shipment east. Parts of this historic trail can still be clearly seen today.

<text>Duncan is a city in and the county seat of Stephens County, Oklahoma, United States. Its population was 22,310 at the 2020 census. Centrally located in Stephens County, Duncan became the county seat after Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907. Oil wells opened in Stephens County in 1918 and led to rapid development. Cotton was a dominant crop until the Dust Bowl brought its decline, but cattle remain an important part of the economy. The Chisholm Trail passed to the east of Duncan prior to the town&#x27;s founding, which is home to the Chisholm Trail Heritage Center.

Duncan is the birthplace of the Halliburton Corporation. Erle P. Halliburton established the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company in 1919. Halliburton maintains seven different complexes in Duncan plus an employee recreational park, but the corporate offices relocated first to Dallas and later to Houston.

==History==
===19th century===
The Chisholm Trail passed to the east of Duncan prior to the town&#x27;s founding. An estimated 9,800,000 Longhorn cattle were herded up the trail between Texas and Abilene, Kansas, during its existence. After learning that an extension of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad was being built from Kansas to Texas, Scotsman William Duncan brought his wife, parents, and other relatives and created a trading post situated at the intersection of the north-south Chisholm Trail and the east–west military passage between Fort Arbuckle and Fort Sill. The first train arrived on June 27, 1892; that date is considered the official birth date of the town.

Many of the city&#x27;s first buildings were wood frame but were replaced by sandstone and brick structures after natural disasters destroyed them.

At the time of its founding, Duncan was located in Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation.

===20th century===
Four fires in 1901 burned down several buildings.

Centrally located in Stephens County, Oklahoma, Duncan became the county seat after Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907. As a compromise between residents of the northern and southern parts of the county, the county courthouse was located in the middle of Duncan&#x27;s Main Street, half of it in the northern part of the city and county and half in the southern. Main Street made a wide circle around it on both ends.

Oil wells opened in Stephens County in 1918 led to rapid development in Duncan. Shacks were prohibited immediately following the opening of the wells and other regulations were also put in place to channel the growth in an organized manner.

Several Tudor Revival-style homes were built in the 1930s. Works Progress Administration projects meant to rebuild the economy after the Great Depression resulted in a public library, a senior high school, a stadium, a pool, a school and auditorium for the black community, an armory, and numerous bridges and sidewalks.

Duncan expanded its city limits during an economic surge brought on by World War II. Towards the end of this period, the downtown area began to see a decline.

==Geography==

Duncan is situated approximately 30 miles east of Lawton and south of Oklahoma City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (15.67%) are covered by water.

Duncan is known for crape myrtle trees, Oklahoma prairie, and rich farmland. State lawmakers designated the city as Oklahoma&#x27;s official &quot;Crape Myrtle Capital&quot;. Oklahoma&#x27;s grasslands are made up of shortgrass, mixed-grass and tallgrass prairie. The city is part of the Great Plains and has four lakes.

Duncan receives 34 inches of rain per year, with five inches of snowfall. The city also receives an average of 241 sunny days per year. It lies 1,128 feet above mean sea level.

The downtown area lies between Walnut and Willow Avenues, from the railroad tracks to Highway 81.

Duncan once adopted the slogan, &quot;The Buckle on the Oil Belt&quot;. Its main claim to fame is as the birthplace of the Halliburton Corporation. Erle P. Halliburton perfected a new method of cementing wells, making oil production much easier and more profitable, and established the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company in 1919. He died in 1957, when the company had 201 offices in 22 states and 20 foreign countries. Halliburton maintains seven different complexes in Duncan plus an employee recreational park, but the corporate offices relocated first to Dallas and later to Houston.

Halliburton operates the Halliburton Technology Center in Duncan. In 2010, Halliburton announced that 150 jobs in the center were to move to Houston over the following two years.

Agriculture has always played a part in Duncan&#x27;s economy. Cotton was a dominant crop until the Dust Bowl brought about a reduction in its role. The cattle business remains an important part of Duncan&#x27;s economy.

The city has been home to a number of banks and doctors since its early settlement, and both continue to be well represented today.

<doc id="130616" wikidata="Q2124015" url="?curid=130616" title="Marlow, Oklahoma">
<text>Marlow is a city in Stephens County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 4,385 at the time of the 2020 Census. Marlow is located 10 miles north of Duncan, Oklahoma, and 30 miles east of Lawton, Oklahoma. 

==History==
The site that would become Marlow was first settled by Dr. Williamson Marlow, the father of the five Marlow brothers, when he and his wife, Martha Jane, moved from Missouri to the Wildhorse Creek area in Oklahoma in 1880. William Rathmell&#x27;s 1892 book &quot;Life of the Marlows&quot; detailed the history of the brothers&#x27; escapades and set a narrative for the city&#x27;s legacy.

===Marlow brothers===

Born along the Chisholm Trail and on the banks of Wildhorse Creek, the legend of the Marlow family and the five Marlow brothers has been proven to be more fact than fiction.

Dr. Williamson Marlow and his wife, Martha Jane, a relative of Daniel Boone, first established a homestead in this area during the early 1880s. The site of the original Marlow family home is reported to have been located just north of Redbud Park.

Somewhat of a nomad by nature, Dr. Marlow provided medical treatment to the many settlers in this portion of Indian Territory and to many cowboys driving cattle up the Chisholm Trail. He also farmed while his sons reportedly herded horses, selling many of the animals to the U.S. Army located at neighboring Fort Sill. Dr. Marlow died in 1885.

In 1888 his five sons were accused of horse-stealing, a charge which was later proven to be unfounded. Four of the brothers (Charlie, Alfred, Boone and Lewellyn) were arrested and transported by a U.S. Deputy Marshall to the Federal Court in Graham, Texas, for trial.

Hearing of this brother&#x27;s arrest, George Marlow took the entire family to Graham to clear his brothers but soon found himself behind bars.

Boone Marlow ultimately escaped and returned to the Marlow area in Indian Territory, while his four brothers were scheduled to be transported to an ostensibly safer jail in Weatherford, Texas.

Several attempts were made by Graham citizens and law enforcement officials to lynch the Marlows. On the night of January 19, 1889, the brothers were shackled in pairs—George to Lewellyn and Charlie to Alfred—for the trip to Weatherford.

When the group reached Dry Creek outside of Graham, a signal was given and a hidden mob opened fire on the seemingly defenseless Marlows.

The guards ran to join the mob while the brothers leaped from the wagon and armed themselves with guns taken from guards. In the vicious gunfight that followed, Lewellyn and Alfred were killed. Both George and Charlie were seriously wounded.

Retrieving a dead mob member&#x27;s knife, George Marlow unjointed his dead brother&#x27;s ankles. He and Charlie used a wagon to escape the ambush site.

Three members of the mob were also killed and a number of others wounded. Several members of the mob were later prosecuted and convicted for the assault upon the brothers.

Boone was later poisoned near Hell Creek, west of Marlow. His corpse was then shot in an attempt to obtain a $1,500 reward, but his killers, too, were brought to trial.

Alfred, Boone and Lewellyn are buried in a small cemetery at what was once Finis, Texas, outside of Graham.

George and Charlie Marlow survived the attack, eventually moving their families to Colorado where they became outstanding citizens, serving as law enforcement officers.

In 1891, after sentencing mob members for their part in the attack, Federal Judge A. P. McCormick was quoted as saying: &quot;This is the first time in the annals of history where unarmed prisoners, shackled together, ever repelled a mob. Such cool courage that preferred to fight against such great odds and die, if at all, in glorious battle rather than die ignominiously by a frenzied mob, deserves to be commemorated in song and story.&quot;

&quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot;, an American western film, uses concepts from &quot;Life of the Marlows&quot;, a book about the Marlow brothers.

===Jim Crow era===
From the end of the Reconstruction era until the mid 20th century, municipalities in different parts of the country enacted Jim Crow laws, which heavily restricted the rights of Black people. One of the worst racial violence incidents in American history took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with the Tulsa race massacre of 1921. In Marlow, prominent signs were erected publicly that stated, &quot;Negro, don&#x27;t let the sun go down on you here.&quot;

====Murders of Berch and Johnigan====
On December 17, 1923, Albert W. Berch, a white hotel owner, and his Black porter, Robert Johnigan, were confronted and later murdered by an angry mob of Marlow residents at the Johnson Hotel. Berch had hired Johnigan as a porter 10 days before Johnigan decided to quit, citing racial tensions and a planned move to Duncan, but upon the request of J. L. Campbell, a guest from Norman, he decided to give one last shoe-shine. A mob of at least 15 men approached the hotel after sundown, around 8:30 PM, &quot;who went to the hotel where the negro had been employed three days ago as a porter and shot down when Birch attempted to persuade them to desist from their threat to lynch the negro.&quot;

The mob entered the hotel via the lobby and continued into an adjoining room to find Johnigan shining Campbell&#x27;s shoes, asking Johnigan to leave. Campbell testified that one boy in the mob went into the room and grabbed Johnigan, but as Johnigan resisted, Campbell heard a gunshot, which prompted him to leave his chair just as Berch was falling. Campbell testified that he was heading to the hotel&#x27;s dining room and heard four shots in total but saw no weapon in Berch&#x27;s hand or any person who fired a gun. Berch had overheard the conflict between Johnigan and the mob, and he ordered the crowd to leave the hotel, stepping between Johnigan and mob member Marvin Kincannon, a man in his 20s alleged by Mrs. Berch as the leader of the mob.

Conflict escalated when Elza &quot;Roy&quot; Gandy apprehended Johnigan and began beating him with a stick. According to hotel patron and eyewitness Walter O&#x27;Quinn, Berch struck Gandy, who landed back against a table. When Berch ran to Johnigan&#x27;s defense, Kincannon fired a fatal bullet into the chest of Berch, who died within minutes, before twice shooting Johnigan, who died from his injuries at around 5:30 AM the following day. Other witnesses testified that it was Johnigan who knocked Gandy across a table and that Kincannon fired when the two were separated. As Berch fell, Johnigan started toward the phone booth, but Kincannon shot him inside the phone booth. Kincannon grabbed Johnigan out of the phone booth and shot him again in the chest. Four shots in total were fired according to O&#x27;Quinn.

Dr. Richards, a witness to the scene, testified that he saw Berch on the lobby floor succumbing to his wounds: &quot;Birch was dying, he only breathed a few more times after I got there and I saw I ocould do nothing for him and tried to do something for the nigger.&quot; Richards claimed Johnigan lie wounded in front of the shine stand about 10 feet from Berch. He claimed that &quot;one of the bullets struck the negro just above the right breast nipple and lodged in the intestines, probably striking a rib and being deflected downward into the stomach... The second bullet struck in the left groin and came out near the lower part of the hip, apparently being nothing more than a severe flesh wound.&quot; According to a contemporary report by &quot;The Duncan Banner&quot;, &quot;there had been trouble previous to the killing and that the negro had been warned by the defendants to leave the city.&quot;

Kincannon, allegedly the only member of the mob to brandish firearms, left the scene in an automobile with his companions after the shooting and could not be located by police. After multiple related arrests, Kincannon surrendered himself to authorities in Duncan around 3:00 AM on December 22, 1923; he and the other suspects were arraigned that afternoon. A preliminary hearing on January 2, 1924, before County Judge Eugene Rice included Marvin Kincannon, Elza Gandy, Bryon Wright, Fred Stotts, Ollie Lloyd, Homer Thompson, Ellis Spence, and Frank Cain as defendants. Kincannon was the only individual formally charged with Albert Berch&#x27;s killing. On April 18, 1924, Kincannon appeared at district court for the murder charge of Berch, for which the state initially sought the death penalty according to County Attorney Paul Sullivan. &quot;The Duncan Banner&quot; observed that the defendant decided not to refute that the shooter was Kincannon but instead plea self-defense. Kincannon was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for Berch&#x27;s death and sentenced to 25 years in state prison, of which he served 11.

Gandy, whose father was a Marlow police officer, was also convicted of manslaughter for his role in inciting the mob, attacking Johnigan, and furnishing the firearm that was used in the killings. Gandy&#x27;s sentence was declared as life imprisonment on May 15, 1926, but he received a 7-year sentence. An appellate court stated that &quot;Gandy was one of the chief instigators of the mob which was formed to run the negro out of town.&quot; Gandy denied that he instigated the mob or furnished Kincannon the gun. Gandy received parole at least twice; once for seven days for his grandmother&#x27;s death, reported on January 26, 1928, and again for five days to visit his sick sister in Hobart, Oklahoma, on August 13, 1929.

The story was featured in &quot;The Casper Daily Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Albany-Decatur Daily&quot;, the &quot;Shreveport Journal&quot;, &quot;The Vancouver Daily Province&quot;, and the &quot;Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch&quot;, among others. Elza Gandy died on December 9, 1949, in Caldwell, Kansas. Marvin Kincannon died at age 71 in July 1972. In 2019, Berch&#x27;s maternal grandson, Albert Berch Hollingsworth, published a non-fiction book about the incident titled &quot;Killing Albert Berch&quot;, which he spent five years researching.

<text>Torah Judaism refers to schools of thought in Judaism perceived to be most adherent to the Torah and &quot;mitzvot.&quot; The term is often used by Orthodox Jewish groups to refer to their own system of beliefs.

These &quot;mitzvot&quot; include both the biblical and rabbinic &quot;mitzvot&quot;. The phrase &quot;Torah Judaism&quot; implies a belief and practice of Judaism that is based on the inclusion of the entire Tanakh and Talmud, as well as later rabbinic authorities, as sources of conducting oneself in life, and on the premise that the Torah emanates directly from God, as revealed at biblical Mount Sinai. The term &quot;Torah Judaism&quot; is consciously intended to label non-Orthodox Jewish religious movements as being divorced from the Torah.

Torah Judaism is also an ideological concept used by many Orthodox thinkers to describe their movement as the sole Jewish denomination faithful to traditional Jewish values.

Followers of Torah Judaism may also follow the &quot;Da&#x27;as Torah&quot;, i.e., the guidelines of rabbis or &quot;hakhamim&quot; based on the Talmud. In recent time, these hakhamim may include the followers&#x27; rebbes (Hasidic rabbis), rosh yeshivas (deans of yeshivas), or a posek, often identified as an expert in the Shulkhan Arukh. (This recognition of a posek is often limited to Haredi communities, as opposed to Modern Orthodox Jews, although the latter are also Torah-observant.)

<text>Guymon ( ) is a city and county seat of Texas County, in the panhandle of Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 12,965, an increase of 13.3% from 11,442 in 2010, and represents more than half of the population of the county, along with being the largest city in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Cattle feedlots, corporate pork farms, and natural gas production dominate its economy, with wind energy production and transmission recently diversifying landowners&#x27; farms. Guymon was the only town or city in Oklahoma in 2010 and 2020 in which the majority of the population was Hispanic.

==History==

In the 1890s, Edward T. &quot;E.T.&quot; Guymon, president of the Inter-State Land and Town Company, purchased a section of land west of the Beaver River, also known as the North Canadian River. The site grew very rapidly after the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (Rock Island) built a line from Liberal, Kansas, to Texhoma, Texas, in 1901. A community, first named Sanford by the U.S. Post Office Department, was situated along the line. It was renamed Guymon a month later by postal officials to avoid confusion with the town of Stratford, Texas, which was further down the line. Guymon incorporated in 1901. The town plat was filed in Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1904.

Guymon&#x27;s growth was helped when most of the businesses moved there from the nearby town of Hardesty. One of these was the newspaper, &quot;Hardesty Herald&quot;, which owner Richard B. Quinn quickly renamed as the &quot;Guymon Herald&quot;. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Guymon claimed 839 residents, and was named county seat of the newly created Texas County. By the 1910 U.S. census, the town had 1,342 residents. It also had three banks, three hotels, four doctors, a flour mill, a grain company, and several retail establishments. A second newspaper, the &quot;Guymon Democrat&quot;, was in business. Agriculture became the basis of Guymon&#x27;s economy. The 1920 census recorded 1,507 residents, which grew to 2,181 in 1930. By 1932, the town had two cream stations and five grain elevators.

The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s had a negative effect on Guymon. Some old-time residents remember &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, April 14, 1935, as the day of the worst dust storm in the area&#x27;s history. However, discovery of the nearby Hugoton-Panhandle gas field created many new jobs, and brought Guymon&#x27;s population to 2,290 in 1940.

The Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo has offered tributes to the community&#x27;s pioneer spirit every May since 1933. In 2014, the rodeo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. In 2006, the rodeo had over 900 contestants with over $385,000 in prize money.

==Geography==
Located on the High Plains of the central Oklahoma Panhandle, Guymon sits north of Amarillo, Texas, and west-northwest of Woodward. Optima National Wildlife Refuge, Optima Lake, and the state-run Optima Wildlife Management Area lie roughly to the east along the North Canadian River. Guymon sits at an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (0.27%) is covered by water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 12,965 people and 3,453 households residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,941 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city as of 2020 was 58.1% Hispanic, 29.3% non-Hispanic White, 3.6% Black, 5.6% Asian, 4.7% of two or more races, and 0.1% Native American.

There were 3,453 households; the average household size was 3.28 persons. As of 2010, 39.8% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.0% were married couples living together, 8.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.9% were non-families. 21.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 31.3% under the age of 18 and 7.6% who were 65 years of age or older. 45.2% of the city&#x27;s 2020 population was female.

The median income for a household in the city was $53,164. The per capita income for the city was $19,455. About 24.6% of the population was below the poverty line, increasing from 14.3% in 2010.

In the 2010 census, Guymon had the fourth largest Hispanic population among cities in the state, trailing only Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Lawton. In terms of percentages, the Hispanic population of Guymon comprised 52 percent of the population, the highest percentage of Hispanic residents of any city or town in Oklahoma. In 2022 the Hispanic population had increased to 57 percent of the population of Guymon. Guymon has been cited as an example of how immigration can save rural communities, most of which in Oklahoma and many other states have been losing population for decades.

==Economy==
Guymon is a hub for the local economy, which includes wheat farming, livestock, hog and dairy farming, manufacturing, and oil and natural gas production. A United States soil conservation station is located nearby. Local manufacturers produce agricultural tillage tools, pressure tanks, and formula feeds. The town of Goodwell, Oklahoma, home of Oklahoma Panhandle State University, lies to the southwest of Guymon.

Opening of the Hugoton-Panhandle Gas Field led to the establishment of two carbon black plants, the Dandee Manufacturing Company (makers of farming equipment), an ice plant, the OK Welding Manufacturing Company, a feed mill, the Phillips Petroleum cracking plant, and the Southwestern Public Service Company generating plant. The Guymon Municipal Hospital (later renamed Memorial Hospital of Texas County) opened in 1949.

The city&#x27;s largest employer, Seaboard pork processing plant, operates at double shift capacity and processes about 18,000 hogs each day, and its 2,300 employees make up about 20% of the entire city&#x27;s population. Hitch Ranch, which began opening cattle feedlots during the 1960s, is the city&#x27;s second-largest employer. A Swift and Company packing plant is located near Hitch Ranch. The City of Guymon, the Panhandle Telephone Cooperative, and the hospital round out the list of top employers. The employment opportunities created by these industries, especially of the Seaboard company, has led to an influx of Hispanics and recent immigrants to the U.S. which accounts for the population growth of Guymon and the surrounding area while most of Oklahoma&#x27;s small cities and rural communities are losing population.

A movement to harness wind power for electricity generation began a large-scale boom in the Guymon area in 2011. The DeWind Company had two 40-megawatt projects online (near Goodwell) in 2012, joined by a 200-megawatt project in 2015.

==Government==
Guymon has a council-manager form of government. Mitch Wagner was the city manager as of February 2018.

==Education==
Guymon residents are served by the Guymon School District. The school system was begun in 1902–3. The first high school building was built in 1917. Guymon schools were closed for one year during the Great Depression because funds were insufficient to keep them operating. The school district opened a new high school in 1954. This was replaced with a new facility in 1974.

The city has eight elementary schools, one junior high school, and one high school, whose team mascot is the Tiger.

<text>Hardesty is a town in Texas County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town’s population was 205.

==History==
The original Hardesty was four miles northeast of the present community. It had a post office in 1887, with the name honoring A.J. &quot;Jack&quot; Hardesty, who had interests in the area. However, the Rock Island railroad bypassed the town in 1901 and created the locale that became Guymon, Oklahoma. Most of Hardesty’s residents and businesses relocated to Guymon, and the original town withered.

When a second Rock Island line later came through the county near the old Hardesty in 1929, a new community along the route was named Hardesty at the insistence of locals. However, growth of the new Hardesty was stunted by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. The town nevertheless incorporated in 1947 and remains in place, complete with a post office and a school district covering 250 square miles.

==Geography==
Hardesty is just south of the Coldwater Creek arm of the Optima Lake project, including Optima National Wildlife Refuge, and the Optima Wildlife Management Area public hunting lands managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation.

<text>Texhoma is a town in Texas County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 596 at the 2020 census. Texhoma is a divided city with the Texas–Oklahoma state border separating the town from Texhoma, Texas. The name of the town is a portmanteau of Texas and Oklahoma. Founded around the Rock Island Railroad laying tracks through the area, much of the town&#x27;s local economy is from ranching and livestock.

==History==
Before No Man&#x27;s Land was opened for settlers in 1890, the area now known as the Oklahoma Panhandle was sparsely settled ranchland. After the opening, filing occurred on some of the land near the CCC Ranch, mostly by the cowboys, and sold to the ranch as soon as proved up. Expansion of the Rock Island Railroad tracks from Liberal, Kansas to Santa Rosa, New Mexico spurred the settlement&#x27;s formation.

A post office named Loretta was established May 7, 1898, but anticipating the railroad, the post office in 1901 moved and changed its name to Texhoma, said name referring to the community&#x27;s location on the state line. Very few claims were filed on until the railroad was assured. The town grew quickly to a population near 1,000, serving as the closest railroad town to the people who lived as far north and west as present Boise City, and south into the Texas Panhandle to the present town of Gruver.

After a 1932 survey moved the border south by about 365 feet, most of the businesses in the Texhoma in Texas were moved into the Oklahoma.

<text>Frederick is a city and county seat of Tillman County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,940 at the 2010 census. It is an agriculture-based community that primarily produces wheat, cotton, and cattle. Frederick is home to three dairies, a 1400-acre industrial park, and Frederick Regional Airport, which includes restored World War II hangars which house the World War II Airborne Demonstration Team.

Frederick was visited in April 1905 by then U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt while he was on a wolf hunt.

==History==
Originally established in 1901, the Frederick area was among the last of the Oklahoma Territory land to be opened to settlement. What is now Frederick used to be two towns: Gosnell and Hazel. Both towns were established in 1901, when the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation was opened to settlement. In 1902 the towns combined in order to take advantage of the Blackwell, Enid and Southern Railroad. The new town was named Frederick, after the son of a railroad executive. Gosnell received the depot, and the residents of Hazel moved north to the new town of Frederick.The post office moved from Gosnell to Frederick, for which it was renamed in 1902.

Most of the business district was destroyed by fires in 1904 and 1905. The buildings had been made of wood, and were quickly replaced with brick.

In the spring of 1905, President Teddy Roosevelt visited Frederick to meet with Jack &quot;Catch-&#x27;em-alive&quot; Abernathy, the famed barehanded wolf hunter, and introduced the area to tourism and its recreational value. In 1907 the City of Frederick was incorporated, Oklahoma became a state, Frederick was named the seat of Tillman County, and the Katy Railroad came to Frederick. By 1915, Frederick had 15 miles of sidewalks and crossings, and 75 miles of wide, graded, rolled streets. The first paved streets were laid in 1918.
The Frederick Army Air Field opened in 1941, training pilots to fly UC-78 light transport aircraft and B-25 bombers. In 1953, the base was turned over to the City of Frederick, and is now the Frederick Municipal Airport and Industrial Park.

In 1962 a flagpole was erected in Pioneer Park, fulfilling the agreement between Gosnell, Hazel and the railroad.

<text>Grandfield is a city in Tillman County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 919 as of the 2020 United States census. It is located about 30 driving miles southeast of the county seat of Frederick, and is situated at the intersection of US Route 70 and Oklahoma State Highway 36.

==History==
===Opening the Big Pasture===
The Big Pasture, approximately bounded on the south by the Red River and presently located in parts of Comanche, Cotton, and Tillman counties, was the last settled territory in Oklahoma. Native control of the land traces to the Quapaw, who ceded it to the United States in 1818. The Choctaw and Chickasaw accepted the area in the 1820s and 1830s but lost it as a result of the Reconstruction Treaty of 1866. By the terms of the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 a reservation that included the Big Pasture was set-aside for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache. The land became part of Oklahoma Territory in December 1906.

Opening bids to quarter-sections of the Big Pasture to prospective homesteader began on December 3 and ended on December 15, 1909. There were over 100,000 bids for the available 1,830 quarter-sections. Bids varied from $5,800 to $7,376.

Prior to the opening of the area, the United States platted five official townships: Randlett, Ahpeatone, Isadore, Quanah and Eschiti. The only town remaining today is Randlett. Eschiti was the official town nearest the present site of Grandfield.

===Founding===

Problems began when the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railroad missed Eschiti by two miles and Kell City (named for the railroad promoter Frank Kell of Wichita Falls) sprang up along the railroad&#x27;s route.

By 1907, Eschiti had an official United States Post Office and Kell City had the railroad. Citizens from both towns were in heated competition for new settlers and businesses moving to the area.

To try to settle the differences, Reverend Andrew J. Tant, a Baptist minister and homesteader, went into partnership with Frank Kell and offered free lots to businesses if they would relocate to the Tant farm, which would eventually become Grandfield. Since the Tant farm was only about a mile from Kell City, people willingly moved. Free lots were also promised to all churches and schools. Observers at that time wrote they could look through their windows and see lines of houses being moved. According to Mrs. Lawrence Hooks, an early settler, she once cooked breakfast in Eschiti and dinner in Grandfield, without leaving her house.

A committee appealed to the United States Post Office to establish a post office. Assistant Postmaster General Charles P. Grandfield was helpful in granting the request. Consequently, the town was named in his honor. On January 16, 1909, Grandfield citizens voted, almost unanimously, for incorporation, and the post office opened January 21, 1909. In 1910 the population stood at 830.
The town&#x27;s founders and early residents came from a variety of locations, backgrounds, cultures and religions; the States of Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas were well represented, and a substantial number of newly arrived European immigrants also made their homes in Grandfield.

===Oil boom===

There were two oil fields discovered in the Grandfield area: the Northwest Oil Field; and the Red River Oil Field.
The influence of the oil industry on Grandfield cannot be overstated. The closing of the Bell Oil and Refinery Company refinery in the 1960s arguably started the population decline.

Originally, this was the location of a railroad switch known as &quot;Happy Jack,&quot; &quot;Happy Spur,&quot; or just &quot;Happy.&quot; The first station was a boxcar, and the first train arrived on November 16, 1907. The town was named for Harry L. Hollister, the depot agent in Frederick. A post office was established on February 1, 1909.

Hollister&#x27;s population peaked at 200 in 1940, then began a fairly steady decline. The high school closed in 1963 and the grade school in 1968. At the turn of the 21st Century, Hollister had a post office, a Baptist church and two grain elevators.

<text>Tipton is a town in the western part of Tillman County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 847 at the United States 2010 census, a 31.6 percent decline from 1,238 in 2000.

Tipton also is home to Tipton Home, originally called Tipton Orphans&#x27; Home, a home for children, established in 1921, when Sol and Maggie Tipton donated a plot of land in Canadian, Texas to the founders. The Tipton Church of Christ moved the home to Tipton in 1924, where it still operated into the 21st century.

==History==
The community was originally called Farmersville, but the name was changed to Stinson, honoring W. A. Stinson who owned the townsite. He sold the site to investors from Elk City. The town moved in 1909 to a location closer to the newly-laid Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway (acquired by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway in 1911). The townspeople voted to change the name again to Tipton, honoring John J. Tipton, conductor of the first train to pass through the area. A town plat was filed on July 29, 1909, and a post office was opened on September 18, 1909. The population was 441 in 1910.

During World War II, the U.S. government built a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp outside of town to house German soldiers.

On November 7, 2011, an EF4 tornado struck within the vicinity of the town. It was the first violent tornado to occur in the month of November in Oklahoma state history.

On May 16, 2015, the town was nearly hit by a violent wedge tornado.

Although Tipton lies in a hot, dry area, the soil of the area around the town is rich and, with the coming of irrigation, proved quite suited to growing cotton. The town economy has been based on serving the local agricultural industry. The population grew until it hit a peak in 1940, then dropped until 1960, when it dipped to 1117. It rose again to an all-time peak of 1475 in 1980, and has since fallen backward again.

Tipton lies on the northern portion of the Tillman Terrace Aquifer, an alluvial aquifer in western Tillman County, associated with the southern extent of the North Fork of the Red River. The farmland surrounding Tipton is noted for high-quality soils. &quot;Tipton loam&quot; is considered to be among the most ideal soils in the United States. Much of the farmland is devoted to irrigated cotton. Other crops include alfalfa, silage corn, and wheat. Truck crops were grown in this area until the 1950s and have made a recent comeback.

On June 27, 1994, Tipton tied the record for the hottest temperature ever recorded for Oklahoma, at .

<text>Glenpool is a city in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, United States. It is part of the Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area (TMSA). As of 2020, the population was 14,040, which represented an increase of 29.9% since the 2010 census, which reported the total population as 10,808.

Glenpool is notable because the discovery of oil in 1905, which caused an economic boom that propelled the growth of Tulsa and its surroundings. Although the Glenn Pool Oil Reserve, for which the city was named, still produces a small amount of oil; the city is now primarily a commuter town for Tulsa.

==History==

On November 22, 1905, wildcatters, Robert Galbreath Jr. and Frank Chesley (along with, by some accounts, Charles Colcord), drilling for oil on farmland owned by Creek Indian Ida E. Glenn, created the first oil gusher in what would soon be known as the &quot;Glenn Pool&quot;. The discovery set off a boom of growth for the area, bringing in hordes of people: lease buyers, producers, millionaires, laborers, tool suppliers, drunks, swindlers, and newspeople. Daily production soon exceeded . The nearby city of Tulsa benefited from the production, and Glenpool calls itself the town that made Tulsa famous.

By the end of 1906 a settlement consisting of twelve families had grown up nearby. In that year, the Midland Valley Railroad extended a track from Jenks. By 1907, nearly 3,000 people had moved to the area, but only about 500 people actually lived in the town in 1910. Lots were platted and a post office opened on January 31, 1908. The new community was renamed &quot;Glenpool.&quot;

Sometime after the discovery, Ida Glenn and her husband, Robert, sold their farm and moved to California.

In the early days, Glenpool was on the route of the Sapulpa &amp; Interurban Railway (“S&amp;I”) streetcar/interurban line connecting to Tulsa through Kiefer and Sapulpa, as well as south to Mounds; S&amp;I subsequently went through a series of mergers and name changes, with only the Tulsa-to-Sapulpa portion continuing as the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Railway.

Population grew to 428 in 1920, but declined thereafter to 280 in 1950. A post-WWII building boom then pushed the population upward to 353 in 1960. During the 1970s and 1980s, urban sprawl of the city of Tulsa reached Glenpool, and the town became a bedroom suburb. It has been growing since. By 1970 the population had risen to 770, then to 2,706 in 1980.

An annual celebration called &quot;Black Gold Days&quot; is a three-day, family-friendly event with food, music, arts and crafts, a carnival, and a parade. It commemorates the early years of Glenpool&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
Glenpool is located in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma, approximately south of downtown Tulsa on U.S. Route 75, a major national north–south artery. The city is on the eastern edge of the Cross Timbers ecoregion, between the Great Plains and the foot of the Ozarks.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total land area of as of 2020.

==Glenn Pool Oil Field==
Galbreath and Chesley had used their own money to pay for an oil drilling rig, with operator, and a lease on Ida Glenn&#x27;s land. By November 22, 1905, they had drilled through the Red Fork Sand, the deepest known producing sand in the area without striking oil. There was a small stream of natural gas at a depth of 
, so they decided to drill deeper. A few feet further down, the rig encountered a formation known as the Bartlesville Sand, where Chesley noticed the first trace of oil on the drill bit. The well began making a gurgling sound and soon emitted a gusher clear over the derrick. The well soon produced over 75 barrels a day of light, sweet crude oil. Galbreath and Chesley named the well Ida Glenn Number 1. In 1906, Galbreath drilled another well about from Ida Glenn Number 1. This well was also a producer.

Other people rushed to the area to begin drilling, and soon defined the extent of the field. Prices for leases and for drilling services rose sharply. Fewer than two percent of the wildcat wells failed to produce oil. Some of the Creek landowners began earning as much as a million dollars a year from royalties on the production from their 160-acre plots. According to one source,&quot;... More money was made on the Oklahoma oil boom than the California gold rush and Colorado silver rush combined.&quot;

After only one year, the Glenn Pool field had 127 completed wells. Of these, 107 produced oil, 12 found only gas and 11 were dry holes. In addition, 24 more wells were in progress and 33 sites were being readied for drilling. By 1907, the field was increasingly controlled by three companies: Texaco, Gulf Oil Company and Prairie Oil and Gas. Galbreath and Chesley were ready to move on. They sold their Glenn Pool holdings to Edgar Crosbie for $US 500,000 and $US 200,000, respectively.

The Ida Glenn well was plugged and abandoned in 1964. The Glen Pool field still produces a relatively small flow of oil in the 21st century, using waterflood techniques. Over its life span, the field has produced more than 340 million barrels of oil.

Glenpool had one newspaper, the &quot;Glenpool Post&quot;. The paper was published every Wednesday. It was owned by Community Publishers, a newspaper and Internet publisher and commercial printer that served Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. In 2012, the &quot;Glenpool Post&quot; was merged with the &quot;Jenks Journal&quot; and the &quot;Bixby Bulletin&quot; to form the &quot;South County Leader&quot; with the news focusing on Glenpool being a component in the newspaper. Ultimately, the &quot;South County Leader&quot; ceased publication in 2014.

<text>Jenks is a city in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, United States, and a suburb of Tulsa, in the northeastern part of the state. It is situated between the Arkansas River and U.S. Route 75. Jenks is one of the fastest-growing cities in Oklahoma. The city&#x27;s population was 16,924 in the 2010 census, but by 2020, this had grown to 25,949.

==History==
Jenks began in 1904 as a community site established by the Midland Valley Railroad between Tulsa and Muskogee, alongside the Arkansas River. Though the river could only be utilized by shallow draft steamboats while the water level was up, these two transportation routes proved vital to Jenks&#x27; early development.

Jenks was named after William Henry Jenks the owner and director of the Midland Valley Railroad. According to a 1957 article in the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot;, an agent for the townsite company was told by the railroad home office to name a town for the director.

The town was officially platted on July 15, 1905. Also in 1905, a major petroleum discovery was made, further bolstering the economy of the area. The &quot;Glenn Pool&quot; oil well and subsequent oil claims brought many business people to the general area. In 1906, many oil depots (also known as &quot;tank farms&quot;) were constructed in Jenks. By the time of statehood, Jenks had 465 inhabitants.

As oil production waned, tank farms were dismantled, and agriculture became once again a major contributor to the Jenks economy. The economy of the area was further improved in the 1920s when many Bulgarian families immigrated to the area to farm. These immigrants established many vegetable farms.

From 1904 through the 1950s, Jenks experienced many floods from the overflow of the Arkansas River and Polecat Creek. In the 1920s and 1930s, floods were severe. During one flood in the late 1920s, the water was so deep that it completely covered every building but the roof of the three-story-high school. Everyone was evacuated except two men and one woman. They had one shotgun, one small boat, food and a tent on top of the school. They guarded the remains of Jenks for several weeks until the water receded. In 1948, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a levee around Jenks, and the community subsequently grew as a result of the increased safety and security. There was another threat of severe flooding in 1986, when severe rainstorms upstream along the Arkansas River forced the Corps of Engineers to release as much as 300,000 cubic feet per second from the Keystone Dam into the river. This caused a mandatory evacuation order in Jenks and several other river communities.

Jenks has served as a river crossing point via several bridges over the past century. In 1910, a single-lane bridge was built and strengthened the economic success of the area. The year 1948 saw the construction of a replacement two-lane bridge, which still stands today and now serves as a pedestrian crossing between the Riverwalk and the South Tulsa River Parks. The original 1910 bridge was destroyed and all that is left are a few columns and pieces of metal that are seen when the water level is low. A four-lane bridge was built in 1996.

The current High School building was built in 1960-61 and has undergone three major additions. The United States Census of 1970 placed the population of the city at 1,990 and there were approximately 1100 students in public school.

In the 1970s, the Tulsa water system was expanded into Jenks. That decade also saw the construction of a nearby Public Service of Oklahoma gas-fired electric power plant. These developments improved the infrastructure of the area and helped the economy.

In the 1980s, Kimberly-Clark built a manufacturing facility that provides many jobs for the area to this day.

Jenks was named the “Antique Capital of Oklahoma” by the former first lady of Oklahoma, Shirley Bellmon, and the many stores that call Main Street home keep that tradition going. Visitors can park and walk all day browsing vintage wares alongside new and repurposed offerings.

Spring days are perfect for enjoying the sunshine and admiring the flower pots full of tulips, provided by the Jenks Garden Club.

In the winter months, the streets are lined with glimmering snowflakes. Their light illuminates the hearts of those that stroll down the sidewalks.

<text>Sperry is a town in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,115 at the time of the 2020 census. It is primarily a bedroom community, since approximately 85 percent of the employed residents commute to work in Tulsa and other nearby towns. Sperry also has an active retirement community.

==History==
Native American activity in the area antedates the establishment of the town. Of note during the Civil War was the Battle of Chusto-Talasah, fought approximately nine miles southeast on the “Caving Banks” bend of Bird Creek, where on December 9, 1861, Opothleyahola’s Union-allied Indians met the forces of Col. D.H. Cooper’s Confederate troops.

Sperry was originally known as Beuhler Switch. It was named after Charles Beuhler, an employee of the Midland Valley Railroad. The Sperry post office in the Cherokee Nation was established on May 17, 1902, to serve a rural community between Hominy and Delaware Creeks. The post office was located in the Carson Ranch house. The origin of the name Sperry is not clear. One source claims that the name was derived from the surname of a local landowner named Henry Spybuck. The Midland Valley Railroad built a line from Arkansas to Eastern Kansas that reached Sperry in March 1905. The route no longer exists, but has been converted from rail into the 14.5 mile Osage Prairie Trail linking Sperry with Tulsa to the south and Skiatook to the north.

Exploration for oil brought prosperity between 1905 and 1910. Sperry incorporated in 1920, when the census recorded a population of 487. Two communities joined to form present-day Sperry. One was previously known as &quot;Buehler Switch.&quot; This was the larger community, the location of the railroad and depot, and centered around 96th Street North and S. H. 11. The smaller community, consisting of only two or three homes and a general store/post office housed in the same building, was actually known as Sperry. It was on Hominy Creek. near 106th Street North and North Peoria. When statehood was granted in 1907, the post office was renamed Sperry and was moved from the general store to a new grocery store near the depot.

From 1982 to 1989, the Sperry WPA armory served as headquarters to the newly organized Oklahoma Army National Guard 45th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. The &quot;Lords of Darkness&quot; specialized in operating the OH-6 Little Bird helicopter while using night vision goggles. Aircraft were kept a short distance from the Tulsa Air National Guard Base. The unit evolved into the 1-245th Aviation Regiment, now housed at the Tulsa Army National Guard Aviation Complex near 46th St N and Highway 169 which was built 1988.

<text>Coweta is a city in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States, a suburb of Tulsa. As of 2010, its population was 9,943. Part of the Creek Nation in Indian Territory before Oklahoma became a U.S. state, the town was first settled in 1840.

==History==
Before statehood, when the Five Tribes or Five Civilized Tribes were moved to Indian Territory from the Southeastern United States, the area that is now Coweta was designated as part of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Coweta was named after a Lower Creek town on the Chattahoochee River in southwestern Georgia. It was first settled by Muscogee about 1840.

In 1843, Robert Loughridge, a Presbyterian minister, arrived in the area and established a mission, named &quot;Koweta&quot;. He had gained Creek Council approval for this the year before. Loughridge left Koweta in 1850 to supervise the newly completed Tullahassee Mission School. Both schools closed in 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War, when missionaries left the Territory.

In 1867 after the Civil War, the Creek Indians adopted a constitution related to the model of the United States. In addition to government, it established six districts for their nation. Everything northeast of the Arkansas River, including Tulsa, became the Coweta district. The political center of this district was located in a log courthouse on Coweta Creek, about a quarter mile west of present-day center of downtown Coweta. The post office was established on May 24, 1897, and took its name from Koweta Mission.

As a result of negotiations with the congressionally appointed Dawes Commission, regarding the allotment of tribal communal lands in 1897–1898, the Creek courts’ jurisdiction was turned over to the federal government.

Notable events in 1903 included the arrival of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad in Coweta; founding of the community&#x27;s first newspaper,&quot; The Courier&quot;; construction of the first public school for whites; and installation of a telephone line.

The Creek Nation had already established numerous schools for Indian children in their territory well before this time. The tribal school system was funded from federal annuities paid following Creek removal to Indian Territory. By the later 19th century, the Creek Nation encouraged the founding of more schools: Wealaka Mission School (1882), which replaced Tullahassee; Asbury Manual Labor School, transferred from Alabama; Harrell Institute (1881); Bacone College (1885); and Levering, Nuyaka, and Yuchi Mission schools. In this period, they had seven boarding schools for Indian children, three boarding schools for descendants of Creek Freedmen, including what was known after 1883 as the Tullahassee Manual Labor School; and 65 day schools.

Now, the city&#x27;s largest employers are Coweta school system, Walmart (one retail store), and the City of Coweta. Many employed residents now commute to Tulsa, Broken Arrow, or Muskogee.

==Government==
Coweta has a council-manager form of government.

==Points of interest==

<doc id="130641" wikidata="Q2098229" url="?curid=130641" title="Okay, Oklahoma">
<text>Okay is a town along the east bank of the Verdigris River in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 620 at the 2010 census, a 3.9 percent increase over the figure of 597 recorded in 2000.

==Etymology and history==
Okay&#x27;s history as a community began &quot;circa&quot; 1806, when a French trader named Joseph Bogy established a trading post in the Three Forks area of what would eventually become the state of Oklahoma. The firm of Brand and Barbour took over the post later. When Barbour died in 1822, A. P. Chouteau, who had already established a trading post at Salina bought the Three Forks post. At the time, the post included twelve houses and a ferry. Chouteau expanded his business by bringing in Creole carpenters to construct keelboats that local traders needed to transport the goods they obtained from the local Indians to New Orleans and St. Louis. For a while, the Osage tribe claimed ownership of the land, which they ceded to the Western Cherokees before the Trail of Tears. Then the Western Creeks were allowed to settle on part of the land. In 1828, the Federal Government bought Chouteau&#x27;s land for construction of a Creek Agency.

The settlement had various names before 1919. The St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway called a nearby switch Coretta, and the US Post Office adopted the name in 1891. The Cook Gang robbed the train at Coretta on 1894. The name Falls City was also current, from nearby rapids on the Verdigris River. The post office name changed to Rex in 1900 and North Muskogee in 1911. The name Okay was adopted on October 18, 1919, after the &quot;O. K. Trucks&quot; brand of oil tankers made at a factory built there in 1915 by the Oklahoma Auto Manufacturing Company, which later renamed itself the &quot;O. K. Truck Manufacturing Company&quot;. Okay has been noted for its unusual place name.

A fire destroyed most of the business district in 1936, including two general stores, a church, the post office, and two vacant buildings. Only two businesses, a filling station and a blacksmith shop, survived the disaster.

About 26.2% of families and 27.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.9% of those under age 18 and 34.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
According to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, the Okay Public School Board of Education has instituted a policy of allowing teachers to have guns in their schools. On February 1, 2016, the signs that had read, &quot;Gun Free School Zone,&quot; were replaced by signs reading, &quot;Attention. Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.&quot;

Superintendent Charles McMahan was quoted as saying that, &quot;No specific incident caused us to pass this policy. ...With everything that is going on in the world, we&#x27;ve heard that you may possibly see more attacks from radical groups looking for children.&quot; McMahan pointed out that Okay has only one police officer. Other law enforcement officers can respond from Wagoner, Oklahoma in about 10 minutes. He added that about five percent of the Okay teachers are armed.

Teachers participating in the program must have a concealed carry permit, a certificate from Oklahoma&#x27;s Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, a psychiatric evaluation and take a shooting course three times a year. They must carry their own guns (45 caliber or less), or keep them in a locked box at school. The policy also requires the armed teachers wear an identifying badge, hat or jacket.

<text>Redbird is a town in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 137 at the 2010 census, a 10.5 percent decline from the figure of 153 in 2000. Founded at the turn of the 20th century, it was one of more than fifty all-black towns in Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory and is one of thirteen surviving black communities in Oklahoma.

==History==
Redbird, also called Red Bird, originated with the settlement by the family of E. L. Barber, who founded the First Baptist Church in 1889. Other families soon moved into the area. By 1902, Red Bird had obtained a post office. More than 600 people showed up at the official opening of Red Bird on August 10, 1907.

The town advertised in newspapers all across the South to encourage black families to relocate there. Redbird&#x27;s population attained a peak of 336 in 1920. Declining cotton prices caused residents to move away, even before the Great Depression. It rebounded after World War II, and at one point had seven churches, a couple of general stores, eight juke joints, and a gas station.

Urbanization in later years lost the town population again, and the post office closed; however, the town is experiencing something of a rebirth as families buy homes in the area to enjoy a low crime rate and a quieter pace of life.

==Geography==
Redbird is located at (35.888676, -95.588211).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<text>Tullahassee is a town in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 106 in both the 2010 and the 2000 censuses. It was the location of Tullahassee Mission, an Indian boarding school that burned in 1880. Because their population in the community had declined, the Muscogee Creek gave the school to Creek Freedmen, paying to replace the main building, and relocated with their families to the area of Wealaka Mission.

Tullahassee is considered the oldest of the surviving all-black towns in former Indian Territory. By 1880 Creek Freedmen and their descendants dominated the community population.

==History==
The town began in 1850, when the Creek Nation approved the Tullahassee Mission School at this site on the Texas Road. It was founded by Robert McGill Loughridge, a Presbyterian minister who had been serving in the Creek Nation since 1843 and had founded another mission that year.

In the years before the Emancipation Proclamation, many Creek citizens of the town had Black slaves. In the early 1880s, the population of freedmen had increased in the area, while the number of Muscogee Creek had declined. The freedmen were formerly enslaved African Americans and their descendants who were emancipated and granted citizenship in the Creek Nation after the American Civil War. Some also had Creek ancestry.

After a destructive fire at the school, the Creek Council decided to relocate most of their people, and transferred the Creek children to Wealaka Mission. They gave the school and community of Tullahassee to the freedmen in 1881. The Creek paid to have the school&#x27;s main building replaced.

The residents opened a post office in 1899, and the town was incorporated in 1902. The Tullahassee Town Site Company was established to aid developing the town, and it both platted the town in 1907 and recruited black residents from throughout the post-Reconstruction South, where Jim Crow oppression was increasing. A. J. Mason served as president and L. C. Hardridge as secretary. This is now the oldest of the 13 surviving all-Black towns in the state, which were established during the period of Indian Territory. At one time there were 50 all-black towns.

The A. J. Mason Building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 85001743). Carter G. Woodson School, named for a prominent black historian, is listed in the Oklahoma Landmarks Inventory, and noted for its link to African-American history.

In 1914, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) opened Flipper-Key-Davis College, also called Flipper-Davis, in the former Tullahassee Mission building. It was a period when private, municipal and state junior colleges were being founded. Flipper-Davis College was then the only private, higher-level education institution for African Americans in Oklahoma. This junior college closed in 1935 during the Great Depression.

In June 2021, Tullahassee Mayor Keisha Cullin was one of 11 mayors to form MORE (Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity), a coalition of mayors who promised to create reparation pilot programs in their municipalities. Other members of MORE included the mayors of such large cities as Los Angeles, Denver, Sacramento, and Kansas City, Missouri.

The Tullahassee Manual Labor School, located in Tullahassee, Oklahoma was originally used as a Creek boarding school and became a school for Creek Freedmen to gain education beyond an elementary school level. The institution was one of very few designated for Creek Freedmen and operated as such from 1883 to until it was sold to Waggoner County in 1914.

Tullahassee Manual Labor School opened initially in 1850 as a school for Creek children, the school began operation in 1850 until a fire destroyed the building in 1880. The fire created an opportunity for the Creek children to be transferred to a different school, leaving the dilapidated building along with its 100 acres to be offered to the Creek Freedmen population in the area. Tullahassee Manual Labor School was reopened in 1883 primarily serving Creek Freedmen in Tullahassee. After Oklahoma gained statehood, it was owned by the government until 1914 when it was sold to Waggoner County and became Flipper Key Davis College, an institution primarily serving African Americans. As of today, Flipper Key Davis College is no longer in operation.

<text>Wagoner is a city in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 8,323 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 7,669 recorded in 2000. It is the county seat of Wagoner County. Wagoner became the first city incorporated in Indian Territory on January 4, 1896.

==History==
Wagoner is along the path of the Texas Road cattle trail, and the later Jefferson Highway of the early National Trail System, both roughly along the route of U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma today. The town began as a small community at the intersection of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT) Railway and the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway), when William McAnally, a foreman for the MKT built a small hotel at this isolated location in June 1887. By the next summer others had built two more hotels and two general stores. The town was named for railroad dispatcher Henry &quot;Big Foot&quot; Wagoner, who had reported the need for a railroad switch nearby to accommodate the shipment of logs and hay. The switch had been previously named &quot;Wagoner&#x27;s Switch.&quot; The switch soon relocated to the town and caused the development of a major cattle shipping business.

By 1894, the community had 642 names in a local census. A local newspaper began promoting the town in 1895, encouraging more people to move to there. By 1896, there were approximately 1,500 residents. In the fall of 1895, the community formed a commission that circulated a petition requesting incorporation under the statutes of Arkansas. Incorporation was granted by the U. S. District Court on January 4, 1896, making Wagoner the first city incorporated in Indian Territory.

A privately funded courthouse was built in 1897, which housed a newly created U. S. Western District Court. The Dawes Commission turned Indian Territory land from tribal to individual ownership by members of each tribe. The individuals were allowed to sell their land to non-Indians, causing a real estate boom in farmland around the area. By statehood, the city had 2,950 residents and was named as the county seat of Wagoner County.

In April 1914 Wagoner was the location of a brutal lynching of a 17 year old African American girl.

The boom continued through 1910, when the population reached 4,018. The MKT had located a division headquarters in the city, which then had three railroad trunk lines and twenty passenger trains a day. Industries included three grain elevators, a cotton gin, cotton oil mill, iron foundry, hardwood company, cement plant, and roller mill. However, the boom ended in 1913, when the MKT moved its division headquarters to Muskogee. The oil boom farther west and later, the Great Depression, caused a further decline in the city&#x27;s economy and population.

World War II started a revival of Wagoner&#x27;s fortunes. The city lay between two war-related Federal Government projects: Camp Gruber to the south and the Oklahoma Ordnance Works to the north.

After the war, several small manufacturing industries took root. Completion of the nearby Fort Gibson Lake in 1950 stimulated the economy and turned Wagoner into a sports and retirement center. The McLellan-Kerr navigational channel made the agricultural area accessible by barges, stimulating farm-related businesses. Highway improvements created Wagoner as a suburban area for Tulsa and Muskogee.

<doc id="130646" wikidata="Q2549541" url="?curid=130646" title="Copan, Oklahoma">
<text>Copan is a town in Washington County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 733 at the 2010 census, a decline of 7.9 percent from the figure of 796 recorded in 2000.

==History==
The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway built a station at this site in 1899, which it named Copan, after the city of Copán, Honduras. However, when a post office was established here in 1900, it was designated as Lawton. The settlement was renamed Weldon in 1901, but reverted to Copan in 1904. It was incorporated under that name in Indian Territory in 1906. The Copan school district was founded in 1906, as well. By 1907, the town had 305 residents.

The blossoming oil industry in Washington County spurred the growth of Copan. The Prairie Oil and Gas Company built Oklahoma&#x27;s first trunk pipeline, which ran from Bartlesville, Oklahoma to Humboldt, Kansas in 1904. It also included an oil storage terminal near Copan, with 107 tanks, designed to hold 35,000 barrels of crude oil. The Copan oil field was discovered in 1907, and had nearly 2,200 producing wells by 1915.

The town managed to survive and recover from major fires in 1906, 1911 and 1912. It enjoyed a spurt of growth after the creation of nearby Lake Hulah in 1951, and Lake Copan in 1983. Population reached a high of 960 in 1980, largely because the lakes increased tourism. The town economy is now largely based on travel and recreation.

===Highway===
Prior to the construction of Copan Dam west of town, US-75 and OK-10 came through downtown Copan. US-75 entered Washington County from High Street in nearby Caney Kansas. As the old Highway 75 came south, it entered the town on Caney Street. As it exited south of town, it rejoined the current alignment at Washington County Road N 3975 Rd. OK-10 came out of the town of Wann Oklahoma in northern Nowata County Oklahoma, entered the town at Golden Avenue, then came south on Caney Street (old U-75) for 0.3 miles, then continued west on Weldon Avenue. There were two 90 degree curves on the town&#x27;s west side, the first took the highway south for 0.1 miles, the second took the highway back toward the west and had it concurrency with Washington County W. 850 Rd and intersected Washington County N. 3970 Rd, and crossed the Little Caney River, and rejoined the current alignment of OK-10 west of the now Copan Lake into Osage County Oklahoma.

The current alignment on US-75 comes off of McGee Street in Caney Kansas, continues south along the east side of Copan Lake, then continues east of Copan. The current alignment of OK-10 in Copan that it has its concurrency with US-75 east of town beginning at Golden Avenue, then continues south for 1.1 miles, then turns to the west, and continues over Copan Dam. It continues north, then west into Osage County Oklahoma.

===Rail===
Prior to the merger between the Burlington Northern and the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe in 1995, the line between nearby Caney Kansas into Tulsa Oklahoma was the main north-south rail line through Washington County Oklahoma. The line came out of Caney Kansas on the town&#x27;s west side, then continued south into the town of Copan. It ran roughly parallel with Caney Street, and continued on the west side of downtown Copan, then exited the town to the south. Towns and cities in Washington County Oklahoma that were served by the line were, Owen Township, Copan, Dewey, Bartlesville, Ochelata, Ramona, and Vera. It continued south into Tulsa County Oklahoma through Collinsville, Owasso, into Tulsa. The existing switch is located west of Greenwood Avenue where it merges with the current BNSF Cherokee Subdivision through downtown Tulsa. There were as many as eight trains a day that ran this line. It was fully signaled.

The line was to be abandoned by the newly formed Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe (BNSF). This would have left Washington County Oklahoma including Copan without rail service. This line also served the Montgomery Kansas towns of Caney, Havana, Wayside, Bolton, Independence, and Cherryvale. WATCO purchased the line from BNSF post merger, and BNSF still has trackage rights. The line is now Southern Kansas &amp; Oklahoma Line (SKOL) now headquartered in Cherryvale Kansas. .As a consequence of the merger, BNSF continued to maintain the Afton Subdivision that comes off the Cherokee Subdivision in Afton Oklahoma, and the Fort Scott Subdivision from Springfield Missouri. There is no Class 1 rail service in Washington County Oklahoma and Copan.

<text>Ramona is a town in Washington County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 535 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town began as Bon-Ton, but changed its name to Ramona in 1899 in honor of the Helen Hunt Jackson novel of the same name. 

Ramona was an oil town and was also a stop for the Santa Fe railroad. When the oil dried up, there was no other industry to support Ramona, so the town began to die out. Very little business remains in the town, aside from a garage, a bank, a medical clinic, and a diner, and sundry other small businesses. For 30 years the town was under the jurisdiction of the Washington County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, after the police department disbanded and the Chief of Police was sentenced to prison. Under the leadership of the former mayor, the late Robert Fiddler, the police department was reinstated. And the water lines were repaired/replaced by the late William Fugate. a grant was accepted from the Cherokee Nation to repave the streets. The town also supplies natural gas service to the Wal-Mart distribution center five miles north of town.

Recently, under the mayoralty of Cyle Miller, the Cherokee Nation opened the Cherokee Casino Ramona off U.S. Route 75 and Road 3200, which is a significant boom to the local economy. This led to Ramona annexing a considerable portion of land and greatly increasing the size of Ramona proper.

<text>Angelo Bartlett &quot;Bart&quot; Giamatti ( ; April 4, 1938 – September 1, 1989) was an American professor of English Renaissance literature, the president of Yale University, and the seventh commissioner of Major League Baseball.

Giamatti served as Commissioner for only five months before dying suddenly of a heart attack. He is the shortest-tenured baseball commissioner in the sport&#x27;s history and the only holder of the office not to preside over a full Major League Baseball season. Giamatti&#x27;s most notable act as Commissioner was to negotiate the agreement resolving the Pete Rose betting scandal in which Rose was permitted to voluntarily withdraw from the sport to avoid further punishment.

==Personal life==
Giamatti was born in Boston and grew up in South Hadley, Massachusetts, the son of Mary Claybaugh Walton (Smith College 1935) and Valentine John Giamatti. His father was professor and chairman of the Department of Italian Language and Literature at Mount Holyoke College. Giamatti&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Italian immigrants Angelo Giammattei () and Maria Lavorgna (): his grandfather Angelo emigrated to the United States from Telese, near Benevento, Italy, around 1900. Giamatti&#x27;s maternal grandparents, from Wakefield, Massachusetts, were Helen Buffum (Davidson) and Bartlett Walton, who graduated from Phillips Academy Andover and Harvard College. Giamatti attended South Hadley High School, spent his junior year at the American Overseas School of Rome, and graduated from Phillips Academy in 1956. At Yale College, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) and as a junior in 1960 was tapped by Scroll and Key, a senior secret society. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1960.

In 1960, he married Toni Marilyn Smith, who taught English for more than 20 years at the Hopkins School in New Haven, Connecticut, until her death in 2004. Together the couple had three children: actors Paul and Marcus and jewelry designer Elena.

==Yale==
Giamatti stayed in New Haven to receive his doctorate in 1964, when he also published a volume of essays by Thomas G. Bergin he had co-edited with a philosophy graduate student, T. K. Seung. He became a professor of comparative literature at Yale University, an author, and master of Ezra Stiles College at Yale, a post to which he was appointed by his predecessor as Yale president, Kingman Brewster Jr.

Giamatti taught briefly at Princeton but spent most of his academic life at Yale. His scholarly work focused on English Renaissance literature, particularly Edmund Spenser, and relationships between English and Italian Renaissance poets. His tenure as Stiles master ended in 1972.

Giamatti served as president of Yale University from 1978 to 1986. He was the youngest president of the university in its history and presided over the university during a bitter strike by its clerical and technical workers in 1984–1985. As university president, he refused student, faculty, and community demands to divest from apartheid South Africa. Giamatti prohibited students from playing Bladderball on campus after years of increasingly strange pranks and several student hospitalizations in 1982. He also served on the board of trustees of Mount Holyoke College for many years. Giamatti was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1982.

==Baseball==
Giamatti had a lifelong interest in baseball and was a noted Boston Red Sox fan. In 1978, when he was first rumored to be a candidate for the presidency of Yale, he had deflected questions by observing that &quot;The only thing I ever wanted to be president of was the American League.&quot; He also wrote several noteworthy essays about baseball, including &quot;The Green Fields of the Mind&quot;, published in the &quot;Yale Alumni Magazine&quot; in November 1977; &quot;Tom Seaver&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in September 1977; and &quot;Baseball and the American Character,&quot; published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in October 1986.

Giamatti was named president of the National League in . During his stint in that position, he placed an emphasis on the need to improve the environment for the fan in the ballparks. He also decided to make umpires strictly enforce the balk rule and cited affirmative action as a remedy for the lack of minority managers, coaches, or executives in the major leagues.

While still serving as National League president, Giamatti suspended Pete Rose for 30 games after Rose shoved umpire Dave Pallone on April 30, 1988. Later that year, Giamatti also suspended Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell for three days, after Howell was caught using pine tar during the National League Championship Series.

Giamatti, whose tough dealing with Yale&#x27;s union favorably impressed Major League Baseball owners, was unanimously elected to succeed Peter Ueberroth as commissioner on September 8, . He formally took office on April 1, . Determined to maintain the integrity of the game, on August 24, 1989, Giamatti prevailed upon Pete Rose to agree voluntarily to remain permanently ineligible to play baseball.

==Death==

While at his vacation home in Edgartown on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Giamatti, a heavy smoker for many years, died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 51, eight days after banishing Pete Rose and 154 days into his tenure as commissioner. He was interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut. He became the second baseball commissioner to die in office, the first being Kenesaw Mountain Landis in 1944.

Fay Vincent, Giamatti&#x27;s close friend and baseball&#x27;s first deputy commissioner, became acting commissioner upon Giamatti&#x27;s death, and was quickly elected by MLB owners to succeed Giamatti as the new commissioner. On October 14, 1989, before Game 1 at the World Series, Giamatti—to whom this World Series was dedicated—was memorialized with a moment of silence. Son Marcus Giamatti threw out the first pitch before the game. Also before Game One, the Yale Whiffenpoofs sang the national anthem, a blend of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; with &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; that has been since repeated by other a cappella groups.

==Legacy==
The Little League Eastern Regional Headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut is named after Giamatti. One of the three awards given annually by Major League Baseball&#x27;s Baseball Assistance Program is named the &quot;Bart Giamatti Award&quot;.

Giamatti was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.

James Reston Jr. notes in his book &quot;Collision at Home Plate: The Lives of Pete Rose and Bart Giamatti&quot; that Giamatti suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited neuromuscular disease affecting peripheral nerves.

Neil Thomas Proto argues in his book &quot;Fearless: A. Bartlett Giamatti and the Battle for Fairness&quot; that Giamatti&#x27;s early life with his parents and family in New Haven established the code of conduct about fairness that tempered his decision about Pete Rose. Proto also states that as president of Yale, Giamatti was a consequential force in changing Yale&#x27;s once-harmful relationship with New Haven; in reintroducing Sterling Scholarships for New Haven high school students, which had been discontinued by his predecessors; in challenging the eugenics culture at Yale, which had spread nationally and affected Yale&#x27;s view of urban renewal; and in challenging an admissions system that excluded applicants on the basis of race and religion. According to Proto, Giamatti believed the university&#x27;s duty was to educate students in the civic responsibility of good citizenship, not the elitist imperative of creating &quot;leaders.&quot;

<text>Canute is a town in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 541 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Canute was established in the early 1900s and is located on the now-defunct Rock Island Railroad. Following the advent of the automobile, Canute became a popular stop along U.S. Route 66 and a large number of tourist businesses were established, including gasoline service stations, motels and restaurants. However, when Interstate 40 bypassed the small village to the north in May 1970 and received only one exit from the freeway, the local economy went into a decline due to the bypass and the concurrent closure of nearby Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base at Burns Flat, leading most of those businesses to shut down. Today, Canute businesses include a bank and auto repair shop on Route 66, along with a gas station/convenience store. Former Oklahoma governor David Walters was born in Canute.

<text>Colony is a town in northeastern Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 136 at the 2010 U.S. census, a decrease of 7.5 percent from 147 in 2000. It was named for the Seger Colony, founded in 1886, which taught modern agricultural techniques to the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes that would be resettled in the vicinity. Colony is east and north of Cordell.

==History==
John Seger, a native of Ohio and a Union veteran of the Civil War, was hired in 1872 to work as a mason/carpenter to build housing and other structures for a school for Native American children at the Darlington Agency. Later, he began a colony for Native Americans with Arapaho Indians, who were joined later by several Cheyennes. By the following year, Seger&#x27;s colony had over 500 inhabitants. Seger began teaching modern agricultural methods as well as brick-making. By 1892, the colony had also built an industrial arts school, with the Native Americans providing the bricks and cutting stone for all the buildings.

William De Lestinier opened a store near the school with government permission, even before the Land Run of 1892. After the opening, a group of settlers, led by Zack King, created a townsite west of the school and obtained a post office named Seger. De Lestinier moved his store to the new site. In 1895, the Dutch Reformed Church founded a mission at the colony. In 1896, a new post office named Colony opened, and the town took that name.

The colony continued to grow and had an estimated population of 300 by 1911. The Dutch Reformed mission closed in 1912 and the Seger Indian school closed in 1932.

<text>Corn is a town in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 503 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Corn is located 13 miles northeast of Cordell in west-central Oklahoma.

The U.S. Census Bureau, reports that the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

===Origins of the town name===
The word itself is a German word translated in English as &#x27;grain&#x27;. Several sources confirm that the town settled by German immigrants received its name because its first post office was located in (or near) a corn field. As a result of anti-German sentiment during World War I, the name of the town was permanently changed from &quot;Korn&quot; to &quot;Corn&quot;.

===Founding and early years===
The town of Corn, or Korn—as it was spelled at that time—was originally settled by German-speaking Russian Mennonites. Around the time of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Land Run of 1892, Mennonite missionary John J. Kliewer, who was stationed at nearby Shelly Indian Mission, invited fellow Mennonites from Kansas to homestead lands left unclaimed by Cheyennes and Arapahos. Sixteen Mennonite families staked homestead claims in 1892. By 1893, forty families had settled in the area.

These Mennonite homesteaders brought with them a particular variety of winter wheat known as &quot;Turkey Red&quot;, which grew particularly well in the western Oklahoma soil. In 1894, Peter Bergman donated part of his land to establish a place of worship. A rough Mennonite church was then built; a dugout with a low sloping roof and sides made of sod. Church benches were made from local Cottonwood trees. Between 1893 and 1920, a total of eight Mennonite churches were established within an eight-mile radius of the town. To mark its centennial year, Corn received a historical marker from the state honoring both its agricultural and Mennonite heritage.

On April 27, 1896, the Korn post office was established in a rural home, two and one-fourth miles north of the present-day town. Shortly thereafter, the post office was moved three miles north of the original site to a store owned by James Kendall. When Kendall&#x27;s planned townsite failed to develop at the location, the post office was once again moved in 1903 to the present day site of the town of Corn, finding its new home in the merchandise store of George B. Flaming.

World War I brought down harassment both from vigilantes and the Washita County Council of Defense upon many of the Germans and Mennonites that lived in and around Corn. This was due to the combination of their German heritage and their particular Mennonite/Anabaptist theological convictions, which dictated their conscientious objection to participation in warfare. Not only did the town Americanize its name from &quot;Korn&quot; to &quot;Corn&quot; during this time, but the nearby Cordell Christian College closed and a German-language newspaper, the , ceased operation after threats from the Knights of Liberty.

===Education===
A private Christian academy, under the name , was established by the Mennonite Brethren Church as a Bible and language school in 1902. Now known as Corn Bible Academy, it has continuously educated students into the 21st century and is the oldest Christian school west of the Mississippi. As of 2016, it was serving grades 7–12.

In 1968, the public school of nearby Colony merged with the Corn public schools, forming the Washita Heights School District. On April 23, 2010, a referendum was held asking for voter approval to disband the increasingly small school district of Washita Heights, along with its school in Corn, due to the lack of students within the district and insufficient funding. The dissolution was approved and the nearby Cordell schools annexed the Washita Heights district.

<text>Foss is a town in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 151, an 18.9 percent increase from 127 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The history of Foss began when settlers from the area of the Wilson post office moved four miles north to the valley of Turkey Creek in the late 1890s. They initially wanted their new post office to be called Graham, but since that name was already taken it was named Maharg (an anagram of Graham). A flash flood on May 2, 1902, wiped out the town on Turkey Creek, destroying businesses and drowning several people. The town rebuilt on higher ground and was named Foss. The post office began operation on September 15, 1900.

The town expanded rapidly. By 1905 the town had a population between 900 and 1000 residents. It had two banks, three cotton gins, and by 1912 had an electric plant, two hotels and an opera house. It also had plants to manufacture hay balers, baby carriages, and brooms. The population stabilized near 500. In the 1920s the town began to have economic problems as the nearby cities of Clinton and Elk City absorbed more and more trade. During the Great Depression more people moved away.

During World War II, the town boasted a population of over 300 residents, relying primarily on Route 66 travellers (which passed half a mile south of the city) and a U.S. naval base south of the town that operated during wartime. A filling station and a café also operated in the town around that time.

Though in the 1950s and 1960s there was an economic revival due to the nearby Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base at Burns Flat. When the base closed and Interstate 40 bypassed Foss the town declined further. The last bank left in September 1977.

Foss had two newspapers, the &quot;Foss Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Foss Banner&quot;. It was served by the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (Rock Island) railroad. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; went out of business in the 1930s.

<text>New Cordell is a city in and the county seat of Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. It lies along U.S. Route 183. The population was 2,775 at the time of the 2020 Census. The community was previously established a few miles from the current site, but was moved about 1900. It was named for a U.S. Postal Service employee in Washington D. C., Wayne W. Cordell. The official name is New Cordell, though it is now commonly called Cordell.

==History==
Cordell began when H. D. Young opened a general store about 1.5 miles east of the present town, shortly after the Cheyenne and Arapaho lands were opened for non-Indian settlement in 1892. A post office named Cordell was established in the same year in Young&#x27;s store. In 1897, A. J. Johnson and J. C. Harrell convinced Young to move his store to the present site, where water was more plentiful and of better quality than in Old Cordell. The new location became known as New Cordell. In 1900, Washita County residents voted to move the county seat from the town of Cloud Chief to New Cordell. The move was challenged in the court as illegal, because only the territorial legislature could authorize such an action. In 1904, the Oklahoma Territorial Supreme Court ruled that the county seat must return to Cloud Chief. A Cordell attorney, Sam Massengale, traveled to Washington, where he lobbied for a bill to make Cordell the official county seat. The bill passed the U. S. Congress in 1906.

The county courthouse was destroyed by a fire in 1909. It was rebuilt by 1911 by the same architect who designed the Oklahoma State Capitol. Governor George Nigh called it, &quot;...godfather of all courthouses in the state of Oklahoma.&quot; The Washita County Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1911, the Carnegie Foundation approved a grant to construct what became known as the Cordell Carnegie Community Library.

Summers are hot to sweltering, and typically dry, whilst winters average cool by afternoon and freezing by morning but show extreme variation from very warm due to descending chinook winds to frigid periods dominated by Arctic air masses. The heaviest precipitation occurs in the spring from thunderstorms, although occasionally remnant rain depressions in summer and fall provide very heavy rain.

<text>Rocky is a town in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 162 at the 2010 United States Census, a 6.9 percent decline from the figure of 174 in 2000. The town lies along U.S. Route 183.

==History==
Two men, W. F. Shultz and John C. Riffee, arrived at this location in 1897 to open a trading establishment with the local natives. They erected a building constructed of rock they gathered at the Kiowa Reservation, about southwest of their site. They opened for business in 1898 as the Rocky Mercantile Store. The community was named for the store. A post office was established inside the store on July 12, 1898, with John Riffee named as the first postmaster. According to the local newspaper, Rocky handled more than one-third of all mail delivered in Washita County in 1906.

The Orange Blossom School System was organized about south of Rocky in 1902. The town built a new school in 1907. The Works Progress Administration built another school building in the late 1930s. However, the 1930 census marked the highest point of Rocky&#x27;s growth, so no more schools were ever built. Instead, Rocky voters closed the district and merged it into the Sentinel district in 1967. The WPA-built school became a community center.

The Blackwell, Enid and Southwestern Railroad (BES) built a line through Rocky in 1902. The area around the community already had established as a producer of wheat, hay, and cotton. These were mostly shipped to market by rail. BES later was merged into the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, (commonly known as the Frisco). By 1906, Rocky&#x27;s economic base had added three grain elevators, three cotton gins, and considerable hay and livestock.

<text>Sentinel is a town in Washita County, in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The population was 901 in the 2010 census, an increase of 4.9 percent from the figure of 859 residents in 2000. Towns near Sentinel are Rocky, Cordell, Canute, and Burnsflat.

==History==
Located in southwestern Washita County, Sentinel lies at the intersection of State Highways 44 and 55. The town is primarily an agriculture-based community. The 1892 Cheyenne and Arapaho Opening brought non-Indians into the region. In 1898, R. B. Gore, a pioneer of Old Greer County, established a small general merchandise store in the area and applied for a post office. On March 6, 1899, the Post Office Department approved the application and designated the locale as Sentinel, Oklahoma Territory. The name originated from Cloud Chief&#x27;s &quot;Herald-Sentinel&quot; newspaper. This store was approximately one mile east of the present town.

In 1901, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, later bought by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway, began purchasing rights-of-way and designating new townsites for a proposed railroad. The newly formed Orient Townsite Company chose the site of present Sentinel and received a donation of eighty acres from L. N. Whitmer. They named the new town &quot;Barton&quot; and filed a plat on September 23, 1901. The new residents asked Gore to relocate his store and post office to the new location. This caused confusion, as the town and post office had different names. In 1904, Will Hornbeck established the Sentinel News-Boy. Determined to correct the name problem, he started a petition to incorporate the town as Sentinel. In 1906, the voters approved this measure in an election. In August 1907, the town officially became Sentinel. At the 1907 statehood, it had 351 residents.

By 1908, the Orient had built their tracks through the village. In 1910 the population stood at 857, climbing to 1,269 by 1930. In 1911 residents supported two banks, a newspaper, electricity and telephone service, four grocers, two hotels, four general stores, among many other businesses and professionals. In 1935, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was located just west of Sentinel. The population held above one thousand until 1970 when it registered 984. In 1967, the Rocky school consolidated into Sentinel School District. In 1961, the chamber of commerce began hosting an annual, large July Fourth celebration. In 2000, the population stood at 859.

<doc id="130666" wikidata="Q2729552" url="?curid=130666" title="Capron, Oklahoma">
<text>Capron is a town in Woods County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 27 at the time of the 2020 Census, an increase from the 23 reported at the 2010 census.

==History==
Prior to the opening of the Cherokee Strip in 1893, Capron, Oklahoma was first known as &quot;Warren&quot;, a small cattle station on the main line of the Santa Fe railroad. It consisted of a store, and an old railroad car left by the Santa Fe. Sometime after the opening of the strip residents wanted to come up with a new name for the growing town. The name was changed to &quot;Sterling&quot;, but the postal service and Santa Fe would not accept it because there was a town by that name on their line in Kansas. The names of &quot;Virgil&quot; and &quot;Kermit&quot; were proposed, but Santa Fe would not accept these names, for the same reason. Therefore, a committee consisting of Mr. George Espy, postmaster, Dr. G.W. Todd, and Congressman Dennis Flynn was appointed to select a name which the Santa Fe and Postal Service would accept. The name of Captain Allyn K. Capron, Jr. was proposed. Captain Capron was a member of Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, and had been killed at the Battle of San Juan Hill. The name of &quot;Capron&quot; was approved by a petition of the residents. The Santa Fe and U. S. Postal service accepted the name and so it stands today.

At one time Capron was quite a thriving community. It had two banks; the Bank of Capron, and the Capron State Bank; three general stores; two drug stores; a hotel; depot; a millinery shop; theater; blacksmith; a weekly newspaper, The Capron Hustler; a monthly newspaper, The Screech Owl; two barber shops; hardware store; lumber yard; two churches, Warburton Memorial Methodist Church, and First Congregational Church; the Driftwood Telephone Company and Hampton&#x27;s Foot Powder Factory.

A tornado struck Capron in the early morning of April 15, 1939, destroying the town&#x27;s new public school building and its entire business section. The tornado hit as a train was on its regular path through Capron, derailing several cars. At least 15 people were injured by the storm. The majority of the town&#x27;s businesses were never rebuilt; however, the school was later reconstructed.

Capron was always concerned with having a good school system. In 1894 a small but enterprising group of Driftwood Township citizens provided for the establishment of the first Capron Public Schools. The school consisted of grades 1–8 and consisted of a two-room frame building located south and east of the present south Coop Grain Elevator. This building proved adequate until 1909 when a new two-story brick building was built in the north end of town at the site of the present school building. The cost of the 1909 building was $8,500.00. In 1929 residents approved the building of a new one-story building with a large gymnasium and auditorium attached. The old two-story building was torn down to make way for this modern facility. This building was destroyed in the 1939 tornado and a new building, auditorium and gymnasium were built in 1940. At the time, this facility was considered to be one of the best schools in northwest Oklahoma. Additions to the present building were made: in 1952, vocational agriculture building; 1956, additional classrooms and music room; and 1964, when a new cafeteria was added to the school. The high school was first accredited in 1912. In 1968 the high school was closed due to falling enrollment. There were no families in the school district on public assistance in 1968, and the patrons of the district never voted down a tax increase for their school; they wanted the very best for their children. The Elementary School, grades K–8 were closed in 1976 by a vote of the patrons which carried by only one vote. The vote was contested. This decision was taken to court and eventually upheld by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Today Capron has two large concrete grain elevators, a rural water district office, United Methodist Church, garage, filling station, and American Legion Post. The Post Office closed in 1994 after 100 years of service to the citizens of the area.

<text>Freedom is a town in Woods County, Oklahoma, United States. It lies twenty-five miles west of Alva, on the banks of the Cimarron River. The population was 174 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==
On September 13 and 14, 1878, the Battle of Turkey Springs was fought approximately ten miles northeast of present-day Freedom. It was the last known encounter between the United States Cavalry and American Indians in Oklahoma.

In the late 1800s, following the Cherokee Strip Land Run, farmers and ranchers began a small settlement in the area. This 1893 land run, combined with the building of the Buffalo and Northwestern Railroad in 1919–20, incentivized many settlers to homestead 160-acre tracts in the area.

In 1954, Nixon, James Powers&#x27; brother-in-law and long-time bank employee, became president and chief executive officer. As majority stockholder, Jim Powers continued to serve as chairman of the bank’s board of directors until his death in 1988. The bank was closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on June 27, 2014 after regulators found that Freedom State Bank was “critically under capitalized” and had determined that its capital position was “rapidly deteriorating.” Freedom State Bank reopened as a branch of Alva State Bank &amp; Trust following the closure.,

<text>Waynoka is a city in Woods County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located on U.S. Highway 281 and State Highway 14, seventy miles west of Enid. The population, which peaked at 2,018 in 1950, was 708 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==

===Founding years===
Founded in what was then known as Indian Territory, Waynoka was established in 1887 when the Southern Kansas Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, built a rail line through the area. Shortly thereafter, on April 10, 1888, a post office was established, having the distinction of being the first to be established in the Cherokee Outlet. Its economy was based on the railroad and the large ranches in the area. When the Cherokee Outlet opened up for non-Indian settlement in the land run of September 16, 1893, Waynoka became the area&#x27;s agricultural trade center.

===Transportation Center===
The Santa Fe Railway made the city a major railroad center when it built Oklahoma&#x27;s largest rail yard in Waynoka. Ultimately employing a thousand machinists, boilermakers, sheet metal mechanics, fire builders, car men, switchmen, and engineers, it operated twenty-four hours a day. One of the nation&#x27;s largest ice plants was built to supply ice for refrigerator cars hauling perishables on Santa Fe&#x27;s main line from Chicago to Los Angeles. In addition, a roundhouse, maintenance and repair shops, a reading room, a depot, and a Harvey House were built by the railroad. Although the railroad eventually moved its maintenance operations from Waynoka, it continued train crew changes there until 1986. At the turn of the twenty-first century, between fifty and one hundred trains still passed daily through Waynoka on Oklahoma&#x27;s fastest and busiest rail line.

Waynoka was also the starting point of the Buffalo and Northwestern Railroad, a 52-mile line linking to Buffalo, Oklahoma, the Harper County seat. The line was finished in 1920, and acquired by the Santa Fe the same year. However, the Santa Fe abandoned the line in 1982.

The predecessor company of TWA, Transcontinental Air Transport, known as &quot;TAT&quot;, built Oklahoma&#x27;s first transcontinental airport in 1929 in Waynoka, at a site five miles northeast of town selected by Charles Lindbergh himself. TAT offered passengers coast-to-coast travel in forty-eight hours, and Waynoka was an important stop on the pioneering route. For the service, TAT utilized not only its own Ford Trimotor aircraft, but also Pullman sleeper cars of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Santa Fe Railroad for the two overnight segments of the long trip. It was at Waynoka that passengers would transfer from the TAT airplane to the Santa Fe train (going westbound), or conversely, from the Santa Fe train to the TAT plane (heading eastbound). Both Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, as officers in the company, reportedly became familiar faces in town. After losing $2.7 million in its first eighteen months of operation, TAT in October 1930 merged with Western Air Express to become Transcontinental and Western Airlines, which announced a new route from Kansas City, Kansas, by way of Tulsa, Oklahoma. This ended operations at Waynoka.

Waynoka is linked by US Route 281.

The current Waynoka Municipal Airport (FAA Identifier: 1K5) is one mile southeast of town, and features a paved 3532’ x 60’ runway.

<text>Fort Supply is a town in Woodward County, Oklahoma, United States, northwest of the city of Woodward, the county seat. The population was 330 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The United States Army post of Fort Supply was established in 1868 as a &quot;Camp of Supply&quot; for the winter campaign that General Philip Sheridan led against the Southern Plains Indians.

People established the town of Fitzgerald three miles west-southwest of the site of the former Fort Supply in 1902, but this town quickly failed.

Rancher H. H. Halsell sold the land one mile west of Fort Supply to territorial legislator James P. Gandy. Gandy hired surveyors to plat the land for a town site and founded the town of Supply in 1903. He moved most of the original buildings of Supply from the recently failed town of Fitzgerald. The Government established the first post office for the town of Supply on May 12, 1903. In the early years, area farmers and ranchers centered their economic trade around the town.

In 1908, the State of Oklahoma transformed Fort Supply, the derelict army post, into Western Oklahoma State Hospital, also known as Western State Hospital or Fort Supply State Hospital, the first state-operated mental institution of Oklahoma.

The Flood Control Act of 1936 provided for construction of a dam and reservoir one mile southeast of the town in the valley of Wolf Creek. Work began on the largest earthen dam in the United States of America in October 1938 and Fort Supply Lake was completed in May 1942. The United States Army Corps of Engineers administers Fort Supply Lake and the adjacent wildlife and recreation area.

On May 1, 1943, the people changed the name of the post office and town of Supply to Fort Supply.

On December 6, 1988, the State of Oklahoma located a new prison, William S. Key Correctional Center, on the grounds of nearby former Fort Supply. Western State Psychiatric Center also has operations on the grounds. Agriculture and employment at these state institutions form the economic base of the community of Fort Supply.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Fort Supply Reservoir is directly south; the Hal &amp; Fern Cooper Wildlife Management Area, covering 16,080 acres and administered by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, is to the east.

<text>Mooreland is a town in Woodward County, Oklahoma, United States, east of the city of Woodward, the county seat. The population was 1,190 at the 2010 census. Mooreland lies in a valley approximately north of the North Canadian River. This area of shallow-water land lies at an altitude of .

==History==
The Southern Kansas Railway, later the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, constructed a line in 1886/1887 and then furnished an accessible shipping point for the region. After the opening of Cherokee Outlet in 1893, homesteaders made efforts that resulted in the town of Mooreland.

Prosperous area resident J. H. Dail joined F. J. Knittel, John J. Bouquot, John E. Moseley, and William M. Holmes in founding the Mooreland Town Company. They and others realized the agricultural potential of the area and the possibility of immense crop production.

Mooreland Town Company founded the town of &quot;&#x27;Dail City&quot;, named for its chief proprietor, in 1901. The company purchased land from the Knittel homestead and the W. F. Jones homestead for the platting of the original town site. Others helpful in development of Mooreland included John T. Davis, C. L. Lambert, J. C. Krouth, and John Arnold. Residents quickly petitioned the federal government for a post office. Because of already another &quot;Dail&quot; in Oklahoma Territory, the government denied the request. Residents then selected the name &quot;Moreland.&quot; An error occurred when an extra &quot;o&quot; inadvertently crept into the name on the official plat and registration.

In March 1902, the government established the first Mooreland post office with F. M. Jones as first appointed postmaster. &quot;Mooreland Leader&quot; newspaper began publishing in 1903 and continues today.

The economy always depended on farming, primarily wheat and grain. An agricultural service center within a few years of its founding, the community supported four stores, two liveries, three grain elevators, a feed mill, saloons, restaurants, hotels, and medical personnel.

A minor oil boom occurred around the time of World War I. Mooreland began smaller than Woodward, Curtis, and Quinlan, Oklahoma. Curtis and Quinlan withered, but Mooreland and Woodward continued to prosper.

Mooreland celebrated its centennial in 2001 with the publication of a history book. The community includes a school district, six churches, a newspaper, an airport, farmers cooperative and elevators, and several dozen retail and service businesses necessary for survival of the town. Primary employers include Mooreland Public Schools, Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, and Prather Cues (a pool cue stick company).

<text>Woodward is a city in and the county seat of Woodward County, Oklahoma, United States. It is the largest city in a nine-county area. The population was 12,133 at the time of the 2020 census. 

The area was historically occupied by the Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. European-American settlers established the town in 1887 after construction of the railroad to that point for shipping cattle to markets. The town was on the Great Western Cattle Trail. In the 19th century, it was one of the most important depots in the Oklahoma Territory for shipping cattle to the East. As an important cattle town, it had the rough frontier bawdiness of the time. The United States opened up much of the area to European-American settlement by the Land Run of 1893, and migrants rushed into the area.

Boiling Springs State Park, named for its artesian springs that seem to boil, has been established east of the city.

==History==
===Native American settlement===

For thousands of years, succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples inhabited the areas along the North Canadian River. The Plains tribes adopted use of the horse from the Spanish settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries, which greatly increased their range of nomadic hunting. Before the American Civil War, the historic Plains tribes of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho occupied this area.

Boiling Springs, near present-day Woodward, was a favorite campsite of the Plains Indians. A battle between the Kiowa and Cheyenne tribes took place nearby in 1838. The Kiowa and Comanche tribes also battled the United States Army in 1868 in this area, when the US redeployed troops after the Civil War against Native Americans in the West.

In the late 19th century, these tribes fought numerous battles against the United States soldiers and settlers through a wide area around the springs. After the war, United States Army made various expeditions against the Plains tribes in the Cherokee Outlet. Lieutenant Colonels Alfred Sully and George Armstrong Custer, and General Philip Sheridan, stationed nearby at Fort Supply, led these expeditions. In the 1880s, the Comanche considered this area as part of their &quot;Comancheria&quot;, the unofficial name of their territory, which stretched from Kansas to Mexico.

===Settlement as a town===
In April 1887, the Southern Kansas Railway, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, built tracks from Kiowa, Kansas to Fort Reno Military Road near the south bank of the North Canadian River. European-American settlers established Woodward at this junction. The source of the name of the town a mystery. People perhaps named the town for Brinton W. Woodward, usually identified as a Santa Fe Railway director, or bison hunter, teamster, and eventually local saddle-maker Richard &quot;Uncle Dick&quot; Woodward.

The town quickly developed as an important shipping point, both for provisioning Fort Supply and as a place for loading cattle grazed in the Cherokee Outlet for shipment to eastern markets. Woodward ranked among the most important depots in the Oklahoma Territory for shipping cattle to the Eastern and Northern states. The Great Western Cattle Trail met the railroad where Woodward developed. In the summer of 1893, carpenters erected the first government building at the railroad depot, called Woodward. Woodward then had 200 residents.

On September 16, 1893, officials opened the Cherokee Outlet across northern Oklahoma, which more than 50,000 migrants settled in the greatest land run in American history. A surveying error then caused location of the government town, its land office, and other public buildings in the section west of the existing improvements, 15 blocks away from the depot, post office, and stockyards. Since territorial days, Woodward served as the county seat of Woodward County.

Two towns developed: East Woodward, called Denver, began near the improvements, and Woodward began near the land office. In October 1894, people moved the depot west and relocated it between 5th Street and 6th Street; East Woodward businesses followed the depot. Government in time moved the land office, jail, and other buildings east toward the depot. The towns merged into one. The joining resulted in the curve in the long Main Street of the town at 8th Street, originally Boundary Street.

On March 13, 1894, outlaws Bill Doolin and Bill Dalton robbed the railroad station at Woodward, taking an undisclosed amount of money.

Like Dodge City, Kansas, to the North, Woodward boasted a cattle town array of saloons, gambling halls, and brothels. Drovers widely knew the Equity, Midway, Shamrock, and Cabinet saloons of Woodward and the Dew Drop Inn as their watering holes at the end of a cattle drive. Dollie Kezer worked at some of most famous brothels of Denver, Colorado, and Horace Tabor threw lavish parties that she attended before coming to Woodward, where she owned and managed the Dew Drop Inn, which served as another watering hole and also as a brothel.

In 1894, Temple Lea Houston, former Texas state senator and son of Samuel Houston, moved his law practice and family to Woodward. After a personal disagreement in the Cabinet Saloon with the brother and father of the outlaw Al Jennings, Houston shot and killed the brother. Jack E. Love joined his close friend, Temple Lea Houston, in the gunfight. The events slowed the career of neither man. Authorities in Woodward charged and tried Houston for murder, but a jury acquitted him on grounds of self-defense. Houston won a reputation as a brilliant trial lawyer, known for his courtroom dramatics. He delivered his &quot;&quot; in a makeshift courtroom in the Woodward opera house, arguing on behalf of a prostitute who worked at the Dew Drop Inn; after ten minutes&#x27; consideration, the jury acquitted her. Houston died in 1905 in Woodward and is buried there.

People later elected Jack E. Love to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, and he served as its first chairman.

Woodward ranked as one of the most extensive cattle shipping points in Oklahoma Territory. Some men rode for the large cattle outfits of the 1890s and later developed rodeo as a sport. Cow ponies, tied to hitching posts, lined the sandy Main Street.

When open range ended in 1901, however, homesteaders rushed into Woodward County. By late 1902 farmers&#x27; wagons filled with corn, cotton, or sorghum crops for market had already replaced the cow ponies.

On September 7, 1907, William Jennings Bryan spoke to 20,000 people gathered in Woodward, urging the ratification of proposed state constitution of Oklahoma and the election of a Democratic Party ticket. Two months later, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the act of Congress proclaiming admission of Oklahoma as a state, using a quill from an American golden eagle captured near Woodward. At that time the population of Woodward exceeded 2,000.

===County seat and cattle town===

An Act of Congress in 1911 designated Woodward a court town for the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.

The Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway constructed a rail line through Woodward County and Woodward in 1911/1912; the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad later acquired this line.

People introduced successfully Hereford cattle in Woodward County. With this development, cattlemen, such as William Thomas Waggoner, attempted to lease school lands in Woodward County for grazing. These attempts led Woodward County ranchers to form the Oklahoma Livestock Association. At the urging of United States Senator Thomas Pryor Gore and David P. Marum, the former law partner of Temple Lea Houston, in 1912 the United States government located an agricultural research station in Woodward. With the dairy cows replacing beef cattle and progress measured in the number of plow-broken acres, the United States Department of Agriculture established the Great Plains Field Station, immediately southwest of town, in 1913. Wagons of farmers with other crops gave way to wheat as the cash crop before 1914.
People constructed Woodward Federal Courthouse and Post Office in Woodward in 1918, and it opened in 1921. Federal court held dockets annually each November in Woodward.

The &quot;Woodward News&quot; began as the local newspaper in 1926.

Some of the men who rode for the large cattle outfits three decades earlier organized the Elks Rodeo, which began in 1929 at an arena north of town. The ranching and cattle industries still dominated economy of Woodward.

During the Great Depression, local Works Progress Administration projects included the damming of an artesian well, a failed oil-well venture, to form Crystal Beach Lake and its adjacent park. This facility served as a playground for trade area of Woodward and home for the Elks Rodeo.

Town leaders certainly prevented fencing of the market drives away from the stockyards in the early years. On 23 February 1933, the Woodward Livestock Auction, the first commercial-grade cattle auction in Oklahoma, opened, keeping the cattle-marketing tradition.

On 13 September 1934, Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh made an unexpected emergency landing northeast of Woodward. They spent two days at a rural farm, waiting for a relief plane to arrive at Woodward. Charles Lindbergh refused to give any interviews but said that he and his wife, eager for privacy, no longer wanted the public spotlight.

===Economic boom===

From 1934, &quot;Trego’s Westwear&quot; manufactured western cut clothing for customers all over the world. The company frequently made costumes for rodeo stars, movie stars, Dale Evans, and Roy Rogers.

In late November 1956, people first discovered natural gas in Woodward County at McCormick Number One well; a two-decade boom of oil and gas production ensued. Main Street and Oklahoma Avenue stretched westward into the &quot;Oil Patch.&quot;

On January 14, 1957, United States Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson accompanied President Dwight David Eisenhower in a inspection tour of drought-damaged lands around Woodward. A crowd of 12,000 received him at Woodward Municipal Airport.

One of the largest deposits of iodine in the world underlies many portions of Woodward County. Since 1977, numerous companies explored and produced this crude iodine. These companies include Woodward Iodine and Deepwater Chemicals, located in Woodward.

As beef cattle again dominated the land and with the new goal of reestablishing grassy pastures, in 1978, United States Department of Agriculture renamed its facility the Southern Plains Range Research Station.

The population exceeded 10,000 in the 1970s. Good times brought a new high school, a vocational-technical school, a new post office, a new hospital, and an industrial park.

The economic decline in the oil industry during the 1980s caused the first population decrease in the history of the city.

National Register of Historic Places listings in Woodward County, Oklahoma, in 1988 added Woodward Crystal Beach Park.

In March 2023, the National Collegiate Soil Judging Contest took place in Woodward. The event was organized by the Oklahoma State University Ferguson College of Agriculture and USDA-NRCS Woodward Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) Soil Survey Office and brought 240 students from 24 universities to Woodward. Participating students completed technical descriptions, classifications, and interpretations of soil profiles in the competition, which was won by the University of Maryland.

===Tornadoes===
====1947====

On April 9, 1947, the deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history (an F5 on the Fujita Scale) tore through Woodward, killing 181 people, injuring almost 1000, and destroying 100 city blocks. The family of tornadoes, known as the 1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes, ranked as the sixth deadliest in US history. They caused many fatalities and much damage in other communities in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

====2012====

On April 14, 2012, an EF3 tornado struck Woodward causing six deaths.

The West Woodward Airport (KWWR; FAA ID: WWR), located approximately 2.5 miles west of Woodward, features a paved 5502’ x 100’ runway. The airport had commercial air service through Central Airlines in the 1950s.

The Southern Transcon, being the main line of Class I freight rail carrier BNSF Railway, passes through Woodward. Shortline carrier Northwestern Oklahoma Railroad also serves the Woodward area and interchanges with the BNSF.

== Economy ==
The city maintains a city manager commission type of government. Woodward is the principal center of trade for Northwest Oklahoma and a ten-county region including counties in Kansas and Texas. It serves a trade area of greater than 50,000 people. Agriculture, petroleum, wind energy, and manufacturing all contribute to Woodward&#x27;s economy.

Woodward serves as a market and processing center for wheat, cattle, hay and poultry. The city has grown around the Southern Plains Range Research Station, a United States agricultural experiment station established in 1912.

Woodward also lies in an oil and natural-gas area on the shelf of Oklahoma&#x27;s Anadarko Basin. In 1956, natural gas was discovered in Woodward County. Thereafter, Woodward enjoyed significant growth due to the opening and location of oil field service and drilling companies in Woodward.

In addition to hydrocarbons, many portions of Woodward County are underlain by one of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of iodine. Since 1977, numerous companies have explored for and produced crude iodine in Woodward County. Woodward Iodine and Deepwater Chemicals are located in Woodward. In 2003, Florida Power &amp; Light Company&#x27;s subsidiary, FPL Energy, and the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority, began commercial production of electricity generated from wind turbines constructed north of Woodward.

Manufacturers include oil field equipment, apparel, crude iodine, and printing and publishing. Clothing factories are a relatively recent addition.

CF Industries operates an ammonia facility that also produces associated nitrogen products. The plant was built by Fluor for WR Grace and Co, which operated it from 1975 to 1988 as Oklahoma Nitrogen Co. Terra Industries bought the plant from Grace in 1988. In 2010, CF Industries took over Terra, and currently operates the plant.

==Agriculture==
By the early 20th century, Hereford cattle were introduced successfully in Woodward County. With this development, cattlemen such as Dan Waggoner and his son, W.T. Waggoner, attempted to lease school lands in Woodward County for grazing. These attempts led to the formation of the Oklahoma Livestock Association by Woodward County ranchers. At the urging of Senator Thomas P. Gore and David P. Marum, the former law partner of Temple Lea Houston, in 1912 the United States government located an agricultural research station in Woodward. By 1930, the ranching and cattle industry dominated Woodward&#x27;s economy. On February 23, 1933, Oklahoma&#x27;s first commercial-grade cattle auction, the Woodward Livestock Auction, opened in Woodward.

In 1929, Woodward ranchers and businessmen organized the Woodward Elks Rodeo, which through 1959 was one of the premier cowboy rodeos in the nation. As many as 35,000 people would attend the three-day event. National rodeo champions such as Bob Crosby, Paul Carney, Toots Mansfield, Homer Pettigrew, Ace Soward, Eddie Curtis, Jess Goodspeed, Ike Rude, Jim Shoulders, Sonny Davis, Sonny Linger, and Tater Decker all competed at the Woodward Elks Rodeo.

==Businesses==
Between 1934 and 1999, the Trego&#x27;s Westwear Company of Woodward manufactured Western cut clothing for customers all over the world. Rodeo and movie stars were customers of the company and costumes were frequently made for Dale Evans and Roy Rogers. As dress became more casual in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in Western wear waned. Trego&#x27;s closed its manufacturing plant in 1995.

On May 18, 1956, Charles Woodward Pappe, an entrepreneur from Kingfisher, opened the second Top-Hat Drive-In Restaurant in the United States, which was the precursor to the Sonic Drive-In. A few months earlier, Pappe had met Troy Smith, while visiting friends in Shawnee, Oklahoma. With Pappe&#x27;s inspiration, Sonic was founded and eventually became one of the largest chain of fast food restaurants in the US.

<text>Baker City is a city in and the county seat of Baker County, Oregon, United States. It was named after Edward Dickinson Baker, the only U.S. Senator ever killed in military combat. The population was 10,099 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Platted in 1865, Baker City grew slowly in the beginning. A post office was established on March 27, 1866, but Baker City was not incorporated until 1874. Even so, it supplanted Auburn as the county seat in 1868. The city and county were named in honor of U.S. Senator Edward D. Baker, the only sitting senator to be killed in a military engagement. He died in 1861 while leading a failed charge of 1,700 Union Army soldiers up a ridge at Ball&#x27;s Bluff, Virginia, during the American Civil War.

The Oregon Short Line Railroad came to Baker City in 1884, prompting growth; by 1900 it was the largest city between Salt Lake City and Portland and a trading center for a broad region. In 1910, Baker City residents voted to shorten the name of the city to simply Baker, the name change becoming official in 1911; Another vote in 1989 restored the name to Baker City.

The establishment of the Oregon Lumber Company by Charles W. Nibley, the creation of a lumber mill by David Eccles on the North Powder River, and the purchase of sugar beet farms led to the migration of Latter-day Saint families to the Baker area. The first branch in Oregon was created in Baker City on July 23, 1893.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Baker was established on June 19, 1903, after which the Saint Francis de Sales Cathedral was built in Baker City. In 1918, Baker was the subject of national interest when the 1918 solar eclipse took place and the U.S. Naval Observatory based its observations there. The path of totality of the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, included Baker City as well.

One of its former councilors, Adam Nilsson, who also served for the Baker City Public Arts Commission, was charged with criminal mischief for graffiti on August 1, 2017, while holding office. A police officer made connections through the tag &quot;Provolotus&quot; which has been found in graffiti complaints as well as on Nilsson&#x27;s Instagram profile. The graffiti was on a Baker County owned property when Nilsson and his friend Ashley E. Schroder were cited. Nilsson, who has pled guilty to spray painting graffiti at the Lime plant contends his constitutional rights were violated and has filed a $1.3 million lawsuit against Baker County and the county sheriff in August 2019. In this lawsuit, Nilsson wrote that he was negotiating with the artist, whose moniker is &quot;Thrashbird&quot; to obtain art as &quot;public art&quot; for Baker City. By September 27, 2023, all claims by Nilsson were dismissed.

In Spring 2023, the city council voted to remove mayor Beverly Calder as a result of an op-ed piece she had written in the &quot;Baker City Herald&quot;. She retained her seat on the city council but mayoralship was given to Matt Diaz. Diaz resigned in July, following a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ meme claiming he was moving out of town with the city council reinstating Calder as the city&#x27;s mayor.

Beginning in August additional city councilors began resigning their posts, culminating in the entire city council, including Calder, resigning leaving all positions vacant. Before resigning, the three remaining city councilors in September made an attempt to appoint new people to fill the vacancies but they were not able to satisfy quorum requirements, after which they resigned in an attempt to force a special election but Oregon state law requires the vacancies to be filled by the county commissioners.

<doc id="130677" wikidata="Q720975" url="?curid=130677" title="Halfway, Oregon">
<text>Halfway is a city in Baker County, Oregon, United States. The city took its name from the location of its post office, on the Alexander Stalker ranch, halfway between Pine and Jim Town. The population was 351 at the 2020 census.

During the dot-com bubble, Halfway agreed to rename itself Half.com for a year as a publicity stunt for the e-commerce company of the same name.

==History==
The community was named for the fact it is roughly halfway between Pine and Cornucopia. While a post office was established in 1887, the town was platted in another location in 1907, the post office moved there in 1908, and it incorporated in 1909.

===Half.com name change===
Halfway earned a place in the history of the dot-com era in December 1999, when it received and accepted an offer to rename itself as Half.com, after the e-commerce start-up, for one year in exchange for , 20 computers for the school, and other financial subsidies. It became the first city in the world to rename itself as a dot com. Among the less obvious reasons the town was chosen were its small population size (and thus its likelihood to accept such an offer) and the city&#x27;s location, which fit perfectly into Half.com&#x27;s marketing scheme. &quot;They&#x27;re within four miles of the 45th parallel which makes it halfway between the equator and the North Pole&quot;. The proclamation did not legally change its name. The city created and posted two signs at its borders that greeted visitors with &quot;America&#x27;s First Dot-com City&quot;. The city auctioned one of these off in September 2007 for ; the winner was Half.com&#x27;s founder Josh Kopelman.

==Geography==
Halfway is located east of Baker City, along Oregon Route 86, halfway between Pine and Cornucopia, which gave the town its name. The city&#x27;s geographic coordinates of 44°52′42″N 117°6′38″W (making it close to the midpoint between the equator and the North Pole) were part of the reason for Half.com to choose the town for its advertising gimmick.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

<doc id="130678" wikidata="Q2862486" url="?curid=130678" title="Huntington, Oregon">
<text>Huntington is a city in Baker County, on the eastern border of Oregon, United States. It is located on the Snake River and along Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 30. The population was 440 at the 2010 census, down from 515 in 2000.

==History==
Henry Miller settled in the area in August 1862. In 1870, Miller&#x27;s Stagecoach Station was established before the coming of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company rail line in 1884, and was platted in 1885 or 1886. It soon became the primary shipping point for the cattle country to the south. Miller built the Stage Tavern, known for many years as &quot;Miller Station&quot;. It was on the overland route that had been established in the valley, and had become well known to all who traveled in pioneer days. According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, Huntington was named for J.B. and J.M. Huntington, brothers who purchased Miller&#x27;s holdings in 1882.

The Huntingtons maintained a small trading post on their land. In 1884, the rails of the Oregon Short Line and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company line were joined in Huntington. Since that time, Huntington has been an important railway division point. With the advent of the railroad came J.T. Fifer, who had been selling general merchandise to the construction crews moving his goods from town to town as the work progressed. Shortly after Fifer arrived, the Huntingtons closed up, leaving him alone in the general merchandise business. The Oregon Construction Company followed soon, with a stock of general merchandise, a blacksmith shop, the Pacific Hotel, several boarding houses and restaurants and a number of saloons.

In 1898, the Northwest Railroad Company began extending a short line down the Snake River. It reached Homestead about 1910. This increased transportation at Huntington and gave an outlet for Eagle and Pine Valley fruits, cattle, lumber and ore. This line was flooded by water from Brownlee Dam.

Huntington became the only incorporated city in Baker County on the Oregon Trail in 1891 with Home Rule Law.

Remnants of the Old Oregon Trail can still be seen today when one is traveling north from Farewell Bend State Recreation Area toward the town of Huntington on U.S. Route 30.

Evidence of the hardships and tragedies of the pioneer movement still exists: a small iron cross, visible from Route 30, marks the location where Snake River Shoshone Indians killed a number of emigrants in 1860.

At the end of the 19th century, Huntington developed a reputation as &quot;Sin City&quot;, a rugged frontier town having its share of saloons, Chinese opium dens, and gunslingers.

Governor Oswald West was motivated to clean up the city, along with the community of Copperfield, in 1912–14.

The first ransom bill from the 1935 George Weyerhaeuser kidnapping turned up in Huntington.

Huntington&#x27;s two marijuana dispensaries, which opened in 2016, had almost $15 million in sales in 2017, and were on pace to top $25 million in 2018, mostly serving Idahoans.

<doc id="130680" wikidata="Q2227395" url="?curid=130680" title="Sumpter, Oregon">
<text>Sumpter is a city in Baker County, Oregon, United States. The population was 204 at the 2010 census. Sumpter is named after Fort Sumter by its founders. The name was inspired by a rock as smooth and round as a cannonball, which reminded a local resident of the American Civil War and Fort Sumter.

==Names==
Baker County was named for Edward Dickinson Baker, a U.S. Senator from Oregon who was killed in the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff during the American Civil War. Sumpter, first settled by Euro-Americans during this war, was named after Fort Sumter in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The fort was often mentioned in war dispatches read by the settlers. An account in the Baker &quot;Democrat–Herald&quot; many decades later reported that a round rock found in the area in the early 1860s had looked to residents like a cannonball and, reinforced by the war news, had reminded them of Fort Sumter.

In 1883, Joseph D. Young became the first postmaster of Sumpter, and, according to his grandson, was not allowed by the U.S. Post Office to use the old name, &quot;Sumter&quot;. Since freight to the region then depended on pack mules, Young chose the form &quot;Sumpter&quot;, which was close to the original spelling and evoked the term sumpter mule.

== History ==
The community was platted in 1889, and became a mining boom town about 10 years later. Until transportation by rail became feasible in the area, Sumpter was little more than &quot;a huddle of crude log cabins.&quot;

A narrow-gauge railway reached Sumpter in 1897. Built by David C. Eccles, the Sumpter Valley Railway (SVRy) ran from Baker City through Sumpter and on to Prairie City, which it reached in 1907. Until the line shut down in the 1930s, ranchers, mining interests, and timber companies used it to move freight.

Shortly after the SVRy arrived, the city expanded near a set of deep-shaft gold mines with a combined total of of tunnels. The population grew to more than 2,000. Sumpter had electric lights, churches, saloons, a brewery, sidewalks, three newspapers, and an opera house. However, as the mines played out, the city declined even before a devastating fire in 1917.

Dynamite was used to help put out the fire, which destroyed 12 blocks of the town&#x27;s buildings. A few of the surviving structures remain in the 21st century and are occupied by retail shops.

==Economy==
Sumpter relies heavily on tourism as a source of income. The town&#x27;s remaining historic structures, an excursion train that runs along part of the SVRy line, and a state park devoted to a historic gold dredge make the city a tourist destination.

A stretch of the original SVRy has been restored and operates on summer weekends and major holidays from Memorial Day through the end of September. The excursion line has stations in Sumpter and McEwen. The Sumpter station and part of the line are within the state park, known as the Sumpter Valley Dredge State Historic Area. The dredge on display in the park was the last of three used to mine gold from surface deposits along the Powder River. It operated here from 1935 through 1954. Nowadays, the dredge has been made accessible for tourism, and visitors can walk through it to learn how it operated.

In 2013, the area was the location for the reality television show &quot;Ghost Mine&quot;. The plot involves a team of people looking for gold and ghosts in the &quot;Crescent Mine&quot; near Sumpter. According to a &quot;Baker City Herald&quot; story picked up by the Associated Press and Portland television station KATU, most of the filming was done at the Buckeye Mine group near Bourne, about north of Sumpter along Cracker Creek.

In 2020, Season 11 of Discovery&#x27;s TV series &quot;Gold Rush&quot; was filmed in the area. The show features rookie miner Fred Lewis, a veteran, in his attempts to mine gold with his former military friends.

==Geography==

Sumpter, about above sea level, is near the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest, the Blue Mountains, and a subrange of the Blue Mountains, the Elkhorn Mountains. McCully Fork and Cracker Creek meet to form the Powder River near Sumpter. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Sumpter is along Oregon Route 410, also known as the Sumpter Highway. By highway, the city is from Baker City, from Interstate 84, and from Portland. A loop drive known as the Elkhorn Scenic Byway passes through Sumpter, connecting to Oregon Route 7 at its intersection with Route 410.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Sumpter has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Adair Village is a city in Benton County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,018 as of the 2023 census population estimates.

==History==
Adair Village was named after the World War II military installation Camp Adair. When the war ended, the camp was closed and most of the buildings were removed, except for the hospital, which in 1946 was leased to Oregon State University for student and faculty housing. The university converted the hospital into apartments, a local government was organized, and the Adair Village post office was established in 1947.

When the postwar enrollment boom dwindled, Oregon State gave up its lease, and the United States Air Force maintained the base as a radar station. Adair Village post office closed in 1951, and Adair Air Force Station post office took its place from 1961 through 1969. The Air Force ceased operations and sold the property, with the individual houses being placed on the market. Adair Village incorporated in 1976. Adair Village city hall is one of the original World War II buildings.

<doc id="130683" wikidata="Q5016902" url="?curid=130683" title="Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve">
<text>Caerlaverock is a national nature reserve (NNR) covering parts of the mudflats and shoreline of the Solway Firth about 10 km south of Dumfries, in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It lies between the River Nith and the Lochar Water, and consists of a variety of wetland habitats including bare mud and sand, merse and marshes, and is fringed by neutral grassland on the landward side. A nature reserve was designated in 1957 at the instigation of the Duke of Norfolk. The NNR covers an area of and is an internationally important wintering site for waterfowl and wading birds.

The NNR is now managed by NatureScot, but remains under private ownership, being managed by SNH under lease agreements. As much of the reserve is intertidal, Crown Estate Scotland are one of the major landowners. Management of the site seeks to balance the human activities (fishing, wildfowling and farming interests) with those of nature.

==Ecology==
Virtually the entire Svalbard population of barnacle goose (roughly 38,000 as of 2015) overwinters here. More than 140,000 wading birds, including pink-footed geese, teals, goldeneyes, dunlins, grey plovers and golden plovers have been recorded in winter. In addition, many thousands of birds stop while passing through. During the summer around 45-50 species of birds breed at Caerlaverock, including shelducks, common redshanks, curlews and oystercatchers. 
Caerlaverock is also home to the UK&#x27;s most northerly population of natterjack toads , which live in shallow pools on the landward side of the reserve. SNH estimate that Caerlaverock (and the surrounding areas) may be home to up to 10% of the UK&#x27;s breeding population.

Carerlaverock NNR is part of the Upper Solway Flats and Marshes, which is a Ramsar site and a European Union Special Protection Area for birdlife, and extends across the Solway to Cumbria. The NNR is also part of the Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation, and is partly within the Nith Estuary National Scenic Area. The NNR is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are other national nature reserves on the other side of the Solway firth, in England.

The reserve was formerly included among UNESCO&#x27;s Biosphere Reserves. The site was designated in the 1970s, but subsequently the focus of the UNESCO programme shifted from the idea of isolated natural environments to one that allows for the interaction with man in terms of sustainable living and education. After new criteria for biosphere reserves were agreed in 1995, Caelaverock was among four Scottish sites delisted.

==Visitors==
NatureScot have provided two carparks and several paths to allow visitors to access the reserve. The path network links to WWT Caerlaverock, a centre run by conservation charity Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust located next to the NNR, and to the neighbouring Historic Environment Scotland property of Caerlaverock Castle.

Canby is home to the Canby Depot Museum and Hart&#x27;s Reptile World.

==Education==
Canby students are served by the Canby School District, which includes Canby High School.

==Media==
The &quot;Canby Herald&quot; is the city&#x27;s weekly newspaper. As of September 2018, Canby is also served by &quot;The Canby Current&quot;, a digital news source and twice-weekly podcast formerly known as the Canby Now Podcast.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
The Union Pacific (formerly a Southern Pacific mainline) freight and passenger (via Amtrak) line runs through the center of downtown Canby although Amtrak passenger trains no longer stop here. The Amtrak Cascades stops in nearby Oregon City. The Oregon Pacific Railroad branchline to Molalla interchanges with the Union Pacific mainline at Canby.

===Mass transit===
Since 2002, the city has operated its own bus system, Canby Area Transit (CAT). CAT buses do not run on weekends or major holidays. The service connects with the Portland area&#x27;s TriMet at the Oregon City Transit Center and with the Salem-Keizer Transit (Cherriots) bus system in Woodburn. Canby is also served by one route of South Metro Area Regional Transit (SMART), the bus division of the City of Wilsonville. Prior to 2002, Canby was included within the TriMet district, and that agency was the sole provider of transit service in Canby. In late 2001, TriMet approved a request by Canby to withdraw from the TriMet district and initiate its own transit service.

===Automobile===
Oregon Route 99E, a north–south highway, runs generally east–west within the city, paralleling the Union Pacific mainline. The Union Pacific mainline and Ivy St. form a cross that divides the city into four quadrants: NW, NE, SE and SW.

The east–west streets are generally numbered avenues, with Oregon Route 99E being SE and SW 1st Avenue. North–south streets are named streets. Many of their names are types of trees, and they run in alphabetical order from west to east, starting at the Molalla River. Within the city limits, addresses always include a quadrant designation, except for Ivy St, which only includes N or S.

Unincorporated islands within the city limits are included in the addressing system, as are some adjacent areas, but most unincorporated areas around the city but still in Clackamas County conform to the Portland addressing scheme, while areas in Marion County conform to the Salem addressing scheme.

===Waterways===
The historic Canby Ferry provides year-round transportation across the Willamette River (river conditions permitting) between Canby and Wilsonville.

===Aviation===
Canby is close to the Aurora State Airport and the Portland-Mulino Airport, both of which are served by general aviation only.

===Pedestrian and bicycle===
Canby features a paved road which is closed to automobile traffic, the Molalla Forest Road. This road was formerly a private road used by logging trucks, but is now used primarily by bicyclists and pedestrians.

<text>Estacada is a city in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, about southeast of Portland. The 2020 population is estimated to be 3,700. According to the 2010 census, the population in 2010 was 2,695.

==History==
The Estacada post office opened on February 24, 1904 and the city was incorporated in May 1905. The community formed as a camp for workers building a hydroelectric dam on the nearby Clackamas River that was to supply Portland with electricity. At the time, the river was relatively inaccessible by road, forcing the Oregon Power Railway Company to build a railway to the vicinity of the river to transport crews to the river for the construction of the dam. After the construction of the Hotel Estacada, the town became a weekend destination on the railroad line for residents of Portland. During the week, the train carried freight and work crews to and from Portland. Following the development of the dams, the city became a hub for the logging industry. In the early 20th century, a trolley line connected the town with downtown Portland. The railway line has been removed and there is no longer rail service to Estacada.

===Name===
The origin of the city&#x27;s name is disputed. One explanation is that the city&#x27;s name is a corruption of the names of a civic leader&#x27;s daughters, Esther and Katie, however, there is no evidence of their existence. Another theory states that: &quot;Estacado&quot; is a Spanish word and it means &quot;staked out&quot; or &quot;marked with stakes.&quot; It was first suggested by George Kelly as a name for the town site at a meeting of the Oregon Water Power Townsite Company directors on December 27, 1903. Kelly had selected the name at random from a U.S. map showing Llano Estacado in Texas. If Kelly&#x27;s suggestion had not been drawn from the hat, the town could have been named Rochester, Lowell or Lynn. The name Estacada is also used in Arizona.

<text>Johnson City is a city in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. The population was 566 at the 2010 census. Because of its small area, its population density is over 8,000 per square mile, making it the most densely populated city in Oregon.

==History==
On June 16, 1970, the residents of a trailer court owned by Delbert Johnson voted 49-to-10 to incorporate. Johnson had started the development in 1959, and in 1968 was unsuccessful in having the area annexed to Gladstone. The 55th Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1969 established a boundary review board to prevent an increase in small incorporated cities, but proponents of Johnson City&#x27;s incorporation had filed for an election before the law took effect. The community is also known as Johnson Mobile Estates.

Johnson City residents are not eligible to participate in the Clackamas County library system (LINCC), or any of its county partners. They are also not eligible for North Clackamas Parks and Recreation (NCPRD) programs, which includes Meals on Wheels.

In an effort to join the LINCC, the Johnson City Tenant Collective (JCTC) put Measure 3-585 on the 2022 November General Election ballot. It did not pass, and there is an open investigation against the owner of Johnson Mobile Estates for possible voter intimidation.

Molalla&#x27;s economy was traditionally based on logging and agriculture, but with the downturn in the timber industry, the city is turning to commerce to revitalize its economy.
Major employers in Molalla include the Molalla River School District and RSG Forest Products.
Natural resource recovery still stands out in Molalla. Many logging, road construction, quarrying and trucking companies provide services to the timber land managers in the timber rich area. Rapid growth species of trees have been planted and cultivated for timber and fiber. Aggregate, mined in the foothills, provides gravel for roads, asphalt highways and roads throughout the region.
An expanding agritourism industry is currently taking root in the more pastoral parts of the small lumber town, with the most promising examples being Posse Acres Elk Farm and Petting Zoo, The Abbey Farm Creamery and Out In The Garden Nursery, and the American Wildlife Foundation.

== Arts and culture ==

===Annual cultural events===
Molalla is the home of the Molalla Buckeroo rodeo (it began in 1913, the same time as the city was founded) and the Apple Festival. The Pacific Coast Freestyle Championships, a model airplane aerobatic tournament, has been held there for 14 years in late July. Several Latino rodeos are held at the rodeo facility by &quot;LaFortuna&quot; in spring, mid-summer, late summer and fall, bringing tens of thousands of Latino families to celebrate in the community. The Fourth of July Parade, sponsored by the Molalla Area Chamber of Commerce, often sports 50,000 spectators. Many other minor festivals—Halloween on Main Street, Christmas in the City, Spring Fling, Easter Egg Hunt in the Park, Fishing Derbies, Trail Rides, The Brew Fest, The North Valley High School Rodeo—all add to the quality of life in Molalla.

===Museums and other points of interest===
There is a miniature steam train, the Shady Dell Pacific Railroad, in Molalla Train Park three miles east of Molalla.
An interesting and free exhibit of Rodeo History Honors the &quot;Heroes&quot; of Rodeo memorialized in large brass plaques placed in the sidewalks of Molalla&#x27;s city core.
The Horace L. Dibble House and the Fred Vonder Ahe House and Summer Kitchen are buildings in Molalla on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) that have been preserved by the Molalla Area Historical Society. The NRHP-listed Rock Creek Methodist Church and William Hatchette Vaughan House are also in the Molalla area.

==Parks and recreation==

The Molalla River corridor offers opportunities for outdoor activities, including fishing, hunting, and hiking. Along the corridor to the east, Table Rock is a favorite local rocky promontory that provides visitors with a view of Molalla and the surrounding countryside for miles in every direction. Neighborhood and community parks include Fox, Clark, Long, and Ivor Davies Parks. Clark Park has a large open space, oak tree grove and playground. Long Park has a playground, a pavilion, and a beautiful bear carving. Fox Park hosts summer concerts and has a playground, pavilion, and splash pad for children. A long pedestrian and bicycle-friendly path extends through Ivor Davies Park over several small bridges and around a fish pond.
