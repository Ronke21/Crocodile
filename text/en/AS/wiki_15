<text>Amityville () is a village in the Town of Babylon in Suffolk County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 9,500 at the 2020 census. The village maintains its own accredited law enforcement agency the Amityville Police Department.

==History==
Huntington settlers first visited the Amityville area in 1653 due to its location to a source of salt hay for use as animal fodder. Chief Wyandanch granted the first deed to land in Amityville in 1658. The area was originally called &quot;Huntington West Neck South&quot; (it is on the Great South Bay and Suffolk County, New York border in the southwest corner of what once called Huntington South), but is now the Town of Babylon. According to village lore, the name was changed in 1846 when residents were working to establish its new post office. The meeting turned into bedlam and one participant was to exclaim, &quot;What this meeting needs is some amity.&quot; Another version says the name was first suggested by mill owner Samuel Ireland to name the town for his boat, the &quot;Amity&quot;.
The place name is strictly speaking an incidental name, marking an amicable agreement on the choice of a place name. The village was formally incorporated on March 3, 1894. In the early 1900s, Amityville was a popular tourist destination with large hotels on the bay and large homes. Annie Oakley was said to be a frequent guest of vaudevillian Fred Stone. Will Rogers had a home across Clocks Boulevard from Stone. World-famous classical composer &amp; pianist Benjamin Britten resided in the village during World War II. Gangster Al Capone also had a house in the community. Congregants began holding meeting for St. Mary&#x27;s Church in 1886, building a Chapel in 1888 by Wesley Ketcham under Rev. James H Noble and the church was consecrated in 1889, pre-dating the town incorporation.

===&quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;===

Amityville is the setting of the book &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; by Jay Anson, which was published in 1977 and has been adapted into a series of films starting in 1979. The story of &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; can be traced back to a real life murder case in Amityville in November 1974, when Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot all six members of his family at 112 Ocean Avenue. In December 1975 George and Kathy Lutz and Kathy&#x27;s three children moved into the house, but left after twenty-eight days, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena produced by the house. Jay Anson&#x27;s novel is said to be based on these events but has been the subject of much controversy; the murder case actually happened, but there has been no evidence that the house is or was haunted.

The local residents and authorities in Amityville are unhappy with the attention that &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; brings to the town, and tend to decline requests to discuss it publicly. The website of the Amityville Historical Society makes no mention of the murders in 1974 or the period that the Lutz family lived at the house. When the History Channel made its documentary about &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; in 2000, no member of the Historical Society would discuss the matter on camera.

The house featured in the novel still exists but has been renovated and the address changed in order to discourage tourists from visiting it. The Dutch Colonial Revival architecture house built in 1927 was put on the market in May 2010 for $1.15 million and sold in September for $950,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

==Asharoken Police Department==
The Village of Asharoken maintains its own police force, paid for predominantly by property taxes on village residents. Over the years Asharoken has earned a reputation for being tough on speeders. In 2003 the four-man Asharoken Police Department issued 1,000 tickets for speeding violations, a rate over 40 times greater than neighboring towns with significantly greater populations. Though the population of Asharoken has changed little in recent years, as of 2009 the police force increased to 11 officers, a supervising officer-in-charge, five cars and a boat patrolling land and water. 

The police department took possession of a new marine vessel in December 2010.

<doc id="127248" wikidata="Q384692" url="?curid=127248" title="Bay Shore, New York">
<text>Bay Shore is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Islip, New York, United States. It is situated on the South Shore of Long Island, adjoining the Great South Bay. The population of the CDP was 29,244 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Bay Shore is one of the older hamlets on Long Island. Sagtikos Manor, located in West Bay Shore, was built around 1697. It was used as a British armed forces headquarters, at the time of the Battle of Long Island during the Revolutionary War. President Washington stayed at the Sagtikos Manor during his tour of Long Island in 1790.

The land that would become Bay Shore proper was purchased from the Secatogue Native Americans in 1708 by local school teacher John Mowbray for &quot;several eel spears&quot;.

The hamlet&#x27;s name has changed over time: Early European settlers referred to the area first as Penataquit and later as Awixa; both were names used by the indigenous Secatogue. For reasons never documented, the name was changed in the early 19th century to Sodom. In 1842 there was a further name change to Mechanicsville, then a return in 1849 to Penataquit. The name Penataquit proved unpopular because it was difficult to spell, and the name of the hamlet and post office was changed to Bay Shore in 1868.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Bay Shore became renowned in the late 19th century for its shopping district and resorts. The rural hamlet became popular with affluent New Yorkers looking to escape the city to white sand beaches of the Great South Bay and the fishing villages of Fire Island. It was a tourist spot on weekends and during the summer, in large part because the newly built Long Island Rail Road enabled easy access from New York City. During World War I it became the headquarters of the First Yale Unit, a United States Naval Air Reserve unit.

===Post-World War II development===
The population of Bay Shore increased significantly after World War II: from the mid-1950s through mid-1960s, a variety of housing developments were constructed on farms and unused woodlands. Those developments were settled largely by working and middle class first-time home buyers from New York City.

Despite strains on the community brought on by sudden, substantial growth, the hamlet remained sound. Main Street continued to be one of the region&#x27;s most popular shopping destinations.

===1970s and 1980s===
Bay Shore suffered a decline beginning in the late 1970s. Without a local government, residents were unable to make decisions that were instead left to the Town of Islip and Suffolk County. The population density and demographics shifted when rezoning permitted businesses, rental properties and multi-family dwellings where previously only single-family houses had been allowed. Many Main Street storefronts became vacant. Construction of the South Shore Mall two miles north of Main Street took business away from the small businesses on Main Street. Deinstitutionalization caused psychiatric patients of the nearby Pilgrim State Hospital to be hastily relocated to rental housing downtown, often without sufficient professional support.

===Restoration and the hamlet today===

Work to restore Bay Shore has been ongoing since the 1980s. Upscale townhouses and condominiums were built in gated communities on the grounds of old estates. The former Bay Shore Theater and one-time opera house was renovated and expanded into a YMCA. The redevelopment of Main Street is ongoing; efforts include new sidewalks, antique-style streetlights, new landscaping and restored parks.
Main Street has regained much of its popularity. There are many attractive new restaurants, clothing boutiques and other stores and offices. The Bay Shore Beautification Society transformed an empty lot on Main Street into a meditation garden in 2007, that has since been recognized for its excellent design.

A US battleship was to have been placed at the Bay Shore Marina. However, the water was deemed too shallow, and instead a decommissioned WWII torpedo was converted into a monument. The aging bulkhead and other dock structures at the marina were rebuilt. Over the summer of 2010, a new water park was built at Benjamin Beach, which sits adjacent to the marina, with a renovated bath house and new landscaping.

Abandoned department stores at the Gardiner Manor Mall were razed to make new use of the property. Most of the old mall and adjacent buildings were replaced by new commercial and retail spaces, including a Lowe&#x27;s home improvement center, a Target and a BMW dealership.

In 2008 and 2009, new condominiums replaced dilapidated housing next to the train station. Additionally, a pedestrian bridge was built over the tracks, and the old tunnel between platforms was closed.

Other parts of the CDP, as of the 2020 US Census, extend into Islip Union Free School District, Brentwood Union Free School District, and West Islip Union Free School District. The shape of Bay Shore CDP differed in the 2010 and previous censuses, and so that boundary did not extend into West Islip School District.

In addition, Bay Shore Parochial School of St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church (of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre) offers elementary education covering grades K–8 courses and curriculum. It opened in 1921.

Since 1891, Bay Shore has been served by volunteer firefighters of the Bay Shore Fire Department. The department is headquartered on Fifth Avenue, and two additional stations are located on Union Boulevard and East William Street. The department also serves Brightwaters and West Bay Shore.

The Bay Shore Fire Department is made up of members from five companies. In 1885, Bay Shore Hook &amp; Ladder Company #1 was formed. In 1891, within a few weeks of each other, Penataquit Hose Company #1 and the Bay Shore Hose Company #1 were formed. The three companies were soon merged to form the Bay Shore Fire Department that same year. In 1895, the Bay Shore Fire Patrol Company was formed. Finally, the Bay Shore Engine Company #1 was formed in 1925. Briefly, during World War II, a sixth company was formed, Victory Engine Company #2, to supplement the department while many of its members were off in Europe and Asia fighting for America&#x27;s armed forces.

===Rescue ambulance===
Bay Shore is served by the Bay Shore-Brightwaters Volunteer Rescue Ambulance. The ambulance service covers 25 square miles and is staffed 24/7 by volunteers ranging in certifications from EMT to Paramedic.

==Emergency services==

===Fire safety===
Fire protection in Bayport is provided by the Bayport Fire Department, a volunteer department located at 251 Snedecor Avenue on the corner of Railroad Street, which is part of the Suffolk County Fire Rescue and Emergency Services system with call numbers 3-14-0. Besides fire protection, the Bayport Fire Department also responds to auto accidents, rescue calls, water-related emergencies, hazardous materials incidents and a first response for high priority EMS calls such as cardiac arrests, choking, etc.

The Bayport Fire Department was organized on August 15, 1891, with 18 members under the name Bayport Hose Company. Charles R. Post was made Chief. A plot of land on the north side of Middle Road, next to Shands (Little Albert&#x27;s) was purchased from I. S. Snedecor for $500 and a Fire House built for $3000. There was a belfry but this was removed in 1941. This building was sold to Arthur Shand, and a new firehouse was built on Snedecor Avenue and Railroad Street in 1956 where it stands today. In 1896 they bought a hook and ladder truck so heavy that there were not enough members to pull it to the fire. This also created the Hook and Ladder Company thus changing the name to the Bayport Fire Department.

Prior to World War II, a third company was created, Engine Company No.1; however, during WWII, the interdepartmental companies temporarily disbanded and were reestablished at the close of the war. In 1955 the Bayport Fire District purchased its first new fire truck, a 1955 Mack 750 GPM. In 1991 this vehicle was retired from active service and sold to the Bayport Fire Department for one dollar (US). In 2006, the truck in its original condition went through a minor overhaul having its gold leaf replaced and intense cleaning. Today, the BFD has roughly 120 members, 70-85 active and has an average response time of four minutes. Currently, there are four companies (Hose Company, Hook and Ladder Company, Engine Company and Fire Police Company) with two Squads (Rescue and Water Rescue).

In the 1800s fire departments typically had similar uniforms. Black or navy blue pants, red wool shirt with black breast and white insignia and patent leather belts. Today, the Bayport Fire Department members continue to wear the original uniform and as far as they know are the only fire department in New York state that continues to do so (with the exception of the Brentwood Fire Department band).

====Water Rescue Squad====
Formed in 1991 by members of the department and companies, was created as the BFD Dive or SCUBA team specializing in mostly subsurface rescues and based on recreation diving adapted to rescues. Early on, the team was one of the largest in Suffolk County based on certified divers. In 2000, the fire district purchased a 19&#x27; zodiac hurricane 580 rescue boat. This was to be used in conjunction with the smaller 10&#x27; avon rescue boat which was not sufficient for offshore rescues in the Great South Bay. Soon the department found their water rescue alarms went from about 1 or 2 per year to between 30 and 40. Quickly the squad reorganized itself and started advanced training in Public Safety Diving, Surface Rescues and Ice Rescues with nationally recognized certifications. In 2005 two major steps were taken with the squad: first, a new truck committee was established and a bid contract was awarded to Marion Body works of Wisconsin to build a specialized custom water rescue truck (which was delivered in May 2006), and second, the Zodiac was outfitted with a custom top, larger windshield, custom grab rails, radar, new GPS, new fire radios and new lighting. With mutual aid plans, the response area of the water rescue team has grown to Patchogue Bay to the east to Heckscher State Park to the west and south to Fire Island. In 2021 the Department placed a new Fire-Rescue boat in service. A 30ft Endeavor custom built by Silver Ships in Alabama. Powered by twin 350hp Mercury Verado outboards the vessel is equipped with A/C &amp; heat, a fire pump with bow monitor, Raymarine radar/chart/sonar system &amp; FLIR system.

===Ambulance and others===

EMS/Ambulance Service is provided by the Community Volunteer Ambulance Co. located in Sayville, which in addition to Sayville and Bayport covers the West Sayville, Bohemia and Oakdale communities. Police services are provided by the Suffolk County Police 5th Precinct.

==Education==
Bayport is served by the Bayport-Blue Point School District, which consists of a high school (Bayport-Blue Point High School), a middle school (James Wilson Young Middle School), and three elementary schools, Academy Street Elementary, Sylvan Avenue Elementary, and Blue Point Elementary.

==Library==
Bayport is served by the Bayport-Blue Point Public Library. The Bayport-Blue Point Public Library was founded in 1935 as project of the Blue Point Parent Teacher Association, as the Blue Point Public Library. When the Bayport and Blue Point school districts merged in 1952, the library officially became the Bayport-Blue Point Library, and it is a school district public library, overseen by the New York State Education Department. The library&#x27;s collection began from donated books, with tradition stating that the donated books were gathered, home by home, via wheelbarrow. Today, the library&#x27;s logo is a wheelbarrow containing books, paying homage to the institution&#x27;s beginnings. The library was first contained in a room of the Blue Point School (now Blue Point Elementary School) before moving to various locations including the building what is now the Blue Point Liquor Store, and houses along Blue Point Avenue. In 1957 the current building was built at 203 Blue Point Avenue. Two additions to the building have made the building almost three times its original size. The library was completely run by volunteers up until 1970, making it one of the last volunteer-run libraries in New York State.

On December 6, 2018, voters in the Bayport-Blue Point School District approved the purchase of the St. Ursula Center at 186 Middle Road in Blue Point for $3.65 million, to become the future home of the Bayport-Blue Point Public Library. The convent, which had served as a novitiate, retreat center, and most recently a retirement home for the Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk, is scheduled to undergo a $13,197,800 renovation to convert the home into a 28,000 square foot public library with additional programs and collection space, state-of-the-art technology, an outdoor Community Garden, and more. As of 2024 the library is now built.

==Aerodrome==
Bayport is home to one of only a few remaining aerodromes on Long Island. The Bayport Aerodrome Society is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1972. Its membership is composed of aviation professionals and those interested in preserving aviation history. By offering tours of the Aerodrome and living museum, its members share their passion for aviation with the community.

<text>Belle Terre is a village in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 792 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The peninsula on which the community of Belle Terre is situated has been known as Mt. Misery since the 17th century. Before Belle Terre&#x27;s modern existence, the area was referred to as Mt. Misery Point. By comparison, the lower portion of the peninsula, which is currently a section of the neighboring village of Port Jefferson, was referred to as Mt. Misery Neck.

Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, the bulk of the peninsula was owned by the Strong family, who had their Oakwood estate in its Mt. Misery Neck section. The first known dwelling in contemporary Belle Terre was a shack constructed by an African-American affectionately known as Uncle Mott in the 1800s. This house was the subject of a painting by local artist William Moore Davis.

In 1902, the Port Jefferson Company purchased the Oakwood estate with the purpose of creating an exclusive waterfront development of fifty houses to rival the communities of Long Island&#x27;s traditional Gold Coast. The well-connected real-estate developer, Dean Alvord, was chosen as president of Belle Terre&#x27;s estates, which was incorporated in 1906. The construction of the Belle Terre Club, a grandiose private members club at the center of the community, also occurred in 1906. A pair of stately pergolas were constructed as well, which overlook the waterfront.

In 1931, Belle Terre incorporated itself as a village.

The Belle Terre Club was destroyed in a fire in 1934, the same year as the pergolas were deconstructed due to the financial burden of their upkeep. Due to a lapse in insurance coverage, the clubhouse was never rebuilt although a new country club opened in the Port Jefferson section of the Mt. Misery peninsula in 1956.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the community&#x27;s residents staged a successful campaign against sand and gravel companies who began dredging operations in the area. Prior to these companies being ordered to cease operations in 1931, the Seaboard Sand &amp; Gravel Company dredged a large cove near the tip of the peninsula. This is today known as Pirates Cove and is a popular feature of Port Jefferson Harbor among boaters.

For several decades prior to her death in 2014, Belle Terre was the principal home of Nadia de Navarro Farber, a Bulgarian-born countess (by her second of four marriages) who donated considerably to the John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in neighboring Port Jefferson Village. Farber alternated her residence between a landmark pink mansion near the tip of Belle Terre and her castle on the Caribbean island of Saint Croix. The pink mansion was featured prominently in the 1989 film &quot;She-Devil&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The village occupies the northeastern half of the Mt. Misery peninsula and overlooks both Port Jefferson Harbor and the Long Island Sound.

==Belle Terre v. Boraas==
Belle Terre is known for a law that evicted students from a nearby university campus, the Stony Brook University, who were leasing shared housing in the village. In 1974, in the case &quot;Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States, an opinion written by Justice William O. Douglas held that it was constitutional to forbid more than two people unrelated by blood, adoption, or marriage — not counting household servants — from living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit in the village for the purpose of maintaining a quiet residential sector.

<text>Bellport is a village in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 2,084 at the 2010 census.

The Incorporated Village of Bellport is named after the Bell family, early settlers of the area. South Country Road (Main St.) in the village features small businesses such as antique shops, artist galleries, small inns, restaurants, and a service center. These family-run businesses get community support from the Bellport Chamber of Commerce. Bellport is also home to the Gateway Playhouse, a professional summer theater in operation since 1950.

==History==
The land that is now Bellport was purchased along with what is now the hamlet of Brookhaven (then called Fireplace Neck) and western South Haven from the Unkechaug Indians in 1664 by settlers from nearby Setauket, who were attracted by the plentiful harvests of salt hay. The part that became Bellport was named Occumbomock Neck. Jonathan Rose was the first permanent settler in the 1680s, and by 1720 the Rose family owned much of Occumbomock Neck. In 1829, Captain Thomas Bell, a Scottish immigrant, bought land there. He sold sections of it, and by 1843 the village had 30 dwellings and 200 inhabitants. He changed the name to Bell-Port (now Bellport), envisioning a seaport, since Bellport was very close to the Old Inlet, a breach in the barrier island Fire Island, which gave Bellport easy access to the open ocean. With Colonel William Howell, Bell built a dock and a road to the dock. But the breach healed over, and Bellport instead became a tourist attraction, with wealthy visitors coming by railroad and then coach from New York City. Although all seven hotels eventually closed, the last in the 1950s, Bellport remained associated with wealthy New Yorkers, who eventually established year-round residences. After World War II, nearby Camp Upton was converted into Brookhaven National Laboratory, bringing in more, highly educated, year-round residents.

Bellport was incorporated as a village in 1910. On July 4, 1980, the Bellport Academy and Bellport Village Historic District were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On March 8, 1963, Bellport High School burned down. No one was killed, but 40 students and teachers were hospitalized. The replacement school was built in Brookhaven, but is still called Bellport High School.

On November 26, 1983, the New York Pyrotechnic Products Company factory (now known as Fireworks by Grucci) just north of the village exploded, killing two and injuring 24. The explosion had the effect of an earthquake, causing significant damage to hundreds of homes.

== Geography ==

===Ho Hum Beach===
Ho Hum Beach is on Fire Island, across the Great South Bay from the Bellport Village Marina. Village residents and their guests are welcome to visit the beach. Surfers, sunbathers, and fishermen especially enjoy its privateness. Ho Hum Beach offers a bathing area, a screened-in snack shack and showers on the bay side of the beach. The Whalehouse Point ferry runs from the Bellport Village Marina from late May to early September. Village residents can buy round-trip ferry tickets, and their guests may ride the ferry for an increased fare. Village residents are also welcome to ride their own boats over. Boat slips for non-residents are available for a fee.

These are paid for by taxes on property within the village boundaries, which the Brookhaven town receiver of taxes collects. Education is the responsibility of the South Country Central School District, ambulance service is provided by the South Country Ambulance Company, fire service by the Bellport Fire District, and police service by the Suffolk County Police Department and Bellport code enforcement.

== Transportation ==
Bellport is served by two bus routes, the 66 (which runs from the Patchogue LIRR station to the Riverhead LIRR station, running mostly on Montauk Highway before turning onto William Floyd Parkway in Mastic and running along Neighborhood Road in Mastic Beach, then turning onto Mastic Road and ultimately rejoining Montauk Highway) and the 77 (which runs from the Patchogue LIRR station to South Country Road in Bellport). Both bus routes also provide a direct connection to the Bellport LIRR station in the hamlet of North Bellport.

The main route through Bellport is South Country Road (Suffolk CR 36), a former section of Montauk Highway that runs west to east from East Patchogue to Brookhaven. The main south-north road is Bellport Lane, which becomes Bellport Avenue north of South Country Road. At the northern village border, the principal south-north route shifts to Station Road and runs toward West Yaphank, while Bellport Avenue becomes a minor local street that terminates at a dead end on the Montauk Branch of the LIRR, resuming its trajectory between Montauk Highway and the eastbound service road of Sunrise Highway at Exit 56. Other roads include Head of the Neck Road, which runs west through east from North Bellport and skirts the village&#x27;s northern border east of Fairway Drive.

==Library==
The Bayport-Blue Point Public Library was founded in 1935 as project of the Blue Point Parent Teacher Association, as the Blue Point Public Library. When the Bayport and Blue Point school districts merged in 1952, the library officially became the Bayport-Blue Point Library, and it is a school district public library, overseen by the New York State Education Department The library’s collection began from donated books, with tradition stating that the donated books were gathered, home by home, via wheelbarrow. Today, the library’s logo is a wheelbarrow containing books, paying homage to the institution’s beginnings. The library was first contained in a room of the Blue Point School (now Blue Point Elementary School) before moving to various locations including the building what is now the Blue Point Liquor Store, and houses along Blue Point Avenue. In 1957 the current building was built at 203 Blue Point Avenue. Two additions to the building have made the library almost three times its original size. The library was completely run by volunteers up until 1970, making it one of the last volunteer-run libraries in New York State.

On December 6, 2018, voters in the Bayport-Blue Point School District approved the purchase of the St. Ursula Center at 186 Middle Road in Blue Point for $3.65 million, to become the future home of the Bayport-Blue Point Public Library. The convent, which had served as a novitiate, retreat center and most recently a retirement home for the Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk, is scheduled to undergo a $13,197,800 renovation to convert the home into a 28,000 square foot public library with additional program and collection space, state-of the-art technology, an outdoor Community Garden, and more.

<doc id="127254" wikidata="Q472802" url="?curid=127254" title="Treaty of Waitangi">
<text>The Treaty of Waitangi (), sometimes referred to as Te Tiriti, is a document of central importance to the history of New Zealand, its constitution, and its national mythos. It has played a major role in the treatment of the Māori people in New Zealand by successive governments and the wider population, something that has been especially prominent from the late 20th century. The treaty document is an agreement, not a treaty as recognised in international law. It was first signed on 6 February 1840 by Captain William Hobson as consul for the British Crown and by Māori chiefs () from the North Island of New Zealand. The treaty&#x27;s quasi-legal status satisfies the demands of biculturalism in contemporary New Zealand society. In general terms, it is interpreted today as having established a partnership between equals in a way the Crown likely did not intend it to in 1840. Specifically, the treaty is seen, first, as entitling Māori to enjoyment of land and of natural resources and, if that right were ever breached, to restitution. Second, the treaty&#x27;s quasi-legal status has clouded the question of whether Māori had ceded sovereignty to the Crown in 1840, and if so, whether such sovereignty remains intact.

The treaty was written at a time when the New Zealand Company, acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and would-be settlers, was establishing a colony in New Zealand, and when some Māori leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French ambitions. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British Governor of New Zealand, recognising Māori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving Māori the rights of British subjects. It was intended by the British Crown to ensure that when Lieutenant Governor Hobson subsequently made the declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand in May 1840, the Māori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored. Once it had been written and translated, it was first signed by Northern Māori leaders at Waitangi. Copies were subsequently taken around New Zealand and over the following months many other chiefs signed. Around 530 to 540 Māori, at least 13 of them women, signed the Māori language version of the Treaty of Waitangi, despite some Māori leaders cautioning against it. Only 39 signed the English version. An immediate result of the treaty was that Queen Victoria&#x27;s government gained the sole right to purchase land. In total there are nine signed copies of the Treaty of Waitangi, including the sheet signed on 6 February 1840 at Waitangi.

The text of the treaty includes a preamble and three articles. It is bilingual, with the Māori text translated in the context of the time from the English.
* Article one of the Māori text grants governance rights to the Crown while the English text cedes &quot;all rights and powers of sovereignty&quot; to the Crown.
* Article two of the Māori text establishes that Māori will retain full chieftainship over their lands, villages and all their treasures while the English text establishes the continued ownership of the Māori over their lands and establishes the exclusive right of pre-emption of the Crown.
* Article three gives Māori people full rights and protections as British subjects.

As some words in the English treaty did not translate directly into the written Māori language of the time, the Māori text is not an exact translation of the English text, particularly in relation to the meaning of having and ceding sovereignty. These differences created disagreements in the decades following the signing, eventually contributing to the New Zealand Wars of 1845 to 1872 and continuing through to the Treaty of Waitangi settlements starting in the early 1990s.

During the second half of the 19th century Māori generally lost control of much of the land they had owned, sometimes through legitimate sale, but often by way of unfair deals, settlers occupying land that had not been sold, or through outright confiscations in the aftermath of the New Zealand Wars. In the period following the New Zealand Wars, the New Zealand government mostly ignored the treaty, and a court judgement in 1877 declared it to be &quot;a simple nullity&quot;. Beginning in the 1950s, Māori increasingly sought to use the treaty as a platform for claiming additional rights to sovereignty and to reclaim lost land, and governments in the 1960s and 1970s responded to these arguments, giving the treaty an increasingly central role in the interpretation of land rights and relations between Māori people and the state.

In 1975 the New Zealand Parliament passed the Treaty of Waitangi Act, establishing the Waitangi Tribunal as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with interpreting the treaty, investigating breaches of the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi by the Crown or its agents, and suggesting means of redress. In most cases, recommendations of the tribunal are not binding on the Crown, but settlements with a total value of roughly $1 billion have been awarded to various Māori groups. Various legislation passed in the latter part of the 20th century has made reference to the treaty, which has led to ad hoc incorporation of the treaty into law. Increasingly, the treaty is recognised as a founding document in New Zealand&#x27;s developing unwritten constitution.
The New Zealand Day Act 1973 established Waitangi Day as a national holiday to commemorate the signing of the treaty.

==Context and background history==
Treaty making by European powers with indigenous peoples had always been common but not universal practice in empire building. Treaties were dependent on the specific situation. In 19th century New Zealand, the British wanted to formalise their involvement in the country, regulate land speculation and control general disorder. They were faced with a Māori population that was more numerous, with cultivated land and government. Therefore, the British drew up the Treaty of Waitangi. In comparison, this situation did not apply in Australia where no treaties were deemed necessary by the British.

Māori generally respected the British, partially due to their relationships with missionaries and also due to Britain&#x27;s status as a major maritime power, which had been made apparent to Māori travelling outside New Zealand.

While heading the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years, leading to slave trading being prohibited in the British Empire in 1807, William Wilberforce, with other members of the Clapham Sect, championed the foundation of the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1799, with the determination to improve the treatment of indigenous people by the British. This led to the establishment of the Christian mission in New Zealand, which saw laymen arriving from 1814 to teach building, farming and Christianity to Māori, as well as training Māori ministers.

The Māori language did not then have an indigenous writing system. Missionaries learned to speak Māori, introduced the Latin alphabet and, with Māori, developed the written form of the language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission-house of the head of the New Zealand CMS, Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published Māori translations including parts of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. Demand for Colenso&#x27;s 1837 Māori New Testament, and for the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian Māori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 Māori soon attending regularly. Literacy and understanding the Bible increased and social and economic benefits.

Other major players in the area around the 1830s included American whalers and French Catholics who came for trade and as missionaries. The Māori were deeply distrustful of the French, due to a massacre of 250 people that had occurred in 1772, when the French retaliated for the killing of Marion du Fresne and some of his crew.

While the threat of general French colonisation never materialised, in 1831 it prompted thirteen major chiefs from the far north of the country to meet at Kerikeri to compose a letter to King William IV asking for Britain to be a &quot;friend and guardian&quot; of New Zealand. It is the first known plea for British intervention written by Māori. In response, the British government sent James Busby in 1832 to serve as the British Resident in New Zealand. In 1834 Busby drafted a document known as the (in the Māori language) and the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand (in English) which he and 35 northern Māori chiefs signed in 1835, establishing those chiefs as representatives under the title of the &quot;United Tribes of New Zealand&quot;. He Whakaputanga (Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand) asserted that the &#x27;public authority&#x27; of New Zealand remained with Māori. This document was not well received by the Colonial Office in Britain, and it was decided in London that a new policy for New Zealand was needed. From a Māori perspective, The Declaration of Independence had a twofold significance: first, for the British to establish control of its lawless subjects in New Zealand; and second, to establish internationally the mana and sovereignty of Māori leaders.

From May to July 1836, Royal Navy officer Captain William Hobson, under instruction from Governor of New South Wales Sir Richard Bourke, visited New Zealand to investigate claims of lawlessness in its settlements. Hobson recommended in his report that British sovereignty be established over New Zealand, in small pockets similar to those of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Rupert&#x27;s Land (in present-day Canada). Hobson&#x27;s report was forwarded to the Colonial Office. From April to May 1838, the House of Lords held a select committee into the &quot;State of the Islands of New Zealand&quot;. The New Zealand Association (later the New Zealand Company), missionaries, Joel Samuel Polack, and the Royal Navy made submissions to the committee.

On 15 June 1839, new letters patent were issued in London to expand the territory of New South Wales to include the entire territory of New Zealand, from latitude 34° South to 47° 10&#x27; South, and from longitude 166° 5&#x27; East to 179° East. Governor of New South Wales George Gipps was appointed Governor over New Zealand. This was the first clear expression of British intent to annex New Zealand.
Hobson was called to the Colonial Office on the evening of 14 August 1839 and given instructions to take the constitutional steps needed to establish a British colony. He was appointed Consul to New Zealand and was instructed to negotiate a voluntary transfer of sovereignty from the Māori to the British Crown – as the House of Lords select committee had recommended in 1837. The Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Marquess of Normanby, gave Hobson three instructions: to gain freely given Māori recognition of British sovereignty over all or part of New Zealand, to assume complete control over land matters, and to establish a form of civil government. The Colonial Office did not provide a draft of the treaty. Normanby wrote at length about the need for British intervention as essential to protect Māori interests, but this was somewhat deceptive. Hobson&#x27;s instructions gave no provision for Māori government of any kind nor any Māori involvement in the administrative structure of the prospective new colony. His instructions required him to:
treat with the Aborigines of New Zealand for the recognition of Her Majesty&#x27;s Sovereign authority over the whole or any part of those islands which they may be willing to place under Her Majesty&#x27;s dominion.

The historian, Claudia Orange, argues that prior to 1839 the Colonial Office had initially planned a &quot;Māori New Zealand&quot; in which European settlers would be accommodated (without a full colony), where Māori might retain ownership and authority over much of the land and cede some land to European settlers as part of a colony governed by the Crown. Normanby&#x27;s instructions in 1839 show that the Colonial Office had shifted their stance toward colonisation and &quot;a settler New Zealand in which a place had to be kept for Māori&quot;, primarily due to pressure from increasing numbers of British colonists, and the prospect of a private enterprise in the form of the New Zealand Company colonising New Zealand outside of the British Crown&#x27;s jurisdiction. The Colonial Office was forced to accelerate its plans because of both the New Zealand Company&#x27;s hurried dispatch of the &quot;Tory&quot; to New Zealand on 12 May 1839 to purchase land, and plans by French Captain Jean François L&#x27;Anglois to establish a French colony in Akaroa. After examining Colonial Office documents and correspondence (both private and public) of those who developed the policies that led to the development of the treaty, historian Paul Moon similarly argues that the treaty was not envisioned with deliberate intent to assert sovereignty over Māori, but that the Crown originally only intended to apply rule over British subjects living in the fledgling colony, and these rights were later expanded by subsequent governors through perceived necessity.

Hobson left London on 15 August 1839 and was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand in Sydney on 14 January 1840, finally arriving in the Bay of Islands on 29 January 1840. Meanwhile, a second New Zealand Company ship, the &quot;Cuba&quot;, had arrived in Port Nicholson on 3 January 1840 with a survey party to prepare for settlement there. The &quot;Aurora&quot;, the first ship carrying immigrants, arrived in Port Nicholson on 22 January 1840.

On 30 January 1840 Hobson attended the Christ Church at Kororareka (Russell), where he publicly read a number of proclamations. The first was the Letters Patent 1839, in relation to the extension of the boundaries of New South Wales to include the islands of New Zealand. The second related to Hobson&#x27;s own appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand. The third concerned land transactions (notably the issue of pre-emption).

CMS printer William Colenso produced a Māori circular for the United Tribes high chiefs, inviting them to meet &quot; Hobson&quot; on 5 February 1840 at Busby&#x27;s Waitangi home.

==Drafting and translating the treaty==

Without a draft document prepared by lawyers or Colonial Office officials, Hobson was forced to write his own treaty with the help of his secretary, James Freeman, and British Resident James Busby, neither of whom was a lawyer. Historian Paul Moon believes certain articles of the treaty resemble the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the British Sherbro Agreement (1825) and the treaty between Britain and Soombia Soosoos (1826).

The entire treaty was prepared in three days, in which it underwent many revisions. There were doubts even during the drafting process that the Māori chiefs would be able to understand the concept of relinquishing &quot;sovereignty&quot;.

Assuming that a treaty in English could not be understood, debated or agreed to by Māori, Hobson asked CMS head missioner Henry Williams, and his son Edward Marsh Williams, who was a scholar in Māori language and custom, to translate the document overnight on 4 February. Henry Williams was concerned with the actions of the New Zealand Company in Wellington and felt he had to agree with Hobson&#x27;s request to ensure the treaty would be as favourable as possible to Māori. Williams avoided using any English words that had no expression in Māori &quot;thereby preserving entire the spirit and tenor&quot; of the treaty. He added a note to the copy Hobson sent to Gibbs stating, &quot;I certify that the above is as literal a translation of the Treaty of Waitangi as the idiom of the language will allow.&quot;
The gospel-based literacy of Māori meant some of the concepts communicated in the translation were from the Māori Bible, including (governorship) and (chiefly rule), and the idea of the treaty as a &quot;covenant&quot; was biblical.

The translation of the treaty was reviewed by James Busby, and he proposed the substitution of the word for , to describe the &quot;Confederation&quot; or gathering of the chiefs. This no doubt was a reference to the northern confederation of chiefs with whom Hobson preferred to negotiate, who eventually made up the vast majority of signatories to the treaty. Hobson believed that elsewhere in the country the Crown could exercise greater freedom over the rights of &quot;first discoverers&quot;, which proved unwise as it led to future difficulties with other tribes in the South Island.

==Debate and signing==

Overnight on the 4–5 February the original English version of the treaty was translated into Māori. On the morning of 5 February the Māori and English versions of the treaty were put before a gathering () of northern chiefs inside a large marquee on the lawn in front of Busby&#x27;s house at Waitangi. Hobson read the treaty aloud in English and Williams read the Māori translation and explained each section and warned the chiefs not to rush to decide whether to sign. Building on Biblical understanding, he said:

Māori chiefs then debated the treaty for five hours, much of which was recorded and translated by the Paihia missionary station printer, William Colenso. Rewa, a Catholic chief, who had been influenced by the French Catholic Bishop Pompallier, said &quot;The Māori people don&#x27;t want a governor! We aren&#x27;t European. It&#x27;s true that we&#x27;ve sold some of our lands. But this country is still ours! We chiefs govern this land of our ancestors&quot;. Moka &#x27;Kainga-mataa&#x27; argued that all land unjustly purchased by Europeans should be returned. Whai asked: &quot;Yesterday I was cursed by a white man. Is that the way things are going to be?&quot;. Protestant Chiefs such as Hōne Heke, Pumuka, Te Wharerahi, Tāmati Wāka Nene and his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone were accepting of the Governor. Hōne Heke said:

Tāmati Wāka Nene said to the chiefs:
Bishop Pompallier, who had been counselling the many Catholic Māori in the north concerning the treaty, urged them to be very wary of the treaty and not to sign anything.
For Māori chiefs, the signing at Waitangi would have needed a great deal of trust. Nonetheless, the expected benefits of British protection must have outweighed their fears. In particular, the French were also interested in New Zealand, and there were fears that if they did not side with the British that the French would put pressure on them in a similar manner to that of other Pacific Islanders farther north in what would become French Polynesia. Most importantly, Māori leaders trusted CMS missionary advice and their explanation of the treaty. The missionaries had explained the treaty as a covenant between Māori and Queen Victoria, the head of state and Church of England. With nearly half the Māori population following Christianity many looked at the treaty as a Biblical covenant – a sacred bond.

Afterwards, the chiefs then moved to a river flat below Busby&#x27;s house and lawn and continued deliberations late into the night. Busby&#x27;s house would later become known as the Treaty House and is today New Zealand&#x27;s most visited historic building.

Hobson had planned for the signing to occur on 7 February however on the morning of 6 February 45 chiefs were waiting ready to sign. Around noon a ship carrying two officers from &quot;HMS Herald&quot; arrived and were surprised to hear they were waiting for the Governor so a boat was quickly despatched back to let him know. Although the official painting of the signing shows Hobson wearing full naval regalia, he was in fact not expecting the chiefs that day and was wearing his dressing gown or &quot;in plain clothes, except his hat&quot;. Several hundred Māori were waiting and only Busby, Williams, Colenso and a few other Europeans.

===Article Four===
French Catholic Bishop Jean-Baptiste Pompallier soon joined the gathering and after Anglican English priest and CMS mission head Rev Henry Williams read the Māori translation aloud from a final parchment version. Pompallier spoke to Hobson who then addressed Williams:
Williams attempted to do so vocally, but as this was technically another clause in the treaty, Colenso asked for it to be added in writing, which Williams did, also adding Māori custom. The statement says:

This addition is sometimes referred to as article four of the treaty, and is recognised as relating to the right to freedom of religion and belief (). Historian Paul Moon has claimed any guarantee of religious freedom implied by Pompallier&#x27;s action is a myth and that there is a lack of evidence or legal basis to support the statement being a fourth article of the treaty. Historian Michael King agreed with Moon that Pompallier was probably protecting Catholic interests, but also accused Moon of being anti-Catholic in his criticism of Pompallier stirring up trouble that day.

===First signings===
The treaty signing began in the afternoon. Hobson headed the British signatories. Hōne Heke was the first of the Māori chiefs who signed that day. As each chief signed Hobson said &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;We are [now] one people&quot;. This was probably at the request of Williams, knowing the significance, especially to Christian chiefs, &#x27;Māori and British would be linked, as subjects of the Queen and followers of Christ&#x27;. Two chiefs, Marupō and Ruhe, protested strongly against the treaty as the signing took place but they eventually signed and after Marupō shook the Governor&#x27;s hand, seized hold of his hat which was on the table and gestured to put it on. Over 40 chiefs signed the treaty that afternoon, which concluded with a chief leading three thundering cheers, and Colenso distributing gifts of two blankets and tobacco to each signatory.
===Later signings===
Hobson considered the signing at Waitangi to be highly significant, he noted that twenty-six of the forty-six &quot;head chiefs&quot; had signed. Hobson had no intention of requiring the unanimous assent of Māori to the treaty, but was willing to accept a majority, as he reported that the signings at Waitangi represented &quot;Clear recognition of the sovereign rights of Her Majesty over the northern parts of this island&quot;. Those that signed at Waitangi did not even represent the north as a whole; an analysis of the signatures shows that most were from the Bay of Islands only and that not many of the chiefs of the highest rank had signed on that day. Hobson considered the initial signing at Waitangi to be the &quot;de facto&quot; treaty, while later signings merely &quot;ratified and confirmed it&quot;.

To enhance the treaty&#x27;s authority, eight additional copies were sent around the country to gather additional signatures:
* the Manukau-Kawhia copy (13 signatures),
* the Waikato-Manukau copy (39 signatures),
* the Tauranga copy (21 signatures),
* the Bay of Plenty copy (26 signatures),
* the Herald-Bunbury copy (27 signatures),
* the Henry Williams copy (132 signatures),
* the Tūranga (East Coast) copy (41 signatures), and
* the Printed copy (5 signatures).

The Waitangi original received 240 signatures.

About 50 meetings were held from February to September 1840 to discuss and sign the copies, and a further 500 signatures were added to the treaty. While most did eventually sign, especially in the far north where most Māori lived, a number of chiefs and some tribal groups ultimately refused, including Pōtatau Te Wherowhero (Waikato iwi), Tuhoe, Te Arawa and Ngāti Tuwharetoa and possibly Moka &#x27;Kainga-mataa&#x27;. A number of non-signatory Waikato and Central North Island chiefs would later form a kind of confederacy with an elected monarch called the Kīngitanga. (The Kīngitanga Movement would later form a primary anti-government force in the New Zealand Wars.) While copies were moved around the country to give as many tribal leaders as possible the opportunity to sign, some missed out, especially in the South Island, where inclement weather prevented copies from reaching Otago or Stewart Island. Assent to the treaty was large in Kaitaia, as well as the Wellington to Whanganui region, but there were at least some holdouts in every other part of New Zealand.

Māori were the first indigenous race to sign a document giving them British citizenship and promising their protection. Hobson was grateful to Williams and stated a British colony would not have been established in New Zealand without the CMS missionaries.

=== Sovereignty proclamations ===
On 21 May 1840, Lieutenant-Governor Hobson proclaimed sovereignty over the whole country, (the North Island by treaty and the South Island and Stewart Island by discovery) and New Zealand was constituted the Colony of New Zealand, separate from New South Wales by a Royal Charter issued on 16 November 1840, with effect from 3 May 1841.

Hobson issued the proclamation because he felt it was forced on him by settlers from the New Zealand Company at Port Nicholson who had formed an independent settlement government and claimed legality from local chiefs, two days after the proclamation on 23 May 1840, Hobson declared the settlement&#x27;s government as illegal.

==Extant copies==

In 1841, treaty documents, housed in an iron box, narrowly escaped damage when saved by civil servant George Elliot as the government offices at Official Bay in Auckland were destroyed by fire. They disappeared from sight until 1865 when a Native Department officer worked on them in Wellington at the request of parliament and produced an erroneous list of signatories. The papers were fastened together and then deposited in a safe in the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s office.

In 1877, the English-language rough draft of the treaty was published along with photolithographic facsimiles, and the originals were returned to storage. In 1908, historian and bibliographer Thomas Hocken, searching for historical documents, found the treaty papers in the basement of the Old Government Buildings in poor condition, damaged at the edges by water and partly eaten by rodents. The papers were restored by the Dominion Museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on. In February 1940, the treaty documents were taken to Waitangi for display in the Treaty House during the Centenary celebrations. It was possibly the first time the treaty document had been on public display since it was signed. After the outbreak of war with Japan, they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with the Public Trustee at Palmerston North by the local member of parliament, who did not tell staff what was in the case. However, as the case was too large to fit in the safe, the treaty documents spent the war at the side of a back corridor in the Public Trust office.

In 1956, the Department of Internal Affairs placed the treaty documents in the care of the Alexander Turnbull Library and they were displayed in 1961. Further preservation steps were taken in 1966, with improvements to the display conditions. From 1977 to 1980, the library extensively restored the documents before the treaty was deposited in the Reserve Bank.

In anticipation of a decision to exhibit the document in 1990 (the sesquicentennial of the signing), full documentation and reproduction photography was carried out. Several years of planning culminated with the opening of the climate-controlled Constitution Room at the National Archives by Mike Moore, Prime Minister of New Zealand, in November 1990. It was announced in 2012 that the nine Treaty of Waitangi sheets would be relocated to the National Library of New Zealand in 2013. In 2017, the He Tohu permanent exhibition at the National Library opened, displaying the treaty documents along with the Declaration of Independence and the 1893 Women&#x27;s Suffrage Petition.

==Treaty text, meaning and interpretation==

The treaty, its interpretation and significance can be viewed as the contrast between a literate culture and one that was wholly oral.

===English text ===
The treaty itself is short, consisting of a preamble and three articles.

The English text (from which the Māori text is translated) starts with the preamble and presents Queen Victoria &quot;being desirous to establish a settled form of Civil Government&quot;, and invites Māori chiefs to concur in the following articles. The first article of the English text grants the Queen of England &quot;absolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty&quot; over New Zealand. The second article guarantees to the chiefs full &quot;exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties&quot; but the Crown has a pre-emptive right to buy the land. The third article guarantees to all Māori the same rights as all other British subjects.

===Māori text===
The Māori text has the same overall structure, with a preamble and three articles. The first article indicates that the Māori chiefs &quot;give absolutely to the Queen of England for ever the complete government over their land&quot; (according to a modern translation by Hugh Kāwharu). With no adequate word available to substitute for &#x27;sovereignty&#x27;, as it was not a concept in Māori society at the time, the translators instead used (governorship or government). The second article guarantees all Māori &quot;chieftainship over their lands, villages and all their treasures&quot; (translated), with &#x27;treasures&#x27; here translating from to mean more than just physical possessions (as in the English text), but also other elements of cultural heritage. The second article also says: &quot;Chiefs will sell land to the Queen at a price agreed to by the person owning it and by the person buying it (the latter being) appointed by the Queen as her purchase agent&quot; (translated), which does not accurately convey the pre-emption clause of the English text. The third article gives Māori the &quot;same rights and duties of citizenship as the people of England&quot; (translated); roughly the same as the English text.

===Differences===

The English and Māori texts differ. As some words in the English treaty did not translate directly into the written Māori language of the time, the Māori text is not a literal translation of the English text. It has been claimed that Henry Williams, the missionary entrusted with translating the treaty from English, was fluent in Māori and that far from being a poor translator he had in fact carefully crafted both versions to make each palatable to both parties without either noticing inherent contradictions.

The differences between the two texts have made it difficult to interpret the treaty and also continue to undermine its effect. The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the interpretation of three Māori words: (&#x27;governorship&#x27;), which is ceded to the Queen in the first article; (&#x27;chieftainship&#x27;) not (&#x27;leadership&#x27;) (which was stated in the Declaration of Independence just five years before the treaty was signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few Māori involved with the treaty negotiations understood the concepts of sovereignty or &quot;governorship&quot;, as they were used by 19th-century Europeans, and lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that &quot;ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in Māori terms&quot;.

Furthermore, is a loan translation from &quot;governorship&quot; and was not part of the Māori language. The term had been used by Henry Williams in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, which was signed by 35 northern Māori chiefs at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated &quot;&quot; to describe &quot;all sovereign power and authority in the land&quot;. There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that (&#x27;prestige&#x27;, &#x27;authority&#x27;) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that would not have been appropriate. This is because is not the same thing as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their .

The English-language text recognises Māori rights to &quot;properties&quot;, which seems to imply physical and perhaps intellectual property. The Māori text, on the other hand, mentions &quot;taonga&quot;, meaning &quot;treasures&quot; or &quot;precious things&quot;. In Māori usage the term applies much more broadly than the English concept of legal property, and since the 1980s courts have found that the term can encompass intangible things such as language and culture. Even where physical property such as land is concerned, differing cultural understandings as to what types of land are able to be privately owned have caused problems, as for example in the foreshore and seabed controversy of 2003–04.

The pre-emption clause is generally not well translated. While pre-emption was present in the treaty from the very first draft, it was translated to , a word which simply meant &quot;to buy, sell, or trade&quot;. Many Māori apparently believed that they were simply giving the British Queen first offer on land, after which they could sell it to anyone. Another, less important, difference is that , meaning England alone, is used throughout in the Māori text, whereas &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; is used in the first paragraph of the English.

Based on these differences, there are many academics who argue that the two versions of the treaty are distinctly different documents, which they refer to as &quot;Te Tiriti o Waitangi&quot; and &quot;The Treaty of Waitangi&quot;, and that the Māori text should take precedence, because it was the one that was signed at Waitangi and by the most signatories. The Waitangi Tribunal, tasked with deciding issues raised by the differences between the two texts, also gives additional weight to the Māori text in its interpretations of the treaty.

The entire issue is further complicated by the fact that, at the time, writing was a novel introduction to Māori society. As members of a predominately oral society, Māori present at the signing of the treaty would have placed more value and reliance on what Hobson and the missionaries said, rather than on the written words of the treaty. Although there is still a great deal of scholarly debate surrounding the extent to which literacy had permeated Māori society at the time of the signing, what can be stated with clarity is that of the 600 plus chiefs who signed the written document only 12 signed their names in the Latin alphabet. Many others conveyed their identity by drawing parts of their (personal facial tattoo), while still others marked the document with an X.

Māori beliefs and attitudes towards ownership and use of land were different from those prevailing in Britain and Europe. The chiefs would traditionally grant permission for the land to be used for a time for a particular purpose. A northern chief, Nōpera Panakareao, early on summarised his understanding of the treaty as &quot;&quot; (&quot;The shadow of the land will go to the Queen, but the substance of the land will remain with us&quot;). Nōpera later reversed the statement – feeling that the substance of the land had indeed gone to the Queen; only the shadow remained for the Māori.

==Role in New Zealand society==
===Effects on Māori land and rights (1840–1960)===
==== Colony of New Zealand ====
In November 1840 a royal charter was signed by Queen Victoria, establishing New Zealand as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales from 3 May 1841. In 1846 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 which granted self-government to the colony, requiring Māori to pass an English-language test to be able to participate in the new colonial government. In the same year, Lord Stanley, the British Colonial Secretary, who was a devout Anglican, three times British Prime Minister and oversaw the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, was asked by Governor George Grey how far he was expected to abide by the treaty. The direct response in the Queen&#x27;s name was:

At Governor Grey&#x27;s request, this act was suspended in 1848, as Grey argued it would place the majority Māori under the control of the minority British settlers. Instead, Grey drafted what would later become the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, which determined the right to vote based on land-ownership franchise. Since most Māori land was communally owned, very few Māori had the right to vote for the institutions of the colonial government. The 1852 Constitution Act also included provision for &quot;Māori districts&quot;, where Māori law and custom were to be preserved, but this section was never implemented by the Crown.

Following the election of the first parliament in 1853, responsible government was instituted in 1856. The direction of &quot;native affairs&quot; was kept at the sole discretion of the Governor, meaning control of Māori affairs and land remained outside of the elected ministry. This quickly became a point of contention between the Governor and the colonial parliament, who retained their own &quot;Native Secretary&quot; to advise them on &quot;native affairs&quot;. In 1861, Governor Grey agreed to consult the ministers in relation to native affairs, but this position only lasted until his recall from office in 1867. Grey&#x27;s successor as Governor, George Bowen, took direct control of native affairs until his term ended in 1870. From then on, the elected ministry, led by the Premier, controlled the colonial government&#x27;s policy on Māori land.

==== Right of pre-emption ====
The short-term effect of the treaty was to prevent the sale of Māori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was intended to protect Māori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated indigenous peoples in other parts of the world from their land with minimal compensation. Before the treaty had been finalised the New Zealand Company had made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as a fait accompli, in which it was largely successful.

In part, the treaty was an attempt to establish a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse. Initially, this worked well with the Governor and his representatives having the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy.

The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, by the standards of the time. In particular, the Governor had the responsibility to protect Māori interests. Still, Hobson, as Governor of New Zealand, and his successor Robert FitzRoy both took seriously their duty as protectors of Māori from unscrupulous settlers, working actively to prevent shady land deals. Hobson created a group of &quot;Protectors of the Aborigines&quot;; officials specifically appointed to verify owners, land boundaries, and sales. Lack of funds often prevented land deals at this time, which created discontent among those who were willing but unable to sell. Combined with a growing awareness of the profit margins that the government was receiving by reselling the land at a profit, there was growing discontent among Māori with the pre-emption clause. At this time Māori and others argued that the government&#x27;s abuse of the pre-emption clause was incompatible with article three of the treaty which guaranteed Māori equal rights to those of British subjects. FitzRoy was sympathetic to their pleas and decided to waive the pre-emption clause in 1844, allowing land sales directly to individuals.

====New Zealand Wars and land sales====

The growing disagreement over British sovereignty of the country led to several armed conflicts and disputes beginning in the 1840s, including the Flagstaff War, a dispute over the flying of the British Union Flag at the then colonial capital, Kororareka in the Bay of Islands. The Māori King Movement () began in the 1850s partly as a means of focusing Māori power in a manner which would allow them to negotiate with the Governor and Queen on equal footing. The chiefs justified the King&#x27;s role by the treaty&#x27;s guarantee of (&#x27;chieftainship&#x27;).

FitzRoy&#x27;s successor George Grey was appointed Governor in 1845. He viewed the Protectors as an impediment to land acquisition and replaced them with new officials whose goals were not to protect Māori interests, but rather to purchase as much land as possible. Grey restored the Crown&#x27;s right to pre-emption bypassing the Native Land Purchase Act in 1846, which contemporary writers viewed as a &quot;first step towards a negation of the Treaty of Waitangi&quot;. This ordinance also tightened government control of Māori lands, prohibiting Māori from leasing their land and restricting the felling of timber and harvesting of flax. A high court case in 1847 (&quot;R v Symonds&quot;) upheld the Crown&#x27;s right to pre-emption and allowed Grey to renegotiate deals made under Fitzroy&#x27;s waiving of the pre-emption clause. Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges). Donald McLean acted as Grey&#x27;s intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense. Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether. The whole of the South Island was purchased by 1860 in several large deals, and while many of the sales included provisions of 10 per cent of the land set aside for native inhabitants, these land area amounts were not honoured or were later transmuted to much smaller numbers. In some cases Grey or his associates bullied the owners into selling by threatening to drive them out with troops or employ rival chiefs to do so.

Conflict continued to escalate in the early 1860s, when the government used the Māori King Movement as an excuse to invade lands in the eastern parts of the North Island, culminating in the Crown&#x27;s confiscation of large parts of the Waikato and Taranaki from Māori. The treaty was used to justify the idea that the chiefs of Waikato and Taranaki were rebels against the Crown.
In July 1860, during the conflicts, Governor Thomas Gore Browne convened a group of some 200 Māori (including over 100 pro-Crown chiefs handpicked by officials) to discuss the treaty and land for a month at Mission Bay, Kohimarama, Auckland. This became known as the Kohimarama Conference, and was an attempt to prevent the spread of fighting to other regions of New Zealand. But many of the chiefs present were critical of the Crown&#x27;s handling of the Taranaki conflict. Those at the conference reaffirmed the treaty and the Queen&#x27;s sovereignty and suggested that a native council be established, but this did not occur.

==== Native Land Court ====
The Native Land Court (later renamed the Māori Land Court) was established under the Native Lands Act 1865, which also finally abolished the Crown right to pre-emption. It was through this court that much Māori land was alienated, and the way in which it functioned is much criticised today. A single member of a tribal group could claim ownership of communal tribal land, which would trigger a court battle in which other tribal members were forced to participate, or else lose out. The accumulation of court fees, lawyers fees, survey costs, and the cost of travelling to attend court proceedings resulted in mounting debts that could only be paid by the eventual sale of the land. In effect, Māori were safe from the court only until a single tribal member broke ranks and triggered a case, which would invariably result in the sale of the land. By the end of the century, nearly all of the highest quality Māori land had been sold, with only two million hectares remaining in Māori possession.

Although the treaty had never been directly incorporated into New Zealand law, its provisions were first incorporated into specific legislation as early as the Land Claims Ordinance 1841 and the Native Rights Act 1865. However, in the 1877 &quot;Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington&quot; judgement, Judge Prendergast argued that the treaty was a &quot;simple nullity&quot; in terms of transferring sovereignty from Māori to the British Crown. This remained the legal orthodoxy until at least the 1970s. Māori have since argued that Prendergast&#x27;s decision, as well as laws later based on it were a politically convenient and deliberate ploy to legitimise the seizure of Māori land and other resources.

Despite this, Māori frequently used the treaty to argue for a range of demands, including greater independence and return of confiscated and unfairly purchased land. This was especially the case from the mid-19th century, when they lost numerical superiority and generally lost control of most of the country and had little representation in government or the councils where decisions that impacted their affairs were made. Simultaneously, Māori rights over fisheries (guaranteed in article 2 of the treaty) were similarly degraded by laws passed in the late 19th century.

Over the longer term, the land purchase aspect of the treaty declined in importance, while the clauses of the treaty which deal with sovereignty and Māori rights took on greater importance. In 1938, the judgement of the case &quot;Te Heuheu Tukino v Aotea District Maori Land Board&quot; considered the treaty as valid in terms of the transfer of sovereignty, but the judge ruled that as it was not part of New Zealand law it was not binding on the Crown.

==== Treaty House and revival ====

The treaty returned to the public eye after the Treaty House and grounds were purchased by the Governor-General, Viscount Bledisloe, in the early 1930s and donated to the nation. The dedication of the site as a national reserve in 1934 was probably the first major event held there since the 1840s. The profile of the treaty was further raised by the New Zealand centenary of 1940. For most of the twentieth century, textbooks, government publicity and many historians touted the treaty as the moral foundation of colonisation and argued that it set race relations in New Zealand above those of colonies in North America, Africa and Australia. Popular histories of New Zealand and the treaty often claimed that the treaty was an example of British benevolence and therefore an honourable contract. Even though Māori continued to challenge this narrative, the treaty&#x27;s lack of legal standing in 1840 and subsequent breaches tended to be overlooked until the 1970s when these issues were raised by the Māori protest movement.

===Resurgence and place in New Zealand Law (1960–present)===
The Waitangi Day Act 1960 was a token gesture towards acknowledging the Treaty of Waitangi and somewhat preceded the Māori protest movement as a whole. It established Waitangi Day, although it did not make it a public holiday, and the English text of the treaty appeared as a schedule of the Waitangi Day Act but this did not make it a part of statute law. Subsequent amendments to the act, as well as other legislation, eventually acquiesced to campaigns to make Waitangi Day a national holiday in 1976.

====The Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 and the Waitangi Tribunal====

During the late 1960s and 1970s, the Treaty of Waitangi became the focus of a strong Māori protest movement which rallied around calls for the government to &quot;honour the treaty&quot; and to &quot;redress treaty grievances&quot;. Māori boycotted Waitangi Day in 1968 over the Māori Affairs Amendment Act (which was perceived as a further land grab) and Māori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of the treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials, as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by the Māori Land Court continuing alienation of Māori land from its owners. The protest movement can be seen as part of the worldwide civil rights movements, which emerged in the 1960s.

As a response to the protest movement, the treaty finally received limited recognition in 1975 with the passage of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, which established the Waitangi Tribunal, but this initially had very limited powers to make findings of facts and recommendations only. The act was amended in 1985 to enable it to investigate breaches of the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi back to 1840, and also to increase the tribunal membership. The membership was further increased in another amendment in 1988.

====Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi====
The Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 introduced the phrase Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. It is found twice in the long title of the Act and also in Section 6(1) which provides for the Waitangi Tribunal to inquire into claims by any Maori that they are prejudicially affected by Crown acts (or omissions) that are inconsistent with the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

The Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 provides for the intentions of the treaty to be taken into account through the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.
The Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s key function is to evaluate Crown actions against the intentions of the parties that signed the Treaty. The Tribunal also has the specific authority to determine the meaning of the two texts of the Treaty.
Hayward (2004) states: &quot;The Tribunal&#x27;s findings ...are expressed in the currency of treaty principles - which principles are applicable to the particular case, and how the Crown breached those principles, if at all&quot;.

In order to apply the Treaty of Waitangi in a way that is relevant to the Crown and Māori in the present day, the Waitangi Tribunal and the courts must consider the broad sentiments, the intentions and the goals of the treaty, and then identify the relevant principles of the treaty on a case-by-case basis. Each Tribunal is required to determine the principles of each claim on a case-by-case basis.

The &quot;Principles of the Treaty&quot; have become a common topic in contemporary New Zealand politics. In 1989, the Fourth Labour Government published a report &quot;Principles for Crown Action on the Treaty of Waitangi&quot; a similar list of principles to that established in a 1987 court case. By 2021, the Treaty of Waitangi or its principles are referred to in over thirty five principal Acts. The ACT party has proposed a referendum on redefining the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

====Waitangi Tribunal claims====

During the early 1990s, the government began to negotiate settlements of historical (pre-1992) claims.

==== Bill of Rights ====
Geoffrey Palmer argued that the treaty should be further incorporated as a part of the New Zealand constitution, to help improve relations between the Crown, Māori and other New Zealanders. The Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s &quot;Bill of Rights White Paper&quot; proposed that the treaty be entrenched in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. This proposal was never carried through to the legislation, with the attitude of many Māori towards it &quot;suspicious, uneasy, doubtful or undecided&quot;. Many Māori were concerned that the proposal would relegate the treaty to a lesser position, and enable the electorate (who under the original Bill of Rights would be able to repeal certain sections by referendum) to remove the treaty from the Bill of Rights altogether. Geoffrey Palmer commented in 2013 that:
During the 1990s there was broad agreement between major political parties that the settlement of historical claims was appropriate. Some disagreed however, and claims of a &quot;Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry&quot;, which profits from making frivolous claims of violations of the Treaty of Waitangi, were made by a number of political figures in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including former National Party leader Don Brash in his 2004 &quot;Orewa Speech&quot;. The &quot;Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Deletion Bill&quot; was introduced in the New Zealand Parliament in 2005 as a private member&#x27;s bill by New Zealand First MP Doug Woolerton. Winston Peters, the 13th Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, and others supported the bill, which was designed to remove references to the treaty from New Zealand law. The bill failed to pass its second reading in November 2007.

==== Public opinion ====
In terms of public opinion, a study in 2008 found that among the 2,700 voting age New Zealanders surveyed, 37.4% wanted the treaty removed from New Zealand law, 19.7% were neutral, and 36.8% wanted the treaty kept in law; additionally, 39.7% agreed Māori deserved compensation, 15.7% were neutral, and 41.2% disagreed. In 2017, the same study found that among the 3,336 voting age New Zealanders surveyed, 32.99% wanted the treaty removed from New Zealand law, 14.45% were neutral and 42.58% disagreed, and 9.98% didn&#x27;t know.

Today, the treaty is still not specifically part of New Zealand domestic law, but has been adopted into various acts of parliament ad hoc. It is nevertheless regarded as a founding document of New Zealand.

==Commemoration==
The anniversary of the signing of the treaty – 6 February – is the New Zealand national day, Waitangi Day. The day was first commemorated in 1934, when the site of the original signing, Treaty House, was made a public reserve (along with its grounds). However, it was not until 1974 that the date was made a public holiday. Waitangi Day has been the focus of protest by Māori (as was particularly the case from the 1970s through to the 1990s), but today the day is often used as an opportunity to discuss the history and lasting effects of the treaty. 
The Waitangi crown, a 1935 commemorative coin, was issued in honour of the treaty. The treaty was one of the first inscriptions from New Zealand added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme in 1997.

<doc id="127255" wikidata="Q3468957" url="?curid=127255" title="Bohemia, New York">
<text>Bohemia is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 9,852 at the 2020 census. It is situated along the South Shore of Long Island in the Town of Islip, approximately 50 miles from New York City.

A portion of Long Island MacArthur Airport is located within the hamlet.

Many of Bohemia&#x27;s current residents trace their ethnic heritage back to southern Italy, Ireland, and the historical Czech lands (also called Bohemia). A large percentage of Bohemia&#x27;s growing population has migrated to the town from western Long Island, Brooklyn, and Queens.

Connetquot River State Park is also located in Bohemia. The park provides an ideal location for horse back riding and because of this, the town harbors a unique equestrian culture. Many of the homes located along the park have stables and it is common to see locals walking their horses through the town&#x27;s tree lined streets.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of what is today Bohemia were the Secatogue tribe of the Algonquian peoples.

The area was founded as Bohemia in 1855 by Slavic immigrants who were the first Europeans to settle there in large numbers. These migrants came from a mountainous village near Kadaň in the Central European Kingdom of Bohemia, which is the town&#x27;s namesake (Kadaň is located in present-day Czech Republic). Their pilgrimage coincided with a wave of Bohemian nationals emigrating to the United States, many of whom embodied the free spirited and enlightened lifestyles synonymous with bohemianism. They had taken part in the widespread revolutions against autocratic rule that had shaken Europe in 1848 and came seeking a new life in the United States. Work was hard to come by in New York and many of the men tried to support themselves as street musicians. An important contribution they made to the development of Long Island was adding their rich Central European folklore to the local culture, a nice complement to the also rich oral tradition of the native people. Many of the first homes they built are located on the town&#x27;s avenues and are distinguished by their cross gable roofs.

For 100 years, Bohemia remained a very small village most of whose residents were of Czech descent. With the development of all of Long Island after World War II, Bohemia also grew. At the time of the centennial in 1955, the population was about 3,000. Today there about 10,000 inhabitants from many national and ethnic backgrounds.

=== Local cigar industry ===
The Slavic immigrants came to Bohemia with excellent cigar-making skills. There were once several cigar making factories in the town and the industry provided a living for many of the residents. Two notable cigar factories were Albert Kovanda&#x27;s factory, located on the corner of Lakeland and Smithtown Avenues, and the M. Foster Cigar Factory, located at Ocean Avenue and Church Street. The local cigar industry continued until the 1930s when mechanized production did away with the need for hand manufacturing. No cigar factories remain today.

=== Name change ===
Over the years, there have been a number of attempts to change the name of Bohemia, which some people felt was too tied to one ethnic group. They felt this was keeping new people and new businesses from coming to the town. Proposed new names have included: Sayville Heights or North Sayville, after the town immediately to the south; Lidice, after a Czech town destroyed by Nazi troops during World War II; and MacArthur, after the airport built in the 1940s (the airport is named for American General Douglas MacArthur). None of the efforts to change the name received enough public support to be finalized.

==Geography==

The airport serves travelers from the Greater New York Metropolitan Area and around the nation who want a more convenient alternative to the congestion at John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports. The airport&#x27;s most popular destinations include: Orlando, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; and Baltimore, Maryland.

Bohemia is a short drive from the Sayville Ferry Service of the Fire Island National Seashore which provides access to some of Long Island&#x27;s most pristine and least crowded ocean beaches.

==Bohemia Historical Society==
Dedicated to preserving the rich heritage of the hamlet, the Bohemia Historical Society (BHS) was founded in 1984. This non-profit local organization pursues this goal through its educational programs, slide presentations, involvement in community activities, a newsletter, its website and its museum. The museum was officially opened on April 26, 2009, and it houses a number of exhibits depicting life in the early days of Bohemia, a photograph collection, and a book collection that includes many historical Czech manuscripts. Additionally, the building serves as the society meeting place.

==Connetquot River State Park==
Connetquot River State Park Preserve maintains 3,473 acres of land and water for the protection and propagation of game birds, fish and animals. Deer and waterfowl are numerous, rare nesting birds, including the osprey, are present and there are numerous rare plants, such as trailing arbutus and pyxie moss in their natural habitats. The preserve also has 50 miles of hiking, horseback riding, cross-country ski and nature trails, as well as fishing (by permit only) on the Connetquot River.

<text>Brentwood is a hamlet in the Town of Islip in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 62,387 at the 2020 Census, making it the most populous CDP in Suffolk County and on all of Long Island outside of New York City.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1844, the area was established as Thompson Station and Suffolk Station, two new stations on the expansion of the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road.

On March 21, 1851, it became the utopian community named Modern Times. The colony was established on of land by Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. In 1864, it was renamed Brentwood after the town of Brentwood, Essex, in England.

By contract, all the land in the colony was bought and sold at cost, with being the maximum allowable lot size. The community was said to be based on the idea of individual sovereignty and individual responsibility. Individuals were encouraged to pursue their self-interest as they saw fit. All products of labor were considered private property. The community had a local private currency based upon labor exchange in order to trade goods and services (&quot;see Mutualism (economic theory)&quot;). All land was private property, with the exception of alleys which were initially considered common property but later converted to private property. Initially, no system of authority existed in the colony; there were no courts, jails or police. This appears to have given some credence to Warren&#x27;s theories that the most significant cause of violence in society was most attributable to policies and law which did not allow complete individuality in person and property. However, the modest population of the colony might be considered a factor in this characteristic. The Civil War, as well as new residents that did not share the colony&#x27;s philosophy, are said to have contributed to its eventual dissolution. Almost all of the original buildings that existed in Modern Times have been destroyed, aside from two Octagon houses, the original schoolhouse and a residence.

===Modern-day Brentwood===
During the first half of the 20th century, Brentwood was home to the Ross Health Resort Onehtah, managed by Dr. William H. Ross. Onehtah was a place where a person could escape the pollution of the city. It was thought that the smell of pine needles brought a person good health.

Brentwood is the site of Pilgrim State Hospital (once one of the world&#x27;s largest hospitals and psychiatric institutions), now known as Pilgrim Psychiatric Center. A portion of the psychiatric center was converted into the Brentwood State Park athletic field complex, which officially opened in 2009.

Brentwood&#x27;s Centennial Celebration was on June 16–17, 1950. The 150th anniversary of the community was commemorated on May 9–11, 2007.

Brentwood High School has a nationally-recognized boys soccer team that won national championship in 2019.

Brentwood Legion Ambulance operates within the fire district borders. The Brentwood Fire Department and Brentwood Legion Ambulance work closely together to protect and serve those within their community.

===Brentwood Fire Department===
The Brentwood Fire Department was started in 1898 when local residents banded together to combat brush and forest fires that threatened their homes and farm land. On August 28, 1899, land was purchased from Mrs. Elvira S. Studley and the Brentwood Fire District was incorporated. The Department was first known as the Brentwood Hook and Ladder Company. A firehouse was built in 1900 and a used fire apparatus was purchased from the Islip Fire Department.

In 1926, the department was reorganized and Theodore Freund was elected as the first Fire Chief. On March 30, 1928, the original firehouse burned down and many records were destroyed. The old building was replaced with a two-story brick house on the same site which is still in use today as the department gym. In 1932, the name &quot;Brentwood Fire Department&quot; was formally adopted and in 1937, the hamlet&#x27;s first fire hydrants were installed and the fire district&#x27;s political boundaries were enlarged a year later. In 1955, a new fire house was built on Fourth Street, around the corner from the old firehouse. The Brentwood Fire Department continues to serve the residents of the Brentwood community, answering an average of 1,500 calls a year. The Brentwood Fire Department is regularly recognized as one of the busiest fire departments in Suffolk County. The Brentwood Fire Department is part of the Suffolk County Fire Rescue and Emergency Services (FRES) system. It holds department identifier number 3-2-0.
The District is governed by an elected five-member Board of Fire Commissioners (Board). The Board is responsible for the overall financial management of the District, including establishing policies and procedures to ensure that assets are properly safeguarded. Additionally, the Board is responsible for approving an annual budget to ensure the District&#x27;s resources are efficiently used. The District Treasurer is the District&#x27;s chief fiscal officer, appointed by the Board, and is responsible for the receipt, custody, disbursement, and accounting of District funds. The District&#x27;s total expenditures for 2010 were approximately $5.8 million.
Firehouses within the district include Quanahasset Engine Company #1, Pines Engine Company #2, Ames &amp; Elliott R.A.C. Company #3, Sagtikos Engine Company #4, Central Engine Company #5 and Edgewood Engine Company #6. There is also a Hook and Ladder Company #1 and the Fire Prevention Company #9.
===Brentwood Legion Ambulance===
Brentwood Legion Ambulance was founded and established by William J.A. Seymour in 1959. That year he was seriously injured after being involved in an automobile collision in Brentwood. It took almost two hours for an ambulance to arrive from a neighboring town, as Brentwood lacked any ambulance services. As a result, Mr. Seymour ended up being driven to the hospital in a private vehicle despite having sustained serious injury. Mr. Seymour recognized that this was a problem affecting his neighborhood, so he decided that changes needed to be made.

That year, Mr. Seymour gathered members from the American Legion’s Joseph Loeffler Post 1006, based in Brentwood. The ‘Legion’ portion of the department’s name is to honor the dedication of the members from the local American Legion Post that played a monumental part in establishing the ambulance service. Mr. Seymour and the members of the American Legion Post together were no more than 25 volunteers, giving their time to help their neighbors. They purchased a 1948 Cadillac hearse and converted it into an ambulance. Over the course of over 50 years, the Brentwood Legion Ambulance has expanded to over 250 members from all across Long Island, New York. The department has made upgrades to state-of-the-art equipment and vehicles since obtaining their first ambulance from 1948 all those years ago.

Brightwaters was developed in the early 20th Century by the T.B. Ackerson Company, which was known for its work in Brooklyn.

By 1916, locals felt that their community, which at the time was still an unincorporated part of the Town of Islip, would be better off if they were to incorporate as a village, citing concerns over how their community was being taxed and how they had to pay for private subscriptions for things which the believed should have been provided through taxes paid to Islip. This led to locals signing a petition to incorporate Brightwaters as a village. The petition was given to the Town of Islip on September 20, 1916, and Brightwaters became an incorporated village on November 30, 1916.

<doc id="127260" wikidata="Q2877571" url="?curid=127260" title="Calverton, New York">
<text>Calverton is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) on eastern Long Island in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 6,510 at the 2010 census.

Most of Calverton is in the Town of Riverhead, while the area south of the Peconic River is a mostly undeveloped smaller portion in the Town of Brookhaven.

==History==
Calverton was first referred to as &quot;Baiting Hollow Station&quot; when the Long Island Rail Road arrived in 1844. The station closed in 1958, but the sheltered shed for the station remained standing as of 2007.

The area&#x27;s Native American name was &quot;Conungum&quot; or &quot;Kanungum&quot;, meaning &quot;fixed line&quot; or &quot;boundary&quot;. In 1868, the Calverton post office opened, named for Bernard J. Calvert. It remained a small farming community specializing in cranberries, which grew in swampy areas along the Peconic River until the Navy purchase.

Calverton&#x27;s history is tied closely to Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Calverton. In 1953, the United States Navy purchased around Calverton from a local farmer named Harry Edwards, including the mansion of a grandson of Frank Winfield Woolworth&#x27;s, so that Grumman could test and finish jets. A runway was built, and most of Grumman&#x27;s F-14 Tomcat and E-2C Hawkeye aircraft were to pass through the plant.

In 1965, Nelson Rockefeller proposed using the base as the fourth major airport for the New York metropolitan area. Grumman and local opposition ended the quest.

In 1978, more than of the base were used to create Calverton National Cemetery, which is the largest and busiest (in terms of burials per day) United States national cemetery. In 1995, after Northrop acquired Grumman, the new Northrop Grumman pulled out of the base, and the Navy began liquidating the land. In 1996, before the base could be turned over the Town of Riverhead, the base was used to reassemble the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 which had crashed about south in the ocean. In 2000, Skydive Long Island (formerly located at East Moriches) moved to the airport, and to this day continues to generate the majority of the current air traffic as a key destination for New York–based skydivers.

Through 2007, debates raged about whether or not to turn the base into a mega complex around a NASCAR track, called EPCAL Centre, or a giant ski resort based construction of an artificial high indoor ski mountain. In January 2008, the Riverhead Town Board, with newly elected officers, signed a deal to sell the airport for $155 million to Riverhead Resorts, to build the ski mountain, tear up the airport runway, and replace it with a lake, overruling a December vote to give the NASCAR track the go-ahead. It would have taken up to three years to get the necessary environmental permits, and the proposed opening date of the project was 2012. On November 12, 2010, however, the town of Riverhead voted 4–1 to cancel all plans for the indoor ski resort/water park.

A portion of the base is being developed as an industrial/office park.

Several new medium size industrial companies have sprung up in the area, including Crown Recycling and a Federal Express Distribution Center.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.82%, is water.

==History==
Cold Spring Harbor was named after the naturally cold freshwater springs that flow in the area.

In the 20th century it became known as the site of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, although the laboratory itself is located in the adjacent village of Laurel Hollow in Nassau County, which was called Cold Spring before incorporation.

Today it is primarily a bedroom community of New York City, with a small central business area running along Route 25A, and is home to many educational and cultural organizations: the Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Museum, the Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery and Aquarium (also in Laurel Hollow), Dolan DNA Learning Center, the Uplands Farm Sanctuary (home of The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Long Island chapter), and a museum exhibition gallery run by Preservation Long Island.

== History ==
The name &quot;Commack&quot; comes from the Secatogue Native American tribe who lived on the South Shore of Long Island between Copiague and Bayport. The Secatogue named their northern lands in the center of the island Winnecomac which means &quot;pleasant lands.&quot; The name may have been inspired because of the area&#x27;s flat lands with rich soil, and thick oak forests abounding with plants and wildlife. From its earliest days, Commack, originally spelled &quot;Comac&quot; had fertile soil which made it the perfect land for farming. 

Commack is a suburban area, and, like most unincorporated places on Long Island, does not have a walkable downtown or &quot;Main Street&quot;.

By the 1980s, the Commack Motor Inn had become such an accepted part of Long Island life that its gift certificates were prizes at social clubs. In a 1994 interview, actress Rosie O&#x27;Donnell recounted, &quot;That&#x27;s where everyone in high school went to have their first sexual experience.&quot;

<text>Coram is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, United States. As of the 2010 United States census, the CDP population was 39,113.

== History ==
Coram is the oldest settlement in the central part of the town of Brookhaven. Its early name was &quot;Wincoram&quot;, perhaps the name of a Native American who lived in the area as late as 1703. The first European settler in the area was likely William Satterly, who sought permission to open a tavern to cater to travelers in 1677.

During the American Revolutionary War, Benjamin Tallmadge with his contingent of Light Dragoons arrived and he with 12 Culper Ring men captured and burned 300 tons of hay the British were storing for winter to feed their horses. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:
I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time. I beg you to accept my thanks for your spirited execution of this business. Annually Coram celebrates the event in October.

From 1784 to 1885, Coram served as the meeting place for the Town of Brookhaven government, using the Davis Town Meeting House for much of that period. The Davis House, built in the 1750s, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and is the oldest existing structure in Coram.

== Albert Einstein and Cutchogue ==
An avid sailor, Albert Einstein once called Little Peconic Bay in Cutchogue &quot;the most beautiful sailing ground I ever experienced.&quot; In the summers of 1938 and 1939 he rented a cottage on Old Cove Road, now called West Cove Road, on Nassau Point, and spent many hours alone in a little sailboat he called Tineff (Yiddish for &quot;worthless&quot;). Albert Einstein was taught to sail on Little Peconic Bay but his sailing skills left much to be desired.

While in Cutchogue on August 2, 1939, pipe-smoking Einstein was visited by fellow Jewish physicists from Hungary Leó Szilárd (who had produced a nuclear chain reaction in a laboratory at Columbia University) and Edward Teller (both prompted by Niels Bohr), and dictated the famous Letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him to the new developments in nuclear physics and hinting that the Germans might be working on an atomic bomb, urging him to launch his own program. The letter is widely credited with setting in motion the Manhattan Project, the US government effort that built the first atomic bomb.

When Szilárd first explained the concept of a nuclear chain reaction to him, Einstein gave the famous reply, &quot;Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht!&quot; (&quot;I really never thought of that before&quot;).

<text>Deer Park is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Babylon, in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was listed as 28,837 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Deer Park is located in the pine barrens in the northeastern corner of the town of Babylon. It grew out of Jacob Conklin&#x27;s 1610 settlement of the Half Way Hollow Hills, later known as Wheatley Heights. Charles Wilson started what is now Deer Park in 1853 about eleven years after the Long Island Rail Road arrived in 1842-when he established a large and productive farm. A post office was opened in 1851, closed in 1872 and re-opened on July 1, 1873. Deer Park had an elementary school in 1874. Prior to 1923, the Deer Park School District took in Deer Park and Wyandanch.

Farming was a staple of this small town for most of its history. Known as the &quot;fruit basket&quot; of New York state, the area was also famed for its dahlia cultivation. It was not until the effects of the post-World War II boom reached Deer Park that its economy ceased to be agricultural.

Deer Park had two industries before 1940: the Walker and Conklin firm baked red bricks in West Deer Park (now Wheatley Heights), and the Golden Pickle Works (1902) prepared pickles in Deer Park. Deer Park was the locale of the Edgewood State Hospital (1938–1969)-originally a tuberculosis sanatorium, and later an Army hospital during World War II. The Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation established a factory in Deer Park in 1956.

In 1946, the former Deer Park Airport opened. It operated until 1974; the land was subsequently redeveloped.
Deer Park is reputed to have been the favorite summer spot of President John Quincy Adams, as his preferred vacation destination from 1835 until his death. However, this &quot;fact&quot; has never been verified.

On October 22, 2008, the $300 million Tanger Outlets at the Arches shopping mall opened.

<text>Dix Hills is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP), in the Town of Huntington, on Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 26,180 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Settlers traded goods with the Indigenous Secatogue tribe for the land that became Dix Hills in 1699. The Secatogues lived in the northern portion of the region during the later half of that century. The land was known as Dick&#x27;s Hills. By lore, the name traces to a local native named Dick Pechegan, likely of the Secatogues. Scholar William Wallace Tooker wrote that the addition of the English name &quot;Dick&quot; to the indigenous name &quot;Pechegan&quot; was a common practice.

Tooker wrote that Pechegan&#x27;s wigwam and his planted fields became the hilly area&#x27;s namesake, known as the shortened &quot;Dix Hills&quot; by 1911. The area was mostly used for farming until after World War II.

In the 1950s, Dix Hills and its neighbors Wheatley Heights and Melville, along with the area known as Sweet Hollow, proposed to incorporate as a single village. This village would have been known as the Incorporated Village of Half Hollow Hills, would have had an area of roughly , and would have embraced the Half Hollow Hills Central School District (CSD 5). The plans were unsuccessful, and these areas would remain unincorporated.

Proposals were revived around 2001, when Dix Hills, Melville, Wheatley Heights, and East Farmingdale (all within the school district) proposed incorporating as a single village. These plans also failed and each remains unincorporated hamlets to this day.

<text>East Islip is a hamlet and CDP in the Town of Islip, Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 13,931 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally referred to as &quot;East of Islip&quot;, the name was acquired in 1890 from the estate of William Nicoll, an English aristocrat who purchased the surrounding land in 1683 to erect a family residence. Nicoll&#x27;s purchase comprised from the Secatogue Indians, reaching as far as Bayport to the east, Babylon to the west and Ronkonkoma to the north. His mansion, Islip Grange, named after his family&#x27;s ancestral estate at Northampshire, England, stood near the shoreline of what is now Heckscher State Park.

East Islip, as well as many hamlets along Long Island&#x27;s south shore, was once an enclave for some of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest families. Its estates at one time included the Hollins, Gulden, and Knapp estates, among others. An original estate mansion, Brookwood Hall, has passed from its last private owners, the Thorne family (originally of Great Neck during the Dutch colonial era) and now serves as a municipal building for the Town of Islip. The Sullivan estate became the home of the Hewlett School, a private boarding school which closed shortly after the turn of the century. Some estate and early farmlands were donated to the Roman Catholic church and make up the current grounds of St Mary&#x27;s of East Islip, which includes a private elementary and middle school, in addition to church and other parish buildings. The original Westbrook farm on the boundary between East Islip and Oakdale, near the Bayard Cutting Arboretum, has ceased operations, and its fields are now the home of East Islip Soccer, near the fields set aside for the Little League of the Islips.

Today, modern East Islip is composed of much smaller, yet affluent communities and few estates. Many of these newer communities were built on the land that was once part of former estates that were sold off, most notably the estate of Percy G. Williams. The Moorings, an opulent waterfront guard-gated private community, is one of the hamlet&#x27;s premier neighborhoods. Other neighborhoods within the hamlet include Deer Run and Country Village as well as the Beecher Estates.

<text>East Marion is a census-designated place (CDP) that roughly corresponds to the hamlet by the same name in the town of Southold in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The CDP population was 926 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
The first inhabitants were the Orient Focus People, Native Americans who lived in the area about 1000 BC. They vanished long before the arrival in about 900 AD of the Corchaugs, who called the area Poquatuc. The Corchaugs were still present when six English families settled in 1661. The new residents called the area Oysterponds because of the abundant shellfish that they began to gather and sell to nearby communities. While farming remained the principal occupation, trading vessels began operating out of the sheltered harbor during the colonial period.

===The Revolution===
British troops landed in 1776 during the American Revolutionary War. Many families fled to Connecticut, and the Redcoats periodically plundered the farms they left behind. After Benedict Arnold switched sides, he organized raids on Connecticut from Oysterponds. The British returned during the War of 1812, setting up what turned out to be a porous blockade against American ships sailing to New York City. In 1814 Commodore Stephen Decatur anchored his American squadron off Trumans Beach but never engaged the British. After the war, renewed farming and fishing brought prosperity to Oysterponds. By 1840 more than 30 schooners were operating out of the harbor, carrying fish and produce.

===Turning point===
Orient and East Marion originally were called Oysterponds Lower Neck and Oysterponds Upper Neck, respectively. In 1836, the two communities went their separate ways with new names. Orient was chosen to reflect the area&#x27;s easternmost position on the North Fork of Long Island. East Marion was named for Gen. Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; of the Revolutionary War. &quot;East&quot; was tacked on because of an existing town of Marion upstate.

===Brushes with fame===
By 1870 the tip of the North Fork had become a resort. The Orient Point Inn, which opened in 1796, played host to President Grover Cleveland, poet Walt Whitman, orator Daniel Webster, actress Sarah Bernhardt and author James Fenimore Cooper, who wrote &quot;Sea Lions&quot;, set in Orient. (The inn closed in the 1960s and was demolished.) Meanwhile, members of one prominent Orient family did what they could to stave off public attention. They were the Tuthills, generally referred to in those less-sensitive days as the &quot;Tuthill Dwarfs&quot; or &quot;Tiny Tuthills&quot;. Three Tuthill sisters, Cynthia, Lucretia and Asenath, were midgets and accomplished seamstresses. In the mid-19th century, their brother Rufus built them a house with reduced dimensions; it still stands on Village Lane. Their diminutive and shy nephew, Addison, declined P. T. Barnum&#x27;s invitation to join his circus.

===Claims to fame===
Most people today know Orient for the ferries to New London and for Orient Beach State Park. Regularly scheduled ferry service to Connecticut began in the 1930s. The park was created when the community deeded the bulk of the beach peninsula to the state in 1929. East Marion is a sleepy country hamlet with myriad bays and inlets, wildlife preserves and miles of rolling farmlands. Currently the community contains a series of bed and breakfasts along NY 25 between Greenport and Orient Point.

==TWA Flight 800==

East Moriches became known internationally on July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 exploded off the coast and fell into the Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Coast Guard Station, East Moriches, was used by emergency responders, and was the site where the bodies were initially prepared for transport. A helipad was constructed at the station, and the media located their equipment and crews there for breaking news. Today there are parks in Smith Point and Center Moriches on Long Island, New York dedicated to those who died in the crash, and a plaque bearing their names. The cause of the explosion, which killed all 230 passengers and crew on board, was determined to be a short circuit which caused the contents of the centre-wing fuel tank to explode; however, many alternative theories exist.

<text>East Northport is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Huntington in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 20,217 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Founding===
Soon after the establishment of a village in the Huntington area, English settlers sought to further expand their territory. On July 30, 1656, land was purchased from Chief Asharoken, head of the Matinecocks Native American tribe, part of which consisted of the land that is today known as East Northport.

===Larkfield and Clay Pitts===
Two distinct communities formed in the area now known as East Northport. The more populous settlement known as Larkfield was located on the northern side, near Vernon Valley (now part of Northport). Larkfield originally developed near the location of Genola Cemetery, just north of the modern-day junction of Larkfield Road, Vernon Valley Road, and Laurel Road. A second community located on the southern side was known as Clay Pitts, named for its vast deposits of red clay. This clay which had been used by Native Americans to form pottery was used by the Europeans to form bricks for construction. The land between Larkfield and Clay Pitts was well suited for agriculture, and the region prospered in the late 18th century as a thriving farming community by supplying produce to markets in New York City and Brooklyn.

===East Northport===
In 1868 the Long Island Rail Road opened a station within the village of Northport. However, just a few years later the LIRR decided to move the Northport station to a new location in Larkfield to facilitate further railway extension to Port Jefferson. The new railway station located at Larkfield Road and Bellerose Avenue opened on January 13, 1873. Although the station retained the name of Northport, train conductors would refer to it as &quot;East of Northport&quot;, because the station was located east of the railway junction which used to direct trains north to the old station located in the village of Northport. Despite the fact that East Northport is primarily &quot;south&quot; of Northport, the area became known thereafter as East Northport. The Larkfield Post Office formally changed its name to East Northport in 1910. The East Northport, New York post office building was renamed the Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building in 1998.

===Suburban growth===
As Americans returned home from World War II, Long Island experienced a dramatic population shift from large cities to suburban areas. East Northport&#x27;s population soared as a housing boom transformed the rural farmland into modern suburbs. Today East Northport is the largest community in the town of Huntington, by land area, and third in population behind Huntington Station and Dix Hills.

===Crime===
On August 11, 1989, FBI Informant Robert Kubecka and his brother-in-law Donald Barstow were murdered inside their Brightside Avenue office by Lucchese Family soldiers Rocco Vitulli and Frank &quot;Frankie the Pearl&quot; Federico, on orders of Capo Salvatore Avellino, with the blessing of then-Lucchesse underboss Anthony &#x27;Gaspipe&#x27; Casso. Information provided by Kubecka had been used as part of the infamous Mafia Commission Trial in 1985–1986.

<doc id="127279" wikidata="Q3459226" url="?curid=127279" title="East Patchogue, New York">
<text>East Patchogue (, ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 21,580 at the time of the 2020 census. 

The CDP is a proximate representation of the East Patchogue hamlet used for statistical purposes of the United States Census Bureau.

== History ==
Patchogue has historically been a major shopping and commerce hub of Suffolk County. &quot;Patchogue&quot; in the narrow sense is an incorporated village with narrow limits, only about a mile and a half wide. East Patchogue includes the eastern portion of Patchogue in the wider sense, as well as the area east of that but still west of the incorporated village of Bellport. This double meaning of &quot;East Patchogue&quot; is reflected in the naming of New York State Route 27A: It is called &quot;East Main Street&quot; in the western portion of East Patchogue, and &quot;Montauk Highway&quot; (as it typically is outside of villages) in the eastern portion. The western side of East Patchogue is in the Patchogue-Medford School District, while the eastern side is in the South Country Central School District, and its high-school students attend Bellport High School.

The area around County Road 80 in the western portion of East Patchogue was once commonly regarded as the hamlet of Hagerman. In New York, a hamlet has no official boundaries or government and refers only to a named, settled area. With suburban growth, Hagerman is no longer distinct from its surroundings, and the name has fallen into disuse, especially since the removal of the Hagerman station on the Long Island Rail Road. There still exists the Hagerman fire district.

Prior to its closure, the East Patchogue post office was located at 1415 Montauk Highway.

The municipal bonds that were floated to reimburse the builder are being paid off by a special levy on the electric bills of residents of Long Island. In 2022, estimates calculated the debt had grown from just under $8 billion to over $9 billion – more than $8,000 per ratepayer.

<doc id="127282" wikidata="Q2411815" url="?curid=127282" title="Duke of Newcastle">
<text>Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne was a title that was created three times, once in the Peerage of England and twice in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first grant of the title was made in 1665 to William Cavendish, 1st Marquess of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was a prominent Royalist commander during the Civil War.

The related title of Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne was created once in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was conferred in 1756 on Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne (of the third creation), to provide a slightly more remote special remainder. The title became extinct in 1988, a year that saw the deaths of the distantly related ninth and tenth Dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyne.

== Creations ==

=== First creation (1665) ===

William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a son of Charles Cavendish, himself the third son of Sir William Cavendish and his wife Bess of Hardwick. One of Charles Cavendish&#x27;s elder brothers became the 1st Earl of Devonshire (see Duke of Devonshire for further history about this branch of the family).

The first duke, William Cavendish, was the son of Charles Cavendish and his second wife Catherine Ogle, 8th Baroness Ogle, daughter of Cuthbert Ogle, 7th Baron Ogle. William Cavendish became Viscount Mansfield in 1620, and in 1621, he was created Earl of Newcastle upon Tyne and Baron Cavendish of Bolsover. He succeeded his mother as ninth Baron Ogle in 1629, and he became Marquess of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1643. He was elevated to the dukedom of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1665. He also was granted the title of Earl of Ogle as a subsidiary title for the , to be used as a courtesy title by his heir apparent. Upon his death in 1676, he was succeeded by his son, the second Duke, who was a politician. However, the second Duke&#x27;s only son and heir apparent (Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle) predeceased him. Therefore, upon the second Duke&#x27;s death in 1691, all of these many titles became extinct, except the barony of Ogle, which fell into abeyance between the second duke&#x27;s four daughters (one of whom was Lady Elizabeth Cavendish).

=== Second creation (1694) ===

The second Duke&#x27;s third daughter, Lady Margaret Cavendish (1661-1717), married John Holles, 4th Earl of Clare, who was incidentally her first cousin, her mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son. In 1694, the dukedom was revived when he was created Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. The Holles family descended from John Holles, who was created Baron Haughton, of Haughton in Nottinghamshire, in 1616 and Earl of Clare in 1624. His second son was a politician, Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles. Lord Clare was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented East Retford, Nottinghamshire, in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. His son, the third Earl, was briefly MP for Nottinghamshire in 1660. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned fourth Earl of Clare, who married a daughter of the second Duke of Newcastle. In 1694, three years after the title became extinct, the Dukedom of Newcastle was revived and granted to the late Duke&#x27;s son-in-law. The new duke of Newcastle and his wife, Lady Margaret, had only one daughter and no sons. Therefore, on his death in 1711, all his titles became extinct.

=== Third creation (1715) and Newcastle-under-Lyne (1756) ===

The Duke&#x27;s sister, Lady Grace Holles (died 1700), married Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham (see Earl of Chichester for earlier history of the Pelham family). Their elder son Thomas, upon his uncle&#x27;s death in 1711, succeeded to the substantial Holles estates and assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname and arms of Holles. In 1714, the earldom of Clare was revived when he was created Viscount Haughton and Earl of Clare, with remainder to his younger brother Henry Pelham. The following year, the dukedom was revived when he was made Marquess of Clare and Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne, with like special remainder. These titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1756, when his brother died without male issue and it was evident that the Duke would have no children, the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne was additionally created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne with a different special remainder: to his nephew-by-marriage Henry Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln, who rapidly took on the additional surname Pelham. (For the history of this title from the 1768 inheritance upon the 1st Duke&#x27;s death, see Earl of Lincoln.) The 1st Duke&#x27;s other titles became extinct, except for the Pelham baronetcy (of Laughton) and the barony of Pelham (of Stanmer), which devolved to his first cousin once-removed, Thomas Pelham. (For the history of these titles, see Earl of Chichester.)

Extensive personal, transaction and estate papers of the dukes are held in the Portland (Welbeck) and Newcastle (Clumber) collections at the University of Nottingham&#x27;s Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections.

<text>Eastport is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York, on the South Shore of Long Island. The population was 1,831 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Eastport town is built on Shinnecock land. The present hamlet dates to 1772, when two men built the dam that formed what has come to be called the West Pond, which created a dividing line between Brookaven and Southampton. They built two mills below the dam, a saw mill and a gristmill. By 1845, the area to the east of the West Pond had come to be known as Waterville. The land to the west was called Seatuck, after a nearby creek. When, in 1860, the United States Postal Department needed to define the town to deliver mail, it combined the two areas. The name Seatuck was dropped for being too similar to Setauket, New York and the combined area was named Eastport.

Eastport was long and best known as the center of Long Island&#x27;s duck industry. The first duck farms were established in the area in the 1880s. In the first half of the 20th century it was the capital of the production of Long Island ducks, producing 6.5 million ducks a year from 29 farms going to market. By 1915, the Long Island Duck Growers&#x27; Association was located in Eastport; and, in 1949, Cornell University established the Duck Disease Research Laboratory there. Routine surveillance carried out by the Duck Disease Research Laboratory identified the first case of Duck hepatitis virus (DHV-1) in the United States 1949 and, in 1967, the first case of Duck plague on the American Continent.

Practically all duck farms have been phased out and the descendants of the original farmers sold the valuable waterfront property for residential development projects.

<text>Elwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 11,426 at the 2020 census.
The hamlet, given its location in the center of the Town of Huntington, is referred to as &quot;The Heart Of Huntington.&quot;

== History ==
The first settlers came to Elwood, NY in the mid to late 1800&#x27;s. Not much written history can be found from this time period, but there was a book published in 1874 about Suffolk County, New York. In that book, it states that &quot;Elwood was described as a one-and-a-half-mile area southeast of a section called Cuba.&quot;

There are revolution soldier Graves so it is believed that they&#x27;ve been here longer than mid 1800s.

There were large farmlands owned by a few farmers. Many people who were farmers came to Elwood to work, grow, and produce food, because of the level land and Long Island&#x27;s rich soil. Elwood may have gotten its name from an early settler named Elkanah Wood; however, this is only a theory. As the Elwood community started to grow, there were few students in the schools due to families deciding that farm life and chores came before education. The need for education became more apparent with families wanting their children to go to school. In 1894 a law in New York state was passed so that every child from 8-16 was required to attend school.

<doc id="127288" wikidata="Q5092358" url="?curid=127288" title="Cherry Grove, New York">
<text>Cherry Grove (often referred to locally as the Grove) is a hamlet in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is located on Fire Island, a barrier island separated from the southern side of Long Island by the Great South Bay. The hamlet has approximately 300 houses on , a summer seasonal population of 2,000 and a year-round population of 15.

Cherry Grove, along with nearby Fire Island Pines, is considered one of the most popular lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)–accepting resort communities in the United States.

==History==

===19th century===
Cherry Grove dates its modern history to the 1868 purchase by Archer and Elizabeth Perkinson. They bought the land between Lone Hill (now Fire Island Pines) and the Cherry Grove Hotel from the ocean to the bay for 25 cents per acre and named the area for the black-cherry trees in the area. The Perkinsons opened a hotel in 1880. According to local legend Oscar Wilde stayed at the Perkinson Hotel.

===20th century===
In 1921, the Perkinson family sold all the land east of Duryea Walk to Lone Hill, and then divided what was left into 109 building lots. A lot 50 × could be purchased for $250 or less, and ocean-front lots cost no more than a dollar a front foot. Buildings from the newly deactivated Camp Upton in Yaphank, were ported over to form the core of the new colony. A post office was established in 1922 at the site of where &quot;Tides&quot; (formerly &quot;The Monster&quot;) is today; the first boardwalks were built in 1929. In 1930, Duffy&#x27;s Hotel replaced the original hotel and was the only place with electricity and a phone.

The 1938 Long Island Express Hurricane destroyed much of Cherry Grove and discouraged mainlanders from coming. In their stead, the gay community that already frequented the island settled there moving from Ocean Beach, with figures such as Antoine de Paris and W. H. Auden leading the way.

In the 1950s, Cherry Grove was already known as a &quot;safe haven&quot; one of three that included Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Key West, where they &quot;could only fleetingly enjoy a carefree, 24-hour-a-day queer life by running off to a handful of destinations comfortably removed from a homophobic America.&quot; Only 60 miles from New York City, it was isolated because of its location off Long Island that required access by a ferry or, at the time, seaplane. The gay aura of the town supposedly arose when Christopher Isherwood and W. H. Auden arrived dressed as Dionysus and Ganymede, carried aloft on a gilded litter by a group of singing followers.

Truman Capote stayed at the Carrington House, just east of Cherry Grove, where in 1957, he completed his groundbreaking novella, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

The hamlet&#x27;s major hotel and lounge in the 1950s was Duffy&#x27;s, which burned on September 27, 1956, and was replaced by the Ice Palace Hotel. John Eberhardt, a developer who died in 2014, was credited for building the Belvedere Hotel and many other properties in the hamlet, from 1956 to the 1970s.

In early May 1959, James Baldwin visited Cherry Grove, staying in the Grove Hotel, where he wrote part of his intersectional
Novel, &quot;Another Country&quot;.

===21st century===
The Grove is home to three massive homes: Cielo E Mar (an aria from the 1876 opera &quot;La Gioconda&quot; which translates to &quot;Sky and Sea&quot;), the Belvedere, and Bottom of the Garden. While the Grove has its charms, several residents in 2005 expressed concerns about the lack of any services and population in the winter, the high cost of food and beverages, some &quot;disrespectful visitors who come to party ... &#x27;Day trippers&#x27;&quot; (especially on the 4th of July), over-regulation of zoning by the town of Brookhaven, and a large population of voracious deer who eat up both beach grass and private gardens. A new generation of entertainers and socialites call Cherry Grove their summer home, including Hedda Lettuce, Michael Musto, Panzi, and Wanda Sykes and her wife and children.

In 2013, the Cherry Grove Community House and Theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, one of only a few sites so far listed for their role in American LGBT history.

A &quot;pop-up&quot; urgent care center opened in 2014, which is part of Northwell Health; a golf cart for emergency medical services was also purchased for the Grove, for the new 24/7 paramedic services. Local residents &quot;raised about $90,000 from donors to hire locally based paramedics, which have responded to more than 30 calls since May as of mid-August and will remain staffed through the end of September, when bustling crowds thin out at the beach.&quot;

In the early morning hours of March 27, 2015, an epic fire of historic proportions &quot;destroyed&quot; the Grove Hotel, Holly House, and two residential homes nearby; 23 fire companies responded from Fire Island and the south shore of Long Island and three firefighters were injured. The fire &quot;engulfed&quot; the surrounding properties, but the fire departments were able to put out the blaze, in this, &quot;one of the most popular LGBTQ destinations.&quot; According to its social media accounts, the Ice Palace, a famous nightclub, &quot;had negligible damage&quot;, but was not destroyed along with the hotel. The hotel has since been rebuilt.

==Neighborhoods==
The entire community has a single seasonal post office, on Bayview Walk near the main dock, open from about May 1 to October 12, which is a popular place to congregate. Full services, such as money orders, are available at the Sayville, New York, post office, reachable from the ferry. The ZIP Code is 11782.

Despite the small size of the hamlet, at about 41 acres, the community is further divided into three or four neighborhoods, from west to east:
* The quiet, residential West End, also called Cheeey Grove Estates, where the few year-round residents live in about 100 houses marked by stone chimneys, runs across the island from West Walk to Holly Walk. This was formerly the home of artist Paul Cadmus. Originally, the area between East and West Walks was called Cherry Grove Estates.
* The central business district, or Town, from Holly Walk to Doctor&#x27;s Walk, and the beach to the bay, includes the Fire House, Community Center/Arts Project, The Ice Palace Resort, a clinic, and the public ferry dock, as well as a few cooperatives, bars, grocery store, gift shops, realtors, and restaurants. It is more densely settled than the rest of the hamlet. Several major structures in the center were &quot;destroyed&quot; by a large fire in March 2015, including the Grove Hotel (since rebuilt) and Holly House.
* The residential East End, from Doctor&#x27;s Walk to Ivy Walk, and south of Bayview Walk, consists exclusively of about 100 private homes, almost all of which are seasonal. The northeastern section of the East End, north of Bayview Walk, has a few private homes and the Belvedere Guest House for Men; some properties also have their own private docks. Once connected to Fire Island Pines, erosion and rising waters caused a collapse of the northeastern extension of Bayview Walk. Most of Bayview Walk was reconstructed in spring 2014.

Cherry Grove is accessible via two major walks (Bayview and Lewis), which are generally parallel to the beach, and sixteen minor walks (Ivy, Sumner, Maryland, Aeon, Gerard, Greene, Duryea, Doctors, Main, Ocean, Holly, Surf, Beach, Sea, East, and West), which are generally perpendicular to the beach. South Walk (not shown in the map at right) is parallel to the beach and extends between Surf and Beach Walks.

==Recreation and sites of interest==

The Community House, located near the intersection of Holly and Bayview Walks, provides a wide variety of public services to the Grove. Generally speaking, gay couples and activities are the norm. In 2013, the Cherry Grove Community House and Theatre was named to the National Register of Historic Places for &quot;the enormous role it played in shaping what gradually evolved into America&#x27;s First Gay and Lesbian Town.&quot;

===Outdoor activities===
The main outdoor attraction is the beach and the surrounding protected portions of the Fire Island National Seashore. Clothing-optional sunbathing is common at the beach. The hamlet&#x27;s easternmost dunes have been nicknamed the &quot;Meat Rack&quot;. The legal name of that area is the Carrington Tract, where Truman Capote famously completed &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

===Entertainment and dining===
There are at least six restaurants that operate within Cherry Grove, varying from pizza and breakfast to seafood and fine-dining. Also, there are at least four entertainment venues hosting plays, art shows, dancing, underwear parties, drag shows, and various community events.

As of 2005, there were five bars, but one closed during the Great Recession of the late 2000s.

===Civic activities===
Civic activities in the Grove include charity events and an Awards Night, during which votes are taken and titles bestowed upon residents and local businesses. The Arts Project of Cherry Grove hosts a flea market, drag shows, and a gala dinner and dance in late September.

There is a sense of civic virtue in The Grove; people volunteer at CGFD, the Cherry Grove Community Association, on environmental projects, and even painting the edges of the boardwalks.

===Annual events===
A big event on the Cherry Grove social calendar is the Fourth of July weekend &quot;Invasion of the Pines&quot;, which dates back to July 4, 1976, when a resident of the Grove showed up wearing drag in Fire Island Pines and was refused service. In the 1970s, the Pines was a more-conservative, more-heterosexual community than the Grove.

There are two annual drag show contests in Cherry Grove: the &quot;Homecoming Queen&quot; show over Memorial Day weekend, and the &quot;Miss Fire Island&quot; the longest running contest the weekend of, or after, Labor Day.
===Fauna and flora===
The ecosystem of Cherry Grove is primarily pine barrens; however, there are several microclines and ecological niches.

Deer are common and quite tame on Fire Island. As noted, some residents consider deer to be a nuisance, while others enjoy seeing wildlife close to their summer homes.

Raccoons, foxes, squirrels, and many species of birds can be seen throughout the summer.

Cherry Grove is named for the many wild cherry trees that bloom each June in the area.

==Transportation==

Cherry Grove is only accessible by water with most residents and visitors using a passenger ferry or private water taxi. A small marina is also available. There are no private vehicles in this part of Fire Island, although police and service vehicles are seen on the beach from time to time. The Grove has no paved roads and the cottages and beach are only accessible using a series of wooden boardwalks.

===Sayville Ferry===
Cherry Grove can be accessed via the Sayville Ferry Service departing from Sayville, New York, across the Great South Bay. The Long Island Rail Road connects Sayville to New York City.

Passengers connecting between the Sayville station and the Sayville Ferry service can pay for a shuttle van or taxi ride, or may walk or ride their bicycle the mile and a half distance. People driving cars may park in large, gravel parking lots across the street from the ferry dock.

===Fire Island Water Taxi===
Visitors arriving by car may park at the Robert Moses State Park &quot;Field Five&quot; parking lot. After reaching the Fire Island Lighthouse, the Fire Island Water Taxi will ferry paying customers to the Grove. A water taxi provides short-distance transportation for those moving from place to place along the coast of Fire Island. The fare and schedule for the taxi service varies by season.

==Emergency services==
===Fire department===

The Cherry Grove Fire Department (CGFD) is an all-volunteer department that has an Insurance Services Office (ISO) class 3 rating. Adjacent each of the community&#x27;s 18 fire hydrants are hose sheds containing firefighting hose, hydrant adapters, and appliances that would be needed by the members to suppress a fire; this is due to the unique nature of Cherry Grove. There are no roads, only 6-foot wide boardwalks that change with the island&#x27;s topography, and a typical fire engine would exceed the boardwalk&#x27;s weight rating. If a fire or emergency is spotted, one should call 911. A fire siren is activated, which along with pagers, alerts the members to respond.

CGFD is a Basic Life Support First Response (BLSFR) agency, and as such has New York state certified emergency medical technicians that operate in conjunction with Cherry Grove EMS and the Suffolk County Police Department&#x27;s marine bureau officers, to mitigate medical emergencies and patient transport. CGFD receives assistance from both neighboring Fire Island fire departments as well as mainland departments via ferry or fire boat (such as Sayville Fire Department) in case of large fires, as happened in March 2015 when a fire destroyed several commercial properties in the business district.

===Health care===

Northwell Health operates two urgent care facilities on Fire Island (one in Cherry Grove and the other in nearby Ocean Beach). These centers operate during the summer from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and are open for walk-in patient visits seven days a week from 9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 pm. If patients require medical treatment outside of those hours, the Immediate Care Center&#x27;s physician can be reached on call by contacting local police.

Good Samaritan Hospital, South Shore University Hospital, and Long Island Community Hospital are located across the Great South Bay from Fire Island in the Long Island hamlets of West Islip, Bay Shore, and East Patchogue, respectively. A heliport for medevac helicopter use is adjacent to Good Samaritan Hospital. Specially equipped boats provided by the Suffolk County Police Department Marine Bureau docked at the various communities on Fire Island provide emergency transportation to individuals in need of dire medical care. In many cases, Long Island based ambulances will meet the boats once they cross the Bay (roughly 4.5 miles) and then drive individuals the short distance to one of the three hospitals. Also, one emergency access road connects Long Island (West Islip) to Fire Island (Kismet). However, the road ends there and does not extend the full length of the island into the other communities.

<text>Fort Salonga is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Towns of Huntington and Smithtown in Suffolk County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 10,008 at the 2010 census.

The hamlet is considered the easternmost part of the historic Gold Coast of Long Island, with the Geissler Estate being located within the hamlet.

== History ==
One night during the Revolutionary War, Colonial forces landed on the beach in nearby Crab Meadow, and moving down the beach overtook the fort.

In the post-Civil War era the rich red clay deposits gave birth to a successful brickworks as well as other trade. Barges loaded with manure swept from the streets of New York City would arrive, and farmers from nearby towns would come to get the manure for fertilizer. The emptied barges were then loaded with bricks for the trip back to the city. One of the brick companies to operate there in the late 19th century was owned by the Brown family, whose bricks bore the initials BBB for Brown&#x27;s Best Bricks. The family home on the top of the hill on Breeze Hill Road has served as the clubhouse for the Indian Hills Country Club since 1963.

=== The hamlet&#x27;s name ===
The area was formerly known as Fresh Pond.

The name evolved from the Revolutionary War-era British Fort Salonga, or Fort Slongo, (named after one of the fort’s architects) once located near the border of the towns of Huntington and Smithtown, overlooking the Long Island Sound. 

Historically, Fort Salonga had its own post office. However, it closed sometime in the 1900s. Fort Solonga now shares the Northport 11768 zip code and is still recognized as acceptable mailing address alternative by the USA post office.

== Education ==
Historically, the Fort Salonga school district had its school, which consisted of a single schoolhouse. However, in 1926, like most school districts on Long Island, NY, it integrated itself into the neighboring school districts depending on what part of the hamlet it was in.

The portion of Fort Salonga located within the Town of Huntington is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Northport-East Northport Union Free School District, while the portion located within the Town of Smithtown is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Kings Park Central School District. As such, children who reside within Fort Salonga and attend public schools go to school in one of these two districts, depending on where they live within Fort Salonga.

The school district boundary within Fort Salonga overlaps with the town boundaries, following Bread and Cheese Hollow Road.

==Notable Residents==
Elijah Churchill (1755–1841) was a notable figure associated with Fort Salonga, New York. Born in Newington, Connecticut, he served as a sergeant in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Churchill distinguished himself in several engagements, notably leading an attack on Fort Slongo (now Fort Salonga) on October 3, 1781. For his valor in this and other actions, he became one of the first recipients of the Badge of Military Merit, the predecessor to the modern Purple Heart.

Booker T. Washington (1856–1915) was an influential African-American educator, author, and advisor to multiple U.S. presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt. He was the founding principal of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and a leading advocate for African-American economic self-sufficiency and education during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Washington maintained a residence in Fort Salonga, New York, where he spent time away from his duties at Tuskegee during the summer.

<text>Gilgo-Oak Beach-Captree, frequently just called Oak Beach, was a census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York within the Town of Babylon. The population was 333 at the 2000 census.

Following the 2010 census, the area was delineated as two CDPs: Gilgo and Oak Beach–Captree. The original CDP contained several small beach communities on a barrier island along the southern edge of Long Island. In order from west to east, these included West Gilgo Beach (on the Nassau/Suffolk county border), Gilgo Beach, Cedar Beach (no residences), Oak Beach (including the Oak Island Beach Association), Oak Island and Captree Island. They are connected to the mainland by Ocean Parkway from the west and Robert Moses State Parkway from the north.

Prior to the 2020 census, the Oak Beach-Captree CDP was further split into the Oak Beach and Captree CDPs.

==Geography==
Oak Beach is located at (40.641100, -73.278195).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of , of which was land and , or 25.21%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 333 people, 161 households, and 94 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 305 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.00% White, 0.30% African American and 2.70% Asian. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.80% of the population.

There were 161 households, out of which 14.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were married couples living together, 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.0% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.07 and the average family size was 2.64.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 13.5% under the age of 18, 1.5% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 21.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $66,250, and the median income for a family was $105,870. Males had a median income of $61,250 versus $37,083 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $55,813. None of the families and 0.9% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

The census numbers are presumably for full-time inhabitants; many of these houses are second homes and not primary residences, although the proportion of seasonal residents is decreasing.

The land for these communities is not privately owned, but leased from the State of New York through the year 2050. However, the residences on the property are owned. If the leases are not renewed at some point in the future, the owners will have to move the houses elsewhere, similar to what happened at High Hill Beach when Jones Beach was created.

<text>Gordon Heights is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 3,981 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Gordon Heights had its beginnings in the early 1920s, when developer Louis Fife went to Black neighborhoods in New York City (Harlem, Brooklyn, and The Bronx) with the offer of land and a better life on Long Island. Land was offered as low as $10 down and $10 monthly or $10 weekly.

Promoted as a place that would be a solid, close-knit community of small farms, the pilgrimage to Long Island began in 1927. Gordon Heights was named after &quot;Pop&quot; Gordon, a man who had previously owned most of the land that became part of the new community.

A civic association was formed to address the need of area residents. It would later become known as the Gordon Heights Progressive Association, which was founded in 1945. This group was the parent body of the Gordon Heights Fire Department.

<text>Great River is a suburban hamlet and CDP in the Town of Islip in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is situated approximately (55 mi driving) east of New York City on the South Shore of Long Island, adjoining the Great South Bay, protected from the Atlantic Ocean by Fire Island.

Great River&#x27;s name is a translation of &quot;&quot;Connetquot&quot;,&quot; an Algonquian word for &quot;Great River.&quot; Prior to the 1900s Great River was primarily home to wealthy families on mansion estates. The population was 2,005 at the time of the 2020 census.

Great River&#x27;s buildings include a New York City–style steak house in a turn of the century (20th) Public house, a delicatessen, a rural delivery post office and the Great River Fire Department.

==History==
For centuries, clusters of the Algonquin people known as the Montaukett Indian Nation occupied the territory known as Secatogue, now the town of Islip. They lived in clusters located at West Islip (Secatogue), Bay Shore (Penataquit), Great River, and Oakdale (Connetquot).

On November 29, 1683, William Nicoll (Nicolls), founder of the Town of Islip and son of New York City Mayor Matthias Nicoll, was awarded the first royal patent to the east end of what is now the Town of Islip. Nicoll purchased land from Sachem (Paramount chief) Winnequaheagh of Connetquot. He named his plantation (an tract of land) &quot;Islip Grange&quot;, in honor of his ancestral home of Islip (UK) in East Northamptonshire, England, from which Matthias emigrated in 1664. Nicoll&#x27;s domain extended from East Islip to Bayport and embraced the present-day communities of Sayville, West Sayville, Oakdale, Great River, Islip Terrace, Central Islip, Hauppauge, Holbrook, Bohemia, Brentwood, Holtsville, and a portion of Ronkonkoma. Nicoll paid an annual quit-rent (tax) to Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick and Governor of the Province of New York, of five bushels of good winter wheat or twenty-five (25) shillings payable annually on March 25.

Other early land patentees were Andrew Gibb (Islip hamlet), John Mowbray (Bay Shore, originally Awixa), Stephan Van Cortlandt (Sagtikos Manor), and Thomas Willets (West Islip).

William Nicholl also purchased five islands from Winnequaheagh on November 19, 1687, including Hollins Island (a.k.a. East Fire Island.) The purchase was confirmed on a patent by Governor Dongan on June 4, 1688. Altogether William Nicoll acquired four patents for land – the final purchase was on September 20, 1697, issued by Governor Benjamin Fletcher. Under Col. Fletcher, piracy was a leading economic development tool in New York City&#x27;s competition with the ports of Boston and Philadelphia. New York City had become a safe place for pirates (freebooters) who carried &quot;real money&quot; into the impoverished colony.

Nicoll&#x27;s estate eventually became the largest manor on Long Island.

By 1710, the colonial government passed an act to enable the precinct of Islip in the County of Suffolk to elect two assessors, a collector, a constable, and a supervisor. The people finally had a voice. Growth, however, remained at a standstill until the American Revolutionary War ended when in the seventeen (17) years that followed there was more progress than in the fifty (50) years preceding. This activity was partly due to the impact of American shipping.

Great River hamlet was formerly known as Youngsport. In the 1840s the Youngs family lived about one and a half miles south of Montauk Highway on Great River Road. Erastus Youngs and his family began building and repairing boats on the west shore of the Connetquot River near Great South Bay. With hardly anyone else around (21 houses), the place was called Youngsport for thirty years. Youngsport had one store and a freight station on the South Side Railroad of Long Island two miles north of it. The inhabitants were principally known as bay men. Alva Vanderbilt (later Alva Belmont), the Oakdale socialite suffragette, bought the Youngs&#x27; home and gave it to Trinity Lutheran Parish of Brooklyn, which used it as a summer camp called &quot;Seaside Camp&quot; for city children. Youngsport Village&#x27;s name was changed to Great River in either 1870 or 1881.

William Lawrence Breeze purchased &quot;Timber Point Farm&quot; from William Nicoll in 1883.

The Great River freight station was enhanced to a passenger station in the summer of 1897.

William Nicoll 7th (great-great-great grandson of the original William) served as School Commissioner of East Islip. He was the last owner of Islip Grange. He served as Warden of Emmanuel Church in Great River for 22 years, and ministered to the small cemetery there in which he is now buried. William 7th donated part of the land on which the present East Islip Junior High School now stands.

Heckscher State Park (), named for the industrialist August Heckscher, was part of Nicoll&#x27;s original estate and the location of the Nicoll Manor house. Heckscher Park&#x27;s land (Nicholls Neck) was once the location of the 19th-century estates of J. Neal Plumb (original location) and in 1886 George Campbell Taylor (). This should not be mistaken for the similarly named, fairly close but much smaller () national historic district of Heckscher Park in Huntington on the North Shore of Long Island.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.46%, is water. The Hamlet of Great River comprises 465 land parcels. Great River CDP and the GRFD responsibilities include Heckscher State Park although most references by New York State for mailing addresses are listed as East Islip.

This was a popular stop for Gilded Age wealthy businessmen traveling to South Side Sportsmen&#x27;s Club in Connetquot River State Park Preserve after the Club House Station closed in 1897.

Suffolk County Transit Bus routes also serve Great River.

Alternatively, Central Islip on the LIRR Ronkonkoma Branch is very close (seven miles to the north), with more frequent trains.

===Connetquot River===

Connetquot River (a.k.a. Great River) is a river particularly known for its brook, brown and rainbow trout fly fishing and Crab trapping from docks. The river flows into NYS&#x27; Nicoll Bay past Nicoll Island. Recognized by NY state as a Wild, Scenic and Recreational River Connetquot River is one of the four largest rivers on Long Island.

Connetquot River&#x27;s entire habitat represents the largest undeveloped contiguous area within Suffolk County that covers an entire river watershed. However, only the Estuary portion south of Sunrise Hwy NY Rte 27 is officially named Connetquot River although in popular usage both the brook and river share the same name.

Connetquot River within the confines of Great River has multiple locations for enjoying the water including public and private docks and launch sites. There are three public locations including one with a ramp for launching mid-size Boat trailered vessels plus another launch site in NYS&#x27; Heckscher Park. There are at least two private launch sites.

Great River Ramp (a.k.a. Memorial Park) allows public access to launch mid-sized vessels from trailers. The ramp park is easily recognized by the flag pole and a large memorial stone dedicated to armed forces deceased residents. Winter season adds a holiday tree and a menorah to the entrance. Adirondack chairs donated and installed by BSA Troop 205 are also outside the gate.

Great River Dock is a small park, at approximately 400 Great River Road, with open access to the river for fishing and crabbing. However, no boat launching is permitted at this location. Picking up or dropping people here is also prohibited. The park has stations for cutting bait and working on the crabs or fish. There are benches provided by NYS and the local BSA Troop 205 donated and installed picnic tables and Adirondack seating. This is a popular location for enjoying Great River Community events such as an annual holiday boat parade on Thanksgiving weekend with Fireworks by Grucci as well as Grucci fireworks at other times of the year largely sponsored by Oakdale restaurants. The park closes at dusk except for special events and is considered very safe.

A public small sandy beach section on the main land near Nicoll Island, sometimes erroneously titled Timber Point Park due to proximity to the golf course, is water level and especially good for launching kayaks and canoes. Motorized vessels are prohibited from launching here and the shallow and sandy bottom would likely cause a &quot;failure to launch.&quot; Great River Community Association usually sponsors an annual kayaking BBQ in the summer. Long Island schools also use it for practice of their crew teams. Nicoll Island has a stretch of clean white sand that can be reached by kayak.

===Emmanuel Episcopal Church===
Emanuel Episcopal Church, the &quot;Little Chapel&quot;, on Great River Road, became a reality in 1862 when Mr. and Mrs. William Nicoll deeded one-half acre of land. The bell in the chapel tower was inscribed with the words, &quot;Emmanuel Church, Islip, L.I., Thou shall open my lips, O&#x27;Lord and my mouth shall show thee praise&quot;.

Located at the site of the original chapel&#x27;s entrance is a stained glass window from France donated by the Plum family. Tiffany glass windows known as the Sarah Nicoll&#x27;s &quot;Crown of Heaven&quot; and the William Nicoll&#x27;s &quot;Jewel Cross&quot; were donated as a memorial by the Nicoll family. Other Tiffany windows were also presented to Emmanuel from 1903 to 1915.

Mr. &amp; Mrs. W. Bayard Cutting donated the funds to build and furnish the church rectory in 1889.

Emmanuel Church Cemetery is located directly behind the church. Some of those interred there are William Nicholl VII and the financier H. B. Hollins.

In 2012 Emmanuel Episcopal Church observed a year-long 150th anniversary celebration of its founding on November 16, 1862.

===Timber Point Country Club===
Timber Point Golf Course is a public 27-hole regulation length, full-service facility, located south of Montauk Highway in Great River. Positioned where the Connetquot River meets the Great South Bay.

Timber Point, was originally an 18-hole golf course designed by the architectural team of Colt &amp; Alison. The club was built and formed in the Roaring Twenties, along with other prominent estates that were constructed along the South Shore during that time. The original mansion now serves as the clubhouse and still overlooks the property, much the same way it did for club founders Horace Havermeyer, Buell Hollister and W. Kingsland Macy.

In 1925 Angel de la Torre, Spain&#x27;s first golf professional, agreed to travel to the United States to play in the U.S. Open. In that same year, upon the recommendations of Captain Allison (a premier architect whom he had met in England), he accepted the position of golf professional at the newly built Timber Point Country Club. At one time, Timber Point was in the top 100 courses in the United States.

Aside from being immensely difficult as approached from the back tees (6,825 yards, par 71, in 1925), Timber Point probably offered about as much terrain-oriented variety as one could imagine. Its front nine initially ventured near the bay, then proceeded back inland through a series of British heath-like holes, then across some Pine Valley-like sandy terrain. The inward half, which was largely constructed on reclaimed marshland, included several of the boldest holes of the course, including the 460-yard par-four eleventh (featuring three distinct driving areas), the 470-yard par-four fourteenth and the 205-yard into-the-wind fifteenth, modeled after Dr. Alister MacKenzie&#x27;s famous Gibraltar hole at Moortown Golf Club, England. The sixteenth and seventeen were true seaside holes, and the 510-yard eighteenth, one of the few holes routed with the prevailing breeze, offered the aggressive player a chance to close in style.

Timber Point exists in a heavily altered state since its present owner, Suffolk County, long ago turned it into a 27-hole (three courses of nine holes) facility. Were its original design still intact, it would surely rate very near the top of Long Island&#x27;s best courses. The course is open seven days a week (in season), opening March 15 and with the last day of golf as December 30.

The Suffolk County Parks Department of Recreation &amp; Conservation Golf Courses headquarters is located at Timber Point. Since the department&#x27;s relocation here, the course has had substantial improvements.

===Timber Point Marina===
Timber Point Marina is situated on the Great South Bay within the Timber Point Country Club, divided into two separate areas that provide a total of 153 slips, a fuel dock, sewage pump-out station, restrooms, electrical hookups and water. Transient slips are also available.

===Bayard-Cutting Arboretum===
Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park () was part of the former Bayard Cutting Estate. Originally comprising and 12 buildings, the estate of William Bayard Cutting (1850–1912) was donated as an arboretum to the State of New York by Cutting&#x27;s widow and daughter, Mrs. Olivia James.

Westbrook estate has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973 as a national historic district.

Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park consists of a notable large Tudor-style English country house called &quot;Westbrook&quot; and its surrounding landscaped gardens. The house was designed by architect Charles C. Haight in 1886 for William Bayard Cutting, who was an attorney, financier, real estate developer, sugar beet refiner and philanthropist. Located in the former Cutting residence are magnificent fireplaces, woodworkings, and stained glass windows.

An annex to the mansion was built in 1890 and contained a billiards room, a small organ, a gaming room and guest rooms.

Landscape design was done by Frederick Law Olmsted, popularly considered to be father of American landscape architecture. Olmsted was famous for co-designing many well known urban parks with his senior partner Calvert Vaux, including Central Park and Prospect Park in New York City.

Currently the manor house contains the administration office and a café.

=== Westbrook, Suffolk County, New York ===
Westbrook, a large rambling house of many gables and tall chimneys on the South Shore of Long Island, lies on the west bank of Connetquot River.

Westbrook was designed in 1886 for William Bayard Cutting (1850–1912) by the architect Charles C. Haight in the Tudor style. Scottish heather was shipped to provide thatch for the gate house, which remains at the corner of Montauk Highway and Great River Road. In 1895 Cutting and his brother Robert Fulton Cutting laid out a golf course at Westbrook, known to be the first private golf course in the United States.

===Heckscher State Park===
Heckscher State Park (), known as the &quot;Home of the White-tailed Deer&quot;, is on the shore of the Great South Bay. Islip&#x27;s founder, William Nicoll, originally built his Islip Grange estate on this property.

Heckscher Park was once the 19th century estate of J. Neal Plum and then George Campbell Taylor. The park was purchased by the State of New York using a donation by the affluent August Heckscher in 1929.

The park offers a beach, a boat launch, pavilions with picnic tables, a playground, playing fields, recreation programs, hiking, biking, fishing, and cross-country skiing. Unfortunately, a campground with tent and trailer sites, an olympic-sized swimming pool and a food concession are all closed due to NYS funding cuts (2015.)

The park is accessible by the Heckscher State Parkway (end of the Southern State Parkway) at the last exit, No. 46.

The Long Island Philharmonic plays a concert in the park every July.

Suffolk County Marathon To Support Our Veterans, initiated in 2015, starts and ends in Heckscher State Park during mid September. &quot;Taste of Long Island&quot; food festival begins in the park after the Marathon.

===Lorillard Estate and Racing Stable===
George L. Lorillard (March 26, 1843 – 1892) was an American, New York City tobacco tycoon and a prominent Thoroughbred racehorse owner. Lorillard owned a mansion on of Long Island, located north of Montauk Highway and west of Connetquot Road, that is now Bayard-Cutting Arboretum. He built a large stable and racing horse training track. Lorillard&#x27;s racing stable was handled by horse trainer R. Wyndham Walden. They won the Preakness Stakes a record five straight years between 1878 and 1882, the Belmont Stakes in 1878, 1880, and 1881 and the Travers Stakes in 1878 and 1880. Among George Lorillard&#x27;s best horses were Saunterer, Vanguard, Grenada, Tom Ochiltree, and Duke of Magenta. In 1878, Duke of Magenta won the Preakness Stakes, the Withers Stakes, the Belmont Stakes, and the Travers Stakes, a feat accomplished since by only two other colts: Man o&#x27; War and Native Dancer. Even 2015&#x27;s American Pharoah won the current American Triple Crown but finished a close second in a hard-fought Travers Stakes snapping a winning streak of eight races.

The United States Congress shut down on October 24, 1877, for a day so its members could attend &quot;The Great Race&quot; at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The event was a match race run by a trio of champions: Ten Broeck, Tom Ochiltree and Parole. Ten Broeck, the Kentucky champion, was owned by F. B. Harper. Tom Ochiltree, the Eastern champion and winner of the 1875 Preakness Stakes, was owned by George L. Lorillard. Parole, a gelding, was owned by Pierre Lorillard IV, George&#x27;s brother. Parole, with jockey William Barrett up, prevailed with a late run, crossing the finish line three lengths ahead of Ten Broeck and six ahead of Tom Ochiltree, which had helped to set the early pace with legendary jockey George Barbee in the irons. An estimated 20,000 people crowded into Pimlico to witness the event. The Great Race is depicted in a four-ton stone bas-relief — copied from a Currier &amp; Ives print and sculpted in stone by Bernard Zuckerman – hanging over the clubhouse entrance at Pimlico. It is long and high and is gilded in 24-karat gold leaf.

In 1884 George Lorillard sold much of his estate to William Bayard Cutting.

The Gardiner family was the first to make a name for themselves as pickle farmers in the region but a former enslaved man, Samuel Ballton, earned the moniker &quot;The Pickle King&quot; for becoming a prolific pickle farmer in Greenlawn in the early 1900s.

<text>Greenport is a village in New York&#x27;s Suffolk County, on the North Fork of Long Island. It is located within the Town of Southold and is the only incorporated community in the town. The population was 2,197 at the 2010 census.

Greenport was a major port for its area, having developed a strong fishing and whaling industry in the past, although currently there are only a handful of commercial fishing vessels operating out of the village. More recently the tourism industry has grown substantially.

==History==
Greenport was first settled in 1682 and incorporated in 1838. Greenport was once a whaling and ship building village, and since 1844, has been the eastern terminal station on the north fork for the Long Island Rail Road.

During Prohibition, rum running and speakeasies became a significant part of Greenport&#x27;s economy. Greenport&#x27;s residents knew the waters well and could outrun the coastguard. Restaurants on the east end, including Claudio&#x27;s in Greenport, served the illegal booze. Many of the village&#x27;s older structures are included in the Greenport Village Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

===Police department disbanded===

Village residents voted 617–339 in November 1994 to disband their nine-member police department. The department, which was established in 1947, was shut down after a grand jury investigation into a series of scandals. Since the shutdown, police services have been provided by the Southold Town Police Department. In 2005, trustees established a local chapter parapolice organization of volunteer vigilantes, Guardian Angels, to patrol the village.

The main building at 720 Front Street serves as a Junior–Senior High School and the back annex serves as an Elementary School and Kindergarten.

The Old Kindergarten Schoolhouse was Greenport&#x27;s first schoolhouse. It was located on the North Road. In 1832, a larger schoolhouse was built on Front Street and Greenport students transferred to the new location. In 1879, the first kindergarten was established and the old schoolhouse was moved from the North Road to 4th Avenue and South Street (now the location of the Greenport Fire Department). Greenport students attended kindergarten in the building until 1932.

In 2005, the Old Kindergarten Schoolhouse was moved to its present site on Front Street and with oversight by the Greenport Improvement Committee, was restored with matching funds from the Village of Greenport and New York State. The building is now the Village&#x27;s historic interpretive center and a venue for community meetings and events.

<text>Hampton Bays is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Southampton in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York. It is considered as part of the region of Long Island known as The Hamptons. The population was 13,603 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The hamlet was settled in 1740 as &quot;Good Ground&quot;, which became the main hamlet of eleven in the immediate area. The area where Main Street, also known as Montauk Highway, is located today, was the approximate area of the original hamlet.

There were ten other hamlets in the area. They were called Canoe Place, East Tiana, Newtown, Ponquogue, Rampasture, Red Creek, Squiretown, Southport, Springville, and West Tiana. Most of these hamlets were settled by one or two families and had their own school house. Many of the names from the former hamlets are still featured as local street names today.

As a result of the growth of the surrounding hamlets and villages in the Hamptons and increased tourism from New York City, the eleven hamlets, although generally called &quot;Good Ground&quot; collectively by the early part of the 20th century, amalgamated under the name &quot;Hampton Bays&quot; in 1922. The motive behind the name change was for the hamlet to benefit from the &quot;Hamptons&quot; trade that the community&#x27;s neighbors were experiencing.

In the early 1970s and the 2010s, portions of Hampton Bays unsuccessfully attempted to incorporate itself as the Incorporated Village of Hampton Bays.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 28.54%, is water. The hamlet is surrounded by three bays, the Peconic Bay to the north, and Shinnecock and Tiana bays to the south. The two southern bays are a part of a greater bay system, called the Great South Bay system, which stretches from approximately Southampton Village to Jamaica Bay in New York City. The Shinnecock Canal, a man-made canal located in the eastern part of the hamlet, connects the Great Peconic Bay with the Shinnecock Bay. Shinnecock Inlet, which leads from the Shinnecock Bay to the Atlantic Ocean, is the easternmost inlet, making it very popular for commercial fishing. The inlet itself, which separates the barrier beaches of Hampton Bays from those of neighboring Southampton, was created in the 1938 New England hurricane when the forces of the hurricane washed over that area of barrier beach, connecting the waters of the Atlantic with the bay.

The Hampton Bays CDP is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south; by the Shinnecock Inlet and the eastern portion of Shinnecock Bay to the east, beyond which lie the village of Southampton and the CDP of Shinnecock Hills; by Peconic Bay to the north, beyond which lie the towns of Southold and Riverhead; and by the CDPs of Flanders and East Quogue (still within the town of Southampton) to the west.

Hampton Bays is located approximately east of Manhattan.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
Like most of the other communities in The Hamptons, tourism is a critical component of the local economy.

Commercial fishing remains a vital part of the Hampton Bays economy, centered on the fishing station at Shinnecock Inlet. After Montauk, Hampton Bays is the second-busiest commercial fishing port in the state of New York. According to 2014 statistics by the National Marine Fisheries Service, 4.7 million pounds of finfish and shellfish, worth $5.5 million, were landed in the Hampton Bays/Shinnecock port.

Hampton Bays was used as the set of the 2007 movie &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot; starring Nicole Kidman and Jack Black.

== Education ==
Hampton Bays is served by Hampton Bays Public Schools. The district operates three schools. Hampton Bays Elementary School serves grades Pre-K-4, and Hampton Bays Middle School, which fully opened in Fall 2008, serves grades 5-8. It is the first &quot;green&quot; school in New York state. Hampton Bays High School serves grades 9-12.

HB Schools&#x27; athletic teams are called the &quot;Baymen&quot;, in honor of local commercial fishermen who work the hamlet&#x27;s inland waters. Team colors are purple, black and white.

== Media ==
WLIR-FM is a radio station licensed to serve Hampton Bays.

== Transportation ==

Hampton Bays is served by Sunrise Highway (NY 27), which is a major artery to the western parts of Long Island and New York City. The hamlet is also served by Montauk Highway (NY 27A), which runs from Queens to Montauk. Montauk Highway serves as the &quot;Main Street&quot; of many hamlets and villages along the south shore of Long Island.

The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) provides limited rail service seven days per week via the Montauk Branch connecting Hampton Bays to Montauk and New York City. Hampton Jitney and Hampton Luxury Liner coach bus services provide slightly more frequent passenger travel between New York City and Hampton Bays, especially during summer months. Local Suffolk County buses also provide service to neighboring areas.

The waterways in the area, including the Shinnecock Canal, provide invaluable routes for boats.

<text>Hauppauge ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the towns of Islip and Smithtown in western Suffolk County, New York, on Long Island. Its population in 2022 was estimated at 20,401 by the U.S. Census Bureau. Despite the official seat of Suffolk County being Riverhead, situated further east, many of the county&#x27;s government offices are located in Hauppauge. 

==Geography==

Hauppauge is located at (40.818205, −73.206878). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.37%, is water. The name is derived from the Native American word for &quot;sweet waters.&quot; Local Native American tribes would get their fresh drinking water from this area, instead of near Lake Ronkonkoma where the water was not potable. Hauppauge is known for the underground water springs and high underground water table.

Hauppauge now has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and the hardiness zone is now 7b. 

==History==
The first house in greater Hauppauge, according to historian Simeon Wood, dates as far back as 1731, located on what would be the Arbuckle Estate, and later the southeast corner of the Hauppauge Industrial Park, near the intersection of Motor Parkway and Old Willets Path. The settlement of Hauppauge proper commenced with the family of Thomas Wheeler prior to 1753, at the present-day location of the BP gas station between Townline and Wheeler Road. The locale would take the Wheelers&#x27; name as its own until the 1860s when the name Hauppauge was restored. On March 13, 1806, &quot;a meeting of the male members of the Methodist Society of the &#x27;Haupogues&#x27; was convened at the School House agreeable to public notice for the express purpose of Incorporating and Electing Trustees for said Society.&quot; The first trustees elected at the meeting presided by Timothy Wheeler and Issac Wheeler were Issac Nichols, Elkanah Wheeler, George Wheeler, and Samuel Brush. They were known as the &quot;Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Congregation of the Haupogues&quot;. In 1812, the Hauppauge Methodist Church that stands today was constructed on land donated by the Wheeler family.

Hauppauge gained significance as a waypoint on the King&#x27;s Highway, laid out by the colonial legislature of New York in 1702. The present-day right of way departs westward from Route 111 as Conklin&#x27;s Road or Half Mile Road, passing St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church before terminating at the border between Smithtown and Islip. Hauppauge was effectively split between the towns of Smithtown and Islip in 1798 with the survey of New Highway, or what is now known as Townline Road (County Route 76).

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census estimates, there were 20,401 residents, including 6,830 households and 5,246 families, living in the CDP. The population density was . There were 7,384 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 81.5% White, 8.0% Asian, 1.3% African American, 0.0% Native American or Pacific Islander, 2.8% from other races, and 6.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.5% of the population.

There were 6,830 households, out of which 28.3% had children under the age of 18 living within (a decrease of 8.5 percentage points from the 2010 census), 61.7% were married couples living together, 18.1% had a female householder with no husband present, with an average of 2.90 people per household. 5.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average family size was 3.39 people.

The median age was 51.3 years, an increase of 10.2 years from the 2010 census. For every 100 females, there were 100.01 males. An estimated 94.7% of the CDP&#x27;s population holds a high school diploma or higher.

According to the 2020 census, the median income for a household in the CDP was $120,442, and the mean income was $144,898. On average, people paid a median of $26,868 in annual housing costs. About 4.4% of the population were below the individual poverty line, including 2.9% of families and 8.3% of nonfamily households.

==Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge==
The Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge (formerly the Hauppauge Industrial Park), located at the edge of the hamlet, is the largest on Long Island, and by some accounts the second-largest industrial park in the United States. It is also reported to be the largest of its kind in the United States that is fully protected by an all volunteer fire department, the Hauppauge Fire Department. The park had more than 1,000 companies as of 2017 and employs over 55,000 people. The companies in the industrial park provide tax revenue to the Hauppauge school district&#x27;s budget. The current site of the Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge housed a radio communication facility operated first by Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company in 1936 (and owned by Clarence Mackay) and later by the ITT Corporation. The radio facility, which specialized in transmissions to and from Europe, South America, and ships at sea, closed in 1986 but is memorialized on-site by Wireless Blvd.

==Economy==
Royal Apparel&#x27;s headquarters have been located in Hauppauge since 1992, producing American-made apparel here, in addition to several other U.S. East Coast locations. In May 2000, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill opened an office in Hauppauge. The office is located on the second floor of the 1300 Veterans Memorial Highway building. Carl Galioto, the head of the company&#x27;s technical division, stated that it opened the office because it had difficulty hiring New York City-area recruits. The location was established to attract professionals who would have otherwise been required to commute. Voxx International, a consumer electronics company, and Dime Community Bank are also headquartered here.

<doc id="127304" wikidata="Q3459180" url="?curid=127304" title="Holbrook, New York">
<text>Holbrook is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) within the Towns of Brookhaven and Islip, in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 26,487 at the time of the 2020 census. The community borders the eastern side of Long Island MacArthur Airport.

==History==
Holbrook is believed to have derived its name from a stream which was called, in various narratives, either &quot;Old Brook&quot; or &quot;Hollow Brook.&quot;

The area was part of the 51,000 acre Islip Grange estate, acquired in 1697 by William Nicoll (son of Matthias Nicoll, who was the sixth mayor of New York City). It was largely a rural area until Alexander McCotter acquired 5,000 acres in the area in 1848 (after the Long Island Rail Road reached it in 1844) and platted the community. The oldest still standing building from this period is St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church, which was built in 1863. In 1875, the Nevins and Griswold cigar factory operated at the original LIRR station.

<text>Holtsville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 19,714 at the 2010 census.

The hamlet is mainly in the Town of Brookhaven, while the southwestern portion is in the Town of Islip. An IRS Processing Center is located in Holtsville, along with NYPA&#x27;s Richard M. Flynn Power Plant.

==History==
The hamlet known today as Holtsville included only a few farmhouses in the late 18th century. In 1843, the Long Island Rail Road opened its Waverly station. Maps from that period label the area as &quot;Waverly&quot;, and a stagecoach line ran north–south along present day Waverly Avenue. As another post office named Waverly already existed in New York, the name of the hamlet was changed to Holtsville in 1860, in honor of U.S. Postmaster General Joseph Holt. As of 1874, Holtsville consisted of 15 houses, a school, and a general store. The train station retained the name &quot;Waverly&quot; for some time, but was eventually also changed to Holtsville, probably in the 1890s, after farmers complained about their shipments going upstate by mistake. In 1916, the Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium opened on land that was considered Holtsville at the time, but is now part of the hamlet of Selden. The site later became the location of the main campus of Suffolk County Community College.

The Internal Revenue Service opened a large processing center on a site in the hamlet in 1972.

The rail era in Holtsville ended in 1998, when a number of LIRR stations closed due to low ridership. Holtsville commuters were advised to use Medford and Ronkonkoma stations; more use Ronkonkoma because, except for a few peak-hour trains terminating in Mineola or Hicksville, boarding at Medford would require transfer to an electric train at Ronkonkoma anyway.

As of 2016, the Internal Revenue Service in Holtsville has the lowest ZIP Code (00501) in use in the United States.

<doc id="127308" wikidata="Q3452395" url="?curid=127308" title="Islandia, New York">
<text>Islandia is a village in the northern part of the Town of Islip in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 3,567 at the time of the 2020 census.
==History==
Islandia incorporated itself as a village in April 1985 after CA Technologies established its world headquarters in Hauppauge and trying to capture the Hauppauge School District, in the area some people informally referred to as South Hauppauge. After more than three years of conducting local research, residents appeared in front of Islip&#x27;s officials to take the first steps in incorporating Islandia on September 16, 1980. At the meeting, locals presented the Town of Islip was a petition signed by 432 Islandia Residents, which was over the 180 minimum required, and also presented the $1,000 (1980 USD) filing fee required. Many officials in the Town of Islip, including Town Supervisor Michael LoGrande, were less than thrilled with the proposal, and Islip soon sued the organizers of the prospective village in an attempt to prevent Islandia&#x27;s incorporation. It wasn&#x27;t until December 1984 that the Town of Islip dropped their opposition and asked residents in return for at least 200 residents to sign a letter to promise that the community would not exclude minorities from living within its borders. An incorporation vote was soon held, during which residents ultimately voted in favor of incorporating, and in April 1985, Islandia officially became an incorporated village. Its founding father was Warren Raymond.

When it incorporated, Islandia became the first new village on Long Island to incorporate in over 15 years (the last village incorporated prior to Islandia was Lake Grove in 1968).

The core of Islandia is a 500-home housing development built by Levitt &amp; Sons circa 1963, which offered seven different model homes to choose from. The original Levitt home buyers were informed during pre-construction sales that their children should attend the Hauppauge Union Free School District, but instead it became part of the Central Islip Union Free School District. The Levitt development was assigned the Central Islip ZIP code 11722 and was considered part of Central Islip until the incorporation of Islandia in 1985.

In August 2016, the village board approved plans for a new casino to be opened at the Marriott hotel. These plans attracted opposition from some members of the community citing possible crime and traffic problems, while others supported the first new casino to be opened in Suffolk County. Marriott International sold the property to Delaware North for $40.41 million because Marriott has a corporate policy against gambling. On February 27, 2017, Jake&#x27;s 58 casino opened with 250 video lottery terminals.

==Geography==

<text>Jamesport is a village in Riverhead, Suffolk County, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. At the 2020 U.S. Census its population was 1,609.
Jamesport consists of a downtown area and surrounding farms.

Hallock State Park Preserve (previously &quot;Jamesport State Park&quot;) is located north of Jamesport in the adjacent village of Northville.

== Geography ==
The United States Census Bureau has estimated that Jamesport has a total area of , of which just under is land and , or 0.60%, is water.

== History ==
Jamesport was first settled in the 1690s and was originally called &quot;Aquebogue.&quot; It was renamed &quot;Lower Aquebogue&quot; when another hamlet called &quot;Upper Aquebogue&quot; was established to the west. The Jamesport Meeting House, built in 1731, is the oldest operating church building in Suffolk County

&quot;Jamesport&quot; is named for James Tuthill, who settled with his family in the area south of Lower Aquebogue, on the Peconic Bay, in 1833. Over time, Lower Aquebogue came to be called Jamesport, while the community to the south, previously called Jamesport, came to be called South Jamesport (and is included in the present-day Jamesport CDP). Upper Aquebogue became Aquebogue.

James Tuthill tried to establish a commercial whaling and shipping wharf on the Peconic Bay, in what is now South Jamesport . But the effort was unsuccessful, because the water in the Bay at low tide was too shallow to accommodate ships. However, the Long Island Rail Road established service between Jamesport and New York City, after which Jamesport became a popular resort area, with several large bayfront hotels. These included the Miamogue Hotel and the Great Peconic Bay House, which operated until 1952. Jamesport also became a thriving fishing community, and was a center for scallop and bunker (menhaden) fisheries.

From the 1830s to about 1950, Jamesport was the site of a camp meeting grove operated by the Methodist Episcopal Church, and after 1904, of an Epworth League Fresh Air Camp.

During the 1960s, the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) designated land adjacent to the Long Island Sound near Northville for use as the proposed Jamesport Nuclear Power Plant, in addition to its Shoreham plant, which was already under construction. However, the Jamesport plan was scrapped when LILCO ran into opposition to Shoreham in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Demographics ==

As of the 2020 census, there were 1,609 people, 469 households, and 1,126 housing units in Jamesport. The population density was 216.0 per square mile. The ethnic makeup of the CDP was 88.6% White, 11% Hispanic or Latino (of any ethnicity), 1.5% African American, 0.4% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.43% “other ethnicities”, and 0.48% people of two or more ethnicities.

Of the 469 households, 56.7% were married couples living together, 29.4% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 3.2% had a male householder with no spouse present.

Minors made up 10.2% of the population, and 9.9% of the population were living below the poverty line.

<doc id="127312" wikidata="Q242640" url="?curid=127312" title="Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne">
<text>Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (; 1623 [her exact birth date is unknown] – 16 December 1673) was an English philosopher, poet, scientist, fiction writer, and playwright. She was a prolific writer, publishing over 12 original texts under her name at a time when women were largely removed from publishing. As a well-connected natural philosopher, Cavendish engaged with some of the most influential minds of her time, including René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, and Henry More.

==Background==
Born Margaret Lucas to Sir Thomas Lucas (1573–1625) and Elizabeth Leighton (died 1647), she was the youngest child of the family. She had four sisters and three brothers, the royalists Sir John Lucas, Sir Thomas Lucas and Sir Charles Lucas, who owned the manor of St John&#x27;s Abbey, Colchester. As a teenager, she became an attendant on Queen Henrietta Maria and traveled with her into exile in France, living for a time at the court of the young King Louis XIV. She became the second wife of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1645.

Her husband, then-marquess William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a Royalist commander in Northern England during the First English Civil War and in 1644 went into self-imposed exile in France. Margaret accompanied him and remained abroad until the Stuart Restoration in 1660.

==Writings==
Cavendish, as a poet, philosopher, writer of prose romances, essayist, and playwright, published under her own name at a time when most women writers remained anonymous. Her topics included gender, power, manners, scientific method, and philosophy. Her utopian romance &quot;The Blazing World&quot; is one of the earliest examples of science fiction. She was unusual in her time for publishing extensively in natural philosophy and early modern science, producing over a dozen original works; with her revised works the total came to 21. She often would have her portrait engraved on the covers of her different works so that people would know that she was solely responsible for the creation of whatever she wrote and then published in some way or another.

Cavendish has been championed and criticised as a unique, ground-breaking woman writer. She rejected the Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy of the 17th century, preferring a vitalist model. In May 1667, she became the first woman to attend a meeting at the Royal Society of London, criticising and engaging with members and philosophers such as Robert Boyle. She has been claimed as an early opponent of animal testing.

Cavendish&#x27;s publications brought her fame and helped to disprove the contemporary belief that women were inherently inferior to men. Cavendish used them to advocate women&#x27;s education: women were capable of learning and benefiting from education, and she insisted her own works would have been better still if, like her brothers, she had been able to attend school.

==Early years==
===Childhood===

Cavendish&#x27;s father, Thomas Lucas, was exiled after a duel that led to the death of &quot;one Mr. Brooks&quot;, but pardoned by King James. He returned to England in 1603. As the youngest of eight, Cavendish recorded spending a lot of time with her siblings. She had no formal education but had access to libraries and tutors, although she hinted that the children paid little heed to tutors, who were &quot;rather for formality than benefit&quot;. Cavendish began putting ideas down on paper at an early age, although it was poorly accepted for women to display such intelligence at the time and she kept her efforts in the privacy of her home. The family had significant means and Cavendish stated that her widowed mother chose to keep her family in a condition &quot;not much lower&quot; than when her father was alive; the children had access to &quot;honest pleasures and harmless delights&quot;. Her mother had little to no male help.

===Lady-in-waiting===
When Queen Henrietta Maria was in Oxford, Cavendish never gained permission from her mother to become a lady-in-waiting. She accompanied the Queen into exile in France, away from her family for the first time. She notes that while she was confident in her siblings&#x27; company, she became bashful amongst strangers. She was fearful she might speak or act inappropriately without her siblings&#x27; guidance, and with this, she carried anxiety about being well-received and well-liked. Due to this, she spoke only when necessary and so came to be regarded as a fool, which Cavendish stated that she preferred to being seen as wanton or rude.

Regretting that she had left home to be a lady-in-waiting, Cavendish informed her mother that she wanted to leave the court, but her mother persuaded her not to disgrace herself by leaving and provided her with funds that Cavendish noted quite exceeded the normal means of a courtier. She remained a lady-in-waiting for two more years before marrying William Cavendish in 1645, then still Marquess of Newcastle.

===Marriage to the Marquess===
Cavendish noted that her husband liked her bashfulness; he was the only man she was ever in love with, not for his title, wealth, or power, but for merit, justice, gratitude, duty, and fidelity. She saw these as attributes that held people together even in misfortune, and in their case helped them to endure suffering for their political allegiance. Cavendish had no children, despite efforts by her physician to help her conceive. Her husband had five surviving children from a previous marriage, two of whom, Jane and Elizabeth, wrote a comic play, &quot;The Concealed Fancies&quot;.

Cavendish later wrote a biography of her husband: &quot;The Life of the Thrice Noble, High and Puissant Prince William Cavendish.&quot; In her dedication, Cavendish recalls a time when rumours surrounded the authorship of her works: that her husband wrote them. Cavendish notes that her husband defended her from these but admits to a creative relationship, even as her writing tutor, for writing &quot;fashions an image of a husband and wife who rely on each other in the public realm of print.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Health===
Cavendish stated in &quot;A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding, and Life&quot; that her bashful nature, which she described as &quot;melancholia&quot;, made her &quot;repent my going from home to see the World abroad.&quot; It manifested itself in reluctance to discuss her work in public, but this she satirised in her writing. Cavendish defined and sought self-cures for the physical manifestations of her melancholia, which included &quot;chill paleness&quot;, inability to speak, and erratic gestures. 

===Religious beliefs===
Cavendish&#x27;s views on God and religion remained ambiguous. Her writings show her as a Christian, but she did not often address the matter. In her Physical Opinions, she explicitly stated her belief in the existence of God – &quot;Pray account me not an Atheist, but believe as I do in God Almighty,&quot; – but sought to split philosophy from theology and so avoid debating God&#x27;s actions in many of her philosophical works.

Her theological temerity was unusual at a time when much of women&#x27;s writing was built around religion. Although Cavendish acknowledged God&#x27;s existence, she held &quot;that natural reason cannot perceive or have an idea of an immaterial being.&quot; So &quot;when we name God, we name an Inexpressible, and Incomprehensible Being.&quot; Still, she believed that all parts of nature have an innate knowledge of God&#x27;s existence. Even inanimate matter, she argues, &quot;also have an interior, fixt and innate knowledge of the existency of God, as, that he is to be adored and worshipped. And thus the inanimate part may, after its own manner, worship and adore God.&quot;

===Fashion and fame===

Cavendish, in her memoir, explained her enjoyment in reinventing herself through fashion. She said she aimed at uniqueness in dress, thoughts, and behaviour and disliked wearing the same fashions as other women. She also made her desire for fame public. Several passages remark on her virtuous character: while acknowledging the goodness in others, she thought it acceptable to hope to better them and even achieve everlasting fame.

She expected to be criticized for deciding to write a memoir but retorted that it was written for herself, not for delight, to give later generations a true account of her lineage and life. She noted that others, such as Caesar and Ovid, had done the same.

===Financial problems===
A few years after her marriage, she and her husband&#x27;s brother, Sir Charles Cavendish, returned to England. Cavendish had heard that her husband&#x27;s estate, sequestrated due to his being a royalist delinquent, would be sold and that she as his wife could hope to benefit from the sale. In the event, she received no benefit. She noted that while many women petitioned for funds, she herself only did so once and, being denied, decided such efforts were not worth the trouble. After a year and a half, she left England to be with her husband again.

===Death===
She died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 January 1674. Her husband arranged for a monument, by the sculptor Grinling Gibbons, to be erected in the north transept of the abbey. The epitaph reads: &quot;Her name was Margaret Lucas youngest daughter of Lord Lucas, earl of Colchester, a noble family, for all the brothers were valiant, and all the sisters virtuous.&quot; &quot;All the Brothers Were Valiant&quot; became the title of a novel and number of film adaptations in the early 20th century.

==Major works==
===&quot;Poems and Fancies&quot; (1653)===
&quot;Poems and Fancies&quot; encompasses poems, epistles and some prose on topics that include natural philosophy, atoms, nature personified, macro/microcosms, other worlds, death, battle, hunting, love, honour, and fame. Her poems, at times, take a dialogue form between such pairs as earth and darkness, an oak and a tree-cutter, melancholy and mirth, and peace and war. As noted by Mistress Toppe, formerly Elizabeth Chaplain and Cavendish&#x27;s maid, Cavendish&#x27;s writings took the form of poetical fiction, moral instruction, philosophical opinion, dialogue, discourses and poetical romances. &quot;Poems and Fancies&quot; included &quot;The Animal Parliament&quot;, a prose piece consisting largely of speeches and letters. The collection concludes with her thoughts on her writing and an advertisement for one of her future publications.

====Authorial intent====
Cavendish concluded the collection by stating she was aware that she did not write elegantly and that her phrasing and placement of words could be criticised. She said she had difficulty creating rhymes that could communicate her intended meaning. In short, Cavendish stated that she strove for meaning at the expense of elegance, her aim being to communicate ideas. She also noted that she expected her work to be criticised for not being useful, but she wrote not to instruct her readers in the arts, sciences, or divinity, but to pass her time, asserting that she made better use of her time than many others. Cavendish returned to these points in her epistles and poems.

====Epistle dedicatory====
Cavendish, like authors such as Aphra Behn and William Wordsworth, stated her intended audience, writing purpose and philosophy in prefaces, prologues, epilogues, and epistles. Her several epistle dedications for &quot;Poems and Fancies&quot; often sought to justify writing at a time when women writers were not encouraged in terms of subject choice. She instructed readers on how to read and respond to her poetry, most often by inviting praise from supporters and requesting silence from those unaffected by her work. Cavendish commonly used the epistles to admit and excuse potential weaknesses in her writing. They were directed at specific audiences and varied accordingly.

====Poetry as Spinning====
Looking at several of the epistles in &quot;Poems and Fancies&quot;, her dedication to Sir Charles Cavendish, her brother-in-law, compares writing poetry to spinning and calls poetry mental spinning – it was commonly thought to be more appropriate for women to spin than to write, but she herself was better at writing. This is one of several occasions when Cavendish calls attention to stereotypical gender roles and expands on her reasons for not following them. Here, Cavendish often employed metaphors to describe her writing in terms of stereotypical feminine tasks or interests, such as spinning, fashion, and motherhood. While criticising her own work, she said it would seem better if Sir Charles Cavendish looked favourably on it. Cavendish often appealed to readers for applause: if it were well received, it would be somewhat improved. She ends by complimenting Charles&#x27;s charity and generosity.

====The pursuit of fame====
In her epistle to noble and worthy ladies and in many others, Cavendish plainly expresses her desire for fame. She was not concerned that the best people should like her writing, as long as many people did. She justified this by linking fame to noise and noise to great numbers of people. Cavendish often assumed a defensive position, here justified by asserting that she expected critiques from males and females not only of her writing, but of her practice of writing itself. Cavendish argued that women who busy themselves writing will not act ineptly or gossip. Though she expected criticism from females, she called for female support in gaining honour and reputation. She ends by stating that if she fails, she will see herself as martyred for the cause of women.

====Defence of writing and fame====
In her epistle to Mistress Toppe, Cavendish states a desire for fame as her main reason for writing. Again, she asks for acceptance of her writing as a digression from accepted gender norms. While she often brings in metaphors of domestic or stereotypical feminine activities, here, she tries to excuse her desire for fame by distancing her ambition from what is feminine: her ambition is a quest for glory, perfection, and praise, which she states is not effeminate. Even while writing and pursuing fame, she remained modest and honourable and did nothing to dishonour her family. Cavendish attributed her confidence, as a type of censor, to her belief that there is no evil, only innocence in her desire for fame. As to her writing without permission, Cavendish excuses herself by stating it is easier to get a pardon after the fact than to obtain leave beforehand. She places writing over gossip, as a common and negative female activity. She credits her books as tangible examples of her contemplation and contrasts her self-proclaimed harmless ideas with wild ideas that might lead to indiscreet actions.

Cavendish explored writing closet dramas in her exile. She became one of the best-known women playwrights through her interest in philosophical nature.
This epistle is followed by a response from Mistress Toppe, praising Cavendish and her skill in poetical fiction, moral instruction, philosophical opinion, dialogue, discourses, and poetical romances.

====Language, knowledge and error====
Cavendish included a prefatory letter to natural philosophers. She knew no language but English, and even her English was somewhat limited since she was familiar only with &quot;that which is most usually spoke.&quot; In other words, she downplayed her knowledge of the technical vocabulary used by natural philosophers and, thereby, her knowledge of opinions and discourses that preceded her own. She then dismissed errors she might make as trivial, asserting that she did not mean her text to be taken as truth. She wrote simply to pass the time and expected her work to be read for the same end. This epistle also explained her writing in verse: poets were thought to write fiction and that fiction was aligned with pastime, not truth. So verse might be expected to contain errors. Cavendish lamented that her work was not more entertaining and advised readers to skip any part they did not like.

====Writing to pass the time====
Her epistle states that with no children and, at that time, no estate, she has a lot of spare time, which she fills by writing, not housekeeping. Food husbandry in poetry was well-ordered fancy composed of fine language, proper phrases, and significant words. Cavendish excused errors that might be found in her work as due to youth and inexperience, for she wrote only to distract herself from hardships of her husband&#x27;s and her own. Comparing her book to a child, she said that it was innocent, young, well-behaved, bashful, and sensitive. Readers should blame her, not the book, if they did not like it. If, however, the book was well-liked, she made it clear that she expected fame.

====Instruction on comprehension and judgement====
In her epistle to the poets, Cavendish notes that as women seldom wrote, her writing may be ridiculed, as the strange and unusual seem fantastical, the fantastical seems odd, and the odd seems ridiculous. She requests that her work be judged by reason, not prejudice. She then excuses weaknesses in her poetry by stating that she writes only to escape melancholy thoughts and fill idle time. She employs a food/feasting metaphor: her poems are not ripe, but applause and praise will make them pass as a &quot;general feast&quot; to those of vulgar taste who take quantity over quality. As was typical in her writing, applause is welcomed and criticism censored, as she advises those who dislike her poetry to keep silent. Hers are poems of fancy and so require study. She recommends that as one with a troubled conscience ought to look to a minister for guidance. Likewise a reader will ask a poet for help in understanding her poems. Attempting again to guide readers to a positive reception of her book, Cavendish distinguishes poets (able judges of poetry) from rhymers (faulty judges of poetry) and advises people not to call her book nonsense or poorly constructed out of their own ignorance and malice. Returning again to her desire for fame, Cavendish notes that if judged by an honest poet, who would not be envious, her work would receive applause.

Cavendish asks the reader to read her fancies (poems) slowly, paying heed to each word, for each is a fancy itself. She warns that if readers lose their place or skip lines, they will miss the meaning of the entire work.

====Poems: excuses and instructions====
Cavendish followed some epistles with poems on how they came to be published and how they should be received. The proximity of the poems to the epistles and their similarity in subject and tone suggests that they may be interpreted as Cavendish&#x27;s own point of view.

The poem &quot;The Poetresses (sic) hasty Resolution&quot;, like many of Cavendish&#x27;s epistles, contains excuses for errors that may be found in the poet&#x27;s work and begs for praise. The poet states that self-love influences her judgment of her own poetry, which she finds she likes so much that she is moved to continue writing in the hope of fame. She claims to write without thought of how her work would be received by critics. She then recalls how she was visited by Reason, who advised her to stop writing. Reason said her writing was a waste of time, that her work would not be well received, and she should not have her work printed so that the printer would not lose money. Reason also stated that there were already too many books and that she should burn what she had written to spare the world from more. The poet noted her own angry response: she sent her book to the press before she could be persuaded otherwise. In hindsight, however, she regretted doing so: she felt ashamed of her writing and told the reader to pity her and wipe away her tears with praise.

In &quot;The Poetresses Petition,&quot; she compares a negative reception to her books with their death. If the books suffer such a death (i.e., criticism), she requests silence and that they be forgotten, without alteration or inscriptions, and left undisturbed unless new merit is found. Again, Cavendish sought to censor criticism and promote fame by instructing that only positive criticism should be voiced.

In &quot;An Apology for Writing So Much upon This Book&quot;, she compares it to a child and the book/child and author/parent to birds. The book is like a baby bird just going out on its own. The author, like a parent bird, is unsure whether the book/baby bird will be safe and chirrups in an attempt to protect it.

===&quot;Nature&#x27;s Pictures drawn by Fancy&#x27;s Pencil to the Life&quot; (1656)===
This is viewed as &quot;Cavendish&#x27;s most ambitious attempt to combine modes and genres.&quot; It includes short prose romances – &quot;The Contract&quot; and &quot;Assaulted and Pursued Chastity&quot; – and several prefatory addresses to the reader. The stories concern &quot;the advantageous production of woman as spectacle&quot; and &quot;repeatedly [feminise] the aristocratic and chivalric trope (or figure) of the fair unknown.&quot;

===&quot;A True Relation of my Birth, Breeding, and Life&quot; (1656)===
Cavendish published this autobiographical memoir as an addendum to &quot;Natures Pictures Drawn by Fancies Pencil to the Life&quot;, in 1656. She wrote it at the age of 33, which has been discussed by literary critics. One critic sees Cavendish&#x27;s autobiography as a way to gain credibility and a marketable image that would undercut a socially improper public image. Cavendish wrote her autobiography in response to what people were saying of her in her lifetime. It relates Cavendish&#x27;s lineage, social status, fortune, upbringing, education and marriage, describes her pastimes and manners, and offers an account of her personality and ambition, including thoughts on her bashfulness, contemplative nature and writing. She also shares her views on gender (appropriate behaviour and activity), politics (Parliamentarians v. Royalists) and class (proper behaviour of servants).

The memoir details the lives of her family, including a short account of her brother Charles Lucas, one of the best Civil War Cavalier cavalry commanders, executed by the Parliamentarians for treason in the Second English Civil War. She goes on to address the economic and personal hardships that she and her family faced from the war and their political allegiance, such as loss of estates and bereavements.

===&quot;CCXI Sociable Letters&quot; (1664)===
Published in 1664 by William Wilson, &quot;CCXI Sociable Letters&quot; (1664) is a collection of letters written as if composed by real women. The organisation is similar to that of &quot;The World&#x27;s Olio&quot; (1655). The topics are as varied as the forms and length of the letters. They cover marriage, war, politics, medicine, science, English and classical literature, and miscellaneous matters like gambling and religious extremism. Some letters seem to point to characters as actual people – Thomas Hobbes may appear in letter 173 and C. R. stand for King Charles II, – and some are addressed to real people with whom Cavendish often communicated, but most are fictional, leading to a surprisingly vibrant, ongoing conversation and observation of contemporary life.

===&quot;Observations upon Experimental Philosophy&quot; (1666)===
====Cavendish&#x27;s natural philosophy====
Throughout her work on natural philosophy, Margaret Cavendish defends the belief that all nature is composed of free, self-moving, rational matter. Eileen O&#x27;Neill provides an overview of Cavendish&#x27;s natural philosophy and its critical reception in her introduction to &quot;Observations upon Experimental Philosophy&quot;. She describes Cavendish&#x27;s natural philosophy as rejecting Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy and favouring Stoic doctrines: while women rarely wrote about natural philosophy in the 17th century, Cavendish published six books on the subject. O&#x27;Neill points out that Cavendish herself was not formally educated in natural philosophy, though William Cavendish and his brother Charles shared an interest in the subject and supported her interest and study in the area. She may also have been influenced by social encounters with philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes. O&#x27;Neill believes Hobbes (who had instructed Charles in philosophy) had marked influence on Cavendish&#x27;s natural philosophy, making her one of the few 17th-century supporters of Hobbes&#x27; materialist philosophy, which argued that incorporeal souls did not exist in nature. Beginning in the 1660s, Cavendish began to study the work of her contemporaries more seriously. O&#x27;Neill suggests that such study was meant to enable Cavendish to argue her own points better by contrast with those of other natural philosophers.

O&#x27;Neill notes that Cavendish&#x27;s natural philosophy and her writing in general were criticised by many contemporaries and by more recent readers, such as Pepys, Henry More and Virginia Woolf. Cavendish&#x27;s work has also received positive criticism and has been lauded by many for tackling typically male-dominated subjects such as natural philosophy. Letters and poems of praise by her husband were included in several of her published works.

====Writing as an honourable disease====
Cavendish in her preface to &quot;Observations upon Experimental Philosophy&quot; states that she expects readers to say that her practice of writing prolifically is a disease. If so, Cavendish stated, many others, including Aristotle, Cicero, Homer and St Augustine, have suffered the same disease. It was an honour for someone of great ambition (as she often identified herself) to share the disease of such wise and eloquent men. In these, as in her other writings, she asserts that she writes for herself and that her writing is a harmless pastime when compared with those of many other women. She contradicts herself, however, by adding that she writes for delight, which she had denied in her previous work. Also somewhat contradictory is her intention of continuing to write even if she has no readers, which belies her desire for fame. Ultimately, Cavendish excuses her criticism of and engagement with the theories of other natural philosophers as a necessary step in the search for truth.

====Learning versus wit====
In her epistle to the reader, Cavendish writes that a woman&#x27;s wit may equal that of a man, and women may be able to learn as easily as men. She argues that wit is natural, whereas learning is artificial, and in her time, men have more chance of educating themselves than women.

Cavendish remarks on her own experience reading philosophical works: many such works have challenged her understanding with their frequently difficult words and expressions. Thus Cavendish advises writers of philosophy to use language appropriate to less expert readers. She defends this by stating that philosophical terms should ease communication of thoughts. She believes that successful communication is possible in all languages and accuses those who complicate communication (particularly English writers) of aiming for esteem from those who admire writing simply because they do not understand it, without considering that it may be nonsense. In her own work, Cavendish states, she chooses not to use difficult terms, although she adds that she understands such terms. Her stated reason is that she desires her work to be accessible to people regardless of their education. Her aim is to communicate her ideas clearly. She requests that any errors that may be found in her work be overlooked and readers remain focused on her main ideas. Here, as in many epistles, she instructs readers on how to approach her work and requests them to read it fully and withhold criticism until they have done so.

===&quot;The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World&quot; (1666)===

Cavendish&#x27;s science-fiction work was published in 1666 and again in 1668, each time with &quot;Observations upon Experimental Philosophy&quot;.

As many such as Silvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson have noted, this early version of science fiction critiques and explores such issues as science, gender and power. It also views relations between imagination and reason and philosophy and fiction. Cavendish writes herself into the book, which details a fictional, quite separate new world and its empress. She remarks in her epilogue that she is the empress, adding that in much the same way as there was a Charles the First, she would be seen as Margaret the First.

==Plays in 1662 and 1668==
Two volumes of Cavendish&#x27;s dramatic works were printed. &quot;Plays&quot; (1662), printed by A. Warren (London) includes:
*Loves Adventures 
*The Several Wits
*Youths Glory, and Deaths Banquet
*The Lady Contemplation
*Wits Cabal
*The Unnatural Tragedy
*The Public Wooing
*The Matrimonial Trouble
*Nature&#x27;s Three Daughters, Beauty, Love and Wit
*The Religious
*The Comical Hash
*Bell in Campo 
*A Comedy of the Apocryphal Ladies
*The Female Academy

&quot;Plays, Never Before Printed&quot; (1668) was published by Anne Maxwell (London):
*The Sociable Companions, or the Female Wits
*The Presence 
*Scenes (edited from The Presence)
*The Bridals
*The Convent of Pleasure
*A Piece of a Play

==Other works==
Cavendish also published collections of &quot;Philosophical Letters&quot; (1664), orations, as in her collection entitled &quot;Orations&quot; (1662). Many of her works address such issues as natural philosophy, gender, power and manners. Cavendish&#x27;s plays were never acted in her lifetime, but a number, including &quot;The Convent of Pleasure&quot; (1668) have been staged since. &quot;The Convent of Pleasure&quot; has recently become a staple of high school and university literature courses because of its feminism and Sapphic plot and character elements. Several of Cavendish&#x27;s works have epistles, prefaces, prologues and epilogues in which she discusses her work, philosophy and ambition, while instructing the reader on how to read and respond to her writing. Her work has been alternately criticised and championed from its original publication to the present day.

==Critical reception==
Cavendish was an unorthodox and daring intellectual who received positive and negative commentary from her contemporaries. Negative comments can be found by the Royal Society member Samuel Pepys who once wrote of her as &quot;a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman&quot; though he was eager to read her work. Dorothy Osborne reflected in one published letter, after reading a book by the Duchess, that she was &quot;sure there are soberer people in Bedlam.&quot; After receiving copies of her work on natural philosophy, Henry More wrote to Anne Conway that Cavendish “may be secure from anyone giving her the trouble of a reply.&quot; She also had numerous admirers, Constantijn Huygens, Mildmay Fane, Earl of Westmorland, John Dryden, Kenelm Digby were among them. Joseph Glanvill and Walter Charleton corresponded with her and engaged with philosophy and science. After her death, her husband William Cavendish compiled a book of admiring letters, poems, and epitaphs by numerous people. In the nineteenth century Charles Lamb enjoyed her &quot;Sociable Letters&quot; and so much admired her biography of her husband that he called it a jewel &quot;for which no casket is rich enough.&quot; James Fitzmaurice argues “Cavendish was viewed sympathetically by the English Romantic poets”.

Margaret Cavendish was the first person to develop an original theory of atomism in Britain. She was also the first woman to be invited to attend a session of the Royal Society. One member, John Evelyn, saw in Cavendish &quot;a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy&quot;. Yet her knowledge was recognised by some, such as the protofeminist Bathsua Makin: &quot;The present Dutchess of New-Castle, by her own Genius, rather than any timely Instruction, over-tops many grave Gown-Men.&quot; She saw her exemplifying what women could become through education. New manuscript evidence also suggests she was read and taken seriously by at least some early Royal Society members, such as its secretary, Nehemiah Grew.

Cavendish was mostly lost to obscurity in the early twentieth century. Not until Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;The Common Reader&quot; (1925) did discourse rediscover the Duchess. Woolf remarked that: Margaret Cavendish began to generate intense scholarly interest in the 1980s, when rediscovered and analysed from a modern feminist perspective. Since then there have been many book-length critical studies of her. She has also gained fame as one of the first science-fiction writers, with her novel &quot;The Blazing World&quot;. Her self inserted as a character named Margaret Cavendish in &quot;The Blazing World&quot; is said to be among the earliest examples of the modern Mary Sue trope. More recently, her plays have been examined in performance studies, for blurring the lines between performance and literature, challenging gender identities and upsetting gender norms. Further analysis on Cavendish appears here.

This new interest has engendered media projects. The film, &quot;The Blazing World&quot; (2021), is loosely inspired by Cavendish&#x27;s science fiction story. Siri Hustvedt&#x27;s The Blazing World (2014), which was also loosely inspired by Cavendish, won The Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction and was long-listed for the Booker Prize. &quot;Margaret the First&quot; by Danielle Dutton dramatises her &quot;with lucid precision and sharp cuts through narrative time&quot;, as a new approach to &quot;imagining the life of a historical woman&quot;. As the digital humanities grow, several projects have begun archiving Cavendish. The International Margaret Cavendish Society was set up as &quot;a means of communication between scholars worldwide&quot;, to increase awareness of Cavendish&#x27;s scholarly presence as a hub for newsletters, contacts and links to Cavendish&#x27;s works. Likewise the Digital Cavendish Project works to make Cavendish&#x27;s writing accessible and readable for people across the web and &quot;highlight digital research, image archives, scholarly projects, and teaching materials&quot;. On 26 January 2018, the Digital Cavendish Twitter account announced that its next goal was to compile the Complete Works of Margaret Cavendish.

<text>Lake Grove is a village in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 11,163 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area of Lake Grove was settled in the early 18th century along Middle Country Road, which was then part of the Old Kings Highway, originally a Native American footpath. The community&#x27;s first church building, built in 1818, was the First Congregational Church of New Village. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, the building has been preserved and is depicted on the village seal. In 1870, Lake Grove established its first post office, which carried the mail to and from Lakeland station (discontinued in 1883) by horse and wagon. The area was variously called Lakeland, Lakeville, New Village, Ronkonkoma or West Middle Island until it settled on the name Lake Grove in mid-19th century, after the groves of trees near Lake Ronkonkoma.

During the early 20th century Lake Ronkonkoma became a popular area for recreation, which prompted many small summer houses built on private roads of Lake Grove. In 1921, a new post office was erected in the eastern part of the area and given the name of Centereach. The next significant housing development built in Lake Grove was called Brook Lawn and was located on Stony Brook Road, which later grew into Stony Brook. More developments followed and the population of Lake Grove increased rapidly. In 1954, the newly built Nesconset Highway created a major commercial crossroad in Lake Grove, which prompted the construction of the Smith Haven Mall in 1968, which in turn made the local residents become concerned about the impact of new businesses and increased traffic in their community.

In order to gain local control of the zoning and planning, Lake Grove was incorporated by a vote of 552 to 332 on September 9, 1968.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 10,250 people, 3,419 households, and 2,742 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 3,509 housing units at an average density of .

<doc id="127314" wikidata="Q3459304" url="?curid=127314" title="Lake Ronkonkoma, New York">
<text>Lake Ronkonkoma is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 18,619 at the time of the 2020 census.

Lake Ronkonkoma is mainly located in the Town of Brookhaven, but has small sections in the Town of Smithtown and the Town of Islip.

== History ==
The actual lake, Lake Ronkonkoma, adjacent to the CDP, is the largest lake on Long Island. The land surrounding one side of the lake is in the jurisdiction of the Town of Islip. The elevation of the lake surface is given as on the most recent USGS map, but as the lake is a &quot;groundwater lake&quot;, not fed by streams, it has no surface outlet and its water surface reflects the current level of the local water table. This can undergo significant changes over time, and the lake level experiences slow periods of rise and fall. In the late 1960s it was quite low; after several intermediate changes in level, in 2007 the lake was higher than at any time since, with a difference of well over between the 1960s low and the 2007 high.

As a result of the lake&#x27;s existence, Lake Ronkonkoma was once a resort town, until the area experienced a population explosion in the mid-20th century. Remnants of old resorts and hotels can still be seen around the lake&#x27;s shores. Many summer cottages and bungalows from that period remain, now converted to year-round use.

The lake is the subject of a number of urban legends, mainly rooted in the area&#x27;s rich Native American heritage. For example: 1. &quot;It&#x27;s bottomless&quot; (and/or empties into Long Island Sound or other waterways). In fact, the lake is relatively deep (approx. ) at its southeastern side, and is accordingly known as a kettle hole lake. 2. &quot;Every year the lake sacrifices someone.&quot; Or more specifically, Princess Ronkonkoma &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; calls young men out to the middle of the lake and drowns them. In all versions, the lady is an Indian princess who herself drowned in the lake, for reasons that vary depending on the story. The most popular version is that every year the lake claims one male victim. Articles suggest that in the past 200 years, only a handful of females have drowned in Lake Ronkonkoma. 3. &quot;There is a mysterious rise and fall of the lake that doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable relationship to local rainfall totals.&quot; This has not been sufficiently explained either way.

The Native Americans in Suffolk County, as opposed to Nassau County (then part of Queens County) got along well with the white English. In the Dutch west end of Long Island there was bitter fighting between the Native Americans and the Dutch.

There is some kernel of truth in the story. The lake was considered the most sacred lake by the Indians and it was also a meeting point. The tribes controlled different parts of it. One thing is certain, the Native American princess could not have lived in what is now Ronkonkoma; a major point of the story is that the princess and her lover ran off from their own settlement to the lake. In addition the Indians did not live anywhere near the lake. They lived near the coasts of Long Island.

On October 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded over half the village&#x27;s streets. On the southern side of Montauk Highway the water reached up to high. When multiple fires broke out south of Montauk Highway, firefighters were able to contain these fires to their respective dwellings limiting further damage to neighboring houses. Firefighters from most of the Town of Babylon helped control the fires in Lindenhurst. Firefighters fought the blazes in water that was four feet high in higher spots and six feet in lower areas. The people who lived on the northern side of Lindenhurst had no power for over one week. Because of incidents of looting the vacated homes on the southern side of Lindenhurst, the police force had to impose limitations. Curfews were enforced, and only people with proof of residency were allowed south of Montauk Highway. After two days, the water receded.

<doc id="127317" wikidata="Q288029" url="?curid=127317" title="Oscar de la Renta">
<text>Óscar Arístides Renta Fiallo (22 July 1932 – 20 October 2014), known professionally as Oscar de la Renta, was a Dominican fashion designer. Born in Santo Domingo, he was trained by Cristóbal Balenciaga and Antonio del Castillo. De la Renta became internationally known in the 1960s as one of the couturiers who dressed Jacqueline Kennedy. He worked for Lanvin and Balmain. His eponymous fashion house has boutiques around the world, and is headquartered on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

== Early life ==
De la Renta, the youngest of seven children and the only boy in his family, was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to a Dominican mother, Carmen María Antonia Fiallo and a Puerto Rican father, Óscar Avelino De La Renta, owner of an insurance company. The Fiallos, De la Renta&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family, were embedded in Dominican society, and counted poets, scholars, businessmen, and top army brass among their members. Their origin in the island can be traced back to the foundation of San Carlos de Tenerife in 1685 by Canarian settlers.

A maternal uncle, Luis Arístides Fiallo Cabral, was a doctor, lawyer, and architect, who received every degree the University of Santo Domingo could offer. Another maternal uncle, Fabio Fiallo, was a diplomat and poet. On his father&#x27;s side, De la Renta&#x27;s great-great-grandfather José Ortíz de la Renta was the first mayor of Ponce, Puerto Rico, elected by popular vote and who had the distinction of serving as mayor eight times, the most ever for the city.

De la Renta was raised Catholic in a protective family. His mother died from complications of multiple sclerosis when he was 18.

At the age of 18, he went to study painting in Spain at the Royal Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. For extra money, he drew clothes for newspapers and fashion houses. After Francesca Lodge, the wife of John Davis Lodge, the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, saw some of his dress sketches, she commissioned de la Renta to design a gown for her daughter. The dress appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine that fall. He quickly became interested in the world of fashion design and began sketching for leading Spanish fashion houses, which soon led to an apprenticeship with Spain&#x27;s most renowned couturier, Cristóbal Balenciaga. He considered Cristóbal Balenciaga his mentor. In 1961, de la Renta left Spain to join Antonio del Castillo as a couture assistant at Lanvin in Paris.

== Career ==
In 1963, de la Renta turned to Diana Vreeland, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Vogue&quot;, for advice, saying that what he really wanted was to &quot;get into ready to wear, because that&#x27;s where the money is&quot;. Vreeland replied, &quot;Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster. She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.&quot; De la Renta proceeded to work for Arden for two years in New York City before he went to work for Jane Derby, an American fashion house. When Derby died in August 1965, de la Renta took over the label.

From 1993 to 2002, de la Renta designed the haute couture collection for the house of Balmain, becoming the first Dominican to design for a French couture house. In 2006, the Oscar de la Renta label diversified into bridal wear.

De la Renta&#x27;s designs have been worn by a diverse group of distinguished women and celebrities, including pop star Taylor Swift. De la Renta&#x27;s brand saw international wholesale growth beginning in 2003, under the direction of CEO Alex Bolen, from five to seventy-five locations. De la Renta&#x27;s designs are available in his retail stores, online, and with select wholesale partners worldwide.
In 2014, the George W. Bush Presidential Center hosted an exhibit titled &quot;Oscar de la Renta: Five Decades of Style&quot; which shared the designer&#x27;s creations for Mrs. Bush and America&#x27;s First Ladies.

== Other enterprises ==
In 1977, de la Renta launched his fragrance, &quot;OSCAR&quot;, followed by an accessories line in 2001 and a homewares line in 2002. The new business venture included 100 home furnishings for Century Furniture featuring dining tables, upholstered chairs, and couches. In 2004, he added a less expensive line of clothing called O Oscar. De la Renta said he wanted to attract new customers whom he could not previously reach.

In 2006, de la Renta designed Tortuga Bay, a boutique hotel at Puntacana Resort and Club. The hotel is part of the luxury hotel collection, The Leading Hotels of the World.

In 1990, the designer married Annette Engelhard (born 1939), daughter of Fritz Mannheimer and his wife Jane née Reiss, and adoptive daughter of her mother&#x27;s second husband, Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. De la Renta had stepchildren from both marriages.

<text>Lloyd Harbor is a village in the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the village&#x27;s population was 3,660.

==History==
In 1654, the Matinecock Native Americans sold of what is now called Lloyd Neck to English settlers from Oyster Bay. The Matinecock referred to the region as &quot;Caumsett&quot; (&quot;place by sharp rock&quot;). In 1676, James Lloyd acquired the neck, which was then taken over by his son Henry. Henry Lloyd farmed the land and erected a house, which still survives in Caumsett State Park. After his death in 1763, his son Joseph built the Joseph Lloyd Manor House, which he was forced to abandon by the British during the Revolutionary War. The British built several fortifications in the neck, including Fort Franklin. Henry Lloyd IV was the last Lloyd to own the estate, in 1841. In the 1880s, it became a stop for steamboats coming from New York City, bringing tourists and wealthy New Yorkers.

In 1886, Lloyd&#x27;s Neck, which was then part of the town of Oyster Bay and had earlier been known as Queens Village, was set off and separated from Queens County and annexed to the town of Huntington in Suffolk County.

The 1900s ushered the era of the Long Island Gold Coast, and various wealthy families began to buy land and build seaside mansions and estates. These included William Matheson, Marshall Field III, Ronald Conklin, Harold Dimppel, Sr., Ferdinand Eberstadt and George McKesson. In 1926, Lloyd Neck and West Neck became incorporated as a municipality which was named Lloyd Harbor.

Robin Gibb, Charles Lindbergh, Jerry Seinfeld and Billy Joel have each lived on the Neck for a time. Currently many of these estates have been adapted for other uses. Marshall Field III&#x27;s estate is now Caumsett State Historic Park, and the Conklin estate is a Roman Catholic seminary. Others have become a county park and a wildlife refuge. Charles Robertson&#x27;s estate is now the Banbury Center, a small conference center of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In 1969 the Long Island Lighting Company proposed locating a nuclear power plant in the community. Local opposition quickly defeated the plan, with Ferdinand Eberstadt donating his estate to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to become Target Rock National Wildlife Refuge.

<doc id="127319" wikidata="Q3460208" url="?curid=127319" title="Manorville, New York">
<text>Manorville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 14,317 at the time of the 2020 census.

Manorville is mostly in the Town of Brookhaven, but its northeast corner is in the Town of Riverhead. Due to its proximity to The Hamptons, Manorville is nicknamed &quot;The Gateway to the Hamptons&quot;.

==History==

The hamlet of Manorville was a small farming community for many years. The area of the hamlet once laid within the huge tract of land known as Manor St. George, a land grant given to Col. William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith in 1693 for recognition of his service as governor of Tangier in Morocco. In 1844, the Long Island Rail Road built a station called St. George&#x27;s Manor, which was situated off of Ryerson Avenue. However, Seth Raynor, the station agent who was a patriot during the American Revolutionary War, disliked the name due to its similarity to the British and their colonial dominance (Saint George, the patron saint of England, is a symbol of the English monarchy), and decided to paint over the sign, leaving only the word &quot;Manor&quot;. The hamlet changed its name to &quot;Manorville&quot; with the opening of its post office in 1907, but timetables and Long Island Rail Road documents retained the name &quot;Manor&quot; until 1907 or 1908.

The Long Island serial killer is sometimes dubbed the &quot;Manorville killer&quot; because four victims&#x27; remains were discovered in Manorville from 2000 to 2011.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which is land and , or 0.16%, is water.

The hamlet is at the western edge of, and partially within, the Long Island Central Pine Barrens. The land is heavily wooded, and features some wetlands, particularly in the northern section near the Peconic River. Much of the northeastern portion of the hamlet is in the Pine Barrens&#x27; &quot;Core Preservation Area&quot;, where no further development is allowed. This area also serves as a primary source for Long Island&#x27;s groundwater preserve.

Manorville is in the center of Long Island with no access to the water. It lies partially on the Ronkonkoma terminal moraine, which creates some slightly rolling topography, especially in the central portion of the hamlet. The glacial topography of the area features several kettle hole ponds, the most well-known of which is Punk&#x27;s Hole, where a Revolutionary War captain was rumored to have hid from the British.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 11,131 people, 4,122 households, and 2,938 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 4,243 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.38% White, 1.18% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.66% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.75% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.14% of the population.

<text>Mastic Beach is a hamlet and census-designated place, and former village in the southeastern part of the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 14,849 at the 2010 census, when it was an unincorporated census-designated place for the first time.

== History ==

In 2010, a group of residents sought to incorporate Mastic Beach as a village. Petitioners blamed the town of Brookhaven for not doing enough code enforcement on blighted streets and eyesore buildings, believing more diligent code enforcement under village control would improve the community aesthetics. Opponents were concerned that creating the village would increase taxes, and that estimates for the proposed village&#x27;s total budget were low. At $549,500 annually, the village would take up building code enforcement, leaving police, fire, and sanitation to Brookhaven.

After a vote on August 31, 2010, incorporation was approved. The proposed incorporation needed to be passed by a majority in order for the hamlet to become a village. The first elected mayor was Paul Breschard.

The boundaries of the village of Mastic Beach differed from those of the previous census-designated place (CDP). The village did not include the William Floyd House grounds as well as a few blocks in the extreme southwest of the CDP, but it added several blocks west of Mastic Road and Commack Road.

===Dissolution===
Residents voted 1,922 to 1,215 on November 8, 2016, to revert to an unincorporated area with services handled by the Town of Brookhaven. The decision to dissolve the village was decided upon due to political issues and fiscal concerns.

A formal dissolution plan was developed over several months and approved by the Village Board (4–1) at a special meeting on March 16, 2017. The dissolution took place on January 1, 2018.

==Geography==

<doc id="127322" wikidata="Q533896" url="?curid=127322" title="Mattituck, New York">
<text>Mattituck is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 4,584 in 2023 according to the World Population Review. Located in the Town of Southold, Mattituck CDP roughly corresponds to the hamlet by the same name.

== History ==
Mattituck is believed to have derived its name from the Algonquian name for &quot;Great Creek&quot;. Mattituck Creek has been dredged and is used extensively by pleasure craft on Long Island Sound (the Mattituck Inlet is the entrance into Mattituck Creek, and the whole waterway is now popularly referred to as Mattituck Inlet).

It is only one of two harbors (the other being Mt. Sinai harbor) on the north side of Long Island on the Sound east of Port Jefferson.

The Mattituck Inlet and James Creek (which has also been dredged for boats) on the Peconic Bay come within of each other and would provide a shortcut between the Peconic and Sound through the North Fork if connected via a canal. However, authorities have resisted the connection, fearing an ecological disaster. Still, the inlet is blamed for coastal erosion because it interrupts the longshore drift on the sound.

Corchaug Indians, who were the first residents of the area, sold land to Theophilus Eaton, governor of New Haven, Connecticut. The area was eventually settled by English colonists. The meadowlands were held in common by the residents of Southold from its founding in 1640. The town of Southold was established by Charter to the New Haven Colony of Connecticut in 1658. The woodlands were also held in common until 1661, when that land was divided among individual proprietors.

Mattituck was occupied by British troops during the Revolutionary War and Governor Tryon visited.

Mattituck hosts an annual Strawberry Festival and is located in the heart of over 40 vineyards in the Long Island Wine Region. The festival is usually held on Father&#x27;s Day weekend every year.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.88%, is water.

==Demographics of the CDP==
As of the census of 2020, there were 4,322 people, 2,527 households, and 1,963 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 2,313 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Medford is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 24,247 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Long Island Rail Road established the Medford station in 1843 in a flat wilderness in the Long Island Central Pine Barrens. The station connected to the Patchogue Stage Road between Patchogue and Port Jefferson, and a post office was established.

In 1907 the LIRR established the Medford Prosperity Farm (officially called Experimental Station #2) on to show that crops could be raised in the Pine Barrens. Theodore Roosevelt visited the station in August 1910. As the car drove across a trail between Medford and Wading River, it got stuck in the mud and Roosevelt was said to take a &quot;flying leap&quot; to get out.

By the mid-to-late-20th century, developers were building new neighborhoods within Medford. Eagle Estates was built along Horse Block Road east of NY 112 in 1963, although it was planned as far back as the 1930s. The development included a Blue Jay Market shopping center on Horseblock Road west of Eagle Avenue, and a youth baseball and athletic field east of Sipp Avenue between Wave and Race avenues. The Long Island Expressway was built through Medford in 1970, with interchanges at New York State Route 112 and Horseblock Road, the latter of which is close to an older interchange with Horseblock Road and Long Island Avenue, and was not completed until 1999. The Pines was established in the 1970s east of Buffalo Avenue, south of Jamaica Avenue, north of Woodside Avenue and far west of Patchogue-Yaphank Road.

A segment of Peconic Avenue east of Buffalo Avenue has been lined with automotive junkyards since the mid-20th century.

<text>Melville is an affluent hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 19,284 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was known to the Native Americans as &quot;Sunsquams&quot;. In the 17th century, it was named Samuel Ketcham&#x27;s Valley, and it was later known as Sweet Hollow.

===19th century===
In 1854, it was renamed Melville in honor of American novelist Herman Melville, author of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, which was published three years earlier, in 1851. Melville&#x27;s 1846 novel &quot;Typee&quot; also was very popular at that time.

A Presbyterian church was built in Melville in 1829 at the corner of Old Country and Sweet Hollow Roads.

===20th century===

In 1977, the Presbyterian church was moved to the west. The church was in continuous use until 1930. It reopened in 1944 for the funeral of Edward Baylis and has been in use since then.

In 1909, a trolley line to Huntington was established as an extension of the Huntington Trolley Spur that went south to Amityville and had a connection to Babylon. There were six fare zones, one of which was the Duryea Farm in Melville. A decade later, the line was closed after farmers complained that noise from the trolley frightened their animals. Buses then provided local transportation after the trolley line closed. The growing use of private cars later further reduced demand for the trolley line.

In the 1950s, Melville and three of its neighbors, Dix Hills, Wyandanch, and the area known as Sweet Hollow, proposed incorporating as a single village. The village would have been known as the Incorporated Village of Half Hollow Hills, would have had an area of roughly , and would have embraced the Half Hollow Hills Central School District. The plans were unsuccessful.

===21st century===
In 2001, Melville, Dix Hills, Wheatley Heights, and East Farmingdale, which are all within the same school district, proposed incorporating as a single village. These plans also failed, and each remain unincorporated hamlets to this day.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Melville has a total area of .

Melville lies on the east side of Suffolk County&#x27;s boundary with Nassau County.

== Economy ==

Melville and Hauppauge are the two primary business centers of Suffolk County, which is home to almost approximately 1.5 million people. Melville is home to the U.S. headquarters for several national and international corporations, including Canon USA, Chyron Corporation, Leviton, MSC Industrial Direct, Nikon USA, the medical and dental supply distributor Henry Schein, Bouchard Transportation, and Verint Systems. Significant operations of Manhattan-based The Estée Lauder Companies are also based in Melville.

In early 2013, Canon Inc. moved into its new regional headquarters for North and South America to Melville, building a $500-million glass structure near Exit 49 of the Long Island Expressway on the site of a former pumpkin farm. About 1,500 workers were expected to move from Canon&#x27;s Lake Success offices. The company chose Melville over other tri-state area locations because the employees &quot;didn&#x27;t want to leave the area&quot;.

Companies once headquartered in Melville that subsequently relocated include OSI Pharmaceuticals, which was bought by Astellas Pharma of Japan, Allion Healthcare, which was acquired by a private equity firm, Hain Celestial, which moved to Lake Success in Nassau County, Arrow Electronics, which relocated to Centennial, Colorado in 2011, global staffing giant Adecco Staffing, USA, which in 2014 moved their U.S. headquarters to Jacksonville, Florida, and Gentiva Health Services, a Fortune 1000 provider of health services, which relocated to Atlanta in 2006.

Other firms to leave include First Data, Olympus America Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Olympus Corporation, who moved in 2006 to Center Valley, Pennsylvania, and the national pizza chain Sbarro, which declared bankruptcy and reemerged in 2014, relocating to Columbus, Ohio. Around 2002, Swiss International Air Lines&#x27;s North American headquarters moved from Melville to Uniondale. The facility, the former Swissair North American headquarter site, was completed in 1995. Swissair intended to own, instead of lease, its headquarters site. It enlisted architect Richard Meier to design its Melville facility. The building is now owned by Damianos Realty Group, LLC, a Long Island-based real estate company.

==Government==
One of the nine state offices of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer is located in Melville.

== Education ==

Half Hollow Hills Central School District and South Huntington Union Free School District serve Melville. Katharine Gibbs School – Melville serves the post-school population with certificates and associate degrees.

===Media===
The primary Long Island newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot; is published in Melville.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
==== Road ====
The Long Island Expressway and Northern State Parkway, two of Long Island&#x27;s busiest highways and major points of entry in and out of New York City, pass through Melville. NY Route 110 also runs through Melville.

==== Rail ====

Until 1927, Melville was served by the Huntington Railroad&#x27;s streetcar line, which ran along what today is NY Route 110 and has now been replaced by the S1 bus. The closest rail line is the LIRR&#x27;s Main Line to Ronkonkoma and Greenport, but the closest station on that line is Pinelawn, which only provides weekend service. Huntington station in Huntington is the closest full service station.

==== Bus ====

Melville&#x27;s primary mode of public transit is the 1 bus run by Suffolk County Transit. Route 1 runs up and down Route 110 seven days a week and connects to two Long Island Railroad branches north and south of Melville. The &quot;Suffolk Clipper&quot; express bus service also serves the numerous business parks in South Melville during weekdays.

A park and ride and carpool parking lot with a bus shelter exists adjacent to the north of the LIE, but long-distance bus service to and from there is either highly occasional or nonexistent. The parking lot is still used by carpool commuters, but also attracts some illicit activity.

=== Fire protection ===
Melville is protected by the Melville Volunteer Fire Department. Established in 1947, it handles all emergencies, including fires, heavy rescues and extrications, emergency ambulances, hazmat, and other related tasks. The fire department responds to more than 3,500 alarms annually and provides continuous service on an annual budget of $1.5 million.

<text>Middle Island is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 10,483 at the 2010 census. It is situated between the hamlets of Coram and Ridge, to the west and east, respectively, and Rocky Point and Yaphank to the north and south. The name derives from the fact that it lies approximately halfway between the eastern and western ends of Long Island (Montauk Point and the East River) as well as halfway between the northern and southern boundaries (the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean).

==History==
The European-American history of Middle Island goes back at least to 1766, when the first Presbyterian church was built. Rev. David Rose, who was also a doctor and a pastor of the South Haven church, covered his immense parish on horseback. He filled his saddle bags with Bibles and medicines to minister to his frontier congregation. In 1766 the parish opened a cemetery just across from the church.

Around the same time, a veteran of the French and Indian War named Jonathan Edwards who admired the white pine trees of Quebec swiped the seedlings for himself and began planting them along what is today Middle Island-Miller Place Road. Many of these pine trees were spread throughout the community. A local farmer named William Dayton swiped some of the pine cones from the site of the original plantings in 1812 and brought them to his farm south of what is today Middle Country Road, towards an area of Yaphank-Middle Island Road north of Longwood Road. The area near the William Davis farmstead is now part of Prosser Pines and Cathedral Pines County Parks.

The first schoolhouse was built in 1813 east of the church. In 1837, a new church was built just to the rear of the older one. It served the community for 200 years until the new Christian Education building was built at the Longwood Estate in 1966.

For over 100 years (until it was burned down in 1971), Pfeiffer&#x27;s Store was a center of activity for Middle Island and surrounding communities. A nearby lake, known as Corwin&#x27;s Pond, was renamed &quot;Artist Lake&quot; after painter Alonzo Chappel settled there in 1869.

On October 27, 1910, the International Aviation Tournament was held at the Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont, New York. The meet offered $3,750 for the highest altitude, another $1,000 for a world record and a $5,000 bonus for exceeding 10,000 feet. Ralph Johnstone set a new American flight altitude record of 8,471 feet. During the flight, a gust of wind forced him to fly backwards, and he landed near Artist Lake.

Middle Island gained an influx of Estonian refugees during the 1940s and 1950s mainly around the Pine Lake area.

<text>Miller Place is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States. Despite preserving much of its historic identity, changes in the 20th century have transitioned the hamlet into a desirable and densely populated suburban area. The population was 11,723 at the 2020 census.

Miller Place and Mount Sinai are historically linked, with residents sharing such institutions as the Mount Sinai Congregational Church, located on the hamlet&#x27;s border. The harborfront section of Port Jefferson, 5 miles to the West, serves as a primary commercial downtown walking area for residents of both Miller Place and Mount Sinai.

==History==
===Agricultural hamlet===
Miller Place has been inhabited since the 17th century and is named for the Miller family that included many of its initial settlers. For most of its history, the community functioned as an agriculture-based society.

The land that Miller Place occupies was purchased from the native Setalcott tribe in 1664 by settlers of Setauket. The parcel also included what would become Mount Sinai, an adjacent community of similar character with which Miller Place would share a variety of functions throughout its history.

The first known dwelling in the area was constructed in the 1660s by Captain John Scott, an important figure in Long Island&#x27;s early history. This house was named &quot;Braebourne&quot; and features on a map of the New England region credited to Scott, who served as a royal advisor and cartographer among other occupations. This abode, on the eastern side of Mount Sinai Harbor, was one of three houses John Scott commissioned, and the actual occupier is unknown.

While the original settler of Miller Place is unknown, the settling of the region is largely credited to the original Miller family. In 1679, an East Hampton settler named Andrew Miller purchased a plot. Miller was a cooper by profession, and records indicate that he had emigrated from either Maidstone, England or Craigmillar, Scotland.

By the early 1700s, the community had become known as &quot;Miller&#x27;s Place&quot;. The Miller family expanded well into the 18th century and continually developed houses in the northern part of the hamlet. The Millers were in time joined by members of such families as the Helmes, Robinsons, Burnetts, Hawkins, Woodhulls, and Thomases. Many roads in the present hamlet have been named after historical families.

The oldest extant house is the home of William Miller, Andrew Miller&#x27;s grandson, composed in three sections between 1720 and 1816 at a prominent location on North Country Road. The hamlet&#x27;s many extant historical structures are centered on this thoroughfare, forming the core of the Miller Place Historic District. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, it became the first historic district in the Town of Brookhaven. Separately listed is the Samuel Hopkins House.

The American Revolutionary War divided the town, with the majority siding with the Patriot cause but families being split across both lines. A number of midnight raids occurred, one of which resulted in the shooting of a teenage Miller who had peered out of his window to check on the commotion. The march of Benjamin Tallmadge, who led eighty men to the victorious overthrow of a British stronghold at Manor St. George, traversed along the town&#x27;s western border.

In 1789, the neighboring communities of Miller Place and Mount Sinai organized a Congregational church on the town border. While the Mount Sinai Congregational Church building (an extant structure from 1807) is technically in Mount Sinai, the house for its minister was built in Miller Place and continues to be used for that purpose.

The first two public schools in the hamlet were established in 1813 and 1837. In 1834 the Miller Place Academy, a private school, was established under the leadership of a Yale graduate. Though the academy itself closed in 1868, it served as a public school from 1897 until the 1937 opening of what is now the North Country Road Middle School. The Miller Place Academy structure remains as one of the community&#x27;s symbols and currently houses a free library.

===Resort town===

In 1895 the hamlet became home to a station of the Long Island Rail Road, which was located near the present-day intersection of Sylvan and Echo Avenues. It transported people to stops westward to Port Jefferson and New York City or eastward to Wading River. After the station was destroyed in a 1903 fire, a new one was built. However, this building was destroyed in 1934 by another fire, and the Eastern railroad lines were soon abandoned. In 2013 an agreement was signed between local politicians and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), which currently manages the strip on which the railroad operated, to convert this land into a public bicycle trail.

In the latter 19th century, Miller Place became a popular summer resort location. This led to a building boom of beach-side bungalows, rustic log cabins, and commercial activities to accommodate the new seasonal residents. A barn-like building known as the Harbor House operated as a dormitory-style vacation house for young girls until it was destroyed in a 1962 fire. Camp Barstow, a Girl Scout camp near the beach, was active until 1980 and has since become public parkland.

===Modern development===

In the decades following World War II, the population of Miller Place greatly expanded, and the majority of beach cottages were repurposed as family homes.

A 2012 plan by the Town of Brookhaven aims to comprehensively manage Route 25A between Mount Sinai and Wading River under planning strategies counter to those of car-oriented mid-century suburbia. For Miller Place, it intends to transition the section at Echo and Sylvan Avenues into a traditional downtown center with new mixed-use development and an expanded Sylvan Avenue Park that would complement the current town post office and senior center. The plan additionally calls for the preservation of the DeLea Sod Farm, the largest agricultural parcel remaining on the Miller Place stretch of Route 25a.

==Geography==

 Miller Place is located on North Shore of Long Island and features a two-mile section of beach. It also hugs the east side of Mount Sinai Harbor, which it shares with neighboring Mount Sinai and Port Jefferson. The hamlet also borders with Sound Beach, Rocky Point, Middle Island and Coram.

The 73rd meridian west passes directly through Miller Place.

The area is hilly in some patches, mostly near the beach, but generally has grass and trees. Though the soil is suitable for agriculture, desire for housing has led most farms to be developed into suburban housing communities or commercial locations.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, there were 11,723 people, 3,847 households, and 3.11 persons per household residing in the CDP. The 2010 population density was . The racial makeup of the CDP was 88.7% White alone, not Hispanic or Latino, 0.3% African American, 0.0% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, and 2.4% from two or more races. 9.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population had previously increased to 12,339 people in the 2010 census.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population was a wide spread, with 25.7% under the age of 18, 10.9% from 18 to 24, 17.6% from 25 to 44, 29.1% from 45 to 64, and 16.7% who were 65 years of age or older. Overall the population was 48.6% women.

The median income (in 2019 US dollars) for a household in the CDP was $130,341. The per capita income for the CDP was $49,772. 2.5% of the population were below the poverty threshold.

== Economy ==
The center of commerce within the hamlet has largely transitioned from the historic North Country Road to the modern Route 25A.

Along North Country Road is McNulty&#x27;s, a family-owned ice cream parlor and a fixture of the hamlet, and a handful of inns and restaurants located in historic structures. Route 25A is of a more suburban character, with most businesses being corporate chains and located in strip malls. Also along Route 25A are multiple pizza parlors, a bagel store, a deli, and a local coffee shop and bar.

The hamlet is home to many residents who commute daily to New York City. Commuters either use the Long Island Rail Road, with the nearest stations in Port Jefferson and Ronkonkoma, or drive along the extensive highway system that had been developed by Robert Moses. A number of residents also work at nearby Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

== Parks and recreation==
Cordwood Landing County Park has become a popular local destination. The park consists of hilly, wooded trails that lead directly down to extended Cedar Beach.

==Education==

The four schools of the Miller Place Union Free School District are scattered throughout the hamlet and serve both Miller Place and much of the hamlet of Sound Beach. These include the Andrew Muller Primary School (K-2), Laddie A. Decker Sound Beach School (3–5), North Country Road Middle School (6–8), and the Miller Place High School (9–12). The high school has been ranked the 78th in the nation for students taking AP classes. The school&#x27;s mascot is a panther, while the school colors are red, white and blue.

== Health care ==
There is one walk-in clinic and urgent care center in Miller Place; Caremed Primary and Urgent Care.

<doc id="127328" wikidata="Q498773" url="?curid=127328" title="Montauk, New York">
<text>Montauk ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of East Hampton in Suffolk County, New York, on the eastern end of the South Shore of Long Island. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 4,318.

The CDP encompasses an area that stretches approximately from Napeague, New York, to the easternmost tip of New York State at Montauk Point Light. The hamlet encompasses a small area about halfway between the two points.

Located at the tip of the South Fork peninsula of Long Island, east of Midtown Manhattan, Montauk has been used as an Army, Navy, Coast Guard, and Air Force base. The Montauk Point Light was the first lighthouse in New York state and is the fourth oldest active lighthouse in the United States.

Montauk is a major tourist destination with six state parks. It is particularly famous for its fishing, claiming to have more world saltwater fishing records than any other port in the world. Located off the Connecticut coast, it is home to the largest commercial and recreational fishing fleet in New York state.

==History==
===17th century===
Montauk derives its name from the Montaukett tribe, an Algonquian-speaking tribe who lived in the area. In 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block encountered the tribe at Montauk Point, which he named &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Point of the Fishers&quot;. Two decades later, in 1637, the Montauketts sided for their own protection with the New England settlers in the Pequot War in Connecticut. In the aftermath the Montauketts were to sell Gardiners Island. In 1648 what would become the Town of Easthampton (first Maidstone) was sold to settlers by the colony of Connecticut and the colony of New Haven while retaining the lands to the east, from the hills rising above where the first fort stood (Napeague, New York) to Montauk Point. The western boundary of today&#x27;s Hither Hills State Park is also known as the 1648 purchase line.

In 1653, the Narragansett-Montaukett War started. Narragansetts under Ninigret attacked and burned the Montaukett village, killing 30 and capturing one of Chief Wyandanch&#x27;s daughters. The daughter was recovered with the aid of Lion Gardiner (who in turn was given a large portion of Smithtown, New York in appreciation). The Montauketts, ravaged by smallpox and fearing extermination by the Narragansetts, were provided temporary refuge by white settlers in East Hampton. Many short but famous battles ensued. The skirmishes ended in 1657. Fort Pond Bay derives its name from a Montaukett &quot;fort&quot; on its shore. A deed was issued in 1661 titled &quot;Ye deed of Guift&quot; which granted all of the lands east of Fort Pond to be for the common use of both the indigenous people and the townsmen.

Further purchase agreements were entered into in 1661, 1672 and 1686 which, among other things, allowed a group of Easthampton townsmen to graze cattle on the Montaukett lands. While some lands were protected in the agreements as forest land, for the most part, all of Montauk was maintained by the townsmen as a private livestock and fisheries operation. As a result of Montauk being operated as a livestock operation, the site now known as Deep Hollow Ranch is considered to be the oldest cattle ranch in the United States.

In 1660, Wyandanch&#x27;s widow sold all of Montauk from Napeague to the tip of the island for 100 pounds to be paid in 10 equal installments of &quot;Indian corn or good wampum at six to a penny&quot;. However, the tribe was to be permitted to stay on the land, to hunt and fish at will on the land, and to harvest the tails and fins of whales that washed up dead on the East Hampton shores. Town officials who bought the land were to file for reimbursement for the rum with which they had plied the tribe. The tribe was to continue residence until the 19th century in the area around Big Reed Pond in what was to be called &quot;Indian Fields&quot;.

In 1686, Governor of New York Thomas Dongan issued a patent creating the governing system for East Hampton. The patent did not extend beyond Napeague to Montauk. This lack of authority has formed the basis for various control disputes ever since.

===18th century===
During the Siege of Boston in the Revolutionary War, a British ship visited Fort Pond Bay in 1775 in search of provisions—notably cattle. John Dayton, who had limited troops at his disposal on a hill above the bay, feigned that he had more by walking them back and forth across a hill turning their coats inside out to make it look like there were more of them (a tactic referred to as &quot;Dayton&#x27;s Ruse&quot;).

In 1781, the British ran aground near what today is called Culloden Point while pursuing a French frigate. The ship was scuttled, but its remains were discovered in the 1970s. It is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1792, Congress authorized construction of the Montauk Lighthouse. It was completed in 1796.

===19th century===


In 1839, slaves who had seized the schooner &quot;La Amistad&quot; came ashore in the hamlet looking for provisions after being told by the white crew they had returned to Africa. American authorities were alerted, and the slaves were recaptured and ultimately freed in a historically significant trial. 

A judgment was entered in 1851 against the Trustees of the Freeholders and Commonalty of the Town of Easthampton, and on March 9, 1852, a deed to Montauk was given to plaintiffs Henry P. Hedges and others, because their predecessors had contributed the money to purchase Montauk from the native Montaukett Indians in the 1600s. This deed caused the lands covered by the Dongan Patent to be split. Less than one month later, on April 2, 1852, a state law was passed that incorporated the proprietors of Montauk, establishing the corporation of the trustees of Montauk and affirming its right to govern.

Stephen Talkhouse was displayed in 1867 by P. T. Barnum as &quot;the last king of the Montauks.&quot; Talkhouse became famous for his walks around the South Fork.

In 1879, Arthur W. Benson paid US$151,000 for for the east end. The deed releasing claim to Montauk was entered on March 9, 1852. Benson also received clear title to the Montaukett property at Big Reed Pond, buying it from tribesmen for $10 each, and in one case one of the tribesmen&#x27;s houses was burned down. The legitimacy of the transaction is still being contested in court by the tribe. Construction began in 1882 on seven Shingle-style &quot;cottages&quot; designed by Stanford White, which were the centerpiece of Benson&#x27;s plans. The most prominent of the six Montauk Association houses is Tick Hall, which was owned by entertainer Dick Cavett from 1967 to October 2021, when he sold it for $23.6 million.

The first train from the Austin Corbin extension of the Long Island Rail Road pulled into Montauk in 1895, and the &quot;Cannonball&quot;, its premier train to and from New York, made its first run four years later. Corbin planned to turn Montauk into a &quot;shortcut&quot;, saving a day each way for voyages between New York City and London: ships would dock at the Fort Pond Bay terminal and passengers would travel by rail to New York City in two hours. Corbin built the dock on Fort Pond Bay, but the plans never materialized when, among other things, Fort Pond Bay was found to be too shallow and rocky to handle oceangoing ships.

In 1898, after the Benson/Corbin plan did not work out as planned, the United States Army bought the Benson property to establish a base called Camp Wikoff to quarantine Army personnel returning from the Spanish–American War. The most prominent of the returning quarantined soldiers were Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. Several soldiers died during the quarantine, prompting questions about the camp&#x27;s conditions and a visit from President William McKinley.

===20th century===

==== Early 20th century ====

In 1924, Robert Moses began condemning the Benson land to establish state parks on either end of Montauk − Hither Hills State Park in the west and Montauk Point State Park in the east. The two parks were to be connected via the Montauk Point State Parkway.

In 1926, Carl G. Fisher bought most of the East End of Long Island () for only $2.5 million. He planned to turn Montauk into the &quot;Miami Beach of the North&quot;, a &quot;Tudor village by the sea&quot;. His projects included blasting a hole through the freshwater Lake Montauk to access Block Island Sound to replace the shallow Fort Pond Bay as the hamlet&#x27;s port; establishing the Montauk Yacht Club and the Montauk Downs Golf Course; and building Montauk Manor, a luxury resort hotel; the Montauk Tennis Auditorium, which became a movie theater (and is now the Montauk Playhouse); and the six-story Carl Fisher Office Building (later the Montauk Improvement Building and now The Tower at Montauk, a residential condominium). This last building remains East Hampton&#x27;s tallest occupied building, as zoning ordinances restricted heights of later buildings. The 30 or so buildings Fisher put up between 1926 and 1932 were designed in the Tudor Revival style. Fisher had successfully developed Miami Beach before beginning his Montauk project, but although he continued to pour his money into the development, to the extent of $12 million in total, he eventually lost his fortune due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and most of his enterprises were shut down. Other hotels that opened at the time of Fisher&#x27;s project include Gurney&#x27;s Inn, built by W. J. and Maude Gurney, who had managed a Fisher hotel in Miami Beach.

In the Great Hurricane of 1938, water flooded across Napeague, turning Montauk into an island. Floodwaters from the hurricane inundated the main downtown, and it was moved to the south, immediately next to the Atlantic Ocean.

====Mid 20th century====

During World War II the United States Navy bought most of the east end, including Montauk Manor, to turn it into a military base. Fort Pond Bay became a seaplane base. The U.S. Army established Camp Hero with guns to protect New York shipping lanes. Several concrete bunker observation posts were built along the coast, including one immediately to the east of the Montauk Lighthouse. Base buildings were disguised so they would appear from above as a New England fishing village.

In 1951, sport fisherman Frank Mundus began to lead charter fishing trips out of Lake Montauk, initially looking for bluefish but soon found fishing for sharks was more lucrative. The sport of &quot;monster fishing&quot; became Montauk&#x27;s signature draw.

On September 1, 1951, the &quot;Pelican&quot;, captained by Eddie Carroll, capsized in the shoals off Montauk Point, resulting in the deaths of 45 passengers and crew. The &quot;Pelican&quot; was carrying 64 people, most of whom had taken the Fisherman&#x27;s Special trains to the Montauk LIRR station from New York City. The boat left the Fishangrila Dock at Fort Pond Bay at 7:30 a.m., severely overloaded. After fishing in the Atlantic Ocean on the south side of Montauk for several hours, it returned home, encountering engine trouble on the way. The weather turned stormy, and a northeast wind developed against an outgoing tide, resulting in standing waves of several feet at Endeavor Shoals, just off the Point. The vessel, wallowing in the heavy seas, became unstable in its overloaded state, capsized and then foundered at 2:10 p.m. Nearby vessels were only able to rescue 19 passengers. The wreck was secured by fabled sport fisherman Frank Mundus and towed into Lake Montauk by the Coast Guard. As a result of the disaster, strict new regulations regarding overloading of fishing vessels were adopted nationwide.

In 1957, the Army closed Camp Hero, and it was taken over by the United States Air Force, which in 1958 built a AN/FPS-35 radar. A massive building was erected to house its computers.

====Late 20th century====
In 1959, following the Kitchen Debate between United States Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the designers of the kitchen, including Raymond Loewy, announced plans to sell affordable prefabricated houses, called Leisurama, to be used for second homes. One of the houses was exhibited on the 9th floor of Macy&#x27;s. Two hundred of the houses, the largest installation, were assembled at Culloden Point in Montauk.

In 1967, the United States Coast Guard announced plans to tear down the Montauk Lighthouse and replace it with a taller steel tower. Erosion had reduced its buffer from the edge of a cliff from when it was built to less than . After protests, the Coast Guard backed down from the plan. In 1982, the Air Force base formally closed, and the military began selling its surplus property.

Montauk Friends of Olmsted Parks LLC was established in 1994 to protect an extensive system of beaches and waterfront properties and roadways.

In 1995, Montauk became the birthplace of the extreme surfcasting technique known as skishing. The sport involves donning a wetsuit and flippers and swimming into the ocean with rod and reel to catch fish while drifting offshore.

===21st century===

In October 2007, a fishing boat dragged up a large 19th-century anchor, which was speculated to have been lost by the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; in 1862. In 2008, an unidentifiable carcass known as the &quot;Montauk Monster&quot; was discovered near the hamlet&#x27;s business district, with much speculation as to its identity. In August 2016 OCEARCH designated the waters off of Montauk and the rest of the South Shore of Long Island as a birthing ground for great white sharks.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the hamlet has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.53%, is water.

===Climate===
Montauk has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), under the Köppen climate classification, and using the isotherm, is one of the northernmost locations in North America with this climate type. The presence of the Atlantic Ocean brings warmer winters than inland areas of the same latitude as well as cooler springs and summers: despite an extensive urban heat island and warmer lows throughout much of the year, Central Park in Manhattan, as compared to Montauk, averages twice as many days with a low reaching or below. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. There is of precipitation annually, with a slight dry season in summer and wet season in late fall and early winter. Montauk&#x27;s warm subtropical climate makes it a popular vacation destination in the winter for New Yorkers and people from upstate New York.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service, Montauk is in Plant Hardiness Zone 7b/8a, with an annual average extreme minimal temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit, which allows subtropical plants to grow that would otherwise only be able to grow in the Deep South.

==Economy==
=== Tourism ===

Montauk is considered a beach resort, using its position at the tip of Long Island to promote itself as &quot;The End&quot; or &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, and has become one of the busiest tourist locations in East Hampton. It has many restaurants, bed and breakfasts, and hotels, and is a popular vacation spot in the warm months. Such accommodations are rarer elsewhere in the Hamptons. Many Montauk hotels are only open from April to November, some for shorter time periods, and a few year-round, including Gurney&#x27;s Inn.

Lake Montauk, a small bay on the north side of town, is home to a US Coast Guard station and a small fishing fleet, both commercial and recreational.

In 2007, &quot;Newsday&quot; listed 47 businesses in the category of &quot;Hotel&quot; in Montauk. They represented 2,030 rooms.

Montauk is a favored destination for weekend partiers who, as of 2015, had exceeded the local inhabitants&#x27; tolerance for noise and disruption.

==Transport==
The Montauk station on the Long Island Rail Road provides train service along the Montauk Branch to other parts of Long Island and to New York City, and Hampton Jitney provides bus service to Manhattan. Suffolk County Transit does not operate any fixed-route bus service to Montauk, though the town is part of the East Hampton on-demand zone, which extends as far west as the East Hampton station, the eastern terminus of route 92. On-demand bus service operates 7 days a week between 6 AM and 8 PM, including holidays. Small planes can fly into the Montauk Airport.
