==Name and history==

The township is named after the town of Brimfield, Massachusetts, and is the only Brimfield Township in Ohio. It was formed from survey township Town 2, Range 9 of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The original proprietors were Israel Thorndike of Boston and John Wyles of Hartford, Connecticut, both of whom came to the area in 1816 to view their land and divide it. While neither settled in Brimfield, Thorndike sent his nephew Henry Thorndike to act as his agent and settle in the township. Brimfield was known by a succession of different names during the first few years, mostly in reference the swampy land within its borders. It was first known as &quot;Swamptown&quot;, followed by &quot;Beartown&quot;, &quot;Greenbriar&quot;, and &quot;Wylestown&quot;, before town leaders agreed to name it &quot;Thorndike&quot; at the establishment of the township government in 1818 after Thorndike had agreed to donate land for a town square. Thorndike never followed through on his agreement, so residents petitioned to have the name changed to &quot;Brimfield&quot; in honor of John Wyles, Jr., who had inherited his father&#x27;s land interests and at the time resided in Brimfield, Massachusetts. A post office called Brimfield was established in 1834 and remained in operation until 1907.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

<text>Garrettsville is a village in northeastern Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,449 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area. The village was formed from portions of Hiram, Nelson, Freedom, and Windham townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve.

==History==
Colonel John Garrett III purchased of land in Nelson Township, then part of Trumbull County, in 1803, the year Ohio became a state. The land was purchased for the price of $1,313, or about $4.40 per acre. In July of the following year, he settled on this land with his family and two slave girls, 6 and 10 years old. These settlers constructed a grist mill, which was to open in January 1806. Garrett, however, died that same month.

In 1806, the Cleveland-Pittsburgh Road was constructed near Garrett&#x27;s mill. This improved commerce to the area, and nearby pioneers would mill their grain at the mill, eventually building roads and trails to meet with the Cleveland-Pittsburgh Road. In 1830, the Garrettsville Post Office was established. By 1864, residents in the area around the mill had built up a settlement, which was incorporated as a village on September 1, 1864.

Alvin Karpis robbed a train in Garrettsville in November 1935. Karpis was a member of the Barker-Karpis Gang, and was assisted in the robbery by gang member Harry Campbell and at least one other accomplice. Karpis and his gang stole $30,000, and obtained a private airplane to escape to Hot Springs, Arkansas. Karpis was eventually convicted of his crimes, and was imprisoned at Alcatraz longer than any other inmate.

On March 22, 2014, a large fire broke out downtown, burning approximately one city block and 13 businesses to the ground. The local fire department was assisted by 34 fire departments from surrounding communities. Despite the size of the fire nobody was seriously injured; although one Windham firefighter suffered from smoke inhalation. Rick Patrick is the current mayor of Garrettsville.

===Maple syrup, Crane family===
The Garrettsville-Hiram Chamber of Commerce reports that at the beginning of the 20th century, Garrettsville was the largest center in the world for the processing of maple syrup. This was due largely to the efforts of Arthur Crane, who canned this maple tree product at a cannery on Windham Street. Crane&#x27;s son, Clarence Arthur (C.A.) Crane, grew up in Garrettsville. The younger Crane married Grace Edna Hart in the village on June 1, 1898. In 1899, Grace gave birth to Harold Hart Crane, who later became renowned as a poet.

Clarence Crane and his family left Garrettsville in the 1900s. Clarence continued to work in the maple sugar and candies industry, having started out in the industry working for his father. In 1912, Clarence Crane and his company, the Queen Victoria Chocolate Company, invented Life Savers candy.

<text>Ravenna is a city in and the county seat of Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 11,323 in the 2020 census. It is located east of Akron. Formed from portions of Ravenna Township in the Connecticut Western Reserve, Ravenna was founded in 1799 and is named after the city of Ravenna, Italy. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

==History==
Ravenna was founded by Benjamin Tappan, who arrived there on June 11, 1799, to lay claim in his father&#x27;s name to land purchased in the Connecticut Western Reserve. Tappan did not stay in the area for long, however, but built a settlement of log cabins before returning to Connecticut during the summer of 1800.

Later in 1800, Tappan, newly married, returned to the area where the couple built a log cabin of their own. It was his new wife, Nancy Wright, who suggested that the settlement be named after the city of Ravenna, Italy. Nancy became a driving force for the new town. When plans were announced in 1806 for the formation of Portage County, she lobbied for Ravenna to be made the county seat, and it was selected in 1808. She also convinced other Connecticut families to move to the area. The Tappans, however, left Ravenna in 1809.

Ravenna was initially included in Franklin Township, which was part of Trumbull County at the time. The first mail route was established in 1802 and the first school opened in 1803. In 1810 the first county courthouse and log jail were built. This was later replaced with the first brick courthouse twenty years later in 1830, expanded with an addition in 1881. The current courthouse was built in 1961. The Congregational Church, established in 1822, was the first church to be founded in Ravenna. In 1824, the Methodist Church held its first meeting, which later formally organized in 1831. The Presbyterian and the Disciple of Christ churches were organized in 1830. In 1842, the Catholic Church in Ravenna was dedicated.

In 1831, the Clark Carriage Company, founded by W.D. Clark, first began to produce high-end hearses known for their elaborate workmanship and quality. Thirty years later, the company was purchased by Henry W. Riddle and Charles Merts in 1861, with Riddle being the salesman for the company and Merts running the factory. In 1891, Merts retired and sold his share of the company to Riddle, who, in turn, changed the name of the company to the Riddle Coach and Hearse. After the company began manufacturing motorized hearses, the name changed once again—this time to the Riddle Manufacturing Company. With the highly acclaimed reputation of the Riddle Hearse, two U.S. Presidents from Ohio, William McKinley and Warren G. Harding, would later make them their coach of choice for carrying their remains after their deaths.

In 1848, a glassworks was established, which is now commonly recognized as the first true industry in Ravenna. Rail service first arrived via the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad in 1851. In 1877, the Quaker Oats Company was established in Ravenna with the familiar Quaker Oats logo patented in Ravenna in 1879.

On May 25, 1853, the Ohio Woman&#x27;s Rights Association, founded in 1852 in Massillon, held its first statewide meeting in Ravenna. The attendees helped draft a petition to the Ohio General Assembly, requesting legislation that would grant women more rights.

On February 15, 1861, en route to his inauguration in Washington, DC, President-elect Abraham Lincoln traveled by train through Ravenna. He didn’t plan on speaking but, due to the enthusiastic supporters of the community and a stunning cannon salute, he stepped out of the train and addressed the crowd. A small plaque was placed at the site in 1985 to commemorate the event.

Telephones were first introduced in Ravenna in 1882. In 1898, Ravenna began paving its streets when East and West Main streets received new, paved surfaces. By 1909, nearly 50 passenger trains arrived in the town each day. In 1917, Portage County purchased White Hospital, which eventually became the present day University Hospitals Portage Medical Center.

In 1905, The A.C. Williams Co. was incorporated in Ravenna. Through the 1920s, the company was recognized as the largest cast-iron toy manufacturer in the world.

Since the 1970s, the city has held the Ravenna Balloon A-Fair. Usually held around mid-September, the event attracts hot air balloonists and enthusiasts to Sunbeau Valley Farm in Ravenna Township, just west of the city limits. Besides the hot air balloons, there are also parades, cruise-ins, and live entertainment.

In the late 1990s, the downtown area received a $3 million facelift to restore and preserve the city’s architecture, history, and heritage.

<text>Streetsboro is a city in western Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 17,260 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area. The city was formed from the former Streetsboro Township of the Connecticut Western Reserve.

== History ==

Long before settlers moved into the Connecticut Western Reserve, Seneca Indians traversed the area now called Streetsboro. They used Old Portage Trail, which crosses the southwest corner of the city, to go from Lake Erie to the Ohio River basin.

The founder of Streetsboro Township was Titus Street from Connecticut, who purchased the land in 1798. Streetsboro Township contained . The land was surveyed by Street&#x27;s agents Ralph Cowles and Lemuel Punderson in the summer of 1822, and divided into lots of .

In 1825, a turnpike from Cleveland to Wellsville, Ohio, was laid by Frederick Wadsworth, Samuel Cowles, John Strauyhen, and Titus Street. Street agreed to give enough land to make it through the township. In 1827, the turnpike was completed. It followed much of the route of the present Ohio State Route 14.

Major growth began in Streetsboro with the opening of the Ohio Turnpike on October 1, 1955, with Exit 13 (now known as Exit 187) initially being the only interchange in Portage County. By 1957, with the growth of the automobile industry, Streetsboro experienced a population explosion. Proximity to the Akron and Cleveland areas, along with direct access to Interstate 80 (Ohio Turnpike), Interstate 480, and State Routes 303, 43, and 14, have greatly contributed to the rapid growth of manufacturing, distribution, commercial and residential development in the past 50 years.

In 1968, voters decided to merge the township and the village to become one city consisting of . Streetsboro was primarily a farming community until 1970. Streetsboro was home to a small amusement park, Shady Lake Park, located on Route 14, which is now an apartment complex of the same name.

<text>Sugar Bush Knolls is a village in western Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 217 at the 2020 census. It was formed from portions of Streetsboro and Franklin townships in 1964. The community has the highest median household income in the Akron metropolitan area.

==History==

During the Depression, the Davey Tree Company operated a nursery and experimental tree farm on the site of what is now called the Village of Sugar Bush Knolls. The village was named for the sugar maple trees which originally stood near Lake Martin.

The Davey Company owned the land where the village is now located and kept horses in the barn on Ferguson Road where the Framptons would later live. The company owned the small white house on the corner of Ferguson and Lake Martin Drive. During the early thirties, the company offered to let Charles Miller, one of its employees, and his family move into that house, which had no electricity, telephone, or well.

In 1942 the Millers&#x27; son, &quot;Tuck&quot;, and family moved in with the senior Millers; at this time, the street was just a gravel road and did not extend out to Route 43.

Martin Davey, the president of Davey Tree, arranged to have Lake Martin (named for him), Lake Roger and Lake Quincy dug out of the swampland. Lake Roger was named for William Roger Williams and Lake Quincy for David Quincy Grove, both officers of the Davey Tree Company. Harold Moore was the caretaker of the area used by Davey employees for recreation. A picnic shelter, rowboats, tree swings, and picnic tables were used for the company&#x27;s picnics.

The death of Martin Davey in 1946 ended plans for building the company headquarters on the site. In the 1950s the land was divided into building lots and sold. Local businessman Cyril Porthouse purchased a number of lots and built one of the first homes. He loaned the Village money to have sewers installed so that the village could be developed. Some of the early homes were built by McElhones, Bushes, Longs, Kaisers, and Geldhofs. 
Owing to a longstanding yet highly unusual tradition, it is illegal to eat ice cream on Sundays in Sugar Bush Knolls, with offenders drawing a $10 fine on their first offense and three days in jail for all subsequent offenses. This can be attributed to Martin Davey&#x27;s extreme dislike for &quot;the devil&#x27;s syrup&quot; and his not wanting it consumed on the Lord&#x27;s day.

<doc id="129742" wikidata="Q2242395" url="?curid=129742" title="Windham, Ohio">
<text>Windham is a village in eastern Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,666 at the 2020 census. In 1942, the U.S. government chose Windham as the site of an army camp for workers at the newly built Ravenna Arsenal. As a result, Windham experienced the largest increase in population of any municipality in the nation over the 1940s, at 1,148.7%.

Windham is officially considered part of Akron metropolitan area; however, it is slightly closer to Youngstown than Akron and significantly closer to Warren at away, even closer than the county seat of Ravenna. Due to this, the village also positions itself in relation to cities in the Mahoning Valley. Accordingly, the sole bank in Windham holds membership in the Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce.

==History==

Prior to 1811, the land now comprising the Village and Township of Windham was owned by Caleb Strong, as part of his holdings through the Ohio Company of Associates. On September 11, 1810, a group of sixteen men met in Becket, Massachusetts at the home of Thatcher Conant to discuss the purchase of land in Ohio for settlement. These men, who would be known as the &quot;Beckett Land Company&quot;, consisted of Conant, Elijah Alford, Nathan Birchard, Gideon Bush, Dillingham Clark, Elisha Clark, Isaac Clark, Benjamin Higley, Aaron P. Jagger, Enos Kingsley, Jeremiah Lyman, Bille Messenger, Ebenezer Messenger, Benjamin C. Perkins, John Seely, and Alpheus Streator.

On November 11, 1810, the Beckett Land Company purchased about from Caleb Strong. The land was divided into 100 lots, and allotted according to each family&#x27;s investment in the company. Conant, his wife Elizabeth, Dillingham and Abigail Clark, and Alpheus and Anna Streator donated portions of their allotments near the center of the township for a village green, which was common practice for townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The group of sixteen families then departed from Massachusetts on May 2, 1811. Six weeks later, they arrived in the purchased survey township, which was located immediately south of Nelson Township in the Connecticut Western Reserve. This new township, known today as Windham Township, was survey town 4 in range 6 of the Western Reserve.

The first religious service in the new township was held on July 28, 1811, in the home of one of the settlers. This service was very likely Congregationalist, as several of the families belonged to the Congregational Church in Becket, Massachusetts. The Congregational Church eventually constructed a building on the Green, and today that church still remains on the Green as a member church of the United Church of Christ.

The Windham Historical Society notes that the township was originally named Strongsburg, however, some sources cite the original name as Strongsburgh. The namesake was original landowner Caleb Strong, who was by then the Governor of Massachusetts. There is some discrepancy in how this township came to be known as Windham. According to the Windham Historical Society, the name of the township &quot;was changed to Sharon, by an act of legislature in about 1820….
A few years later the name was again changed to Windham, which it has remained to present.&quot; The Historical Society also cites political concerns as the reason the name was changed from Strongsburg to Sharon. However, on Windham Township&#x27;s website, March 2, 1813 is cited as the date on which &quot;the Township was made a district by itself and the name was changed to &#x27;Sharon&#x27;.&quot; The website goes on to state that in 1820, by an act of legislature, the name was changed again to Windham. Yet another source, &quot;The Ohio Gazetteer, and Travelers&#x27;s Guide&quot;, states that the name was changed from Sharon to Windham in January 1829. Still another source places these dates as 1817 and 1820, respectively. Common to most sources are a few claims which reasonably can be ascertained to be fact:

* Caleb Strong was the original namesake of the township.
* The name of the township was changed from Strongsburg/Strongsburgh, to Sharon, and again to Windham.
* The second name change, from Sharon to Windham, was in honor of Windham, Connecticut—home to at least some of the township&#x27;s original settlers.

On November 22, 1973, a train heading eastbound at 50 mph derailed to a switch being open to an industrial track. Two locomotives and the first twelve cars derailed. The engineer Raymond Wilcox passed away in the accident. During the investigation it was discovered that two juveniles admitted to placing the switch into the reverse direction.

The Village of Windham was incorporated in 1892, and on October 12, 1993, the village officially withdrew from Windham Township.

===Ravenna Arsenal===
In 1940, the United States Department of the Army reserved in eastern Portage County for the construction of two facilities One of these was the Portage Ordnance Depot, which with its twin facility the Ravenna Ordnance Plant became known as the Ravenna Arsenal. Over 14,000 people were employed at the Arsenal during World War II, and the village of Windham was chosen as the site to house many of these workers. Windham experienced a population boom as a result; its growth of over 1100% was the largest of any U.S. municipality in the 1950 Census, as was reported in the June 1951 edition of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Interstate 80 and the Ohio Turnpike pass through the village, although there is presently no interchange in either Windham or Windham Township. Windham&#x27;s location on the toll highway, however, has in recent years caused an expansion of 3G wireless communication services for the people of Windham.

==Culture==
===The Gilboa Bull===

Also referred to as &quot;Big beef cow&quot; in popular culture, the 16-foot fiberglass bull statue was placed at the intersection of State Route 224 and Pearl Street by Gilboa resident Peter Diller in the 1970s. 

At the time the bull was installed, Gilboa was looking for a revival of the town by welcoming visitors into its shops and restaurants. When Diller&#x27;s father was driving in Toledo, Ohio one day, he spotted the bull outside of a bar. He stopped at the bar, and asked if they could sell the bull to him, to which the bar complied. According to Diller, the bull was difficult to transport back to Gilboa, due to its large size. “Its head was so high that we had to jockey around every stoplight,” recalled Diller. “The first stoplight … we hit it right on its forehead.” The bull was put into place and has since been regarded as a symbol of Gilboa&#x27;s resilience as a town. “We wanted something that represented the strength of the community,” said Diller, “and what does that more than a big, strong bull?” 

The statue has since been a landmark for people passing by Gilboa on State Route 224.

=== The Gilboa Quarry ===

The Gilbao Quarry was originally a limestone quarry that opened in the 1890s. It operated as the Ottawa Stone Company until it closed in the early 1980s.

<text>Glandorf is a village in Putnam County, Ohio, United States. The population was 969 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Glandorf was founded by Johann Wilhelm Horstmann and six other men from Glandorf, Germany in 1834. They embarked on the ship &quot;Columbus&quot; on September 7, 1833, in Amsterdam, landed November 6, 1833, in New York, and purchased some land in Putnam County in December. Members of this group were Johann F. Kahle, Wilhelm Gülker, Christian Strop, F. Wischmann, Friedrich Bredeick and Mathias and Friedrich Bockrath. Kahle bought land at Greensburg approximately 5 miles to the west of Glandorf and named it &quot;Maria Camp&quot;. Horstmann&#x27;s land was named Glandorf. Their wives and ten other families from Glandorf followed in 1834. This was just the beginning of further emigration from Germany to Ohio and other US states. After his death on February 21, 1843, Horstmann left his land to the community.

In 1834, Horstmann built a log house to serve as church, school, and rectory. The new parish was placed under the patronage of St. John the Baptist. In 1835, the log house was replaced by a wooden church with a steeple, a bell and a pulpit from hallowed-out sycamore log. A brick church followed between 1846 and 1848. In 1878, the Neo-Gothic church St. John the Baptist was erected and consecrated on December 15. In 1992, a fire started in the sacristy of the church, and the sacristy and its contents were a complete loss. The entire interior had to be repainted. A convent of the German sisters&#x27; order of the Society of the Precious Blood was founded in 1849. They cultivated the land which was originally owned by Horstmann and served as teachers. The convent was abandoned in 1917.

<text>Ottawa is a village and the county seat of Putnam County, Ohio, United States. It is located about southwest of Toledo. The population is 4,456 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

The region was long inhabited by the Iroquoian-speaking Wyandot and Algonquian-speaking Ottawa tribes, who settled along the Blanchard River. In 1792 President George Washington sent Major Alexander Truman, his servant William Lynch, and guide/interpreter William Smalley on a peace mission to the tribes. Truman and Lynch were killed; the date of their deaths was apparently prior to April 20, 1792, at Lower Tawa Town, an Ottawa village. {The Ottawa County Courthouse stands on the site of their killings) A similar mission led by Colonel John Hardin ended with Hardin and his servant Freeman being killed in Shelby County; the tribes resisted European-American encroachment.

During the War of 1812 between the US and Great Britain, numerous tribes allied with the British in the hope of keeping European Americans out of their territories. Unable to resist the continued pressure, in 1817, the tribes ceded a large tract of land in Northwestern Ohio to the United States. Blanchard&#x27;s Fork Reserve was established. The tribes ceded this Reserve in 1831, during the era of Indian Removal, and their land claims in the state were extinguished. The Ottawa population on that Reserve removed to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas in 1832. Within the Reserve, two Ottawa villages existed, of which the Lower Tawa Town was the site of what developed as the village of Ottawa, Putnam County, Ohio.

===European-American settlement===
Among the early settlers of the Ottawa area was Henry Kohls, who arrived in 1835 and settled with his family in the village of Glandorf. In the early 1900s, his grandsons, Charles and Frank Kohls, were each elected Putnam County treasurer in successive two-year stints. Notably, while serving as treasurer, they each appointed the other as their chief deputy.

Ottawa was incorporated as a village in 1861, during the first year of the American Civil War.

<text>Bellville is a village in Richland County in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,963 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlers, James McCluer, and Jonathan Oldfield, came to Bellville in 1808. They made their way from what it now known as Fredericktown by a path made from a tornado. McCluer gained ownership of the land and along with Oldfield he built the first cabin in Bellville on what is now known as Ankneytown Road. Even though they were the first settlers to the town and McCluer owned the land, Robert Bell was the actual founder of the village. Other early settlers included Thomas and Bridget O&#x27;Leary.

McCluer sold the land to Robert Bell in 1815, and Bell began to shape the village of Bellville. The development of Main Street, Ogle Street and Durbin Road began. There were 48 lots in Bellville and a tavern was among the first businesses to be constructed. The first post office came to Bellville in 1824, further helping to put its name on the map. 
Before the post office was built, those who lived in the village had to travel a long distance just to send a letter. The first church was constructed in Bellville map in 1834, though church services had taken place since 1814. Up to this point, people’s homes were being used for church and school. The church was The Methodist Episcopal Church and was organized by Bell and preacher William Oldfield.

The first school started in Bellville shortly after McCluer settled on the land in his own cabin in 1818. At this time school was still limited to boys who had to travel long distances just to get there. Girls had to stay home and tend to household chores. By 1857 a working school started where the Clear Fork Elementary buildings are now. Those buildings are no longer used for school related purposes today.

Commerce in the village began to rise in the 1870s. An electric plant started near the current bike trail and flour mill on route 97. The B&amp;O railroad operated through the path of the bike trail as well. Two hotels started called Hotel Lefevre and Hotel Norris. The year 1877 marked the construction of the town hall and was a place for meetings and those who needed to be jailed. The popular bandstand which is in the middle of Bellville was built in 1879. A doctor&#x27;s office was even developed for tuberculosis patients. Eventually, there were two blacksmith shops, hardware stores, a bakery, four grocery stores, two harness shops, two barber shops, multiple dentists and the Exchange bank in 1872.

Bellville was also well known for being a part of the gold rush. The first gold was panned on Dead Man’s Run, which caused people from all over to come pan for gold. The gold was discovered by James C. Lee. Even though the gold that was found was almost pure, little more was discovered.

Bellville is located at (40.625582, -82.518050), along the Clear Fork of the Mohican River.

<text>Butler is a village in Richland County in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 941 at the 2020 census.

==Early history==

Before Butler was founded and named, it was the site of the Delaware Indians hunting ground. Helltown, as the Indians called it, was chosen for its plentiful wild game and fertile farmlands. As early as 1808, settlers were living in Northeastern Worthington township, however the area that makes up Butler was not settled until another 10 years.
Joseph Craig was the first white man to settle in the Butler area. James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, had given Craig a land grant in 1823. Samuel Lewis, another interesting man, traveled through the area in 1809. On January 7, 1813, Lewis organized and divided Richland area into townships. Butler became Worthington township.
Independence was laid out on the northwest quarter of Section 20, January 12, 1848, by Daniel Spohn. In the early days of its existence it was nicknamed &quot;Spohntown &quot; and &quot; Squeelgut,&quot; but was named Independence by Thomas B. Andrews, rather in a spirit of defiance at the attitude of Bellville, which was not a friendly one to the aspiring village. The name was changed to Butler in the 1870s, after a Mexican war hero, General William Butler. In 1891 the name Independence was changed to Butler to match the post office. Andrews was born in 1807 and arrived in the village on November 15, 1833. Later Daniel Spohn and Andrews had the town laid out. Spohn was born in 1781 and died January 18, 1865, 13 years after the town was founded on January 12, 1848. Andrews was its first Postmaster, and, before the town was laid out, kept the office in his house near the site. After the town was laid out and a warehouse erected, he moved the office into the warehouse. The land upon which the town stands was entered on May 13, 1820, by William Simmons. The town plat was surveyed by Joseph Hastings. Mr. Andrews was instrumental in getting the town established and laying it out, taking a plot of land for pay.

The first store was started by William Lamley, who kept groceries and whisky. It may be remarked here that Independence is a temperance town, and will not allow (since the Bowersox affair mentioned in another chapter) any saloon to exist in the place. Lamley&#x27;s store was a small frame building, near the railroad, in the north end of the town. He afterward erected a building, which is now occupied by Downing as a store, and started a hotel. Joseph Geary kept this hotel, the first in the place. David Teeter erected a second hotel. John Diltz, a carpenter and present Postmaster, erected the next dwelling, and shortly after, Daniel Garber erected a shoe-shop on Main Street. William Clapper erected the next building and kept boarders.

Gen. G. A. Jones came up from Mount Vernon, erected a warehouse, started a store and dealt in produce. In 1856, I. W. Pearce purchased the warehouse of Jones, conducted the business, and was also railroad agent. This gentleman at present keeps the principal store in the place, and does what banking business is necessary.
The Bowersox Saloon was the site of an infamous murder that occurred in 1878 when the keeper of the saloon, Samuel P. Bowersox shot a man outside of his bar. After closing hours, Bowersox became angry by some young men that had been lingering causing disturbance. Bowersox fired a gun into the crowd, killing Alfred N. Palm. Enraged citizens burned down the Bowersox Saloon that night. Bowersox was tried and acquitted, rumor had it that his liquor suppliers in Mansfield bribed the judge to keep the bar open.

When the town was out, the schoolhouse A-frame was a short distance south of town.

In 1868, the present building was erected. It is a two-story frame, and occupied by two teachers and about one hundred pupils.
The B&amp;O railroad played a big part in the town&#x27;s development. The railroad was built in 1853 and it was the only railroad in the United States noted to enter and leave the town from the same direction (west). In 1872, there was two passenger trains that collided killing eight people and injuring 40 more.

In 1877, the village was incorporated, the first Mayor being J. M. McLaughlin; the second and present Mayor, George W. McBee.

There are four dry-goods and grocery stores, one hardware, one stove and tin, and several smaller establishments; two churches, one hotel, and a proper proportion of mechanics and professional men. The population is about four hundred. The place stands in land near the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

<text>Lexington is a village along the Clear Fork River in Troy Township and Washington Township in Richland County in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,848 at the 2020 census.

The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course is located just outside Lexington in Troy Township. This venue hosted an annual round of the CART series from 1990 to 2003, has hosted the IndyCar Series since 2007, previously hosted the NASCAR Xfinity Series, hosts Honda Super Bikes, and Vintage Bikes in addition to a few other annual high-profile events.

==History==
Lexington was founded by Amariah Watson Jr. in 1812, a land speculator who had purchased wide lands locally in order to sell to other settlers. During the 1800s, Lexington had many taverns, hotels, and grist mills — most of which at one time or another burned to the ground. In the 19th century, leading members of the community were William Cockley Thad and Martin Kell, Les Griebling, Erwin Castor, Sgt. Patrick Gass, and Jacob Cook. The first road constructed through town was what is now State Route 97, and the second was what is now Lexington-Ontario Road.

Lexington was first inhabited by the Delaware, Wyandot and Mohawk Indians. These tribes inhabited long houses in permanent villages and cultivated crops such as corn, beans, and squash to complement their diet of hunted meat and foraged berries and herbs. The Indians were friendly with Watson when he and his family moved into the area until Watson&#x27;s pig ate their baby. The Indians demanded Watson&#x27;s newborn daughter, who was the first white child born in Lexington, as replacement to their own. Watson settled the argument by agreeing to give the Indians the pig instead. Watson chose to name his new home Lexington. He chose this out of respect for his father who fought in the Revolutionary War of which the first battle was fought in Lexington, Massachusetts. In 1813, Watson built a water-powered sawmill along the Clear Fork River. The mill made work easier and attracted more and more settlers. Business owners used the gristmills for their woolen and saw mills and also distilleries.

The first tavern was built in 1815 by Jacob Cook. It was called &quot;Cook&#x27;s Tavern&quot; and the first grocery store was built in 1825 by William Damsell. It was in 1839 that Lexington was recognized as a village by the federal government. In 1850 the railroad made its path through Lexington and this contributed to much of the business activity and travel for the settlers. Also by 1850 Lexington was booming and anyone could get anything they needed from Lexington and its resources. By 1853 there were over 50 established businesses in Lexington, many of which competed with each other, providing superior products and services to their customers.

The cemetery is on land originally owned by Amariah Watson himself. It wasn&#x27;t until 1857 that the village fenced it in to allow a more safe resting place. The sexton house was built in 1863 and the row of maple trees was later planted in 1889. The Lexington Square was once decorated with a Civil War Gatling gun. In 1958 the village of Lexington donated the gun to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and it can still be found there today.

A structure still standing in Lexington from 1843 is known as the &quot;Old Stone House&quot;. It was built by James Gass and was host to many runaway slaves traveling along the Underground Railroad. The owners today believe that slaves were hidden in a secret closet. Benjamin Gass took 11-12 slaves in a wagon to Springfield Township and those slaves eventually made their way to Canada. A farm on Texter Road owned by Samuel McClure was also part of the underground railroad and George Mitchell hid slaves in his home and water-powered mill, located near the intersection of today&#x27;s routes 97 and 314. Many more families in Lexington helped and hid slaves making their way to freedom. While there is no list of names there was a protracted court case against certain citizens who were charged with helping slaves.

Harry F. Smith is another figure worthy of taking note in Lexington&#x27;s history. Smith grew up in Lexington and is responsible for the first outdoor lighting system that was powered by steam in 1894. Smith later founded Smith Gas Power Company which was Lexington&#x27;s largest business at the time and then he sold it to General Motors in 1918. After retirement Smith was involved in helping create Lexington&#x27;s water system and became known as the &quot;Father of the Clear Fork Reservoir&quot;.

<text>Lucas is a village in southeastern Richland County, Ohio, United States. Lucas is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 589 at the 2020 census.

==History==
David Tucker, a New Hampshire resident, moved to Richland County in 1819, where he set in a proposal to buy land in the rural country of the county. He was granted this proposal in 1824, allowing him to buy land from the state at $1.25 per acre. After purchasing a mass quantity of land from the state, Tucker hired Mr. Steward to survey the land for auctioning out. David&#x27;s brother, John, was placed in charge as the head attorney authored to sell land to incoming settlers and pioneers in 1829. The auction was advertised in the local handbill &quot;The Mansfield Shield and Banner&quot;, in which the land was described as &quot;as good as a wheat growing country as the state can have.&quot; In response to this statement, the land for three major wheat mills was bought that year and mills were built in the following months. The town officially built and commissioned a postal office later that year. In 1830, the Chicago Railroad Company paid for tracks to be laid down on the south side of town of the town as well as a depot. By 1834, the Lucas area was full of houses and shops, becoming a major rural center for Richland County, mostly due to being the first town in the county to receive federal aid in its building because the land where Lucas presided was a campsite of General John Brooks as he marched north from Mansfield during the War of 1812, thus qualifying it as a historical site at the time. Currently three theories exist on how the Village of Lucas acquired its name:
# The town was named after the current at the time and 12th governor of Ohio, Robert Lucas.
# The town was named in honor of Governor Lucas&#x27;s brother, a major land owner for the town.
# The town was named in honor of the Tucker brothers&#x27; mother&#x27;s maiden name, Lucas.
However the name came to be, the town of Lucas was officially established according to Ohio standards at the time in 1836.

==Geography==

<text>Mansfield is a city in and the county seat of Richland County, Ohio, United States. The population was 47,534 at the 2020 census. Located approximately from Cleveland and Columbus via Interstate 71, it is part of Northeast Ohio region in the western foothills of the Allegheny Plateau.

The city was founded in 1808 on a fork of the Mohican River in a hilly region surrounded by fertile farmlands, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location with numerous railroad lines. After the decline of heavy manufacturing, the city&#x27;s economy has since diversified into a service economy, including retailing, education, and healthcare sectors.

The city anchors the Mansfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 124,936 residents in 2020, while the Mansfield–Ashland–Bucyrus, OH Combined Statistical Area had 219,408 residents. Mansfield is the largest city in the Mid-Ohio region. Its official nickname is &quot;The Fun Center of Ohio&quot;; Mansfield is also known as the &quot;Carousel Capital of Ohio.&quot;

== History ==

=== Early history and founding ===
Mansfield was laid out and founded by James Hedges, Joseph Larwell, and Jacob Newman, and was platted in June 1808 as a settlement. It was named for Colonel Jared Mansfield, the United States Surveyor General who directed its planning.

It was originally platted as a square, known today as the public square or Central Park. During that same year of its founding, a log cabin was built by Samuel Martin on lot 97 (where the H.L. Reed building is now), making it the first and only house to be built in Mansfield in 1808. Martin lived in the cabin during the winter and illegally sold whiskey to Indians, which compelled Martin to flee the country. James Cunningham moved into the cabin in the year of 1809. At that time, there were less than a dozen settlers in Richland County and Ohio was still largely wilderness.

Two blockhouses were erected on the public square during the War of 1812 for protection against the North American colonies and its Indian allies. The block houses were erected in a single night. After the war ended, the first courthouse and jail of Richland County were located in one of two blockhouses until 1816. The blockhouse was later used as a school with Eliza Wolf being its teacher.
Mansfield was incorporated as a village in 1828 and then as a city in 1857 with a population of 5,121. Between 1846 and 1863, the railroads came to the city with the Sandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad being the first railroad to reach Mansfield in 1846, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in 1849, and the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in 1863. The city was a center of manufacturing and trade in the late 1880s thanks to the four railroads that passed through the community.

Dozens of manufacturing businesses operated in the city, producing goods like brass objects, doors, linseed oil, paper boxes, suspenders, and numerous other items. Mansfield&#x27;s largest employer in 1888 was a cigar maker, Hautzenroeder &amp; Company, that had 285 workers employed. In 1888, Frank B. Black borrowed $5,000 from relatives to start a brass foundry, the Ohio Brass Company, specializing in brass and bronze castings, stem brass goods, electric railway supplies and more. By 1890, 13,473 people lived in the city.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
By 1908, the blockhouse became a symbol of Mansfield&#x27;s heritage during its 100th birthday celebration, and in 1929, the blockhouse was relocated to its present location at South Park.

The Mansfield Tire and Rubber Company was founded in the city in 1912, producing tires for automobiles.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Mansfield tire brand stood shoulder to shoulder with Goodyear, Goodrich, Firestone and Uniroyal, the &quot;Big Four&quot; tire name brands in the industry at the time. The Mansfield Tire and Rubber Company continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s, before its production started to decline in the 1970s. The company declared bankruptcy in the early 1980s, after closing in 1979, leaving 1,721 workers out of a job.

In 1913, parts of Mansfield were flooded when the Great Flood of 1913 brought of rainfall across Ohio between March 24 and 25. The first road across America, the Lincoln Highway, came to the city in 1913, smoothing the path for economic growth. In 1924, Oak Hill Cottage, a Gothic Revival brick house, built in 1847 by John Robinson, superintendent of the Sandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad was the setting of &quot;The Green Bay Tree&quot;, Mansfield native Louis Bromfield&#x27;s first novel.

In 1927, the 9-story Leland Hotel was constructed downtown on the southwest corner of Park Avenue West and South Walnut Street at a cost of $556,000. The Leland Hotel was the tallest building in Mansfield when completed, and was designed by architect Vernon Redding, that also designed the Mansfield Public Library, Farmers Bank Building, Mansfield Savings Bank Building and Mansfield General Hospital. The hotel was razed in 1976 to make way for a parking lot. What remains of the Leland Hotel today is the hotel&#x27;s compass rose that was embedded in the sidewalk along Walnut Street where the front door of the hotel once was.

Like many cities in the Rust Belt, the 1970s and 1980s brought urban blight, and losses of significant household name blue-collar manufacturing jobs. In recent years, Mansfield&#x27;s downtown, which once underscored the community&#x27;s economic difficulties, has seen innovative revitalization through the establishment of Main Street Mansfield (known today as Downtown Mansfield, Inc.), and is a site of new business growth. In 1993, Lydia Reid was sworn in as the city&#x27;s first female mayor and became the longest-serving mayor of Mansfield encompassing three four-year terms. Reid was succeeded in 2007 by Donald Culliver, the city&#x27;s first black mayor.

In December 2009, the city was placed on fiscal watch by the state auditor citing substantial deficit balances in structural operating general funds. On August 19, 2010, Mansfield would become Ohio&#x27;s largest city to be declared in fiscal emergency with a deficit of $3.8 million after city officials failed to pass measures on cost-savings and cut spending, blaming it on the Great Recession. The city&#x27;s financial crisis lasted nearly four years before being lifted out of fiscal emergency on July 9, 2014.

== Economy ==
Mansfield&#x27;s greatest period of industrial development was led by the city&#x27;s home appliances and stove manufacturing industries, including Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Tappan Stove Company. Westinghouse was the city&#x27;s largest employer in the late 1950s, with over 8,000 employees, specializing in electric lighting, industrial heating and engineering, and home appliances. In 1990, when Westinghouse was known as Mansfield Products Company (Laundry Division of White-Westinghouse), there were 643 employed when it closed.
However, like many cities in the rust belt, Mansfield experienced a large decline in its manufacturing and retail sectors. Beginning with the steel Recession of the 1970s, the loss of jobs to overseas manufacturing, prolonged labor disputes, and deteriorating factory facilities all contributed to heavy industry leaving the area. Mansfield Tire and Rubber Company, Ohio Brass Company, Westinghouse, Tappan and many other manufacturing plants were either bought-out, relocated or closed, leaving only the AK Steel plant in Mansfield as the last remaining heavy industry employers. The AK Steel Mansfield Works production facility, formerly Armco Steel, was the location of a violent 3-year United Steelworkers Union lock-out and strike from 1999 to 2002. On June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that its Ontario stamping plant (Mansfield-Ontario Metal Center) would close in June 2010.

With the loss of the jobs, locally owned businesses in downtown Mansfield closed, as did much of the retail built in the 1960s along Park Avenue West (formerly known as &quot;The Miracle Mile&quot;) and Lexington Avenue. New big-box retail, shopping strips and franchise restaurants have been built in the adjacent suburban city of Ontario, which has replaced Mansfield as the retail hub for Richland County and north-central Ohio.
The city has sought to diversify its economy to become less dependent on its struggling manufacturing sector. Remaining manufacturers in Mansfield include steel manufacturer AK Steel, Honda supplier Newman Technology Incorporated, generator manufacturer Ideal Electric Company (formerly Hyundai Ideal Electric Company), thermostats manufacturer Therm-O-Disc, pumps manufacturer The Gorman-Rupp Company, carousel manufacturer The Carousel Works, Inc., business process outsourcing company StarTek, educational products supplier School Specialty, Inc. has a distribution center in Mansfield, and Mansfield Engineered Components, a designer and manufacturer of motion control components for the appliance, transportation, medical casegoods and general industrial markets. Mansfield&#x27;s healthcare industry includes OhioHealth (formerly MedCentral Health System), the city&#x27;s largest employer and the largest in Richland County. The hospital is the city&#x27;s primary provider of health care and serves as the major regional trauma center for north-central Ohio.

Mansfield is also home of three well-known food companies. Isaly Dairy Company (AKA Isaly&#x27;s) was a chain of family-owned dairies and restaurants started by William Isaly in the early 1900s until the 1970s, famous for creating the Klondike Bar ice cream treat, popularized by the slogan &quot;What would you do for a Klondike Bar?&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s Restaurants is a chain of root beer stands started by Frank Stewart in 1924, famous for their Stewart&#x27;s Fountain Classics line of premium beverages now sold worldwide. The Jones Potato Chip Company, started by Frederick W. Jones in 1945 and famous for their Jones Marcelled Potato Chips, is headquartered in Mansfield.

=== Film industry ===

From the 1950s through the 1970s, Mansfield was the home of the infamous Highway Safety Foundation, the organization that created the controversial driver&#x27;s education scare films that featured gruesome film photography taken at fatal automobile accidents in the Mansfield area. The films include &quot;Signal 30&quot; (1959), &quot;Mechanized Death&quot; (1961), &quot;Wheels of Tragedy&quot; (1963), and &quot;Highways of Agony&quot; (1969). In addition, the Highway Safety Foundation produced other controversial education films including &quot;The Child Molester&quot; and &quot;Camera Surveillance&quot; (both 1964).

In 1962, The Highway Safety Foundation loaned camera equipment to the Mansfield Police Department to film the escapades of some of the city&#x27;s homosexual men, who met for sexual relations in an underground public restroom on the north side of Central Park. The men filmed were charged under Ohio&#x27;s sodomy law, and all served a minimum of one year in the state penitentiary. The resulting footage, combined with overdubbed audio commentary by officials of the Mansfield Police Department, was eventually compiled by HSF as the 1964 film &quot;Camera Surveillance&quot;. Video artist William E. Jones of Massillon, Ohio, obtained copies of the original footage shot by the Mansfield Police Department. Jones transferred the grainy color footage of the original police surveillance films to video and removed the police commentary, presenting it as a silent piece entitled &quot;Tearoom&quot; (2007). Jones&#x27; film was featured in an exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 2008.

Mansfield has also been used as a location for several big-budget Hollywood movies; among the most notable of these were &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;&quot;Air Force One&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, all of which featured the Ohio State Reformatory as a backdrop in pivotal scenes.

Robert F. Simon (1908–1992), an American character actor who appeared in film and on television from 1950 to 1985, was born in Mansfield.

== Transportation ==
=== Highways and roads ===
Mansfield is located on a major east–west highway corridor that was originally known in the early 1900s as &quot;Ohio Market Route 3&quot;. This route was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Mansfield was a major influence on the development of the city. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1928, the Lincoln Highway through Mansfield on Park Avenue East and Park Avenue West became U.S. Route 30.

On September 1, 1928, the Lincoln Highway was marked coast-to-coast with approximately 3000 concrete posts set by the Boy Scouts of America. Each post featured a medallion of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s profile. One of these concrete markers was erected at curbside in front of Central Methodist Episcopal Church, 378 Park Avenue West. It now stands in downtown&#x27;s Central Park, on Park Avenue&#x27;s center divider. The Lincoln Highway Association observed the highway&#x27;s centennial in June 2013. The celebration&#x27;s eastern transcontinental tour group visited Mansfield for an overnight stay on June 25 at the Holiday Inn on Park Avenue West, the highway&#x27;s route through the city.

Mansfield is connected to the Interstate Highway System. Three highway exits from Interstate 71 connects Mansfield to Columbus, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio, Louisville, Kentucky, and points southwest, and to Cleveland, Ohio, to the northeast.

Two divided highways serve Mansfield. Ohio 309, which connects travelers from the major shopping area of the suburban city of Ontario and points west, and continues east into Mansfield before it merges into U.S. Route 30. Ohio 13 turns into a four-lane divided highway at South Main Street and Chilton Avenue and runs to Interstate 71 (full-access interchange) and runs another and turns back into a two-lane highway just north of Bellville.

The city has several arterial roads. U.S. Route 42 (Ashland Road and Lexington Avenue), North U.S. Route 42 downtown (South Main Street, East 2nd Street, Hedges Street and Park Avenue East), South U.S. Route 42 downtown (Park Avenue East, Hedges Street, East 1st Street and South Main Street), Ohio 13 (North Main Street and South Main Street), North Ohio 13 downtown (East 2nd Street, South Diamond Street and North Diamond Street), South Ohio 13 downtown (West 5th Street, North Mulberry Street, South Mulberry Street and West 1st Street), Ohio 39 (Springmill Street, North Mulberry Street, West 5th Street, East 5th Street, Park Avenue East and Lucas Road), Ohio 430 (Park Avenue East and Park Avenue West), and Ohio 545 (Wayne Street and Olivesburg Road).

Designated truck routes known as Truck U.S. Route 42/Truck Ohio 430 (Adams Street and East 5th Street) exist around the downtown area for semi-tractor-trailer trucks due to the height clearance at the Norfolk Southern Railway subway overpass (also known to locals as the Park Avenue East underpass or the subway) that was constructed in 1924 passes over U.S. Route 42/Ohio 430 (Park Avenue East). According to city officials, trucks that happen to be over get stuck under the subway about five to six times a year on average due to not following advanced warning signage. Ohio 13 also has a truck route known as Truck Ohio 13 north (East 1st Street, Adams Street and East 5th Street) and Truck Ohio 13 south (East 5th Street, Adams Street and East 2nd Street) to help keep semi-truck traffic out of downtown Mansfield&#x27;s Historic Carousel District.

=== Railroads ===
Three railroads previously served Mansfield, but currently only two, the Norfolk Southern and the Ashland Railway, provide service in the area.

The Sandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad opened in 1846 and became part of the Washington-Chicago main line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) and then later part of a B&amp;O branch line from Newark to Sandusky. In 1849 the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway (later Pennsylvania Railroad mainline) reached Mansfield, and in 1863 the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad (later Erie Railroad mainline) reached Mansfield.

Passenger services operating into the opening of the 1970s were the Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s Chicago-Hoboken, New Jersey &quot;Lake Cities&quot; (discontinued, 1970); and the Penn Central&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan Limited&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania Limited&quot; (both discontinued, 1971, at the transfer over to Amtrak).

After the B&amp;O branch line was abandoned, the section from Butler to North Lake Park in Mansfield was opened in 1995 as the recreational Richland B&amp;O Trail. The former B&amp;O track from Mansfield to Willard combined with a piece of the abandoned Erie Railroad east of Mansfield to West Salem to form the L-shaped Ashland Railway (1986). A spur of the abandoned Erie Railroad leads west to Ontario to what used to be the General Motors metal stamping plant there.

<text>Ontario is a city in Richland County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 6,656. It is part of the Mansfield metropolitan area.

It was founded in 1834 on the western edge of the Allegheny Plateau, just west of the city of Mansfield. After being incorporated in 1958, Ontario became a heavy manufacturing center because of the Erie Railroad line, and its proximity to Mansfield. However, its status in that regard began to decline in the late 20th century, when much of the Erie Railroad that once ran through the city was abandoned; and shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. The city&#x27;s industry has since diversified into the service economy, including education, finance and healthcare. The city is also a major regional retail hub serving the entire North-Central Ohio area, with a shopping population of over 150,000.

==History==
Ontario was founded by Hiram Cook, and was platted in December 1834 as a settlement in Springfield Township near Mansfield. During that same month thereafter, the original settlement of Ontario merged with New Castle, another small settlement that was originally located just to the west of the Ontario settlement along the Mansfield and Bucyrus route (known today as State Route 309) that had just been laid out and platted. New Castle was named for Henry Cassell, while others stated that it was named in honor of Newcastle upon Tyne, a city in England. Ontario was named after Ontario County, New York, the native place of the founder of the town. In 1863, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad (later Erie Railroad mainline) reached Ontario and a train station was built, but was later demolished after much of the railway was abandoned in the late 20th century.

The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Ontario in 1913 was a major influence on the development of the town. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1928, the Lincoln Highway through Ontario became U.S. Route 30.

In 1956, General Motors built a large Fisher Body stamping plant in Springfield Township and on June 25, 1958, the residents voted to incorporate Ontario into a village to bring the new General Motors plant into Ontario. In 1960, the new Ontario High School was built, complete with an indoor swimming pool, a theatre, 3 shops, and numerous high-tech classrooms and labs for college-preparatory studies. New school construction and renovation has continued over the years, and today the Ontario School District is the main district.

The arrival of both General Motors and the Richland Mall to Ontario was the beginning of the eventual shift of commerce and industry from the adjacent rust belt city of Mansfield to the new suburb-satellite town of Ontario. On June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that its Ontario stamping plant (Mansfield-Ontario Metal Center) will close in June 2010. Several annexations have been made to Ontario since its incorporation and millions of dollars have been spent on public infrastructure including streets, water and sewer facilities, parks, schools, and new civic buildings for Administrative offices, Public Safety Departments and the Water Department. The city administration offices have been housed in several different locations including the &quot;Old Library&quot; which is now being used as a Senior Center. In 1986, the city&#x27;s offices were moved to the newly constructed Charles K. Hellinger Municipal Building. On April 30, 2001, Ontario became a city with a population over 5,300.

Since the 1960s, Ontario has been a location of choice for residential development, due in part to its civic administration, its school system, and significant commercial and industrial development.

==Transportation==

===Railroads===
In 1863, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad (later Erie Railroad mainline) reaches Ontario, but was abandoned in the late 20th century. Today, only a spur of the abandoned Erie Railroad remains. It leads west from the Norfolk Southern Railway in Mansfield to what used to be the General Motors metal stamping plant in Ontario.

===Highways===
Ontario is located on a major east-west transportation corridor that was originally known in the early 1900s as &quot;Ohio Market Route 3.&quot; This route was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1928, the Lincoln Highway became U.S. Route 30. In later years, however, the northern route that ran from Ontario to Delphos (now the Lincoln Highway) was improved and became U.S. Route 30N, while the southern route that ran from Ontario to Delphos (now State Route 309) became U.S. Route 30S. In 1974, the divided routes were removed with U.S. Route 30N, becoming U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 30S would become State Route 309. In 2005, the newly upgraded section of U.S. Route 30, a four-lane limited access highway between Bucyrus and Ontario open to traffic.

Ontario is connected by four major highways, U.S. Route 30, which connects Mansfield and Interstate 71 to the east with Bucyrus to the west, State Route 309, which connects Mansfield to the east with Galion to the west, State Route 314, which connects Shelby to the north with Chesterville to the south, and State Route 430 (Park Avenue West) connecting Ontario to downtown Mansfield.

Busy thoroughfares in Ontario are; Park Avenue West (State Route 430), West Fourth Street, Walker Lake Road, Home Road (along the eastern city limits at Mansfield), and Lexington-Springmill Road, which connects Springmill and State Route 39 to the north with Lexington to the south.

===Public transit===
The Richland County Transit (RCT) operates local bus service five days a week, except for Saturdays and Sundays. The RCT bus line operates 9 fixed routes within the cities of Mansfield and Ontario along with fixed routes extending into the city of Shelby and Madison Township.

<text>Shiloh is a village in Richland County in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of the Mansfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 619 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Shiloh was platted in September 1852 at the junction of the Sandusky and Mansfield Railroad, the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad, and a road between the cities of Tiffin and Wooster. It was originally named &quot;Salem Station&quot; because of its proximity to the village of Salem, which ceased to exist soon after the newer community was founded. In 1862, the name was changed to &quot;Shiloh&quot;, but the reasons for the change are unclear: in 1908, some local citizens testified that it was named in honor of the Battle of Shiloh, a Civil War battle fought in 1862, while others stated that it was given in memory of the biblical Shiloh. In 1874, Shiloh was incorporated as a village. Two railroads provided substantial commerce by the end of the century, and natural gas deposits supplied the village with its energy needs and small amounts of gas for export to surrounding communities.

One Shiloh location, the Silas Ferrell House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="129779" wikidata="Q7917678" url="?curid=129779" title="Vea">
<text>Vea was a Puerto Rican celebrity gossip magazine that was published weekly from 1969 to 2009. It was founded by Enrique Pizzi Galindo and Roberto García.

As a periodical that reported on the lives and activities of many of the island&#x27;s entertainment, sports, and political personalities, the magazine was no stranger to controversy. In 1994, a discovery by a &quot;Vea&quot; employee caused a wide international controversy, when the employee came across some documents that Puerto Rico was the actual birthplace of famous Mexican singer, Luis Miguel, and not Mexico, as it had been widely believed prior to the discovery.

The magazine also featured film and theater reviews, TV-guide listings, hit-song lyrics, and recipes. It also conducted TV show popularity surveys to select the most widely viewed TV shows on Puerto Rican television, known as &quot;Encuesta Vea&quot;. Participants had to fill a coupon published inside the magazine, list on it their favorite TV shows, and mail it in for a chance to win prizes. The magazine ran many other contests, including a raffle to win one of the historic-period gowns worn by actress Von Marie Mendez in &quot;Telemundo&#x27;s&quot; acclaimed Puerto Rican telenovela &quot;Tanairi&quot;.

Noted &quot;Vea&quot; journalists included Belén Martínez Cabello, Roberto Ramos-Perea (the magazine&#x27;s theater critic) and Helda Ribera-Chevremont, among others.

Other competitor &quot;small-format&quot; Puerto Rican entertainment gossip magazines included &quot;Teve Guía&quot; (Puerto Rico&#x27;s version of &quot;TV Guide&quot;), &quot;Artistas&quot; (1977-1994, founded by Jose Antonio Mellado and Miguel A.Lopez Ortiz), and &quot;Estrellitas&quot; (Founded in 1975 by Hugo del Cañal and José Antonio Mellado), a small-format version of &quot;Estrellas&quot;, another Puerto Rican entertainment gossip magazine focused on film, television, music and theater.

<text>Chillicothe ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Ross County, Ohio, United States. The population was 22,059 at the 2020 census. Located along the Scioto River 45 miles (72 km) south of Columbus, Chillicothe was the first and third capital of Ohio. It is the only city in Ross County and the center of the Chillicothe micropolitan area. Chillicothe is a designated Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

==History==

The region around Chillicothe was the center of the ancient Hopewell tradition, which flourished from 200 BC until 500 AD. This Amerindian culture had trade routes extending to the Rocky Mountains. They built earthen mounds for ceremonial and burial purposes throughout the Scioto and Ohio River valleys.

Later Native Americans who inhabited the area through the time of European contact included Shawnees. Present-day Chillicothe is the most recent of seven locations in Ohio that bore the name, because it was applied to the main town wherever the Chalakatha settled. Other population centers named Chillicothe in Ohio at one time include: one located at present-day Piqua, in Miami County; one located south of present-day Circleville, Pickaway County, on the Scioto River; a third about north of Xenia in Greene County, Ohio; a fourth at present-day Frankfort, Ross County, on Paint Creek; and a fifth also located in Ross County, at Hopetown, three miles north of modern Chillicothe.

In 1758 a settlement was established at this site by Shawnee Indians who had abandoned their village of Lower Shawneetown in November of that year. A group of Shawnees from Logstown also joined them.

After the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 forced the Native Americans from most of Ohio, European settlers came to the area. Migrants from Virginia and Kentucky moved west along the Ohio River in search of land. The community Chillicothe was founded in 1796 by a party led by General Nathaniel Massie on his land grant. The town&#x27;s name comes from the Shawnee &quot;Chala·ka·tha&quot; (Chillicothe in English), meaning &quot;principal town&quot;, because it was the chief settlement of that division (one of five major divisions) of the Shawnee people.

In 1798, Ross County became incorporated with Chillicothe as the county seat. Chillicothe was named the capital of the remnant Northwest Territory in 1800, when Indiana Territory was split off, and the Northwest Territory was reduced to Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana. In 1802 as Ohio moved toward statehood, the city hosted the Ohio Constitutional Convention. It served as the capital of Ohio from statehood in 1803 until 1810 then again from 1812 to 1816.

Ohio was a free state, and early migrants to Chillicothe included free blacks, who came to a place with fewer restrictions than in the slave states. They created a vibrant community and aided runaway slaves coming north. As tensions increased prior to the breakout of the American Civil War, the free black community at Chillicothe maintained stations and aid to support refugees on the Underground Railroad. The Ohio River was a border with the slave states of the South, with slaves crossing the river to freedom, and then up the Scioto River to get more distance from their former homes and slave hunters. White abolitionists aided the Underground Railroad as well.

On May 12, 1948, a C. &amp; O. engine suffered a boiler explosion due to a low water level near Chillicothe, Ohio. The train&#x27;s engineer, fireman and front brakeman were killed.

==Arts and culture==

===Majestic Theatre===
Chillicothe is home to the 158-year-old continuously operating Majestic Theatre. Its stage has been graced by such greats as Laurel and Hardy, Milton Berle, George Arliss, Sophie Tucker, Bob Hope and many others. In 1853 the Masonic Hall was built, as the first incarnation of what is now the Majestic Theatre.
The two-story brick building was a combination lodge room, dance hall, and theater. Stock companies stayed for as long as a month, performing a repertory of plays. In 1876 the Masons appointed a building committee to enlarge their building. The original building was and was later extended to . Upon completion in December 1876 it was announced that the Masonic Opera House was one of the finest theaters in the state. After the remodeling and with the completion of the Clough Opera House across the city, theater offerings were tremendous, and varied drama, comedy, farce, minstrel shows, and operas were presented.

In 1904 A. R. Wolf bought the Masonic Opera House. Mr. Wolf remodeled the theater and enlarged the stage. He replaced all the windows in the front of the building with stained glass. The Masonic Opera House continued under Wolf&#x27;s managerial abilities until he sold it to the Myers Brothers in 1914. They again made some improvements and repairs and installed a movie screen and equipment. The Myers Brothers changed the name to the Majestic Theatre. They occasionally had live theater productions on the stage but finally switched exclusively to motion pictures.
In July 1971, Harley and Evelyn Bennett became the new owners of the Majestic Theatre. They did careful restoration with reference to the original wall painting.
Three Chillicothe businessmen (Robert Evans, Robert Althoff and David Uhrig) bought the theater as a non-profit organization in 1990. All new wiring throughout the theater, fire safety, and security systems were installed.

==Parks and recreation==

Chillicothe has several public parks, including Yoctangee Park, Patrick Park, Poland Park, Strawser Park, Manor Park, Goldie Gunlock Park, Pine Street Park, Veterans Memorial Park, and Western View Park.

The biggest park, Yoctangee Park, consists of numerous baseball /softball fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, and playground equipment.

This path connects to the Tri-County Triangle Trail which currently is 30.3 miles long, measured from Bridge St. (SR 159) in Chillicothe, passing through Frankfort and then to Christman Park near Washington Court House in Fayette County, Ohio. The Tri-County Triangle Trail&#x27;s goal is to connect Chillicothe and Greenfield. This same former railroad continues to Jamestown and Xenia, but those connections are a long range plan.

<text>South Salem is a village in Ross County, Ohio, United States. The population was 219 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1842, local Presbyterian minister Hugh Stewart Fullerton orchestrated the establishment of a school in southwestern Ross County. Known as the &quot;Salem Academy,&quot; this school became the foundation of the present village: landowner John Sample platted South Salem in 1846 in order better to serve the students and teachers of the school. After two years of rapid growth, the village reached the point that it could easily serve the needs of the school, and growth ceased. Although South Salem incorporated in the 1870s, few other changes occurred during the late years of the nineteenth century. In 1917, its population was deemed to be between 350 and 400 residents, a size that had remained consistent since the 1850s. The Salem Academy (by then known as the &quot;South Salem Academy&quot;) closed in 1907 due to competition from other schools, and since that time, the village has declined in population.

<text>Clyde is a city in Sandusky County, Ohio, United States, located southeast of Fremont. The population was 6,294 at the time of the 2020 census. The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Clyde as a Tree City USA.

The town is known for having served as inspiration for the setting of Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s 1919 collection of short stories &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;.

==History==
In the 1700s, the area of Ohio, including present-day Clyde, was inhabited by the Wyandot tribe. The distinction of first settler of Clyde goes to Jesse Benton. Claims that the first settler was Samuel Pogue are not entirely wrong as sometime during the war of 1812, Pogue drove a stake near the spring in the west part of Clyde with the intention of settling there after the war concluded. When Pogue returned in 1820 to take formal possession of the land, he found Jesse Benton had already built a cabin on the land. Shortly after Pogues arrival, Benton ceded his claim of the land to Pogue for a barrel of whiskey. Pogue lived in the Benton cabin until his death in 1828.

Clyde was named after Clyde, New York.

Early in the 20th century, Clyde joined the automobile revolution, hosting the pioneering brass era company, Elmore Manufacturing Company. Elmore was taken over by General Motors in 1909 and operations were moved to Detroit in 1919. However, Louis Krebs resigned from Elmore when General Motors took over and formed his own company which later became the Clydesdale Motor Truck Company. After General Motors moved out, Krebs acquired their site in Clyde for his own operations. The buildings, by this time owned by Clyde Porcelain Steel, burned down on November 11, 1945.

The Whirlpool Corporation purchased the Clyde Porcelain Steel Co. in 1952. It began producing washing machines there and then purchased the adjacent property of the Bendix Corporation in 1954, which produced belt-driven washing machines, making it the sole producer of washing machines in the area for the next six decades.

President Donald Trump visited Whirlpool Corporation in Clyde on August 6th, 2020, as part of the 2020 United States presidential election campaign. Trump was the first president to visit Sandusky County in over 100 years.

===Cancer cluster===

In 2006, the Ohio Department of Health recognized that the incidence of child cancer cases in the Clyde area was abnormally high, and in 2007, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency started investigating possible causes. After the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency carried out soil tests in the Whirlpool Corporation&#x27;s former corporate park, Whirlpool Park, in Green Springs, Ohio, it was apparent that soil on the property contained polychlorinated biphenyls. Whirlpool Corporation faced two lawsuits as the park is perhaps the most well known suspected cause of the cluster. This lawsuit was dismissed in 2014, and the other, &quot;Sandusky County v. Whirlpool Corporation&quot;, was withdrawn in 2015. In January 2016, the EPA reported that Whirlpool Park had been cleared of PCB contamination.

<text>Fremont is a city in and the county seat of Sandusky County, Ohio, United States, along the Sandusky River. It is about southeast of Toledo and west of Sandusky. The population was 15,930 at the 2020 census.

The city was the home of Rutherford B. Hayes, who served as President of the United States from 1877 to 1881. The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center was the first presidential library and is one of the focal points of the city. The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Fremont as a Tree City USA since 1986.

==History==

Fremont is located on the former site of Junquindundeh, a historic Wyandot village on the west bank of the lower Sandusky River, near the falls and about upstream from its mouth at Sandusky Bay. French merchants established a trading post there in the 1750s, but British forces took over the trading post and rest of the area after their victory in the French and Indian War.

In 1787, the newly independent United States created the Northwest Territory to include all land west of the Ohio River. In 1803 the southeastern portion of the Northwest Territory was admitted to the Union as the new state of Ohio. Under the terms of Ohio&#x27;s statehood, the area of Lower Sandusky was defined as Indian Territory. American settlers who entered the area were in violation of the 1795 Treaty of Greenville, which was meant to preserve at least some land for the Native Americans. During the War of 1812 the United States Army considered removing by force the white settlers who were violating the Treaty of Greenville, but they did not carry out the threat.

Tensions with Great Britain increased in the early 1800s, and the United States government declared a boycott on all trade with the British, including those in Canada. The U.S. Army built Fort Sandusky near the river to protect an important supply depot. The post&#x27;s name was changed to Fort Stephenson during the War of 1812. In August 1813, British forces attacked and the Battle of Fort Stephenson took place. Major George Croghan and his U.S. Army garrison successfully fought off the invaders.

With the return of peace, a settlement grew up around the fort and became known as Lower Sandusky, since it was located on the lower part of the Sandusky River. In 1821 Lower Sandusky was designated as the county seat of Sandusky County. The town gradually increased in size, with the primary occupations being shipbuilding, fishing, and agricultural processing. Sandusky Bay leads to Lake Erie, and there was good fishing for walleye in the river, which return annually to spawn upriver. By the 1830s, the population included more white settlers, despite the area being a declared reserve only for Native Americans. Numerous Wyandot people still lived in the area, and some runaway African American slaves had made it their home after reaching safety in the free state of Ohio. The city had grain and sawmills, and the first sugar mill in Ohio.

In 1849 the residents changed the name of Lower Sandusky to Fremont, to honor John C. Frémont, who helped acquire California during the Mexican–American War.

In 1873, a few years before gaining national office, future president Rutherford B. Hayes moved into a family mansion in Fremont called Spiegel Grove, which was built by his late maternal uncle. That year Hayes announced his uncle Sardis Birchard&#x27;s bequest in his will, donating property in his estate worth $50,000 to the City Council in order to establish a public library. It opened the following year on Front Street. A few years later, a new building was constructed for it in 1878 on the grounds of the Fort Stephenson State Park, per his bequest. It is now known as the Birchard Public Library of Sandusky County. Spiegel Grove was incorporated into the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, founded in 1916 as the first presidential library in the United States.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fremont became a major center for the production of cutlery, with several manufacturing plants, as well as other industries. The cutlery industry has declined, but the city still has a large Heinz plant for producing ketchup. In 1999, the ketchup factory saw a $40 million expansion.

===Commemoration of Battle of Fort Stephenson===
The city set aside Fort Stephenson Park to preserve and commemorate the site of the fort that had a role in the War of 1812. Only its stone foundations are still visible. In 1885 the Sandusky County Soldiers Monument was installed in the park near Croghan Street, which was named after the commanding major of the fort. (He was promoted to colonel afterward for his success.) Former president Rutherford B. Hayes attended the ceremony.

In 1906 Colonel Croghan&#x27;s remains were brought from his hometown in Kentucky to Fremont and reinterred under the Soldiers Monument. In the same ceremony, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) unveiled a plaque to the Soldiers Monument to commemorate Croghan and his garrison in their victory in the Battle of Fort Stephenson.

What is now the main building of the Birchard Public Library, which serves the entire county, was constructed in 1878 in Fort Stephenson Park, by the terms of the bequest from Sardis Birchard, who bequeathed $50,000 in assets to endow a public library in 1873. The first facility opened in 1874 in a building on Front Street.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Two long-distance US routes run through Fremont, U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 20. State Routes 12, 19, 53 and 412 also pass through or terminate in the Fremont area. SR 53 roughly parallels the path of the Sandusky River, designated as a state scenic river, to its mouth at Sandusky Bay.

None of these routes passes through Fremont but were constructed outside. They are multiplexed on a bypass of the city, most of which is 4 lanes. The bypass has both grade-level crossings and controlled-access interchanges. Prior to completion of the bypass in the late 1950s, all of these routes passed through Fremont. Their former alignments are currently signed as &quot;City Route (number)&quot;, with the number being that of the predecessor highway.

The Ohio Turnpike, another long-distance east–west route, passes approximately 4 miles north of the city. The Turnpike is signed as Interstates 80 and 90. Exit 91 (originally Exit 6) links the Turnpike to Fremont via State Route 53.
Industry is served by the Norfolk Southern railroad. In the city, it uses parts of two defunct railroads as spurs to factories.

<text>Woodville is a village in Sandusky County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,006 at the 2020 census. The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Woodville as a Tree City USA.

==History==
Woodville was laid out and platted in 1836. It was named for General Amos E. Wood.

Woodville was the midway point on the Western Reserve and Maumee Turnpike, which was also known as the &quot;Old Mud Pike&quot; because of the thick mud that often mired animals and vehicles alike. It was the first permanent route across the Black Swamp. The toll road connected Perrysburg with Lower Sandusky, which has since been renamed Fremont.
A mile marker from the road remains at 100 East Main Street, in front of the village pharmacy. Several of the milestones are still in place along the stretch between present day Fremont and Perrysburg. The route is currently designated U.S. Route 20.
It is advised to travel at 19mph continuously when traversing Woodville. This is the only chance you have of correctly navigating the 6 different speed limits present during the short 2 mile town. Otherwise, you will be among the thousands of tourists the Woodville police department preys upon to keep their roads in pristine condition. 
Woodville is also the point at which U.S. 20 crosses the Portage River. The former Pennsylvania Railroad also crossed the Portage River in Woodville. The line was at one time a main route from Toledo to Pittsburgh.

To the north of Woodville lies Woodville Road emanating from Toledo, passes through Genoa, ending in Elmore. It does not pass through Woodville.

A half mile upstream from the highway and the rail bridges lies Trailmarker Park. This is site of a shallow point in the river where Native Americans routinely crossed the Portage. A tree that was bent by Native Americans to mark the crossing point had a large limb that stretched over the west bank of the river, just south of the Cherry Street bridge. However, the limb was mistakenly removed by village workers in the 1990s.

State Route 105 also runs through Woodville.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Woodville and the surrounding Woodville Township are part of the Woodmore Local School District. Until 1968 Woodville had its own school district and the athletic teams were known as the Warriors, with a Native American mascot. In 1968, Woodville&#x27;s school absorbed the Harris-Elmore Local Schools and the name of the district was changed to Woodmore. Elmore&#x27;s athletic teams formerly competed as the Bulldogs.

Immediately following the consolidation, students attended classes through fifth grade in their hometown, or the village nearest to their homes. A portion of the school in Woodville was used as a Middle School for grades 6-8 and the Elmore building was used as the High School for all students. In the early 1980s, all students in grades K-6 began attending school in Woodville and all students in grades 7-12 were moved to the high school in Elmore.

Most of the high school was demolished, rebuilt and opened for the 1990–91 academic year. The original portion of the Elementary School dates back to 1923. A new school building in Woodville is under construction and will house K-8. It is expected to be complete for the 2015–16 academic year.

Woodmore High School athletic teams are called the Wildcats and compete in the Northern Buckeye Conference.

Woodville has a public library, a branch of the Birchard Public Library Of Sandusky County.

There are three public parks in Woodville: 
Trailmarker Park is the largest. It is located along the west bank of the Portage River and is home to a public pool, several pieces of playground equipment and a boat ramp.
Veterans Memorial Park is also referred to locally as Waterworks Park because of its proximity to the water treatment plant on North Perry Street. The park features a memorial to soldiers, complete with a decommissioned cannon and is located on First Street between Walnut and Perry Streets. Playground equipment is also in place at Veterans Memorial Park.
Busdiecker Park was originally named Teardrop Park because of its shape. It is located at the intersection of Main Street (U. S. 20) and Findlay Road and is also bounded by the Portage River. Busdiecker Park features 13 flagpoles, one for each of the astronauts killed in the United States space program at the time of the park&#x27;s renaming in the mid 1990s.

<text>Otway is a village in Scioto County, Ohio, United States. The population was 92 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A post office called Otway has been in operation since 1861. The town site was platted on March 29, 1884. The village was named after Thomas Otway, an English dramatist. Otway was incorporated in 1890.

Trains traveling from Portsmouth to Cincinnati would stop at the Norfolk &amp; Western train depot located in Otway. In 1956, the depot was moved across the tracks and converted into a convenience store as roads were used more and more for travel instead of trains.

On March 2, 2012, a tornado with winds upwards of 75 mph, swept through southern Ohio. Otway&#x27;s fire department building, along with two houses, were damaged. Also damaged was one of Otway&#x27;s emergency response vehicles, but through a donation from the Uniopolis Fire Department, the vehicle was quickly replaced with a 1983 pumper tanker truck.

<text>Portsmouth is a city in and the county seat of Scioto County, Ohio, United States. Located in southern Ohio south of Chillicothe, it lies on the north bank of the Ohio River, across from Kentucky and just east of the mouth of the Scioto River. The population was 18,252 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Portsmouth micropolitan area.

==History==
===Foundation===
The area was occupied by Native Americans as early as 100 BC, as indicated by the Portsmouth Earthworks, a ceremonial center built by the Ohio Hopewell culture between 100 and 500 AD.

According to early 20th-century historian Charles Augustus Hanna, a Shawnee village was founded at the site of modern-day Portsmouth in late 1758, following the abandonment of Lower Shawneetown.

European-Americans began to settle in the 1790s after the American Revolutionary War, and the small town of Alexandria was founded. Located at the confluence, Alexandria was flooded numerous times by the Ohio and the Scioto rivers.

In 1796, Emanuel Traxler became the first person of European descent to permanently occupy land in what would later be known as Portsmouth, after the United States gained its independence.

In 1803, Henry Massie found a better location slightly east and somewhat removed from the flood plains. He began to plot the new city by mapping the streets and distributing the land. Portsmouth was founded in 1803 and established as a city in 1815. It was designated as the county seat. Settlers left Alexandria, and it soon disappeared. Massie named Portsmouth after the town of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

The Ohio state legislature passed &quot;Black Laws&quot; in 1804 that restricted movement of free blacks and required persons to carry papers, in an effort to dissuade blacks from settling in the state. These provisions were intermittently enforced by local governments and law enforcement, and sometimes used as an excuse to force African Americans out of settlements. In 1831, Portsmouth drove out African Americans from the city under this pretext. Many settled several miles north in what became known as Huston&#x27;s Hollow, along the Scioto River. Its residents, especially Joseph Love and Dan Lucas, provided aid to refugee slaves in the following years and assisted them in moving north.

Although southern Ohio was dominated in number by anti-abolitionist settlers from the South, some whites also worked to improve conditions for blacks and aid refugee slaves. Portsmouth became important in the antebellum years as part of the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves from Kentucky and other parts of the South crossed the Ohio River here. Some found their future in Portsmouth; others moved north along the Scioto River to reach Detroit, Michigan, and get farther away from slave catchers. Many continued into Canada to secure their freedom. A historical marker near the Grant Bridge commemorates this period of Portsmouth&#x27;s history. James Ashley of Portsmouth continued his activism and pursued a political career. After being elected to Congress, he wrote the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery in 1865 after the American Civil War.

Portsmouth quickly developed an industrial base due to its location at the confluence of the Ohio and Scioto rivers. Early industrial growth included having meat packing and shipping facilities for Thomas Worthington&#x27;s Chillicothe farm, located north of Portsmouth on the Scioto River. Its growth was stimulated by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal in the 1820s and 1830s, which provided access to the Great Lakes, opening up northern markets.
The construction of the Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W) railyards beginning in 1838 and the completion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) junction at the city in the late 1850s quickly surpassed the canal in stimulating growth. The railroads soon carried more freight than the canal, with the B&amp;O connecting the city to the Baltimore and Washington, DC markets. By the end of the 19th century, Portsmouth was one of the most important industrial cities on the Ohio River between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. It became an iron and steel factory town with new companies like the Portsmouth Steel Company.

===20th century===
The city&#x27;s growth continued. By 1916, during World War I, Portsmouth was listed as being a major industrial and jobbing center, the nation&#x27;s fourth-largest shoe manufacturing center, and the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturer of fire and paving bricks. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel (later called Empire-Detroit Steel) employed over 1,000 people. 100 other manufacturing companies produced goods from furniture to engines.

Such industrial and shipping growth greatly benefited Boneyfiddle (a west-end neighborhood in Portsmouth), where grand buildings were constructed with the wealth from the commerce. As time passed, much of the commerce began to move toward Chillicothe Street, which has remained Portsmouth&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

The city population peaked at just over 42,000 in 1930. In 1931, the Norfolk Southern Corporation built a grand, art deco passenger station at 16th and Findlay streets that provided a substantial entry to the city. Passengers used the station for access to both interstate and intrastate train lines, which provided basic transportation for many. The widespread availability of affordable automobiles and changing patterns resulted in reduction in rail passenger traffic here and nationally. The station was later used for offices and its keys were turned over to Scioto County in 2003, and the building was demolished in 2004.

Suburbanization also affected the city. By the 1950 census, the population had begun to decline, falling below 40,000. Some of this change was due to the effects of highway construction, which stimulated suburban residential development in the postwar years. But during the late 20th century, foreign competition and industrial restructuring resulted in the loss of most of the industrial jobs on which Portsmouth&#x27;s economy had been based; the jobs moved out of the area, with many going overseas.

Further decline occurred in 1980 after the suspension of operations at Empire Detroit Steel&#x27;s Portsmouth Works, which took place after the sale of the steel plant to Armco Steel. Armco Steel closed the plant because it did not want to replace the obsolete open hearth furnaces with more efficient basic oxygen steel furnaces. The plant also needed a continuous caster to replace the obsolete soaking pits and blooming mill in 1995. When the steel mill closed, 1,300 steelworkers were laid off.

===21st century ===

As of 2010, Portsmouth has a population of approximately 20,000. It has shared in the loss of jobs due to unskilled labor outsourcing and population migration to more populous urban areas. Despite its relatively small size, Portsmouth has been a regular stop for recent presidential campaigns. In September 2004, George W. Bush visited the city as part of his reelection campaign. Vice-presidential candidate John Edwards also visited Portsmouth that month. During the 2008 campaign, numerous candidates and surrogates visited Portsmouth, and some spoke at Shawnee State University: Bill Clinton on behalf of Hillary Clinton, Republican nominee John McCain, and U.S. Senator Barack Obama, who won the election. In 2012, candidate Mitt Romney spoke at Shawnee State University. In March 2016, Bill Clinton visited Portsmouth again to campaign for Hillary Clinton. In August 2017, U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke at a rally at Shawnee State University.

Portsmouth and other parts of Scioto County have worked to redevelop blighted properties and create a new economy. Along with adapting disused residential properties, Portsmouth has begun the process of transforming abandoned industrial and commercial properties to other uses.

The city has initiated new developments in its downtown. The Ohio Legislature passed House Bill 233 on April 20, 2016, to authorize cities to create Downtown Redevelopment Districts. They operate similarly to a Tax Increment Finance (TIF) District. Portsmouth formed a Downtown Redevelopment District (DRD) in 2017 in the Boneyfiddle neighborhood to increase investment and development there.

Through the early 21st century, there has been a noticeable increase in investment in Portsmouth&#x27;s local economy. New investments and developments in the local economy led to Portsmouth&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Site Selection Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Top 10 Micropolitan areas&quot;. Celina, Defiance and Portsmouth were among a group of cities tied for 10th. Portsmouth attracted nine significant economic development projects in 2016, nearly as many as it had from 2004 to 2013 combined.

In 2014, Portsmouth was one of 350 cities to enter a submission in the America&#x27;s Best Communities competition, hoping to win the $3 million first place prize. In April 2015, Portsmouth was chosen as one of the 50 quarter-finalists, winning $50,000 to help prepare a Community Revitalization Plan. In January 2016, Portsmouth&#x27;s plan, which emphasized using its most valuable asset, the Ohio River, as a key to revitalizing the city, earned it one of 15 spots in the competition&#x27;s semifinals. In April 2016, Portsmouth was one of seven cities eliminated at the semifinal round, but received an additional $25,000 for use in continuing to develop its plans to improve commercial and community access to the riverfront by making the port a premier regional destination for industrial development, small business development, and riverfront recreation.

In 2019, Portsmouth was named Hallmarks&#x27; Hometown Christmas Town. The Friends of Portsmouth group held the annual Winterfest celebration event that brought Christmas lights, vendors, ice skating, carriage rides, tree lighting, and more to Market Square.

==Geography==

Portsmouth is at the confluence of the Ohio, Scioto, and Little Scioto rivers. It is a midway point among four major cities: Charleston, West Virginia; Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; and Lexington, Kentucky, each of which is about 90 miles away (roughly a two-hour drive).

Much of the terrain is quite hilly due to dissected plateau around it. Both rivers have carved valleys and Portsmouth lies next to both the Scioto and Ohio rivers. It is within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

In November 2002, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in nearby Piketon, Ohio, was recognized as a Nuclear Historic Landmark by the American Nuclear Society. It served a military function from 1952 until the mid-1960s, when the mission changed from enriching uranium for nuclear weapons to producing fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant ended enriching operations in 2001 and began to support operational and administrative functions and perform external contract work. The site is being cleaned up for future development by Fluor/ B&amp;W.

==Arts and culture==
===Buildings and landmarks===

Many historical buildings in Portsmouth have been demolished because of poor upkeep, other city development, or the completion of new buildings that replaced the landmarks. Landmarks that have been demolished include the old Norfolk &amp; Western rail depot, churches dating back to the early 20th century, houses dating to the 1850s, Grant Middle School, and the old Portsmouth High School and various elementary schools.

Many buildings survive from the early 19th century. Old churches are among the reminders of Portsmouth&#x27;s past and identity. The historic 1910 Columbia Theater was destroyed by a fire in 2007, demolished, and rebuilt in 2012 as the open-air Columbia Music Hall, with a refurbished façade from the original structure serving as the entry point. Other noted historic buildings include the old monastery, which can be seen for miles, and Spartan Stadium, as well as numerous buildings in the Boneyfiddle Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1982, Miami University students conducted research on several of Portsmouth&#x27;s most important historic buildings. This work resulted in an exhibition at the Miami University Art Museum and a book, &quot;Portsmouth: Architecture in an Ohio River Town.&quot;

In October 2016, a Shawnee State University professor submitted a proposal to the State Farm Neighborhood Assist grant program to preserve Spartan Municipal Stadium. The stadium opened in 1930 as the original home of the Portsmouth Spartans, now the fifth-oldest active franchise in the National Football League (as the Detroit Lions). In November 2016, the city won a $25,000 State Farm Neighborhood Assist grant for the stadium&#x27;s renovation.

===Library===

The Portsmouth Public Library is the city&#x27;s library, founded in 1879. It has branch libraries throughout Scioto County. The Southern Ohio Museum, founded in 1979, has more than 60 exhibits, including artwork by Clarence Holbrook Carter and Jesse Stuart, China dolls, Native American artifacts, and works by local artists.

===Floodwalls===

Although developed on higher ground, the city has been subject to seasonal flooding. It had extensive flooding in 1884, 1913, and 1937. After the flood of 1937, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a floodwall protecting the city, which prevented two major floods in 1964 and 1997.

In 1992, Portsmouth began honoring some of the many accomplishments of its area natives by placing a star on the riverside of the floodwall. This is known as the Portsmouth Wall of Fame and was instituted by then-mayor Frank Gerlach. Honorees include Don Gullett, Al Oliver, and Dan Quayle, who is not a Portsmouth native.
In 1992 a nonprofit group headed by Louis R. and Ava Chaboudy was formed to investigate developing a mural-based tourist attraction on the floodwall. In 1993, muralist Robert Dafford was commissioned and began painting murals of Portsmouth&#x27;s history. He hired local art student Herb Roe as an assistant. Roe apprenticed to and worked for Dafford for 15 years. The project eventually spanned sixty tall consecutive Portsmouth murals, stretching for over 2,000 feet (610 m). The murals cover subjects from the area&#x27;s history from the ancient mound building Adena and Hopewell cultures to modern sporting events and notable natives.

===Indian Head Rock===
The Indian Head Rock is an eight-ton sandstone boulder that until 2007 rested at the bottom of the Ohio River. Historically, the boulder was used to record low river stages. It is notable due to its history and the figures and names of people carved into the rock at times of low water levels. In 1917, the construction of a dam downriver from Portsmouth meant that the rock would forever be submerged, if not for its recovery by a group of local divers led by an Ironton historian. The rock&#x27;s removal led Kentucky and Ohio into a legislative battle to determine its ownership and disposition. The rock was returned to Kentucky in 2010.

=== Guinness World Records ===
Portsmouth&#x27;s leaders and citizens have organized to win certification for several Guinness World Records for the city. In 2018, the &quot;Friends Plant Portsmouth&quot; participants shattered the record for the most people simultaneously potting plants. Later that year, Portsmouth beat Waukesha, Wisconsin, the previous world record holder, for the most people simultaneously Christmas caroling, which now stands at 1,822 carolers. They also beat the previous record for most people wrapping Christmas presents simultaneously.

==Parks and recreation==

Portsmouth has 14 parks for residents and community use. These include Alexandria Park (Ohio and Scioto River confluence), Bannon Park (near Farley Square), Branch Rickey Park (on Williams Street near levee), Buckeye Park (near Branch Rickey Park), Cyndee Secrest Park (Sciotoville), Dr. Hartlage Park (Rose Street in Sciotoville), Labold Park (near Spartan Stadium), Larry Hisle Park (23rd Street &amp; Thomas Ave.), Mound Park (17th &amp; Hutchins Streets), York Park (riverfront), Spartan Stadium, Tracy Park (Chillicothe &amp; Gay Streets), and Weghorst Park (Fourth &amp; Jefferson Streets).

Portsmouth&#x27;s Spock Community Dog Park, named after a K9 who died protecting his partner, is a recreational dog park implemented in 2019 that gives people a place to walk their dogs and have leisure time.

A new skate-park, designed by Spohn Ranch Skateparks, is planned for construction in the near future.

===Pools===
The McKinley Swimming Pool, on Findley Street, was built during the Civil Rights era in memory of Eugene McKinley, a 14-year-old who drowned. Portsmouth&#x27;s other pool in the area (that has long since closed) was owned by the Terrace Club, and was commonly referred to as the &quot;Dreamland Pool&quot; by community members. The Terrace Club&#x27;s pool was still segregated despite the progress of the Civil Rights movement, which influenced Portsmouth&#x27;s institutional makeup, as well as protests across the nation. During the 1960s, Portsmouth made institutional changes to attempt to include the black community. With the pool&#x27;s construction delayed and the African American community having nowhere to swim in the area, despite the Civil Rights Act&#x27;s passage, a protest called the wade-in occurred at Dreamland Pool on July 17, 1964. The next summer, in 1965, the Board of Directors of the Terrace Club pool unanimously removed its ban on African Americans and reopened under the name Dreamland Pool. The McKinley Pool, which opened in 1966, still remains and represents Portsmouth&#x27;s reform and the struggle against the laws of the Jim Crow Era.

===Greenlawn Cemetery===
Greenlawn Cemetery, established in 1829, is 40 acres in size and is Portsmouth&#x27;s only public cemetery. It incorporates several smaller cemeteries, including City, Evergreen, Hebrew, Holy Redeemer, Hill North (Methodist), Hill South (Robinson), Old Mausoleum, Soldiers Circle, and St. Marys. The cemetery is at Offnere Street and Grant Street. The city maintains it.

==Sports==
Portsmouth had a series of semi-pro football teams in the 1920s and 1930s, the most notable being the Portsmouth Shoe-Steels, whose roster included player-coach Jim Thorpe.

From 1929 to 1933, the city was home to the Portsmouth Spartans, which joined the National Football League (NFL) in 1930. Early in that season, the Spartans competed in the first professional football night game, shutting out the visiting Brooklyn Dodgers 12–0 on September 24, . Despite their on-field success, being based in the NFL&#x27;s second-smallest city during the Great Depression meant the team was in constant financial trouble. This forced the sale of the team and its relocation to Detroit in , where it became the Detroit Lions.

In the late 20th century, the Portsmouth Explorers were one of the original teams in the Frontier League, a non-affiliated minor league baseball organization. The Explorers played in the league&#x27;s first three seasons, from 1993 to 1995. In 1938, Portsmouth was also the home of the Portsmouth Red Birds, a minor-league team owned by the St. Louis Cardinals.

In the late 1990s, Portsmouth was home to the Superstar Wrestling Federation before its demise. More recently Revolutionary Championship Wrestling has made its home in Portsmouth, airing on local TV station WQCW. Revolutionary Championship Wrestling in Portsmouth has featured such stars as Big Van Vader, Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, Demolition Ax, &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton, &quot;Wildcat&quot; Chris Harris, and Ivan Koloff.

==Government==
===City government===

The city charter was adopted on November 6, 1928. The city conducts business at City Hall, which was constructed in 1935. City council meetings are held in the second and fourth weeks of the month. The city reverted from being run by a city manager to a mayor in 1988, with the mayor elected every four years.

In 2012, voters approved returning to a Council/City Manager form of government; this took effect in 2014. Under the City Manager/Council system, the mayor and vice-mayor are elected members of the city council who are appointed to their positions by the council. The city manager is hired by and reports directly to the council. The city manager oversees the day-to-day operations of city government and is the direct supervisor of all city department heads. There are six wards in the city, with elections of council members from the wards every two years.

The City Manager is Sam Sutherland.

===County government===

Portsmouth is Scioto County&#x27;s county seat. The courthouse is at the corner of Sixth and Court Streets and was constructed in 1936. The sheriff&#x27;s office and county jail, once in the courthouse, are in a facility constructed in 2006 at the former site of the Norfolk and Western rail depot near U.S. 23.

The county commissioners are Scottie Powell, chairman; Bryan K. Davis; and Cathy E. Coleman. The county commissioners meet twice weekly on Tuesday and Thursdays at 9:30 am in room 107 on the first floor of the Scioto County Courthouse.

=== Response to the opioid epidemic ===
In the late 1990s, an opioid epidemic of prescription drug abuse swept the region. This caused an accelerated increase in social instability and crime. One of the most prevalent drugs was oxycodone, a synthetic opiate known colloquially as &quot;oxy.&quot;

In May 2011, the Ohio Senate and House unanimously passed a bill cracking down on pill mills (signed into law by John Kasich) authored by Portsmouth&#x27;s state representative Terry Johnson. Shortly thereafter, the DEA and state and local law enforcement agencies worked to identify and shut down a pharmacy and several doctors who had prescribed hundreds of thousands of opiates over a two-year period by suspending their license to practice medicine.

In a 2019 investigative story, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that fentanyl was replacing oxycodone as the preferred opioid.

==Education==
===Postsecondary===

Shawnee State University is a public university and the southernmost member of the University System of Ohio. In 1945, Ohio University established an academic center in Portsmouth. In 1986, a legislative charter introduced by Vern Riffe to establish Shawnee State University was signed into law by Governor Richard Celeste. Shawnee State University offers associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in a variety of disciplines. Other majors are nursing, business administration, sociology, biology, and psychology. Seven master&#x27;s degrees and a doctorate are also offered.

SSU serves almost 3,000 matriculated undergraduates, as well as several hundred grad and post grad students.

Located in downtown Portsmouth, SSU has a 62-acre campus. Its 28 buildings include the Vern Riffe Center for the Arts, Clyde W. Clark Planetarium, Morris University Center, and James A. Rhodes Athletic Center. The university&#x27;s library was named the Clark Memorial Library in 1997. Clark Planetarium features the Hubble Space Telescope Viewspace system. The university has on-campus housing for 934 students. All first-year students must live in university housing unless they are married, veterans, over age 23, or living with their parents.

The Shawnee State &quot;Bears&quot; are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) since the 2010 The Bears compete in 13 intercollegiate varsity sports, including baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. In 2021, the men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Lewis–Clark State to become NAIA national champions.

Clubs on campus include the Art Club, Chemistry Club, Fantanime, Geology Club, History Club, International Game Developer&#x27;s Association (IGDA), Political Science Club, Pre-Med Club, Sexuality and Gender Acceptance (SAGA), and an international group, the Other World Society.

===Primary and secondary===

Portsmouth has one public and two private school systems (the Notre Dame schools and the Portsmouth STEM Academy). The Portsmouth City School District has served the city since its founding in the 1830s and is the city&#x27;s public school. Portsmouth City School District has a storied basketball tradition, winning four OSHAA state basketball championships in 1931, 1961, 1978, and 1988. The Trojan basketball team has made 14 final four appearances, in 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929, 1931 (1st), 1934 (2nd), 1939, 1941, 1961 (1st), 1978 (1st), 1980 (2nd), 1988 (1st), 1990 (2nd), and 2012 (2nd). The Trojan football team has also produced some notable teams, with an Associated Press Division 3 State Championship in 2000, a regional title, and state semifinal appearance in 2000, and finishing as regional runner-up in 2001 and 2002. The Trojans football team has sent five teams to the post-season since 2000, as of the start of the 2009 season.

In 2000, Portsmouth voters passed a school bond issue to help construct new schools for the district. The new schools opened for the 2006–07 school year. These schools won the Grand Prize from School Planning &amp; Management&#x27;s 2007 Education Design Showcase. The award is awarded annually to the K-12 school that displays &quot;excellence in design and functional planning directed toward meeting the needs of the educational program.&quot; In addition, the school system plans to build a new $10 million athletic complex. Portsmouth High School has an award-winning Interactive Media program that has won multiple awards for both video and graphic design. The class is under the direction of Chris Cole and the students run the local cable station TNN CH25.

In 2009, the school system completed construction on a new $10 million athletic complex. The Clark Athletic Complex has a new football field, baseball field, softball field, tennis courts, and track. The complex is named for Clyde and Maycel Clark of the Clark Foundation, major financial contributors for the construction of the facility. The complex, on the site of the former high school building and across the street from the current high school, has three paintings by muralist Herb Roe, a 1992 Portsmouth High School alumnus. The murals depict three of the sports played at the new facility: baseball, tennis, and football.
Notre Dame High School, formerly Portsmouth Central Catholic High School, has served the city&#x27;s Roman Catholics and others since 1852. It is also notable for its football team, founded in 1929. It won two state championships, in 1967 and 1970.

<text>New Riegel is a village in Seneca County, Ohio, United States. The 2020 census enumerated 286 residents at that time.

==History==
Prior to 1850, New Riegel was variously known as Schindler (named for German immigrant Anton Schindler [1790-1851]) and as Wolf&#x27;s Creek (purportedly due to the large number of wolves that roamed local woodlands). In 1850, Schindler subdivided his land into 43 lots, which he collectively named for his hometown of Riegel, Germany. Historically, New Riegel was inhabited by Roman Catholic immigrants from Germany, who created a mission community under the patronage of the famous eighth-century Anglo Saxon missionary to present-day Germany, Boniface. Local Roman Catholic immigrants from Switzerland, France, Belgium and Luxembourg were also drawn to the mission prior to creating their own church communities in nearby Frenchtown and Alvada.

Beginning in 1844, the community was served for more than 150 years by the Precious Blood Missionaries and the Precious Blood Sisters of Switzerland. The latter began educating the children of the village in 1845 and continued that ministry for more than a century.

Completed in 1878, the present-day Saint Boniface Catholic Church (now a chapel of All Saints Catholic Church) is the tallest feature in the village and resembles many of the churches built throughout rural northwest Ohio in the late 19th-century, including the churches in nearby Frenchtown and Alvada.

For many years, Mary of the Crib Convent, an equally large structure occupied by the Precious Blood Sisters, stood to the north of the church, until it was destroyed by fire on June 24, 2001.

Many of the nuns and some of the priests and brothers who served the community are buried at St. Boniface Catholic Cemetery, which contains more than 2,750 marked graves. The priests lived in a red brick rectory built in 1904 to the south of the church, and the elementary school completed just south of the rectory in 1927, still stands as well. This school was built to replace the old school house to the north of the church (on the site of the present-day church parking lot), which was razed in 1927.

With the advent of public education in New Riegel in 1876, New Riegel Local Schools rented the church&#x27;s elementary school until January 2003, when a new PK-12 school was completed. Prior to renting the parish facility, the public school system operated a German school on the site of the present-day city hall (to which the village jail was later attached in 1883), then at a brick school house built in 1911 just west of the present-day American Legion hall. Until the 1990s, the children of New Riegel were bused to the parish facility at 8:00 a.m., for daily mass or religious education, followed by public school instruction in the same facility beginning at 8:30 a.m.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<text>Republic is a village in Seneca County, Ohio, United States. The population was 556 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1834, Sidney Smith hired R.M. Shoemaker of Cincinnati to survey a new town at the corners of sections 15, 16, 21, and 22 in Scipio Township. He called it &quot;Republic,&quot; though it was known by many early settlers simply as &quot;Scipio Center.&quot;

With the arrival of a rail line from Sandusky in 1841, Republic became a popular trading center. Stores, warehouses, shops, and factories sprang up almost overnight. A second rail line was contemplated to run between Republic and Melmore in Eden Township.

When the old Seneca County courthouse at Tiffin burned on May 21, 1841, efforts were made to designate Republic as the county seat, but these were unsuccessful. Republic&#x27;s fortunes began to decline when the new Cincinnati, Sandusky &amp; Cleveland Railroad bypassed it to make a straight run to Tiffin.

The town was stimulated by the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The railroad passes via an arch bridge over what is now State Route 19. On January 4, 1887, just west of town on the railroad was the site of an accident designated the &quot;Republic Horror&quot; when the westbound B &amp; O &quot;Express No. 5&quot; collided head on with a stalled eastbound freight train.

Republic&#x27;s motto is &quot;Small in Size, Big in Heart.&quot; Written by Seneca East student Michelle Wheatley, it was selected in a contest of popular submissions.

<text>Tiffin is a city in and the county seat of Seneca County, Ohio, United States. Developed along the Sandusky River, Tiffin is located about southeast of Toledo. The population was 17,953 at the 2020 census.

It is the home of Heidelberg University and Tiffin University. At one time the city was noted as a glass and porcelain manufacturing center. The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated Tiffin as a Tree City USA.

==History==

The bronze statue of &quot;The Indian Maiden&quot; on Frost Parkway near Miami Street, marks the site of Fort Ball, a military depot of the War of 1812. During a fighting engagement of that war, Erastus Bowe sighted the location where Tiffin later developed. In 1817, he returned to the site and built the Pan Yan Tavern on the North Sandusky River. Its name was likely derived from Penn Yan, New York. Early homesteaders followed soon after Bowe, and the settlement of Oakley sprang up around the Pan Yan on the north side of the river. The chief road of the area followed the path of the stagecoaches through Oakley, which was called Fort Ball after 1824.

In 1821, Josiah Hedges purchased a piece of land on the south bank of the river opposite Oakley and founded another settlement. He named this village in honor of Edward Tiffin, first governor of Ohio and later a member of the United States Senate who had helped gain statehood for the Ohio Territory in 1803. Tiffin was incorporated by an act of the Ohio Legislature on March 7, 1835. In March 1850, Fort Ball was absorbed by Tiffin.

In 1824, with the establishment of Seneca County by the Ohio Legislature, Tiffin was designated as the county seat. The county was named after the Seneca people, the westernmost of the Iroquois League of Six Nations who dominated the territory for centuries.

The discovery of natural gas in the vicinity in 1888 gave new momentum to the city&#x27;s industrial development. Various companies were founded in or moved to the city during this period, including Webster Industries, Inc., American Standard Companies, Tiffin Glass Works, and the Hanson Clutch and Machinery Company. Now known as Tiffin Parts, it has been operating at the same site since the 1920s and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the spring of 1913, the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River valleys were ravaged by Great Flood of 1913. During a three-day period, Tiffin sustained more than $1,000,000 in property loss, with 46 houses and 2 factories swept away, 10 factories damaged, 69 places of business heavily damaged, 6 bridges within the corporate limits destroyed, and 19 deaths.

Ballreich&#x27;s Bros., a potato chip company, has operated in Tiffin since 1920. While the company&#x27;s retail market is Northern Ohio, its products have a reputation that extends beyond its local retail market; these are available for shipping anywhere via the company&#x27;s website. The company was acquired by a group of local investors in 2019.

Tiffin St. Paul&#x27;s United Methodist Church was the first church in the world to be lit by Thomas Edison&#x27;s light bulbs, and the first public building in the United States to be wired for electricity.

Tiffin is the home of the historic Ritz Theatre, built in 1928 as a vaudeville house; it is in the Italian Renaissance style. The Ritz Theatre received extensive renovation and restoration in 1998.

On November 10, 2002, an F3 tornado hit southeast Tiffin, destroying several homes outside city limits. A new Mercy Hospital of Tiffin was built and opened in July 2008.

In 2022, Tiffin City Council elected the city&#x27;s first female mayor, Dawn Iannantuono, a Democrat, following the resignation of former Mayor Aaron Montz, a Republican. Iannantuono, who previously served on Tiffin City Council and the Tiffin City Board of Education, was the 50th mayor of the City of Tiffin. She decided not to seek another term as mayor, and was succeeded by small business owner and former educator Lee Wilkinson, also a Democrat, who defeated Republican John Spahr in the 2023 general election.

As of 2023, the estimated population of Tiffin is 17,706 people.

<text>Anna is a village in Shelby County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,470 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Pre-historical period===
The prehistoric Teays River ran through modern-day Anna about 2 million years ago. The Teays river deposited loose sediment on the Greenville fault line which created a major earthquake center.

===Native American period===
According to the Native Americans, Tecumseh tried to start his alliances in what is now Anna. Most native Shawnee and Miami tribes refused the offer. He supposedly put a curse on the land. The curse stated that the land would be ever plagued with the trembling of the earth.

===Settlement===
The first white settlement at Anna was made in the 1830s. Anna was platted in 1868, and named for Anna Thirkield. The village was incorporated in 1877.

===1937 earthquakes===
On March 9, 1937, the largest recorded earthquake in Ohio occurred where the high school and middle school now stand. It was measured at 5.4 on the Richter magnitude scale, while damage was at intensity VIII according to the Mercalli intensity scale. The shock was felt as far away as Chicago, Illinois, and Toronto, Ontario. The shaking followed a similar but somewhat weaker event that had happened a week earlier, on March 2. The Lutheran and Methodist Churches were heavily damaged; the Lutheran Church subsequently put metal braces in its attic to protect it from future earthquakes. The partially damaged school became a total loss for the town and had to be rebuilt. The town hall was so badly damaged that the upper story was condemned and has not been used since.

The Shelby County area has experienced at least 40 earthquakes since 1875.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Industry==
Anna is the location of a Honda of America Manufacturing (HAM) Plant that produces engines and other components for a range of Honda vehicles.

<text>Fort Loramie is a village in Shelby County, Ohio, United States, along Loramie Creek, a tributary of the Great Miami River in southwestern Ohio. It is 42 miles north-northwest of Dayton and 20 miles east of the Ohio/Indiana border. The population was 1,590 at the 2020 census. The village was founded in 1837 near the former site of a colonial fort of the same name.

==History==

Fort Loramie was established as a fur trading post in 1769 by &quot;Pierre-Louis de Lorimier&quot; (usually anglicized to Peter Loramie), a French-Canadian fur trader, British Indian agent and Shawnee agitator, and his father. The Shawnee used the trading post as a staging area for attacks against Americans during the Revolutionary War. During a raid on the Shawnee by George Rogers Clark in Nov. 1782, the trading post was attacked by a detachment of 150 men under Col. Benjamin Logan and burned to the ground. Lorimier escaped and fled west across the Mississippi. The site remained abandoned until 1795.

After victory at Battle of Fallen Timbers in Aug. 1794, which ended the Northwest Indian War, General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ordered a fort built at the site as a supply depot for Fort Adams, Fort Defiance, and Fort Wayne. It was originally a stockade, but Wayne decided that a blockhouse and storage buildings were more vital. Construction was completed in Dec. 1795. The fort stood on the portage between St. Mary&#x27;s River and Loramie Creek a half mile north of the present town. It was used as one of the demarcation points in the Treaty of Greenville Aug. 1795. The site was also mentioned in the Treaty of Fort Meigs 1817.

During the War of 1812, Fort Loramie served as a supply depot for forts in northern Ohio, and as a waystation for expeditions against the British in Michigan and Canada. The last officer who had command there was a Capt. Butler, a nephew of Gen. Richard Butler who died at St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat in 1791. In 1815, the United States sold the fort to James Furrow, who constructed a post office and tavern out of the buildings. The business had closed by 1820, but a small settlement had grown up around the site. The site today is a farm belonging to the heirs of James Furrow. Nothing remains of the fort or trading post.

Later, a town was laid out nearby and surveyed by Jonathan Counts in 1837. Lots were sold at auction, and the name Berlin was given to the town. Most of the early settlers were German. In 1911, the name of the town was changed to Fort Loramie.

Between 1836 and 1841, the Miami and Erie Canal was built intersecting the town. Canal boats hauled the limestone for the foundation of St. Michael’s Church, built by German Catholic settlers starting in 1849. A log church building from 1838 had preceded the stone and brick church. It was rebuilt again in 1881.

The settlement languished in the early years: the first flour mill and a general store, Willman&#x27;s, were built in 1858. Other early businesses were Bruckens and Vogelsang&#x27;s Cafe.

With the encroachment of railroads, the canal ceased operation in 1909. One relic is Loramie Lake, the reservoir used to keep the canal filled with water.

A large part of the town was destroyed in the Great Flood of 1913.

<text>Lockington (originally called Locksport) is a village in Washington Township, Shelby County, Ohio, United States, along Loramie Creek. The population was 162 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Around 1830, a flour mill was built on Loramie Creek near where the village is now, and before that there was a sawmill built on the same creek that had been abandoned. In 1837, John Brown owned both of these mills, and built a new wool mill. A small community began to grow around these and other mills built along Loramie Creek later, and when the Miami and Erie Canal was built, a series of 5 canal locks lifted the water over the creek via an aqueduct. Due to its location near the locks, the community was originally called Locksport. As a crossroads between the main canal and feeders coming from Port Jefferson and Sidney, the community continued to grow.

In 1837, David Mellinger hired Jonathan Counts to survey and plat a new community on his land. The community of Lockington was approved for incorporation by the Shelby County Commissioners on September 9, 1857, and recorded by the Ohio Secretary of State on January 4, 1858. The first elections were help April 1, 1858, with W. S. Burns elected mayor. The Lockington Post Office was established on June 28, 1847. Around 1845, the first sawmill in Lockington was built by William Stephens, and a new mill built on the same site in 1860 with improvements to mill grain. The mill changed owners, but stayed in operation until it burned down around 1900. About 1905, D.K. Gillespie built a grain elevator in the village, which was vastly improved upon by its new owner, C.N. Adlard, in 1912, making it one of the largest in the state by storage capacity. As of 1913, there were also two general stores, a machine shop, a seasonal ice cream shop, and Knights of the Maccabees Tent No. 68. The post office remained in operation until August 30, 1914, mail service now handled through the Piqua branch. The original locks are now part of the Lockington Locks Historical Area.

In 2019, the Ohio Historical Records Advisory Board awarded Lockington a grant to assist in inventorying, organizing, and improving access to the village&#x27;s historical documents.

<text>Russia ( ) is a village in Loramie Township, Shelby County, Ohio, United States. The population was 712 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Russia was founded by Lewis Phillips, who purchased and plotted the land where the village now sits. Phillips&#x27; house, built in 1853, was the first house in Russia; other settlers followed by the late 1850s. Phillips was also the first businessman in the village, opening a grocery store in 1853. Later settlers soon founded a dry goods store and multiple sawmills; Russia&#x27;s economy was once heavily dependent on its sawmills. Among the earliest settlers were French-speaking Swiss who had served under Napoléon Bonaparte during the French invasion of Russia in 1812. According to tradition, the village&#x27;s name commemorates a battle these veterans had fought in Russia.

Russia was established in an area that was already predominantly French. In the early part of the nineteenth century, a large number of emigrants from Alsace, Lorraine, and other parts of France settled in southwestern Shelby County and the adjacent portions of northeastern Darke County. Besides Russia, these immigrants founded the communities of Frenchtown and Versailles. By the middle of the 1850s, the heavily Roman Catholic population had grown to the point that multiple parishes were established in the area. A log church was built and dedicated to Saint Remigius, the patron saint of France, and Mass was first celebrated there on June 15, 1854. The congregation soon outgrew its building and constructed a new brick church; when it became too small, a larger brick church was constructed and completed in 1892. The village is one of many small communities in a heavily Catholic region of western Ohio known as the &quot;Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches&quot;.

<text>Sidney is a city in and the county seat of Shelby County, Ohio, United States, located approximately north of Dayton and south of Toledo. The population was 20,421 at the time of the 2020 census. It is named after English poet Philip Sidney, and many of the city&#x27;s elementary schools are named after famous writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and John Greenleaf Whittier. Sidney was the recipient of the 1964 All-America City Award. In 2009, it was the subject of the documentary film &quot;45365&quot;.

== History ==
Sidney, named after Sir Philip Sidney, a well-known poet and member of British Parliament, was originally a parcel of land located along the west side of the Great Miami River. This land was donated by Charles Starrett to be used as the site of a new town designated to be the county seat of Shelby County. The area around Sidney was once the richly forested hunting ground of the Shawnee and Miami Indian nations. This fertile area was developed as agricultural lands over time.

The construction of the Miami-Erie Canal between 1825 and 1837 connected Sidney in a north–south direction with the major trade centers in Ohio. In addition to opening the first significant &quot;outside&quot; trade for Sidney, the construction of the canal attracted an influx of settlers to the area. From the 1840s to 1913, canal boats carried Shelby County&#x27;s products to Cincinnati or Toledo. Sidney was crossed by the Miami and Erie Canal&#x27;s Sidney or Port Jefferson Feeder Branch. Before railroads came to Sidney, the canal provided most transportation, as roads were unpaved and not usable in all seasons. Part of the canal remains south of Water Street.

As the influence of the canal declined, another transportation element, railroads, began to develop in Sidney. East–west rail began to be laid in 1851, followed by north–south rail in 1856. Sidney is still served by these railroad lines.

In the 1950s, the Interstate Highway contributed to the development of Sidney. It was named as &quot;All-America City&quot; in 1964. Today, Interstate 75 connects Sidney with Canada to the north, and Florida to the south. Sidney has four interchanges with Interstate 75, providing access for both commercial and industrial users.

Sidney has an extensive parks and recreation system. When the city&#x27;s first comprehensive plan was being developed in the mid-1950s, the city decided to have a park or recreation area within a half-mile of every residence. This goal has resulted in a system of 14 neighborhood parks, a baseball complex, softball complex, soccer complex, municipal swimming pool, and the Tawawa Park, a nature and picnic area.

Sidney is the hometown of Paul Lauterbur, a renowned scientist and Nobel Prize winner who helped develop the MRI.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan visited the city of Sidney on a train (the same train that President Franklin D. Roosevelt used during his visit to Sidney in 1944) while touring the country. President George W. Bush visited the town in 2004, eating at the Spot Restaurant in downtown Sidney. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney visited the Shelby County Fairgrounds in Sidney in 2012.

Sidney, Iowa, derives its name from the community.

The town of Buckeye, Arizona, was originally named after Sidney. Malin M. Jackson, who built Arizona&#x27;s Buckeye Canal, was from Sidney.

==Transportation==
===Air===

Sidney is served by the Sidney Municipal Airport. Dayton International Airport is south while Port Columbus which serves Columbus is east.

===Rail===
Sidney has two railroad lines. Both were built independently in the 1850s.

Until the 1960s, passengers could take the Knickerbocker Limited from Sidney to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. This east–west line was built as the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad which ran from Galion, Ohio to Union City on the Ohio-Indiana border. It was built in conjunction with the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, providing a route between Cleveland and the East and Indianapolis, and later St. Louis. In 1864, the two were merged into the &quot;Bee&quot; Line: the Bellefontaine Railway. In 1869, the lines were merged into the first &quot;Big Four&quot;: the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway. In 1889, the second &quot;Big Four&quot; was formed: the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway. In the early 1920s, this railroad relocated its tracks from downtown Sidney to the south edge of the city over the new Big Four concrete arch bridge. Early in the twentieth century, it was leased by the New York Central System. Later the Big Four was taken over by the Penn Central, then Conrail, and finally CSX Transportation.

Other concrete arch bridges in the region were designed and built for the Big Four; they are located in Avon and Greencastle, Indiana, and Danville, Illinois.

In the 1950s, passengers could board a train in Sidney and take it south to Cincinnati or New Orleans. This north–south line was built as the Dayton and Michigan Railroad. In the 1860s it was leased by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad. It was taken over by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad early in the twentieth century. Later the line was taken over by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, then by CSX Transportation, and passenger services were reduced.

===Highway system===
The Dixie Highway, later US 25, now known as County Rd 25A, ran north–south through downtown Sidney, connecting it with Toledo and Detroit to the north and Dayton and Cincinnati to the south. Interstate 75 was completed in the early &#x27;60s. Located west of Sidney, it took the place of the Dixie Highway and most of the traffic. Four exits from I-75 provide direct access to Sidney: exit 90 (Fair Road), exit 92 (State Route 47), exit 93 (State Route 29), and exit 94 (County Road 25A).

<text>Canal Fulton is a city in western Stark County, Ohio, United States, along the Tuscarawas River. The population was 5,325 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area.

==History==
Canal Fulton traces its history to three villages that developed along the Tuscarawas River. Milan was platted on March 23, 1814, by Matthew Rowland who arrived by ox team. It was the first settlement west of the Tuscarawas River in Stark County. Fulton was platted on May 16, 1826, changed its name to Canal Fulton in 1832, and later incorporated as a village. The present name is an amalgamation of the Ohio Canal and the name of a local pioneer, Ben Fulton. In 1843, President John Quincy Adams visited.

=== Indigenous displacement ===
The land that would become Canal Fulton was part of broader territories shared between several Native American tribes, including Wyandot, Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, Odawa (Ottawa), Ojibwe (Chippewa), Potawatomi, Miami, Eel River, Wea, Kickapoo, Piankishaw, Munsee, and Kaskaskia. 

The United States pressed these nations to cede territory to the west of the Tuscarawas in 1785 and to the east in 1805, paving the way for settlers like Rowland to claim divisions.

The Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 claimed land west of the Ohio to the Tuscarawas from Wyandot, Delaware, Shawnee, Ottawa, Chippewa, Potawatomi, Miami, Eel River, Wea, Kickapoo, Piankishaw, and Kaskaskia Native Americans. The Land Ordinance of 1785 set the precedent for the division and distribution of these lands. 

With the Treaty of Fort Industry in July 4, 1805, Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, Munsee, Delaware, Shawnee, and Potawatomi land east of the Tuscarawas was claimed by the United States and made open to white settlers. 

With the Treaty of Maumee Rapids in 1817 and the Treaty of St. Mary’s in 1818, all lands in Ohio were claimed by the United States. 

=== Frontier life ===
In the County of Stark just outside the Connecticut Western Reserve, on lands known as the Congress Lands, frontier life was dangerous and difficult. Settlers encountered Native Americans attempting to defend their families and territory, confrontations with wild beasts, and difficulty in transportation. 

Settlers arrived on canoe or foot from Cleveland by way of the Cuyahoga to the Portage to the Tuscarawas rivers or by ox-drawn cart following the state road from Pennsylvania to Canton then cutting wider Indian trails to their destination.

=== Land survey ===
Foresighted surveyors while platting Stark County had included “Fractions” of land west of the Tuscarawas. The surveying went according to the laws of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which provided for six-mile square townships to be created in the newly acquired land, the township would then be divided into one-square mile sections, with each section encompassing 640 acres. Each section received its own number. Section sixteen was set aside for a public school. The federal government reserved sections eight, eleven, twenty-six, and twenty-nine to provide veterans of the American Revolution with land bounties for their service during the war. The government would sell the remaining sections at public auction. The minimum bid was 640 dollars per section or one dollar for every acre of land in each section.

The fraction in the northwest part of Stark County was settled before the land on the east bank of the Tuscarawas. The west side of the river was chosen because of the roads that already existed (old Cleveland-Massillon Road also known as the “army road” or “territorial road” because it was cut during the War of 1812, when the Government needed access to Fort Meigs). Also, it was believed the west side had better quality soil. However, the primary reason the west side of river was chosen was because east of the Tusc, the surveys were in two-section areas (with additional surveying the responsibility of the settler) and west of the River the surveys were done on a one-section basis. Most settlers only wanted to farm (and purchase) a one-section area.

=== Rowland&#x27;s purchase ===
Matthew Rowland purchased one of these fractions of land and recorded the proprietorship at Canton on March 23, 1814. Rowland platted the town and offered the 79 lots for sale at a public auction in Canton.

The town was named Milan, after the Lombardian city of Milan in Italy. It was fashionable at the time to name frontier towns after European cities (witness Paris, Ohio, founded in Stark two months before Milan).

=== Developing the region ===
Rowland’s son-in-law built the first structure in Milan (a log cabin), and Rowland soon added a gristmill and a sawmill. Neither was very successful.

The Township that Milan would become a part of was laid off in December of 1815. Lawrence Township was named after Captain James Lawrence famous for his last words during the War of 1812 battle between the American Chesapeake, and the British frigate the Shannon, “Don’t Give up the Ship”. These words are now the township’s motto.

Milan was the only village in the township until the building of the canal between 1826 and 1828, which brought about the town of Fulton on the other side of the river. Milan boasted churches, cemeteries, and a grocery built to service the hundreds of canal workers. Fulton surpassed Milan though and the prefix Canal was added.

For a brief time with the coming of the B &amp; O railroad, Milan once again eclipsed the Port of Canal Fulton. American transportation such as it is, even this balance was tipped again because all the main highways favored the Fulton side of the river. Today Milan no longer exists as it incorporated into Canal Fulton in 1853. It is, however, a quiet residential area, and most in Canal Fulton are aware of the little village’s beginnings.

In 1850 the first permanent community school began operation and railroad operations began. In 1853, Canal Fulton absorbed both Milan and West Fulton. In 1855, Union School building was completed and had two rooms accommodating 100 students. In 1869, the construction of railroad was completed on the west side of the river. 1870 Addition built at Union School. In 1873, The warehouse converted to Opera House. In 1874, Canal Fulton approves organization of a fire department, although one was in existence in the early 1800s. Fire department gets first modern steam-operated pumper. In 1875, Sts. Philip and James School founded.

In 1876, German immigrants came to area as strikebreakers for coal industry. In 1886, new school built to accommodate 12 grades.

<text>Canton () is a city in and the county seat of Stark County, Ohio, United States. It is located approximately south of Cleveland and south of Akron in Northeast Ohio on the edge of Ohio&#x27;s Amish Country. As of the 2020 census, the population of Canton was 70,872, making Canton eighth among Ohio cities in population. It is the largest municipality in the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area, which includes all of Stark and Carroll counties, and was home to 401,574 residents in 2020.

Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or downsizing of many factories and workers. After this decline, the city&#x27;s industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare.

Canton is chiefly notable for being the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the birthplace of the National Football League. 25th U.S. President William McKinley conducted the famed front porch campaign, which won him the presidency of the United States in the 1896 election, from his home in Canton. The McKinley National Memorial and the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum commemorate his life and presidency. Canton was also chosen as the site of the First Ladies National Historic Site largely in honor of his wife, Ida Saxton McKinley.

Starting in the mid-2010s, Canton began experiencing an urban renaissance, anchored by a growing arts district centrally located in the downtown area. Several historic buildings have been rehabilitated and converted into upscale lofts, attracting hundreds of new downtown residents into the city. Furthering this downtown development, in June 2016, Canton became one of the first cities in Ohio to allow the open consumption of alcoholic beverages in a &quot;designated outdoor refreshment area&quot; pursuant to a state law enacted in 2015.

==History==

Canton was founded in 1805, incorporated as a village in 1822, and reincorporated as a city in 1838. The plat of Canton was recorded at New Lisbon, Ohio, on November 15, 1805, by Bezaleel Wells, a surveyor and devout Episcopalian from Maryland born January 28, 1763. Canton was likely named as a memorial to Captain John O&#x27;Donnell, an Irish merchant marine with the British East India Company whom Wells admired. O&#x27;Donnell named his estate in Maryland after Canton, China as he had been the first person to transport goods from there to Baltimore. The name selected by Wells may also have been influenced by the Huguenot use of the word &quot;canton,&quot; which meant a division of a district containing several communes. Through Wells&#x27; efforts and promotion, Canton was designated the county seat of Stark County upon its division from Columbiana County on January 1, 1809.

=== President William McKinley ===

For most of his adult life, Canton was the home of William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States. Born in Niles, Ohio, McKinley first practiced law in Canton around 1867 and was prosecuting attorney of Stark County from 1869 to 1871. The city was his home during his successful campaign for Ohio governor, the site of his front-porch presidential campaign of 1896 and the campaign of 1900. Canton is now the site of the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum and the McKinley National Memorial, dedicated in 1907.

President McKinley&#x27;s impact on Canton as his adopted home is still reflected today in many different ways, and he remains the namesake of McKinley Senior High School of the Canton City School System.

=== Debs&#x27; antiwar speech ===

On June 16, 1918, Eugene V. Debs delivered the keynote speech at the annual Ohio Socialist Convention held in Canton&#x27;s Nimisilla Park. At the time, Debs had been a four-time candidate for president and was considered the country&#x27;s leading socialist and labor organizer. During his speech he decried America&#x27;s involvement in the First World War, saying, &quot;They have always taught you that it is your patriotic duty to go to war and slaughter yourselves at their command. You have never had a voice in the war. The working class who make the sacrifices, who shed the blood, have never yet had a voice in declaring war.&quot; Among Debs&#x27; audience at Nimisilla Park were agents of the U.S. Department of Justice. The year before his speech, and a month following the American entry into the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Espionage Act of 1917 into law. This Act made it a federal crime to interfere with, among other things, the Selective Service Act or military draft.On June 30, 1918, Debs was arrested and charged with, among other things, &quot;unlawfully, willfully and feloniously cause and attempt to cause and incite and attempt to incite, insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty, in the military and naval forces of the United States.&quot; Debs&#x27; trial began on September 10, 1918, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. On September 12, 1918, a jury found Debs guilty. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. On March 10, 1919, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Debs&#x27; conviction in &quot;Debs v. United States&quot;. Debs began serving his prison sentence on April 13, 1919, and remained incarcerated until December 25, 1921, when he was released after President Warren Harding commuted his sentence to time served.

The U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision affirming Debs&#x27; conviction was sharply criticized by legal scholars at the time and is generally regarded as a low point in First Amendment jurisprudence. The lead author of the opinion, progressive Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, later changed course that same term and authored a dissenting opinion recognizing the constitutional protection of such speech in &quot;Abrams v. United States.&quot; Justice Louis D. Brandeis was the only other jurist to join Justice Holmes&#x27; dissent, and the minority opinion had no effect on Debs&#x27; conviction and continued incarceration. The changed mind articulated by Justice Holmes on November 10, 1919, nevertheless had a profound impact on the development of American constitutional law. His dissent in &quot;Abrams&quot; is considered by many legal scholars to be the canonical affirmation of free speech in the United States.

While Debs&#x27; speech in Canton and subsequent conviction ultimately aided Debs in delivering the Socialist Party&#x27;s antiwar platform, his age and the deleterious effects of prison exhausted his ability as an orator. Debs died of heart failure on October 20, 1926. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; recounted his words from the Ohio federal courtroom: &quot;At his trial he admitted the charges against him, declaring he would not retract a word he had uttered to save himself from going to the penitentiary for the rest of his days. Before the sentence was passed on him, Debs said to the Court:

&quot;&#x27;Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class I am in it; while there is a criminal element I am of it; while there is a soul in prison I am not free.&#x27;&quot;&quot;

In June 2017 Canton applied for and received a historical marker from the Ohio History Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society. The marker is located next to where Debs stood in Canton on the afternoon of June 16, 1918. It commemorates the significance and legacy of his speech at Nimisilla Park, notes the many speeches at the park by other prominent historical figures, and honors the park&#x27;s continued importance as a gathering place for the community.

=== Major companies ===

The Timken Company has been among the largest employers in Canton for nearly 100 years. In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as the Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis. In 1901, the company moved to Canton as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland. By 1960, Timken had operations in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, France, South Africa, Australia and Brazil. The company changed its corporate structure in 2014; the roller bearing-producing part of the company was separated from the steel-producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies. The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.

Today, TimkenSteel remains headquartered in Canton and employs 2,800 people, most of them in Northeast Ohio. The company makes special bar quality steel, used in applications all over the world. The Timken Co. is now headquartered in Jackson Township, a suburb of Canton, and employs 14,000 people around the world. The company designs, engineers, manufactures and sells bearings, transmissions, gearboxes, chain and related products, and offers a spectrum of power system rebuild and repair services around the globe.

The Dueber-Hampden Watch Company was an important employer in Canton during the early 1920s. It was formally organized in 1923, having previously consisted of two separate companies: the Dueber Watch Case Company and the Hampden Watch Company. In 1886, John Dueber, the owner of the Dueber Watch Case Company, purchased a controlling interest in the Hampden Watch Company. In 1888, he relocated the Hampden Watch Company from Springfield, Massachusetts and the Dueber Watch Case Company from Newport, Kentucky to Canton, Ohio. These two companies shared manufacturing facilities in Canton but remained two separate companies. The Dueber Watch Case Company and the Hampden Watch Company quickly became two of Canton&#x27;s largest employers. In 1888, the companies&#x27; first year in Canton, they employed 2,300 Canton residents. In 1890, Canton&#x27;s population was 26,337. Thanks to these two companies, Canton became an important center for watch manufacturing in the United States. In 1927 the company went bankrupt, finally ceasing operations in the city in 1930. The machinery and tools were sold to the Amtorg Trading Corporation, one of Soviet Russia&#x27;s buying agencies in the US, for $329.000. The company&#x27;s massive brick factories, which covered over 20 acres and included an ornate 150-foot clock tower, were demolished to accommodate the construction of Interstate 77.

=== Football history ===

On September 17, 1920, a meeting was held at the Hupmobile showroom in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Building in Canton to found the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922). The attendees included Ralph Hay, owner of the Hupmobile showroom and the hometown Canton Bulldogs, and George Halas, owner of the Decatur Staleys. Jim Thorpe of the Bulldogs was the league&#x27;s first president. In 2014 a sculpture titled &quot;Birth of the NFL&quot; was erected in downtown Canton marking the exact location in the Hupmobile showroom where the NFL was created in 1920.

On December 6, 1959, the &quot;Canton Repository&quot;, a local newspaper, called for city officials to lobby the National Football League to create a football hall of fame in the community. Canton officials formally proposed their city as the site for the Hall of Fame in 1961. The NFL quickly agreed to the city&#x27;s proposal. To help convince NFL officials to locate the Hall of Fame in Canton, city officials donated several acres of land on Canton&#x27;s north side to the project. Local residents also raised almost $400,000 to help construct the Hall of Fame.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame formally opened on September 7, 1963. Initially, the museum consisted of two buildings, but in 1971, 1978, 1995, and 2013, the Pro Football Hall of Fame experienced several expansions. As of 2013, the museum consisted of five buildings, covering 118,000 square feet. Since its founding, over 10 million people have visited the Pro Football Hall of Fame. &quot;Welcome to Canton&quot; is the official way of saying congratulations to a new enshrinee.

===Address system===
Canton&#x27;s street layout forms the basis for the system of addresses in Stark County. Canton proper is divided into address quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE) by Tuscarawas Street (dividing N and S) and Market Avenue (dividing E and W). Due to shifts in the street layout, the E–W divider becomes Cleveland Avenue south of the city, merging onto Ridge Road farther out. The directionals are noted as suffixes to the street name (e.g. Tuscarawas St W, 55th Street NE). Typically within the city numbered streets run east and west and radiate from the Tuscarawas Street baseline, while named avenues run north and south.

==Economy==

Canton&#x27;s economy has traditionally been primarily industrial, with significant healthcare and agricultural segments. The city is home to the TimkenSteel Corporation, a major manufacturer of specialty steel. Several other large companies operate in the greater Canton area, including Timken Company, a maker of tapered roller bearings; Belden Brick Company, a brick and masonry producer; Diebold, a maker of ATMs, electronic voting devices, and bank vaults, and Medline Industries, a manufacturer and distributor of health care supplies. The area is also home to several regional food producers, including Nickles Bakery (baked goods), Case Farms (poultry), and Shearer&#x27;s Foods (snack foods). Poultry production and dairy farming are also important segments of the Canton area&#x27;s economy.

Since 2000, Canton has experienced a very low unemployment rate. The healthcare sector is particularly strong, with Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical Center among its largest employers. Nevertheless, as in many industrial areas of the United States, employment in the manufacturing sector is in a state of decline. LTV Steel (formerly Republic Steel) suffered bankruptcy in 2000. Republic Steel emerged and continues to maintain operations in Canton. Hoover Company, a major employer for decades in the region, reached an agreement to sell Hoover to Hong Kong-based Techtronic Industries. The main plant in nearby North Canton closed its doors in September 2007 due to classified reasons. On June 30, 2014, the Timken Company and TimkenSteel split, forming two separate companies at the urging of shareholders. The Timken Company relocated to neighboring Jackson Township, while TimkenSteel remains headquartered in Canton. In response to this changing manufacturing landscape, the city is undergoing a transition to a retail and service-based economy.

Beginning in the 1970s, Canton, like many mid-size American cities, lost most of its downtown retail business to the suburbs. The majority of the Canton area&#x27;s &quot;box store&quot; retail is located in the general vicinity of the Belden Village Mall in Jackson Township. However, the 2010s saw the downtown area bringing in new cafes, restaurants, and the establishment of an arts district. A few retail centers remain in Canton at or near the city limits. Tuscarawas Street (Lincoln Way), a leg of the Lincoln Highway connecting Canton with nearby Massillon, is home to the Canton Centre mall and several retail outlets of varying size. A vein of commerce runs along Whipple Avenue, connecting the Canton Centre area with the Belden Village area. A similar vein runs north from the downtown area, along Cleveland and Market avenues. Connecting Cleveland and Market avenues is a small shopping district on 30th Street NW, and retail lines the Route 62 corridor leading from Canton to Louisville and Alliance.

The city&#x27;s economy has diversified due to the decline of the heavy manufacturing industry. At the heart of this transformation is the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with its multimillion-dollar &quot;Hall of Fame Village&quot; expansion project. This project has been complemented with significant investments by city leaders in urban redevelopment, which continued with the transformation of the Hotel Onesto into the Historic Onesto Lofts. Other urban renewal plans are underway, which include the redevelopment of the downtown Market Square area. Private investment has furthered Canton&#x27;s transformation, which is illustrated by the multimillion-dollar creation of the Gervasi Vineyard, which draws patrons throughout the region. In furtherance of these development initiatives, Canton was one of the first cities in Ohio to create a &quot;designated outdoor refreshment area&quot; legalizing the possession and consumption of &quot;open container&quot; alcoholic beverages in its downtown area.

===Principal employers===

According to Canton&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Arts and culture==

The Canton Museum of Art, founded in 1935, is a broad-based community arts organization designed to encourage and promote the fine arts in Canton. The museum focuses on 19th- and 20th-century American artists, specifically works on paper, and on American ceramics, beginning in the 1950s. The museum sponsors annual shows of the work of high school students in Canton and Stark County, and financial scholarships are awarded. Educational outreach programs take the museum off-site to libraries, parochial schools, area public schools, five inner-city schools, and a school for students with behavioral disorders. The city&#x27;s Arts District, located downtown, is the site of monthly First Friday arts celebrations.

Canton has the main branch of Stark County District Library.

==Sports==

===Football===
Canton is home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The American Professional Football Association, the forerunner of the modern National Football League, was founded in a Canton car dealership on September 17, 1920. The Canton Bulldogs were an NFL football team that played from 1920 to 1923, skipped the 1924 season, then played from 1925 to 1926 before folding.

Canton is the home of the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival, which includes a hot air balloon festival, ribs burn-off, fashion show, community parade, Sunday morning race, enshrinee dinner, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame Grand Parade. The festival culminates in the enshrinement of the new inductees and the NFL/Hall of Fame Game, a pre-season exhibition between teams representing the AFC and NFC at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.
Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, used during the regular season by Canton McKinley High School (as well as some other area schools and colleges), was rated the number one high school football venue in America by the &quot;Sporting News&quot; in 2002. This may be partly attributable to the Bulldogs&#x27; rivalry with the nearby Massillon Washington High School Tigers. All seven of the Ohio High School Athletic Association state final football games are hosted in Canton at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

The Canton Legends played in the American Indoor Football Association at the Canton Civic Center. Operations were suspended in 2009. The Continental Indoor Football League also has offices in Canton.

The Canton Invaders of the National Professional Soccer League II and American Indoor Soccer Association played home games at the Canton Memorial Civic Center from 1984 until 1996, winning five league championships. In 2009, the Ohio Vortex became an expansion team in the Professional Arena Soccer League. Operations have since been suspended.

Canton has been home to professional baseball on several occasions. Several minor league teams called Canton home in the early 1900s, including the Canton Terriers in the 1920s and 1930s. The Canton–Akron Indians were the AA affiliate of the major league Cleveland Indians for nine years, playing at Thurman Munson Memorial Stadium until the team relocated north to Akron following the 1996 season. Two independent minor league teams, the Canton Crocodiles and the Canton Coyotes, both members of the Frontier League, called Munson Stadium home for several years afterward. The Crocodiles, who won the league championship in their inaugural season in 1997, moved to Washington, Pennsylvania, in 2002, and the Coyotes moved to Columbia, Missouri, in 2003, after just one season in Canton.

Canton is home to the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps, a world-class competitor in Drum Corps International. The Bluecoats have been a part of the &quot;top five&quot; finalists in the DCI World Championships since 2013, and took home the Founders&#x27; Trophy in 2016 and in 2024

Also in downtown Canton, there is a small annex for Stark State College to be used by the early college high school students who are located on the Timken Campus.

==Law enforcement==

In April 2024, officers of the Canton Police Department restrained 53-year-old Frank Tyson after a car crash, with Tyson dying after the restraint. Police took down Tyson to the ground, handcuffed him, and then one officer kneeled on Tyson for roughly 30 seconds, with Tyson stating: &quot;I can&#x27;t breathe. I can&#x27;t breathe. You&#x27;re on my neck&quot;. After the knee was removed and Tyson was left on his stomach, Tyson became motionless and subsequently died. Two Canton officers were assigned paid administrative leave during an investigation into the incident.

In May 2024, officers of the Canton Police Department arrested a male bystander to a traffic stop, after Patrolman Nicholas Casto accused the bystander of taunting Casto&#x27;s police dog. Body camera footage showed multiple officers bringing the bystander to the ground, then as the bystander was lying face down with wrists crossed behind his back, Canto led the police dog over to the bystander. The officers retreated as the police dog bit and shook the bystander&#x27;s arm for 15 seconds, with one officer shouting: &quot;Stop resisting!&quot; multiple times, while the bystander kept his arms still crossed behind his back. After Casto pried off the police dog and the bystander is handcuffed, Canto told the dog: &quot;Good boy&quot;. Casto was assigned paid administrative leave during an investigation into the incident, while two Canton councilmen indicated that they were upset by the biting incident. Canton Police Chief John Gabbard in early June 2024 recommended Casto&#x27;s firing, alleging that Casto also &quot;included demonstrably false information in [his] written account of the arrest in order to justify the level of force that was clearly unjustified.&quot; Canton Public Safety Director Andrea Perry fired Casto in late June 2024, with Canton Mayor William Sherer concurring; Perry found that the bystander was not an immediate threat to officers and was unlikely to escape, while Casto could have injured other officers present when he deployed the police dog. Perry agreed that Casto knowingly provided inaccurate information in his report when Casto claimed that the bystander resisted officers, that the other officers were &quot;exhausted&quot;, and that the bystander only put his hands behind his back after the police dog was released.
