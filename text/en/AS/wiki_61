== History ==

Mechanicsburg was named after a settlement of mechanics who made and repaired Conestoga wagons in the early 19th century.

In 1837, when the Cumberland Valley Railroad (CVRR) completed its line, Mechanicsburg was designated as a water station, where workers could restock the locomotive with firewood and water. This important function also contributed to the town&#x27;s growth. The train became the town&#x27;s link to the world of business and industry. Grain and feed companies, lumber yards and numerous factories were purposely built alongside the railroad tracks. Archives show that, at one time, there were twenty-five trains chugging through the town daily carrying travelers, coal, feathers, fruit, ice, mail and newspapers. During the American Civil War, the railroad was an invaluable method of transporting troops and supplies. Today, approximately six trains travel through Mechanicsburg each day, which has recently increased due to new operations on the local sub-line owned by Norfolk Southern. Although automotive technology changed the town forever, today&#x27;s residents cannot dismiss the vital role the railroad played in its development.

Another part of Mechanicsburg&#x27;s growth occurred when the Naval Support Activity was built on of land in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania. NSA Mechanicsburg continues to serve as one of the Defense Department&#x27;s major logistics sites.

Present-day Mechanicsburg is centered on that Leonard Fisher purchased from Joseph Heynes&#x27; tract (No. 1442 of an original grant of from William Penn. Before becoming incorporated on April 12, 1828, the town went by several different names. First, Drytown, because of the extreme scarcity of water during the winter and summer. It was also known as Pinchgut, a German name used as a sign of amusement given to a small village of only a few people. Some also referred to the town as Staufferstown, in honor of Henry Stauffer, the owner of much of the land in the center of town, or briefly as Creekville during the Colonial Era.

On June 28, 1863, Confederate troops led by Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins raided Mechanicsburg, and two days later, met with Union forces in the Skirmish of Sporting Hill, just east of town. Following the Skirmish of Sporting Hill, the Confederate forces retreated south into the little town of Gettysburg where the Battle of Gettysburg would be fought.

The oldest building in Mechanicsburg is the Frankeberger Tavern. One of Mechanicsburg&#x27;s first residents was George Frankeberger, who in 1801 applied for a license to open his newly built log home for the &quot;convenience&quot; of travelers. In exchange for a small fee, Mr. Frankeberger offered cattle drivers a warm meal and a place to sleep. This proved to be rather lucrative, as many people were making the two-day trek between Harrisburg (the state capital) and Carlisle (Cumberland County&#x27;s county seat).

Mechanicsburg is home to many historic markers, such as Irving Female College (named for Washington Irving, a trustee), the first women&#x27;s college in Pennsylvania to grant degrees in arts and sciences.
The Mechanicsburg Commercial Historic District, Irving Female College, Cumberland Valley Railroad Station and Station Master&#x27;s House, Adam Orris House, and Simpson Street School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Ånge Municipality (&quot;Ånge kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västernorrland County, northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Ånge.

The railway junction Ånge was in 1947 made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) and detached from &quot;Borgsjö&quot;. In 1971 they were reunited and together with &quot;Haverö&quot; and &quot;Torp&quot; the present municipality was formed.

The municipal most known slogan is &quot;Sweden&#x27;s geographical center&quot;. It was in 1947 measured by the Royal Institute of Technology to be situated by the lake Munkbysjön (&quot;Lake Munkby&quot;), in the municipality&#x27;s eastern parts. In 2002 the slogan was changed to &quot;Wonderful byways&quot;.

13 kilometers east of the town Ånge lies the town Borgsjö. It has a widely acclaimed rococo church from the 18th century.

<doc id="132316" wikidata="Q890908" url="?curid=132316" title="The Jerry Springer Show">
<text>Jerry Springer is an American first-run syndicated talk show that was hosted by Jerry Springer. The show ran for twenty-seven seasons from September 30, 1991, to July 26, 2018, in which it broadcast 3,891 episodes. The show premiered as a traditional talk show, with a focus on political issues. However, it reformatted into a tabloid talk show in the mid-1990s.

The program was unsuccessful in ratings in its first seasons due to its focus on more political issues. This led to an overhaul of the structure which by the mid-1990s led to the show as it is known now, filled with controversial topics (such as incest and adultery), profanity, chanting, heckling, physical fights (involving a mixture of slapping, boxing, wrestling and liquid spraying as well as martial arts with frequent interventions of security), nudity, scantily clad guests and flashing audience members for &quot;Jerry Beads&quot;. The show was produced by Multimedia, Inc., then NBCUniversal, for over 26 years, peaking in popularity around 1997 and 1998.

It was taped in Chicago, Illinois from 1991 to 2009 and in Stamford, Connecticut, from 2009 to 2018. On June 13, 2018, NBCUniversal ended production of new episodes of the show after 27 seasons. The show&#x27;s final tapings took place on July 6, 2018, and its final episode aired on July 26, 2018, with reruns continuing on The CW until September 10, 2021 and in syndication until September 6, 2024. After the cancellation, it was announced that Springer would host a new courtroom show titled &quot;Judge Jerry&quot;, which premiered on September 9, 2019, and is also distributed by NBCUniversal; it was canceled after three seasons in 2022.

Critical response to the show was overwhelmingly negative, and in 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; proclaimed it to be the worst TV show of all time. This critique of the show as &quot;trash TV&quot;, however, was satirically embraced by the show, with Springer proudly introducing the program as the &quot;worst TV show of all time&quot; at the start of each episode.

==Format and content==
Each episode of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; began with Springer entering the stage and being greeted by a standing audience (made up of mostly college students) pumping the air with their right hand, chanting &quot;Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!&quot;. Beginning in the 2000s, Springer would arrive on stage by sliding down a stripper pole. He then shook hands with some of the audience members before introducing the episode&#x27;s topic and guests. The topics were usually of an unsophisticated nature, such as infidelity and other relationship squabbles. Oftentimes the guests would become emotional and get involved in heated arguments with one another, resulting in outbursts and physical fighting, and the audience chanting &quot;Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!&quot;. On-screen security guards were present and tasked with managing the potential violence.

Once all the guests had told their stories, there was usually a &quot;question and answer&quot; segment where audience members asked guests questions. In earlier seasons, the questions tended to be serious. However, these questions gave way to insults as the show progressed. Throughout the show, some women in the audience would sometimes flash their breasts in exchange for &quot;Jerry Beads&quot; (Mardi Gras-style beads with the show logo). In later seasons, serious questions were typically mocked by the crowd with chants of &quot;Go to &quot;Oprah&quot;!&quot;. Springer then ended the show by giving a formal lecture, sitting by himself on the stage, on the principles of refined values in regards to the featured guests. Springer&#x27;s &quot;final thought&quot; segment ended with the concluding statement, &quot;&#x27;Til next time, take care of yourselves and each other,&quot; which was his sign-off line during his days as a newscaster in Cincinnati.

Generally, Springer tended to present his program standing up, pacing the aisle steps between the seating areas, rather than having a podium or mark on the main stage. This was thought to be to protect himself from the potential violence occurring on the stage. He deliberately chose a role as straight man; he never directly involved himself in the arguments. &quot;I&#x27;m always wearing a suit, I don&#x27;t curse and I wasn&#x27;t in fights involving Jell-O,&quot; Springer stated in retrospective.

Sometimes the show would have a look back at previous episodes. They had rebranded as Classic Springer, some with a false &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;-like theme and patina. These shows were interspersed with commentary from Springer himself, usually before and after commercial breaks.

==Production==
===Set===

According to NBC, the set for the show has had three major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with white walls, in an effort to capture the feel of fellow talk show &quot;Donahue&quot;, Jerry&#x27;s haircut and glasses even seeming to make him look like Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.

In the fall of 1994, a few months after the series underwent its format overhaul, the studio received a makeover to make it look a bit warmer and more inviting, complete with brick walls, artwork, and bookcases. The stage walls were designed so that they could be projected outward into the audience, making room for a catwalk that was used in shows such as the 1997 episode &quot;Stripper Wars!&quot; In late 2000, the whole set was changed to its &quot;industrial&quot; look, changes initially welcomed due to the reduced ratings of the 1999–2000 season. In 2007 the set was slightly changed, with a larger studio audience, bigger stage, and a balcony, which was above the stage and ended at the pole. Springer used this as his main entrance by sliding down the pole. The logo and stage design were carried across to the new studio in Stamford, Connecticut, with only a few changes and stayed as such until the end of the run.

===Topic selection===
The show&#x27;s premiere featured a family reunion.

The search for higher ratings led the program gradually towards provocative topics, becoming more successful as it became geared towards youthful viewers (modeled after Ricki Lake&#x27;s popular talk show) by introducing more controversial topics. However, there were still some traditional and serious topics featured on the show at this time, even with the format change.

By December 1994, the show started featuring physical brawls and fights on stage for the first time in episodes like &quot;High Class Hookers Tell All&quot;, &quot;Holiday Hell With My Feuding Family&quot;, &quot;My Boyfriend Turned Out To Be A Girl&quot;, and &quot;I Want My Man To Stop Watching Porn!&quot; 

==History==

===1991–1994: Origins===
Originally seen in only the five markets where Multimedia owned TV stations (Cincinnati, Macon, St. Louis, Cleveland and Knoxville), it was dramatically different from the later version of the show. It started as an issues-oriented and political talk show, a longer version of the commentary for which Springer had gained local fame as a reporter and anchor (not unlike &quot;Donahue&quot; during this time), and for its first season, was even taped at Springer&#x27;s former station, WLWT in Cincinnati. Guests early on included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and the topics included homelessness and gun politics, as well as the social effects of rock music, featuring shock rock star GG Allin, El Duce from The Mentors and GWAR as guests.

For its second season in the fall of 1992, the series was purchased by the NBC owned-and-operated stations, thus allowing it to finally achieve full national distribution, and production was moved to its longtime home at Chicago&#x27;s NBC Tower (with Springer leaving his longtime position at WLWT in order to do so). Series creator and original executive producer Burt Dubrow became Senior Vice-president at Multimedia Entertainment and continued to oversee the show, while bringing in Terry Weible Murphy to become the executive producer.

===1994–2000: Overhaul and ratings success===
In April 1994, Multimedia threatened cancellation if ratings didn&#x27;t improve by that November, which led to a major overhaul that saw Murphy&#x27;s departure and replacement by fellow &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; producer Richard Dominick, under Dubrow&#x27;s purview.

In 1995, there were two performances by Comedy Central Latin star Jade Esteban Estrada. It became a &quot;freak show&quot; where guests seek their 15 minutes of fame through discussion and demonstrations of deviant behavior. In 1996, Springer wanted people to send him videotapes explaining why they wanted Springer to tape a show in their home. Its extraordinary success has led it to be broadcast in dozens of countries.

That same year, several stations that carried &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;, including WLWT in Cincinnati where Springer was a news anchor, refused to broadcast the episode &quot;I Married A Horse&quot;, which led to it being pulled before airing. Additionally, Barry Diller, the head of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; distributor Studios USA, ordered producers to eliminate physical fighting between guests, as he had reportedly become upset by the show and the controversies it sparked. Studios USA later permitted fights to remain as long as they were &quot;toned down&quot;. The show remained popular, though it lost its position as the most-viewed daytime show by June 1999, finishing slightly behind &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

===2000–2005: Continued controversies===
Diller&#x27;s demands to tone down the show, coupled with it losing the top spot in the ratings, led to speculation that Springer would seek a new distributor after his contract expired in 2000. However, he remained with Studios USA, signing a five-year deal worth $30 million. The same year, a married couple, Ralf and Eleanor Panitz, were guests on an episode of the show entitled &quot;Secret Mistresses Confronted&quot; with Panitz&#x27;s ex-wife, Nancy Campbell-Panitz, in which they complained about Campbell-Panitz&#x27;s behavior and accused her of stalking them. Hours after it was broadcast, on July 24, 2000, Campbell-Panitz was found dead in a home that the three were fighting over, and Florida police soon confirmed that they were treating the death as a homicide. It was then reported that Mr. Panitz, having been issued a first-degree murder warrant for the death, was trying to flee to Canada to avoid prosecution. Upon news of the 52-year-old woman&#x27;s murder, a spokeswoman for the program issued a statement saying that it was &quot;a terrible tragedy&quot;.

In August 2000, Springer appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to discuss the incident, claiming that it &quot;had nothing to do with the show&quot; and that his talk show does not glamorize deviant behavior. On March 27, 2002, after a 10-day trial and 18 hours of deliberating from jurors, Mr. Panitz was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.

In 2001, efforts by groups like the Parents Television Council and the American Family Association forced some advertisers to decrease or to stop their sponsorship of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the Independent Television Commission banned &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and other tabloid talk programs from being shown on television during daytime hours on school holidays in response to numerous parental complaints and concerns about children&#x27;s potential exposure to the salacious content (there was a short-running British version of the show made for ITV called &quot;The Springer Show&quot; that was lighter and more tongue-in-cheek).

In 2003, it was revealed that a group of guests from Hayward, California, faked a &quot;love triangle&quot; for an appearance on two episodes of the show; one guest in the group was murdered, but Hayward police determined that his appearance was not connected to his murder.

===2005–2009: Further changes and Wilkos spinoff===
In January 2006, the show was renewed for its sixteenth season, ending speculation that Springer would leave his talk show to run for elected office in Ohio, where he briefly served as mayor of Cincinnati in the late 1970s. By this time, the show began to poke fun at itself by using the taglines &quot;An Hour of Your Life You&#x27;ll Never Get Back&quot; and &quot;Wasting Technology Since 1991&quot;. On May 12, 2006, Springer celebrated his show&#x27;s 3,000th episode by throwing a party on the show (which no one but Jerry showed up to humorously), and showed many clips, including rare excerpts from the show. 2006 also saw the addition of fan favorite Reverend Shnorr, a drunken womanizing character who would often get into heated confrontations with guests while bringing a fresh comedic edge to the show. The character was created by then-promotions director Brian Schnoor while studying Improv at Chicago&#x27;s famed Second City Theater in the 1990s. By December 2007, Rev. Shnorr merchandise was out-selling the show&#x27;s popular security T-shirts on NBC&#x27;s website.

In the United Kingdom, meanwhile, a Commercial High Court trial was scheduled for summer 2006 to resolve a dispute between Flextech Television and NBCUniversal over Flextech in 2002 canceling its 1998 contract to broadcast &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; in the UK as long as new episodes continued to be produced in the U.S.

On July 15, 2007, it was announced that Springer was picked up by NBC-Universal through the 2009–2010 season. Also, VH1 ran a documentary series &quot;The Springer Hustle&quot;, going &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of the show, having already run another Springer-related documentary in 2005 titled &quot;When Jerry Springer Ruled the World&quot;. Springer&#x27;s appearance on the NBC television network show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; led to an increase in viewership for the first quarter of 2007. Steve Wilkos filled in for Springer during the beginning of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

The security staff for the program also was given new additions, as starting in the seventeenth season, three female security guards were added. Certain professional athletes have come on the show as one-off security guards for some episodes. They include hockey players Joe Corvo and Adam Burish, and mixed martial arts fighters Andrei Arlovski, Shonie Carter, and Bas Rutten.

While certain advertisers continued to avoid buying ad time for &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;, the series continued to keep steady ratings in the February 2008 &quot;Sweeps&quot; period.

Executive producer Richard Dominick resigned shortly after the start of the 18th season; Rachelle Consiglio, wife of Steve Wilkos and longtime Senior Producer, replaced Dominick. The set decorations added during the 17th season were removed.

===2009–2018: Move to Connecticut and final years===
On May 19, 2009, the show recorded its last episode at WMAQ-TV&#x27;s NBC Tower in Chicago, Illinois, where it had been videotaped since 1992, midway through the second season. Beginning with the 2009–10 season, production was moved to the Rich Forum at the Stamford Center for the Arts in Stamford, Connecticut, after NBCUniversal received tax credits from the state of Connecticut to move Springer, along with &quot;Maury&quot; and &quot;Steve Wilkos&quot; to the state, along with NBC Sports. Springer said he was not happy with the move, but understood the financial reasons for which it was being done, and was working to secure jobs for those on his staff who wished to move with the show. After moving to Stamford, the show went through a number of changes; the set became more highly colored with new lighting, new chairs for guests, two new security guards, and a change to its theme music.

The show aired its 20th anniversary episode, which was taped in Times Square, on October 27, 2010. &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;&#x27;s twenty-first season premiered on September 19, 2011, debuting with new graphics. On September 17, 2012, &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; began airing in widescreen and 1080i, in conjunction with its 22nd-season premiere.

In October 2014, it was announced that the show had been renewed by NBC Universal through September 2018. The 25th season of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; began on September 21, 2015. With the 25th season anniversary of the show, Rachelle Wilkos, wife of Steve Wilkos departed as the executive producer of the show. Wilkos would transition full-time as the executive producer of her husband&#x27;s show, as Kerry Shannon, another longtime producer, was promoted as the show&#x27;s new executive producer. Despite her departure from the show, Wilkos briefly remained with the show as a consultant.

==Controversies over authenticity and violence==
In the late 1990s, the show was quite popular and controversial, so much so that it caused contemporaries like Jenny Jones, Maury Povich, Montel Williams, and Ricki Lake to &quot;revamp&quot; their own shows in order to improve ratings. However, major figures in television, along with many religious leaders, had called for the show&#x27;s removal and considered it to be of bad taste. The phrase &quot;Jerry Springer Nation&quot; began to be used by some who see the program as being a bad influence on the morality of the United States.

In 1997 and 1998, the show reached its ratings peak, at one point becoming the first talk show in years to beat &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. It featured almost non-stop fighting between guests—5 to 12 per day during one April 1998 week—and religious figures and even other TV personalities complained. Chicago City Council suggested that if the fistfights and chair-throwing were real, then the guests should be arrested for committing acts of violence in the city, as alderman Ed Burke was concerned over the fact that the off-duty Chicago police officers serving as security guards for the program failed to take legal action against fighting guests. Springer explained that the violence on the program &quot;look[ed] real&quot; to him, also arguing that the fighting on the show &quot;never, ever, ever glamorizes violence&quot;. Ultimately, the City Council chose not to pursue the matter. Because of this probe and other external and internal pressures, the fighting was taken off the show temporarily before being allowed again in a less violent nature. In the years of the show having toned down the fights, viewership declined but remained respectable by the newer standards of daytime television ratings.

There had been continuous debate over the authenticity of the fighting. In an interview, a production assistant stated that &quot;we try our hardest to screen people,&quot; and inauthentic-seeming guests had been kicked off stage. Marvin Kitman, television critic for the &quot;Newsday&quot; newspaper, felt that the fighting had been choreographed beforehand. Christopher Sterling of the George Washington University media department compared the program to professional wrestling; some producers later claimed the fights on the show were inspired by the fights and angles in WWE. Sixteen former guests of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;, who were interviewed on various U.S. media outlets such as the entertainment news program &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; newspaper, claimed there was a &quot;fight quota&quot; for each episode, and that they and other guests were encouraged to fight one another. In the past, producers booked professional wrestlers such as The Iron Sheik, Razor Ramon (albeit in a non-fighting role), Jamie Dundee, 2 Tuff Tony, Madman Pondo, and One Man Kru (also a hip hop artist), as well as lady wrestlers and midget wrestlers; one guest would be a then-unknown Justin Roberts, then-primary ring announcer for WWE. Springer would later make guest appearances during &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on two occasions.

In screening potential cases for his next show &quot;Judge Jerry&quot;, Springer deliberately chose a process that picks cases from those that have already been filed, to prevent would-be litigants from seeking out the show as had been suspected with &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;.

Springer stated in an October 2000 interview with the Reuters news agency:
==Censorship==

&quot;Jerry Springer&quot; aired on various stations in the United States at various times of the day, whether in the morning, the afternoon, or the late night hours. All syndicated episodes of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; were censored, regardless of time, to comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broadcast decency standards.

Initially, most profanity was bleeped, but later episodes were bleeped for explicit language, sometimes to such an extent that speech became incomprehensible; along with the mouth being spot-blurred so that viewers could not read lips. In addition, nudity, flashing of breasts, buttocks, and genital areas; as well as the middle finger was pixelated. After longtime producer Richard Dominick left, the show reverted to the traditional style of bleeping, which remains in place today. A &quot;New York Times&quot; report from April 1998 found that each episode had about 85 to 130 bleeps.

Springer himself had stated that, while his show was a bit wild, there were certain things that were not permitted. The audience was not allowed to shout anything that encouraged or sustained violence among the guests. Furniture could be pushed aside, but the chairs were purposely large to preclude their use as a weapon. Men being violent against women was never acceptable, on- or off-camera; in &quot;Ringmaster&quot;, Springer mentioned that he always asked female guests if they wanted to press charges.

==Broadcast history and release==
&quot;Jerry Springer&quot; was syndicated worldwide. In the United States, it was distributed by Multimedia Entertainment and placed in first-run syndication on September 30, 1991. The show was later distributed by Universal and then Studios USA.

Episodes were available for individual purchase from Video Archives.

On June 13, 2018, the industry publication &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; reported that the series had ceased production and that the 2018–19 season forward would solely consist of reruns. The final first-run episode aired on July 26, 2018. Springer had originally intended to retire after the show ended production; instead, NBCUniversal, interested in keeping his services, convinced him into working on a new courtroom show, to be called &quot;Judge Jerry&quot;.

The CW acquired rerun rights to the show to fill an hour in their daytime timeslot that previously aired &quot;The Robert Irvine Show&quot;. The CW, which began airing the show on September 10, 2018, has first right to the episodes that have been produced but remain unaired, which number in the &quot;dozens&quot;. The CW also had the right to ask that production of the series be revived in the future. Reruns continued to air on The CW until it left the network on September 10, 2021 as a reorganizing of its programming lineup (replacing its daytime block with a Saturday night lineup, which neither the CW nor its predecessors have programmed since they launched in 1995). Reruns continued to air thereafter in broadcast syndication and on The CW Plus until September 6, 2024, when both ceased carrying the show in all markets, just nearly seventeen months after Springer’s April 2023 death from pancreatic cancer.

==Reception==
===Television viewership and ratings===
For a time, it was the top-rated daytime talk show in the United States, drawing about eight million viewers an episode.

By 2018, the show&#x27;s ratings had dropped to about 1.7 million viewers per episode.

===Critical response===
&quot;New York&quot; listed it as one of the worst television shows of 1995 and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Steve Johnson listed it as the second worst show of 1996. The show also topped &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2002 list of &quot;The Worst TV Shows Ever&quot;; for a time, the show itself would even frequently boast about this ranking in its opening credits as a form of self-deprecation. In 2005, the program became a subject of criticism in Bernard Goldberg&#x27;s book &quot;100 People Who Are Screwing Up America&quot;, being called &quot;TV&#x27;s lowest life-form&quot; and Springer himself being ranked at 32 and labeled an &quot;American Pioneer&quot;. Goldberg also claimed that Springer was knowingly capitalizing on the disadvantages of his guests and the stupidity of his audience, also citing the controversial episode revolving around the man who married his horse.

As the show&#x27;s popularity peaked in 1998, a backlash grew against its tawdry content and the quantity of onstage fights between guests during this time became extremely common after steadily rising around December, 1994. By 1997, on stage fights between guests began airing more extensively. Bob Iger, then chairman of ABC, dubbed it an embarrassment to the television industry, and then-U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman implored stations to stop broadcasting it. Many major companies refused to advertise on the show due to its reputation. Consequently, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that while the program had higher ratings than &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; at the time, the cost of a 30-second advertisement was less than a third of that charged by &quot;Oprah&quot;. Most commercials during &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; were &quot;1-800-number ads -- for technical schools, personal-injury law firms, mortgage lenders, insurance companies and health services&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
In 1999, the show was parodied in the film &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;. Dr. Evil and his son Scott appear on the show to discuss being evil, which ends with Dr. Evil and Springer himself brawling onstage. Along with Springer, Steve Wilkos and Todd Schultz played themselves in the movie.

In 2003, a British opera inspired by the series, &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, began playing in the United Kingdom.

On January 7, 2025, Netflix released a documentary about the show, &quot;Jerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action&quot;.

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;The Steve Wilkos Show&quot;===
By 2005, security director Steve Wilkos became a cult figure on his own, and would close each show walking down a hallway engaging in casual talk with one of the more colorful guests of the preceding episode. He also would occasionally host the show. Episodes that he hosted were intended to be more serious in tone than the typical episode of &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;. Wilkos left &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; at the end of the 2006–2007 season to pursue a spin-off talk show, &quot;The Steve Wilkos Show&quot;. 
 It was also shot at the NBC Tower in Chicago and produced by Richard Dominick, who continued to produce &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; as well. 

===&quot;Too Hot for TV&quot;===

During the show&#x27;s most popular era in the mid-late 1990s, &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; released videotapes and later DVDs marketed as &quot;Too Hot for TV&quot;, beginning in October, 1997. They contained uncensored nudity, profanity, and explicit violence (such as punches and slaps deemed too intense for daytime television) that was edited out of broadcasts in order to conform to FCC standards for television broadcast decency and suitability. The releases sold and rented remarkably well and inspired similar sets from other series. Eventually, the show started producing similar &quot;uncensored&quot; monthly pay-per-view/video on demand specials as well as part of In Demand&#x27;s &quot;Too Much for TV&quot; brand of PPV/on-demand content.

In 2015, Springer brought the Too Hot for TV format to the WWE Network for a series of episodes featuring WWE&#x27;s most controversial segments.

===&quot;The Springer Show&quot;===
In 1999, ITV made 12 British-based version episodes of the series &quot;Jerry Springer UK&quot;, filmed at the same studios as his American show.

In 2005, another British version was shown made for ITV titled &quot;The Springer Show&quot; as a replacement for &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot;, which defected to Channel 5. Initially Springer only signed a one-month deal. It beat its talk-show rival &quot;Trisha Goddard&quot; five to one in the ratings, despite it being a subdued and more tongue-in-cheek version of the American show. The series was broadcast from June 6, 2005, until July 1, with the remaining 10 episodes broadcast from September 5 until September 16, 2005, when &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot; fully replaced the show.

===&quot;Ça va se savoir!&quot;===
From 2002 to 2008, a French-Belgian version of the show was produced, hosted by Simon Monceau. For most of its run, it was produced and recorded in Belgium. Contrary to the original version, &quot;Ça va se savoir !&quot; clearly made public that the show&#x27;s guests were in fact actors, which was also indicated during the end titles.

<text>Fagersta Municipality (&quot;Fagersta kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västmanland County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Fagersta.

The &quot;City of Fagersta&quot; (instituted in 1944) was in 1967 merged with Västervåla parish (which had been part of Surahammar Municipality since 1963). In 1971 it was transformed into a municipality of unitary type.

==Localities==
The municipal seat, Fagersta, is the only locality within the municipality with more than 200 inhabitants.

Another locality of note is Ängelsberg, a village located on Åmänningen Lake.

== Politics of Fagersta == 
Fagersta is historically a left wing stronghold, with mostly a social democratic majority running the town, a trend only broken with a further left majority between 1998–2014. However, a rapid shift saw the right-leaning coalition narrowly win the 2022 Swedish general election vote in the municipality. The local elections still saw the Social Democratic-Left Party combination winning a combined majority of seats.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Fagersta Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

<text>Hallstahammar Municipality (&quot;Hallstahammars kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västmanland County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Hallstahammar.

In 1971 &quot;old&quot; Hallstahammar (with the status of a &quot;köping&quot; since 1943) was amalgamated with parts of the dissolved &quot;Kolbäck&quot; rural municipality to form the present municipality of unitary type.

The municipal slogan is &quot;Bo hos oss&quot; (&quot;Live with us&quot;), which reflects the ambition of the present municipal leadership to boost population figures.

== Geography ==
The municipality is subdivided into two parishes: Hallstahammar-Berg and Kolbäck-Säby. They are distinctive from each other: Hallstahammar-Berg in the north is situated along forest lands; Kolbäck-Säby in the south is a centre of communications by roads and railways as well as the intersecting river. Strömsholm, in the southern part of Kolbäck, borders Lake Mälaren and has open fields around its Royal Castle.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Hallstahammar Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 16,581 residents, including 12,314 Swedish citizens of voting age. 47.7% voted for the left coalition and 50.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== Riksdag elections ==
== Communications ==
With train it takes 10 minutes to central Västerås (a larger city), and about an hour to the Central Station of Stockholm. It is also possible to travel straight south, passing the bridge over Lake Mälaren to the larger city Eskilstuna. Good car transport is provided by European route E18 that passes between Kolbäck and Hallstahammar.

== Notable places ==
One of Sweden&#x27;s foremost riding gymnasiums is located in Strömsholm, as part of the Kantzowska Gymnasium. The Church of Kolbäck goes back to the 13th century and has interior decorations paid for by Queen Hedvig Eleonora in the 17th century. The Church of Säby was beautifully restored in the 1630s.

<text>Heby Municipality (&quot;Heby kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Uppsala County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Heby.

The first municipality with the name &quot;Heby&quot; was created in 1952, during the first of the two nationwide municipal reforms in Sweden, through the amalgamation of three original units in Västmanland County. The name was taken from the settlement Heby, which had been a &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; (a kind of borough) since 1887. In 1971 three more former entities were added.

==Geography==
The Dalälven River forms Heby&#x27;s northern border. The municipality also has substantial forests with animals such as elk, deer, fox, bear and lynx.

==Notability==
Heby used to be part of Västmanland County, which borders Uppsala County to the west. In September 2005 it was reported that the municipality was permitted to be part of Uppsala County after intense lobbying in the late 1990s, following a municipal poll in 1998 where the majority was in support of the county transition. The transition took place on January 1, 2007. There were, however, forces who worked for the transition not to take place.

The town remained a part of Allemstraf Township until 1817 when it was granted a charter as a borough. In 1837 the Cumberland Valley Railroad came through the area, and in 1874 the borough was extended to the south to include the homes and businesses that had grown up along the railroad.

Shughart&#x27;s story is depicted in &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, a 2001 film by Ridley Scott, based on the book &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot; by Mark Bowden.

<text>North Middleton Township is a township in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 12,039 at the 2020 census.

The township manager is John M. Epley

==Geography==
The township is in north-central Cumberland County, bordered by Perry County to the north and the borough of Carlisle, the Cumberland County seat, to the south. The Perry County line follows the crest of Blue Mountain. Conodoguinet Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, crosses the southern part of the township just north of Carlisle, making several large bends. The Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) crosses the township between the creek and Carlisle, with the closest access being in Middlesex Township to the east.

Half of the Carlisle Fairgrounds and much of the Carlisle Barracks, containing the U.S. Army War College, are located in the township adjacent to Carlisle borough. A portion of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School National Historic Landmark is in the township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.43%, is water.

Unincorporated communities in North Middleton Township:
*Schlusser, a census-designated place
*Caprivi
*Carlisle Barracks CDP

==History==
When Cumberland County was founded in 1750, it originally consisted of three townships: East and West Pennsborough Townships, and Middleton Township. In 1810, due to population increase, Middleton Township was divided into North Middleton Township to the north of Carlisle, and South Middleton Township to the south. In the mid 18th century, the area that is now the township was inhabited primarily by Scotch Irish settlers who were granted land patents in that region by the family of William Penn, the proprietors of Pennsylvania at the time. The rapid settlement of this area at that time was the result of the Penns&#x27; plan to keep the Scotch Irish who were viewed as rowdy and unsophisticated out of the more refined Lancaster and York counties to the southeast. Thus, by the late 1700s, the population west of the Susquehanna River was composed almost exclusively of Scotch Irish settlers.

As was common of most areas in the Cumberland Valley at that time, most early settlers of North Middleton Township were farmers by trade, and perhaps the area&#x27;s most lasting legacy was the great quantity and quality of barns built there. The majority of these barns exhibited a style that came to be known as the Pennsylvania barn. Many of these barns were built during the late 1800s, but a fair number still exist in the township today. According to a township publication from 1976, there were 78 barns still standing in the area, and although this number has dwindled since that time, there are still several dozen barns in the township today, and agriculture still remains a substantial sector in the region&#x27;s economy.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 10,197 people, 4,039 households, and 2,948 families residing in the township. The population density was .

== History ==
The area was known as &quot;Skinnsäckeberg&quot; in the medieval age, which translates to &quot;Skinsack mountain&quot;, perhaps referring to skinsacks used to carry material up to the mountains, but no one knows for sure.

The area, located within the Mining district of Central Sweden (&quot;Bergslagen&quot;) was a mining district since the 14th century, mostly for iron, but copper was also mined for.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Skinnskatteberg Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 4,361 residents, including 3,403 Swedish citizens of voting age. 46.4% voted for the left coalition and 52.5% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

The municipality has a flowering cultural life with several theatre groups. There is an annual choral meeting, among other music activities. A pride is Galleri Astley in Uttersberg, which is an internationally renowned art center and gallery with around 100 000 visits annually.

Ekomuseum Bergslagen shows the history and culture of iron. It is a museum without walls consisting more than 50 different objects, extending through six municipalities. Twelve of those objects are situated in Skinnskatteberg.

Röda Jorden (The Red Soil) is Sweden’s to date oldest iron preparation site, active between 700 BC to 200 AD. There is a reconstruction of a furnace and a roasting hearth used to demonstrate the process. You can book a day of activities or for a shorter guidetour. You can also discover the area by yourself.

Kopparverket (The Copper Works) at Riddarhyttan has seen industrial activity since the Middle Ages. There are many buildings, ponds and ruins standing and a posted path to show the way.

Lienshyttan (The Blast Furnace of Lienshyttan) is from 1847. The Bastnäs mineral and mine area is one of the world’s richest mineral sites.

Färna bruk is an ironworks from the 16th century with a stately manor. There is also a remarkable mausoleum and a pavilion with lovely paintings. The manor house is a hotel sometime visited by the King of Sweden Carl XlV Gustav.

The Karmansbo bruksmiljö is a well-preserved industrial area with a mansion, workers residences, Lancashire forges and works office. The manor house is a hotel there too. You can see the forges in work in one day in July every year or you can book it for a day of your own.

Ebba Brahes pavilion lies on an island below the Bockhammar manor, probably the oldest pavilion in the country.

This one is an octagonal, pink pavilion built in the 17th century. There is a summer café close.

== Outdoor activities==
The area has great possibilities for a rich outdoor life. There are 244 lakes and most of them are available for fishing. Fishing is a widely spread activity in the district and attracts a lot of visitors. In most of the lakes you can take a swim.

<doc id="132335" wikidata="Q34078" url="?curid=132335" title="Surahammar Municipality">
<text>Surahammar Municipality (&quot;Surahammars kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Västmanland County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Surahammar.

The municipality is located some 100 km west of Stockholm in the southern part of the mineral-rich Bergslagen region.

The municipality was formed in 1963 through the amalgamation of &quot;Ramnäs&quot; and &quot;Sura&quot;.

== Localities ==
* Ramnäs
* Surahammar (seat)
* Virsbo

== History ==
Steelmaking in this municipality was started on a larger scale in the 16th and 17th centuries when forges were built there. It was a new phenomenon to run forge mills separate from mining and pig iron production sites in Bergslagen. The mills were located in Virsbo, Ramnäs and Surahammar and pig iron was transported from mills further north, initially by horse-sledges in the winter. There was ample local supply of hydropower to run the forge hammers and timber to make charcoal. Later, when Strömsholm Canal was finished, it was used to ship finished products to Västerås and Stockholm for export. This restructuring process appears to have been driven by the need to secure access to hydropower and timber for the forges since both the mines and blast furnaces used up considerable amounts of resources in the production of pig iron.

Over time, the mills specialised and in Ramnäs the key product became iron chains – in modern days for the off-shore industry – and in Surahammar wheel-sets for the rail road industry and electro steels, both with ASEA as a major customer.

In Surahammar, Gustaf Eriksson developed the first combustion-engine automobile built in Sweden in 1897. It formed the basis for a new Swedish industry that was located in Södertälje under the name of Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget i Södertelge (renamed in 1906 to Vabis that later merged with Scania AB).

Today, the mills in Virsbo, Ramnäs and Surahammar have been transformed into modern industries with international owners.

== Economy ==
Industry in Surahammar includes:
* Surahammars Bruk AB - electrical steels
* Adtranz Wheelset AB - wheelsets for the railroad industry
* Metso Powdermet
* Scana Ramnäs AB
* Uponor Wirsbo AB
* Ruukki Sverige AB, Virsbo

== Tourism ==
The Strömsholm Canal has been restored and is a popular route for small yachts. One can navigate from Strömsholm Palace, one of the Royal Palaces in Sweden at lake Mälaren to Fagersta and Smedjebacken through several canal locks and lakes, a total distance of 100 km.

Ecomuseum Bergslagen gives an in-depth view of how the early industrialization evolved in the Bergslagen region. It consists of some 40 sites.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Surahammar Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 10,073 residents, including 7,495 Swedish citizens of voting age. 44.4% voted for the left coalition and 54.6% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>Shiremanstown is a borough in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. Bordered to the north by Hampden Township and to the south by Lower Allen Township, it is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The population was 1,569 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
The borough has a history that dates back prior to its establishment in 1864. The borough was named after Daniel Shireman, a German immigrant who settled in the area in the 18th century. Daniel Shireman was a butcher by trade and became a prominent figure in the community.

Before its incorporation as a borough, the area was part of Lower Allen Township. The community grew around the Shireman family and their contributions to the local economy. The town community grew again with the addition of St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church.

Sometime before 1797, a German Reformed church and school were established near the community of Shiremanstown in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. It became known as the &quot;Peace Church.&quot; Nearly one hundred years later, the log structure was still in use, but only as a school by that time. As the surrounding communities grew over the years, the church&#x27;s congregation also continued to grow. Eventually, the congregation became known as St. John&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church. 

In 1897, leaders of the congregation expanded the church further by purchasing the old Messiah church located in Shiremanstown. Initially used for evening services, that building also became the congregation&#x27;s home during the winter months, and was in use regularly until it was destroyed by fire on September 2, 1908.

St. John&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church is now located on Main Street in Shiremanstown.

<text>Dauphin is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 796 at the 2020 census. Dauphin&#x27;s ZIP code is 17018. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Dauphin is located on the western edge of Dauphin County at , on the east bank of the Susquehanna River. The land at the river&#x27;s edge is alluvial floodplain, but Dauphin sits at the head of a narrow valley between two mountains, at the mouth of Stony Creek. The valley between the two mountains is called Stony Valley, which contains the villages of Singersville and Ellendale Forge. This section along the Susquehanna River is a gateway from the southeastern plains into the Appalachian Mountains and the north-central part of the state. Berrier Island is also located at Dauphin.

Dauphin is surrounded by Middle Paxton Township, which comprises mountains and valleys south of the confluence of the Susquehanna and Juniata rivers. From south to north, the mountains in the township are Blue Mountain, Second Mountain, Third or Stony Mountain, and Peters Mountain. The eastern ends of these valleys are generally undeveloped state game lands and protected watershed.

U.S. Routes 22 and 322 pass through the borough as a four-lane expressway, close to the Susquehanna River, with full access from Pennsylvania Route 225 at the west end of town and with westbound access from the east end of town.

==History==
Dauphin borough began as a settlement at the mouth of Stony Creek, the head of a valley between Second and Third Mountains. It was established by Samuel Sturgeon in 1765. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Sturgeon property was owned by Revolutionary War soldier Timothy Green. The locality became known as Green&#x27;s Mill, after the grist mill Colonel Green built at the mouth of the creek. According to local history, the area was also known for its colonial-period fort, alternately called Fort Lyon or Fort McKee. Colonel Green continued to hold highly valued real estate until his death in 1812. By 1814, his plantation property with its mills became part of his son Judge Innis Green&#x27;s holdings. Judge Green continued to add to his real estate holdings throughout the early nineteenth century.

The surrounding township is called Middle Paxton, part of the former Paxton Township of Lancaster County prior to the creation of Dauphin County in 1785. Middle Paxton Township was incorporated in 1787. The main geographic feature of this area are ancient hills or mountains and narrow valleys that generally run east to west with streams emptying into the Susquehanna River. The township remained rural until the twentieth century.

Judge Green laid out Dauphin as &quot;Port Lyon&quot; in recognition of the former fort in 1826. Green named the Port Lyon streets after Pennsylvania rivers and creeks. Opportunities for economic expansion for the area appeared bright that year, as legislation was passed for creation of the Pennsylvania Canal. This fostered expectations that Dauphin would become a port to the coalfields lying to the northeast. Green acted on behalf of the Dauphin &amp; Susquehanna (D &amp; S) Coal Company, which had purchased eighteen tracts of land on or near Little Mountain, totaling about , from a group of businessmen. Charles Bird had earlier that year purchased four tracts of land in Middle Paxton Township from Judge Green. Bird&#x27;s interest was purchased by a group of businessmen who then sold to the D &amp; S Coal Company. Green received the last payment on the agreement price of US $10,000.00 in 1835.
Dauphin was incorporated into a borough by an act of Assembly in 1845. According to the 1850 census, Dauphin had 650 inhabitants at that time. There were 124 families in 118 dwellings. The 1860 census for the borough illustrated the working-class nature of the people living there. The borough had 649 inhabitants in 129 households, nearly the same as recorded in 1850. Fifty-five of the men listed their occupation as &quot;day laborer&quot;. The 1870 census showed a marked change in the occupation of Dauphin&#x27;s residents. Jobs related to the canal had dropped dramatically, while those associated with the railroads had increased substantially. At this time there were 151 households living in 148 dwellings. The borough&#x27;s population had increased to 742. By 1875, the borough contained four churches, three schools and one select school, and two lodges. The 1880 census showed 155 families living in 146 dwellings in Dauphin.

In the early twentieth century, several &quot;summer&quot; houses were constructed on the edge of Second Mountain, south of Stony Creek. Middle-class residents of Harrisburg built these houses as second homes to supplement their primary townhouses. These houses are collectively called &quot;Hillside&quot; and have since become year-round homes.

The borough, situated along the Susquehanna River, has always been associated with transportation. Original Native American trails would have followed waterways such as the river and Stony Creek. Development of the canal system of transporting goods during the early nineteenth century gave way to the rise of the railroads, which lasted for much of the twentieth. U.S. Route 22 became a major highway through Pennsylvania during the mid-twentieth century, parts of which were actually constructed within the footprint of the former Pennsylvania Canal. Dauphin thus developed as an early transportation hub, but in more recent decades has been bypassed by more significant routes of transport, such as the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System.

In the last forty or so years, Dauphin Borough has been a bedroom community of Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital. Many of its civic centers had gone into steep decline, industry migrated elsewhere, taverns and hotels closed, as did schools and churches. The railroad, which declined during the late twentieth century, has been reduced to two tracks paralleling the river, with no stops or stations in Dauphin. One of the reasons for the decline was that as traffic on U.S. Rte. 22 increased, the borough became less desirable as a place in which to reside. By the 1980s, traffic on Rte. 22 was so heavy that the road essentially cut the borough in half. Residents often had such a difficult time traveling across the borough that they waited until after morning and evening rush hours. On weekends when the Pennsylvania State University in State College, some upstate, held football games, Rte. 22 through the borough was impassable.

In older times, Dauphin was the hub of a collection of small village centers in Middle Paxton Township of Dauphin County. Some of these settlements included Singersville, just east of the borough; Ellendale Forge, up Stony Creek Valley; Dauphin Furnace, west of town at the mouth of Clark Creek; Speeceville, west of town at the foot of Peters Mountain; and Heckton Mills, south of Second Mountain about a mile downriver from Dauphin. Much of the eastern part of the township, between Peters Mountain and Second Mountain, is forested and preserved as State Game Lands.

Most of these village centers have ceased to exist as the western part of Middle Paxton Township became suburbanized. The nearest organized towns to Dauphin are Duncannon, a borough on the western shore of the river; Halifax, a borough north of Peters Mountain; and Harrisburg, the state capital to the south.

In the late 1990s, following many years of planning and several postponements, Dauphin Borough was bypassed. A construction project that had caused much controversy resulted in relocating U.S. Rte. 22 closer to the river and out of, or over, Dauphin Borough. Approximately 28% of the borough&#x27;s taxable real estate was taken in order to construct the bypass. The remaining town, free of the traffic problems, became once again desirable as a location for commuters to Harrisburg. Some of the last remaining open land in the borough was developed as residential space, and older structures in the borough were increasingly bought and renovated by commuters. Despite the losses in tax revenues owing to construction of the bypass, the local government continues to operate through cost-saving, cooperative efforts with Middle Paxton Township. Sewer system connections were extended to borough residents in Hillside and along River Road as part of a collection system and pump station upgrade. In 2011, the Dauphin/Middle Paxton Fire Company relocated its apparatus from the borough to a new government building housing Middle Paxton Township offices and Public Safety. The local ambulance association became dormant, and Susquehanna Township E.M.S. began covering medical emergencies in both borough and township.

<doc id="132355" wikidata="Q5263213" url="?curid=132355" title="Derry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Derry Township is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 24,796 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 24,679 tabulated in 2010. Hershey, the site of the well-known Hershey&#x27;s chocolate factory and its affiliated amusement park, is located within the township. Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and the Penn State Hershey Children&#x27;s Hospital are also located on a large tract of land in the township.

==History==
The earliest recorded information about the Derry Township area dates back to 1608, when Captain John Smith explored the region. Leaving Jamestown to search for much-needed food, Smith&#x27;s journey through the Chesapeake Bay region covered an estimated 3,000 miles.

The Township of Derry was incorporated on August 1, 1729, by John, Thomas, and Richard Penn, the sons of William Penn and Proprietors of Pennsylvania. They established Derry Township, along with other townships, to partition Lancaster County&#x27;s territory for tax purposes. Lancaster County itself had been created earlier that same year.

At that time, the boundaries of Derry Township were much larger and included what are currently three other townships within Lancaster County and Dauphin County (which included Lebanon County). The township&#x27;s boundaries extended from the mouth of the Conewago to the mouth of the Swatara in the west, then to the mouth of the Quittapahilla in the north, south in a straight line to the Conewago, and west along the river back to the starting point.

The first official government in Derry Township was established in 1759. Five officials were elected for one-year terms. The number of elected officials in Derry remains five, although the terms are now six years.

In 1767 the court ordered the division of Derry Township, the eastern section to remain Derry and the western to be Londonderry Township.

Derry and Londonderry became a part of Dauphin County when it was established in 1785. In 1787, the township&#x27;s population was 198. Conewago Township was created in 1850 from southern parts of Derry Township and eastern parts of Londonderry Township.

The Derry Session House and Enclosure and Quarries of the Hummelstown Brownstone Company are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Derry Township is located in southeastern Dauphin County, bordered to the east by Lebanon County. Swatara Creek forms the northwest border of the township, except where the border is with the borough of Hummelstown. The unincorporated community of Hershey occupies the center, northern, and much of the eastern part of the township, and Palmdale is in the northeastern part of the township.

<text>Hershey is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Derry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is home to the Hershey Company, which was founded by candy magnate Milton S. Hershey, and Hersheypark, an amusement park.

The community is located east of Harrisburg and is part of the Harrisburg metropolitan area. Hershey has no legal status as an incorporated municipality, and all its municipal services are provided by Derry Township. The population was 13,858 at the 2020 census.

Hershey is also located southwest of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia.

==History==

=== Early settlement ===
In the beginning of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania’s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found.

In 1681, King Charles II granted a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to William Penn to offset debts he owed Penn&#x27;s father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. Penn&#x27;s promise of spiritual tolerance and governmental participation brought many immigrants to the region. The first settlers to live near Hershey came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates.

The Scotch-Irish immigrants left their homelands due to a number of political and economic atrocities by Queen Anne, who persecuted anyone who refused to conform to the Anglican Church. The mountains of Appalachia and the valleys of frontier Pennsylvania drew the attention of these settlers, who were joined by Catholic and Presbyterian Scottish Highlanders who fled due to similar reasons. Naturally, the Scots were clannish, and tended not to mix with the other ethnic groups settling the area at the same time. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area.

The Scotch-Irish established several Presbyterian churches as they moved westward across the state, including the Derry Presbyterian Church in Old Derry Village near the head of the Spring Creek. Prominent attendants included the Clarks, Campbells, Blacks, Boyds, Roland Chambers, James Hamilton, James Harris, William McCord, John Mitchell, and Malcom Kar. The land on which the present Derry Church is situated was given by John, Thomas, and Richard Penn, the sons of William Penn and Proprietors of Pennsylvania. The old Session House was built in 1732 and enclosed in glass in 1929 for preservation by Milton S. Hershey.

Early Scotch-Irish surnames in the Derry Township area included Hayes, Wilson, Harris, Clark, Wallace, McDonald, Logan, Davidson, Wray, McCallen, and Robinson.

The German Palatinates, later called the &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch,&quot; had similarly left their homelands and for a number of reasons, namely political oppression, religious persecution, and economic poverty. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Most of these settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.

Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies.

The Pennsylvania frontier proved dangerous to early settlers. The French and Indian Wars, which decimated the area, forced the construction of a series of forts along the Blue Mountains. During its most famous stage, the Delawares, who aligned with the French, marched down the Blue Mountains to raid the settlers.

At the time of the American Revolution, the settlers of the Derry Township area were enthusiastic about a war for freedom, as evidenced by early protestors and adoption of a list of patriotic resolves on 25 July, 1776, signed by Scotch-Irish and Germans alike.

The land on which Hershey sits on was originally patented by John Carver in the center, James Campbell in the north, and James Galbraith in the northwest. Other communities in the area included Palmstown (now Palmyra), Campbelltown, Millerstown (now Annville), Middletown, and Fredrickstown (now Hummelstown).

==== Transportation ====
Transportation from one settlement to the next was essential if either settlement wanted to grow. Turnpike companies were chartered to create improved roads to better facilitate the movement of goods from town to town. Governor Thomas McKean authorized the formation of the Berks and Dauphin Turnpike in 1805 to connect the cities of Reading and Hummelstown.

The Downingtown, Ephrata and Harrisburg Pike, which was commonly known as the Horseshoe Pike, was chartered in 1803 and completed 1819 and ran through Derry.

==== Education ====
The Pennsylvania Germans and Scotch-Irish were hesitant to accept the idea of free or public schools. They respected education, but associated it with the church, not the state. The enactment of the Free School Act in 1834, entitled &quot;An Act to Establish a General System of Education by Common Schools&quot; was the first great victory for public schools. In 1893, free textbooks and supplies were provided by state law in all Pennsylvania public schools. The first compulsory school attendance law for children was enacted in 1895, but there were many legal exceptions. Education has since been served by the Derry Township School District.
=== Founding of Hershey ===
Using the proceeds from the 1900 sale of the Lancaster Caramel Company, Milton S. Hershey acquired farmland roughly 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Lancaster, near his birthplace in Derry Township. The factory was in the center of a dairy farmland near Derry Church, but with Hershey&#x27;s support, houses, businesses, churches and a transportation infrastructure accreted around the plant. The area around the factory eventually became known as the company town of Hershey, Pennsylvania.

The town was officially founded in 1903 and completed in 1905, namely for the company’s workers, and their homes had modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing, and central heating. The town had a public trolley system, a free school to educate the children of employees, a free vocational school to train orphaned and underprivileged boys, and later an amusement park, golf courses, community center, hotel, zoo, and a sports area. The purpose was to provide &quot;a perfect American town in a bucolic natural setting, where healthy, right-living, and well-paid workers lived in safe, happy homes.&quot;

In 1905, Milton Hershey began constructing a theme park for his workers which he named &quot;Hershey Park.&quot; It officially opened to the public on Memorial Day, May 30, 1906. Located along the banks of Spring Creek, the park was an ideal spot for picnicking, boating, and canoeing, and featured graceful trees and wooded groves. ZooAmerica, formerly the Hershey Zoo, was added to the park in 1910 and housed Milton Hershey&#x27;s own animals.

The public trolley system was built in 1908 in the form of a street railway and provided the citizens easy access to other towns and cities in the area. On 15 November 1909, Milton and Catherine Hershey created and endowed the Hershey Industrial School. Hershey, who had no children of his own, sought to provide underprivileged boys with the education and skills needed to succeed in the real world.

Milton S. Hershey established Hershey Entertainment and Resorts as Hershey Estates in 1927 to distinguish his chocolate manufacturing company from his other business ventures. The Pennsylvania State Police Academy was also opened in Hershey the same year.

=== Growth and tourism ===
Many of the town&#x27;s structures were built and financed during the Great Depression as part of Hershey&#x27;s &quot;Great Building Campaign&quot; to provide jobs. This helped transform the town into a major tourist attraction that continues to grow in popularity each year.

Many of Hershey&#x27;s acclaimed projects include:

Hershey Country Club, opened 1930

The Hotel Hershey, opened May 1933

Hershey Theatre, opened September 1933

Hersheypark Arena, opened 1936

Hersheypark Stadium, opened May 1939

From 1930 to 1936, Milton Hershey had spent more than $10 million on building up Hershey, Pennsylvania, but he reduced hours of his employees and stopped paying annual bonuses. In 1937, a strike and occupation at the chocolate factory ended violently when some strikers were severely beaten by a rally loyal to the company.

Hershey established The M.S. Hershey Foundation in 1935 as a small, private charitable foundation to provide educational and cultural opportunities for local residents. The foundation supports the Hershey Story Museum, originally the Hershey American Indian Museum, Hershey Gardens, Hershey Theatre, and Hershey Community Archives.

=== Since the 1960s ===
In 1903, Hershey consisted of around 700 people. By 1920, the population had increased to 1,500 people. By 1960, the population increased to over 7,000 people.

In 1963, The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center was founded as the site of Pennsylvania State University’s College of Medicine. The College enrolled its first students in 1967 and has conferred 2,182 doctor of medicine degrees. The Hershey Motor Lodge (now the Hershey Lodge) was opened in 1967 and is known as &quot;The Great American Meeting Place.&quot;

==Geography==
Hershey is located in southeastern Dauphin County, in the center and eastern parts of Derry Township. It is bordered to the east by Palmdale (also in Derry Township) and by Campbelltown (in South Londonderry Township, Lebanon County). To the west is the borough of Hummelstown. Over half the population of Derry Township lives within the Hershey CDP.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Hershey CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.41%, is water.

==Demographics==
===2020===
As of the 2020 census, there were 13,858 people living there. Hershey was made up of 82.3% White, 5.5% Asian, 2.7% African American, and 1.1% in other categories. 10.7% identify as Hispanic or Latino.

===2010===
As of the 2010 census, there were 14,257 people living there. Hershey was made up of 83.5% White, 6.6% Asian, 6.2% African American, and 3.5% in other categories. 3.4% identify as Hispanic or Latino.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 422, also known as Chocolate Avenue, runs through the center of Hershey, and U.S. Route 322, also known as Governor Road, passes south of the center. The two highways merge at the western end of Hershey at an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 39.

<text>Hummelstown is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,535 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Originally named Fredrickstown, the town was established in 1762. Hummelstown is a Tree City and is located in District 15 of the Pennsylvania State Senate. It is centrally located between Harrisburg and Hershey, making it a common tourist drive-through. It has several businesses and shops designed to capitalize on the tourist travel that passes through town.

==History==
Hummelstown was founded as &quot;Fredrickstown&quot; in 1762 by two Germans, Frederick and Rosina Hummel. They purchased the land for 200 pounds sterling, then divided the area into building lots, which were sold to German settlers. During the mid-19th century, the Union Canal along Swatara Creek was an important factor in the development of the local economy, promoting trade and transportation.

The town was located on the Berks-Dauphin Turnpike, and later it was served by the Union Canal which paralleled Swatara Creek bordering the north and the west sides of the town, and was opened in 1827. The Lebanon Valley Railroad arrived in 1858. This brought about many jobs of stone cutting and shipyard work and helped facilitate the Hummelstown Brownstone Company which became the leading employer of Hummelstown residents. The company mined Hummelstown brownstone at its quarries from 1867 until 1929. The company was the largest producer of brownstone on the East Coast.

Throughout the history of the town it has been a stopping point for tourists traveling to Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, or to Hershey, the home of Hershey Foods, Hersheypark, and Chocolate World. At various times Hummelstown has been as close as from up to ten different professional sports teams, such as the Harrisburg Heat, Hershey Bears, Hershey Wildcats, and the Harrisburg City Islanders. The Calder Cup has had several ceremonies conducted in Hummelstown over the years.

The borough celebrated its semiquincentennial or 250-year anniversary in 2012.

The Dr. William Henderson House, Keystone Hotel, Enoch Matlack House, and Zion Lutheran Church and Graveyard are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hummelstown Historical Society building is located at North Rosanna Street and North Alley Street in the original building for the Zion Lutheran Church, which is now the main brownstone church on Main Street of Hummelstown. The society has a library, museum, and genealogy section, and hosts numerous Native American relics, such as arrowheads, bones, and pottery.

Hummelstown is within a thirty-minute drive of several colleges and educational institutions, such as HACC, Lebanon Valley College, Penn State Harrisburg, YTI Career Institute, Kepler Career Institute, and VoTech. Many residents of Hummelstown have jobs in Derry Township, mainly through Hershey Foods and its subsidiaries.

Hummelstown currently has three historical markers in the town, one for the town&#x27;s oldest church, one for a former Revolutionary War gun factory, and the other for the Hummelstown Brownstone company.

The town is home to a historical landmark, the Warwick Hotel, which is still a tavern reminiscent of its pre-Revolutionary War days. George Washington stayed a night there and drank from its bar.

Indian Echo Caverns, located one-half mile south of the borough limits, is one of the main attractions near Hummelstown. The caverns were originally used by the Susquehannock tribe, who lived and hunted in the nearby area until they vanished in the 1670s; it opened to the public in 1929.

The shortline Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad operates heritage and freight service between its namesake towns of Middletown and just south of Hummelstown proper, stopping in front of the Indian Echo Caverns entrance. The Hummelstown Borough Council has expressed concern around quality of life issues (noise, odor, safety) with having more trains passing through town. As such, trains stop just south of the busy four-lane U.S. Route 322 grade crossing on a regular basis, and are allowed to enter town exactly 12 times per year. Norfolk Southern&#x27;s busy Harrisburg Line traverses the northern section of Hummelstown, with up to 20 lengthy freight trains passing through daily.

<doc id="132367" wikidata="Q1182346" url="?curid=132367" title="Linglestown, Pennsylvania">
<text>Linglestown is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lower Paxton Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded and laid out in 1765 by Thomas Lingle.

The population was 6,539 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1765, Thomas Lingle purchased a parcel of land in what was then Paxton Township, so as to develop a 90-plot living, working, and studying community for newly-arriving European settlers. He called his new settlement &quot;The Town of St. Thomas&quot;, after the Christian apostle, his namesake. The sheepskin document on which Lingle drew the plan for his village still exists, showing in great detail the village&#x27;s name, each of the plots, their plot numbers, and all street and alley names. The county deed recorder&#x27;s seal and record information are visible on the bottom left corner of the document.

In 1811, Lingle died and was buried in the Wenrich&#x27;s Church cemetery (now St. Thomas United Church of Christ), at the east end of the village. Soon thereafter, village and area residents began calling his village &quot;Lingle&#x27;s town&quot;, and the name soon took on its current form.

As a busy crossroads community located at the base of the mountain, the village soon became the area center for commerce, civic, religious, and educational activities, much of which still exists today.

St. Thomas UCC is the village&#x27;s oldest denomination. The Church of God denomination had its world beginning and first structure and cemetery in Linglestown.

===Linglestown Square renovation===
Since 1996, the village has been considering making improvements to the village square. At the center of the square is a flag pole located in the middle of the road. The initial plan was to move the flag pole and insert a traffic light. After long debate, that idea was shot down. It was replaced by the &quot;Linglestown Plan&quot;, proposed on March 31, 2000. Nearly seven years later, on February 20, 2007, Lower Paxton Township approved a modified version of the Linglestown Action Plan, which involves the addition of roundabouts, other approaches to slowing down traffic through the square, and general community improvement. On September 11, 2009, PennDOT awarded a construction bid for the project to E. Wintermyer Co. of Etters.

While the road construction was intended not only to relieve traffic but also promote an aesthetic aspect in order to draw in business for Linglestown merchants, many of those merchants faced the brink of closing. The plan intended to address the issues with congestion and rush hour traffic, as well as safety concerns. In June 2010, the project entered its final phase. The roadways in the roundabouts were opened to two-way traffic, with the remainder of the road closed to two-way traffic until November 2010.

==Geography==
Linglestown is located in northern Lower Paxton Township at (40.336888, -76.790764). It is bordered to the south by the community of Paxtonia, with the border between them formed by Interstate 81 and with access from Exit 72 (Mountain Road).

<text>Lower Paxton is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 53,501 at the 2020 census. It is the most populous municipality in Dauphin County and the 17th-most populated municipality in the state.

Lower Paxton Township is located miles southwest of Allentown, northeast of Harrisburg, and northwest of Philadelphia.

The township was incorporated in 1767 from Paxton Township.

==History==

In 1729, the Paxtang Township was established within Lancaster County. The spelling &quot;Paxtang&quot; is from the original American Indian name &quot;Peshtank&quot;, which meant &quot;standing water&quot;. Today the word &quot;Paxton&quot; is used instead of Paxtang.

On March 4, 1785, the boundaries of Paxtang Township also became the borders of Dauphin County, split from Lancaster County. &quot;Dauphin&quot; refers to the Dauphin of France, heir apparent to the French throne, whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. About two years later in August 1787 the legislature began to splinter Paxtang Township, first into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang, and Lower Paxtang.

In the years after Dauphin County was established, the township was slowly divided. Hanover Township was cut off to the east in 1736, and Upper Paxton Township was cut off to the north in 1767. What remained in 1767 was then renamed Lower Paxton Township. The divisions continued. Harrisburg Borough, now the city of Harrisburg, was formed in 1791, and Swatara Township was created in 1799. In 1878, more land was cut off the north and became Middle Paxton Township.

Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now occupied by Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry, and Susquehanna townships. Lower Paxton has remained the same area since Susquehanna Township was formed from it on May 1, 1815.

==Geography==
Lower Paxton Township is located in south-central Dauphin County, bordered by Susquehanna Township to the west, Middle Paxton Township to the north, West Hanover and South Hanover townships to the east, and Swatara Township to the south. The eastern border of Lower Paxton Township is formed by Beaver Creek, a south-flowing tributary of Swatara Creek, which flows to the Susquehanna River. The northern border of the township follows or is close to the crest of Blue Mountain, the southernmost ridge of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in this region. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 28.1 square miles (72.8 km), all of it land.

There are four unincorporated communities, all of which are census-designated places, in Lower Paxton Township. Linglestown (population 6,334) is in the northeast part of the township, Paxtonia (population 5,412) is in the center, Colonial Park (population 13,229) is in the west and southwest, and a small portion of Progress is in the far west, though it is mainly in Susquehanna Township.

Interstate 83 runs through the western part of the township, terminating at Interstate 81, which crosses the center of the township from west to east. I-83 access in the township is from Exit 50 (U.S. Route 22/Jonestown Road) and Exit 48 (Union Deposit Road), while I-81 access is from Exit 72, between Linglestown and Paxtonia.

==History==
Lower Swatara Township is bordered by the Susquehanna River on the south and Swatara Creek to the east. The township name is derived from a Native American language. The word is thought to be from a Susquehannock word meaning &quot;Where we fed on eels.&quot; The Native Americans established a network of pathways through the area. Presbyterian settlers from Scotland and Ireland were followed by settlers from the German Palatinate. The first settlers erected their log homes along the banks of the Susquehanna and Swatara.

In 1729, Paxtang Township of Lancaster County was established. The spelling &quot;Paxtang&quot; is from the original Native name &quot;Peshtank&quot;, which meant &quot;standing water&quot;.

In August 1787, the legislature separated Paxtang Township into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang and Lower Paxtang townships.

Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now occupied by Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry and Susquehanna townships.

Lower Swatara Township was incorporated from Swatara Township on November 7, 1961, as a first class township.

<doc id="132373" wikidata="Q318673" url="?curid=132373" title="Thomas Gresham">
<text>Sir Thomas Gresham the Elder (; c. 151921 November 1579) was an English merchant and financier who acted on behalf of King Edward VI (1547–1553) and Edward&#x27;s half-sisters, queens Mary I (1553–1558) and Elizabeth I (1558–1603). In 1565 Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in the City of London.

==Origins==
Born in London and descended from an old Norfolk family, Gresham was one of two sons and two daughters of Sir Richard Gresham, a leading merchant mercer and Lord Mayor of London, who was knighted by King Henry VIII for negotiating favourable loans with foreign merchants.

==Education==
Gresham was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School. After that, although his father wanted Thomas to become a merchant, Sir Richard first sent him to university at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was concurrently apprenticed in the Mercers&#x27; Company to his uncle Sir John Gresham, founder of Gresham&#x27;s School, while he was still at Cambridge.

==Agent in the Low Countries==
In 1543 the Mercers&#x27; Company admitted the 24-year-old Gresham as a liveryman, and later that year he left England for the Low Countries, where, either on his own account or that of his father or uncle, he carried on business as a merchant whilst acting in various matters as agent for King Henry VIII. In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of the London merchant Sir William Read, but maintained residence principally in the Low Countries, basing his headquarters at Antwerp in present-day Belgium (then the Spanish Netherlands), where he became renowned for his adept market-play.

==Financial acumen==
===Rescue of the pound===
When in 1551 the mismanagement of Sir William Damsell, King&#x27;s Merchant to the Low Countries, had caused the English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods – highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair – for raising the value of the pound sterling on the Antwerp bourse which proved so successful that in just a few years King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham&#x27;s advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.

===Later services to the Crown===
On the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, Gresham fell out of favour at Court for a short time with Alderman William Dauntsey displacing him. But Dauntsey&#x27;s financial operations proved unsuccessful and Gresham was soon reinstated; and as he professed his zealous desire to serve the Queen, and manifested great adroitness both in negotiating loans and in smuggling money, arms and foreign goods, not only were his services retained throughout her reign (1553–1558), but besides his salary of twenty shillings &quot;per diem&quot; he received grants of church lands to the yearly value of 200 pounds.

Under Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign (1558–1603), besides continuing in his post as financial agent of the Crown, Gresham acted as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Court of Duchess Margaret of Parma, Governor of the Netherlands, and was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1559 prior to his departure. The unsettled times preceding the Dutch revolt compelled him to leave Antwerp on 10 March 1567; but, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued his business as merchant and government financial agent in much the same way as he had always done. 

Queen Elizabeth also found Gresham&#x27;s abilities useful in a variety of other ways, including acting as gaoler to Lady Mary Grey (sister of Lady Jane Grey), who, as a punishment for marrying Thomas Keyes the sergeant-porter, was imprisoned in his house from June 1569 to the end of 1572.

===Founding of the Royal Exchange===
In 1565 Gresham made a proposal to the City of London&#x27;s Court of Aldermen to build, at his own expense, a bourse or exchange – what became the Royal Exchange, modelled on the Antwerp bourse – on condition that the Corporation provided for this purpose a suitable location. In this proposal he seems to have had a good eye for his self-interest as well as for the general good of the City&#x27;s merchants, for by a yearly rental of £700 obtained for the shops in the upper part of the building he received more than sufficient return for his trouble and expense.

The foundation of the Royal Exchange is the background of Thomas Heywood&#x27;s play: &quot;If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody part 2&quot;, in which a Lord extols the quality of the building when asked if he has ever seen &quot;a goodlier frame&quot;:
==Marriage and progeny==
In 1544 he married Anne Ferneley, widow of Sir William Read, a London merchant. By his wife he had an only son who predeceased him. He also had an illegitimate daughter who married Sir Nathaniel Bacon (&quot;c.&quot; 1546–1622), half-brother of Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Albans, becoming &quot;Anne, Lady Bacon&quot;.

==Death and burial==
Gresham died suddenly, apparently of apoplexy, on 21 November 1579 and was buried at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Bishopsgate in the City of London.

==Bequest for the foundation of Gresham College==
Apart from some small sums to various charities, Gresham bequeathed the bulk of his property (consisting of estates in London and around England giving an income of more than £2,300 a year) to his widow and her heirs, with the stipulation that after her death his own house in Bishopsgate Street and the rents from the Royal Exchange should be vested in the Corporation of London and the Mercers Company, for the purpose of instituting a college in which seven professors should read lectures, one each day of the week, in astronomy, geometry, physic, law, divinity, rhetoric and music. Thus, Gresham College, the first institution of higher learning in London, came to be established in 1597.

==Gresham&#x27;s law==
Gresham&#x27;s law (stated simply as: &quot;Bad money drives out good&quot;) takes its name from him (although others, including the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, had recognised the concept for years) because he urged Queen Elizabeth to restore the debased currency of England. However, Sir Thomas never formulated anything like &quot;Gresham&#x27;s law&quot;, which was the 1857 conception of Henry Dunning Macleod, an economist with a knack for reading into a text that which was not written.

==The Gresham grasshopper==
The Gresham family crest is: &quot;On a Mount Vert a Grasshopper Or&quot; (a golden grasshopper on a green mound); it is displayed by Gresham College, which he founded, and also forms the weathervane on the Royal Exchange in the City of London, also founded by him in 1565. The Faneuil Hall at Boston, Massachusetts, has also borrowed this heraldic device. The Gresham coat of arms is blazoned: &quot;Argent, a Chevron Erminés between three Mullets pierced Sable&quot;.

According to ancient legend, the founder of the family, Roger de Gresham, was a foundling abandoned as a new-born baby among long grass in Norfolk during the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. Although a beautiful story, it is more likely that the grasshopper is simply a canting heraldic crest playing on the sound &quot;grassh-&quot; and &quot;Gresh-&quot;. The Gresham family uses as its motto &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot; (&#x27;Thy will be done&#x27;).

==Legacy==
*Gresham&#x27;s law;
*The Royal Exchange, which he founded in 1565, was opened in 1571;
*Gresham College, funded by the bequest of his Will of 1571, was opened in 1597;
*Gresham Street in the City of London running east from St Martin&#x27;s Le Grand near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, past the Guildhall and the Bank of England is named in his memory;
*The Gresham Palace in Budapest is named after him;
*The Gresham Club in the City was also named in his honour;
*The Gresham Hotel, Dublin is indirectly named after Gresham. It was established in 1817 by another Thomas Gresham, who was given that name as he was a foundling abandoned on the steps of the Royal Exchange;
*Gresham Road, nearby Gresham&#x27;s mansion at Hounslow: Osterley Park.

==In fiction==
*Gresham appears as a background figure in a series of fictional mystery novels by the British author Valerie Anand writing under the pen-name of Fiona Buckley. The fictional heroine of the stories, Ursula Blanchard, lived in Antwerp with her first husband while he worked as one of Gresham&#x27;s agents.
*Gresham also features as the central character of Herbert Strang&#x27;s book &quot;On London River: A Story of the Days of Queen Elizabeth&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1936).

<text>Middle Paxton Township is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,046 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1729 Paxtang Township of Lancaster County was established. The spelling &quot;Paxtang&quot; is from the original Indian name &quot;Peshtank&quot;, which meant &quot;standing water&quot;. Today the word &quot;Paxton&quot; is used instead of Paxtang.

On March 4, 1785, Lancaster County was split to form Dauphin County, named for the Dauphin of France, heir apparent to the French throne, whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. About two years later in August 1787 the legislature began to splinter Paxtang Township, first into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang and Lower Paxtang.

The John Ayres House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

<text>Middletown is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, on the Susquehanna River, southeast of Harrisburg. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 9,550. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===18th century===
Middletown was founded in 1755 along the left bank of the Susquehanna River and was incorporated as a borough in 1828 after a sudden boom in development and population occurred as a result of the construction of the Union Canal, connecting Lancaster to Middletown. In 1824, Pennsylvania&#x27;s statelegislature authorized and funded the canal construction as part of the broad sweeping commercial initiative called the Main Line of Public Works; a forward looking project designing to connect Philadelphia to Pittsburgh by canals and river navigations and Philadelphia to challenge New York City and the Erie Canal for emerging mid-western markets beyond the Allegheny Mountains.

Middletown was selected as the western terminus of the Union Canal, and it was named from its location halfway between Lancaster and Carlisle, where an ascent exists to a low pass allowing easier wagon-era travel among the barrier mountains of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians giving access into north-central Maryland and the valley of the Potomac River. It is the oldest incorporated community in Dauphin County and is located within a rich agricultural area forming the western edge of Pennsylvania Dutch Country.

===19th century===
The George Everhart (Frey) Trust, named for a citizen of Middletown from the 1800s, still manages leases on much of the land in and around Middletown. The trust was founded to operate the Frey Orphanage and did so for many years, in three locations in Middletown. The orphanage eventually closed, and the final location, on Red Hill, has become the , a Diakon Lutheran senior living facility.

===20th century===

Middletown is located 3 miles (5 km) north of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant. The Unit #2 reactor at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant suffered a partial meltdown in 1979, causing then Pennsylvania governor Dick Thornburgh to order the evacuation of pregnant women and pre-school children from the area. Within days, 140,000 people had left the area. President Jimmy Carter visited Middletown&#x27;s Community Building to calm the nerves of anxious residents.

Because the town is old, diverse historic architectural styles abound. Middletown has everything from log houses, some whose construction is obscured by modern siding, to Victorian mansions, and beyond. The Simon Cameron House and Bank, B&#x27;nai Jacob Synagogue, St. Peter&#x27;s Kierch, Charles and Joseph Raymond Houses, Henry Smith Farm, and Swatara Ferry House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Millersburg is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,541 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Harrisburg metropolitan area.

==Geography==
Millersburg is located in northwestern Dauphin County on the east bank of the Susquehanna River at (40.541676, -76.957283). Wiconisco Creek enters the Susquehanna at the southern edge of the borough. According to the United States Census Bureau, Millersburg has a total area of , all land.

Millersburg is the southwestern terminus of U.S. Route 209, which leads northeast to Pottsville and to its northeastern terminus north of Kingston, New York. Pennsylvania Route 147 passes through the center of Millersburg as Market Street, leading north (upriver) to Sunbury and south (downriver) to U.S. Route 22 near Duncannon. The Millersburg Ferry leads west across the Susquehanna to Buffalo Township in Perry County, allowing a connection to U.S. Routes 11 and 15.

==History==
Millersburg was formed in 1807 from a portion of Upper Paxton Township. Its founder was Daniel Miller, for whom the community was named.

The Millersburg Ferry and Millersburg Passenger Rail Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the spring of 1790, Daniel Miller and his brother, John were traveling north along the Susquehanna River. When they arrived at the north side of Berry&#x27;s Mountain, tradition has it, Daniel was so taken with the beauty of the area where the Wiconisco Creek joined with the Susquehanna that he resolved to purchase the land at that location. On June 2, 1790, Miller received a deed for 979-1/4 acres at the mouth of the Wiconisco Creek from William Von Phul of Philadelphia, the owner of the land upon which Millersburg is now situated.

In 1794, Miller built his first cabin that later served as a school in which he taught the children of the surrounding area without compensation. The building was on the site of the old Johnson-Baillie Shoe Company factory on Pine near Market Street. It was not until 1805, upon completion of a more suitable dwelling which still stands on the northeast corner of Pine and Walnut streets that Miller brought his wife, Elizabeth, and their two children to their new home. In 1807, Miller&#x27;s dream of a town on the banks of the Susquehanna became a reality. During that year, he had the land surveyed and laid out into lots, reserving land for churches, the town square and a riverside park. Until a church could be built, Miller, who was a lay minister of the Methodist Church, held services in his own home.

Transportation in Millersburg has always been a very important commodity to the community. Two major transportation projects were planned for Millersburg in the 19th century: one was the Lykens Valley R.R. &amp; Coal Company, and the other was the extension of the Pennsylvania Canal, both proposed in the 1830s. The state began construction of the Wiconisco Canal as part of the Eastern Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in 1837. Millersburg was the northern terminus of the Dauphin County Canal network.

== Millersburg ferry ==

The Millersburg Ferry, the last surviving ferry which crosses the Susquehanna River, and the last wooden-stern paddle-wheel ferry operating within the United States, operates out of Millersburg, which sits on the east side of the river. According to a sign posted at the ferry dock, a ferry has operated here since 1825. The original ferries were poled across the river. Paddle-wheel boats went into operation in 1873. The current ferries are wooden-stern paddle-wheelers which can carry up to four automobiles. The one-mile crossing goes to a point on the west side of the Susquehanna, in a campground near the point where Pennsylvania Route 34 meets U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 15, and near Liverpool. The ferry boats were officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The river at this location is very wide (approximately 1 mile) but is typically very shallow, sometimes only deep. The ferry follows a course across the river near a submerged man-made wall composed of river rocks and debris which provides slightly deeper clearance and prevents the ferry from grounding out.
== Ned Smith Center for Nature and Art==

<text>Paxtang is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 1,640. The borough is a suburb of Harrisburg and is one of the earliest colonial settlements in South Central Pennsylvania.

==History==
Paxtang dates to the 18th century when Euro-Americans settled at the site of the Shawnee-Lenape village of Peshtank. The Lenape called the village &quot;Peshtank&quot; meaning &quot;where the waters stand&quot; which in English became Paxtang or Paxton. Several important trails and routes developed in the area as the Susquehanna River was easily forded here, making Paxtang an ideal location for the movement of people and trade goods across the river.

In 1700, William Penn, founder of the Pennsylvania Colony, obtained from the Susquehannock a deed for their lands in the Susquehanna Valley. This was confirmed by treaty in 1701. In October 1714, French fur trader Peter Bisaillon was granted 250 acres of land &quot;at Peshtang or any other Indian Town or Place on Sasquehannah within this Province,&quot; with permission to build any necessary buildings &quot;during his Trade there or till further.&quot;

Paxtang is the site where Presbyterian Scotch-Irish frontiersmen organized the Paxton Boys, a vigilante group that murdered twenty Susquehannock in the Conestoga Massacre. On December 14, 1763, more than 50 Paxton Boys rode to the settlement near Millersville, Pennsylvania, murdered six, and burned their cabins. Pennsylvania authorities placed the remaining fourteen Susquehannock in protective custody in Lancaster, but the Paxton Boys broke in and slaughtered all fourteen on December 27, 1763. A month earlier, 140 Moravian Lenape and Mohican living peacefully in eastern Pennsylvania had been moved to Philadelphia for their protection. The Paxton Boys marched on Philadelphia in February 1764 with a few hundred followers, however, dispersed after meeting with a delegation headed by Benjamin Franklin.

===Old Paxton Church===
Paxtang is home to the Old Paxton Church, one of the earliest in the area. Built in 1740, the church is the oldest Presbyterian Church building in continuous use in Pennsylvania, and the second oldest in the United States. In 1726, the Rev. James Anderson of Donegal, Pennsylvania, became the first regular preacher. The history of the church is interwoven with the history of central colonial Pennsylvania.

In 1732, the congregation was officially organized as a Presbyterian Church by the Presbytery of Donegal, with the Rev. William Bertram as the first installed pastor. The Rev. John Elder, the &quot;Fighting Parson,&quot; became pastor in 1738. He was pastor during the French and Indian War and Revolutionary War, and served as a commissioned officer. Many of the church&#x27;s pastors have served long pastorates; the terms of four of its ministers total 140 years.

The present stone sanctuary was erected in 1740, replacing a log meeting house which had previously served as the place of worship. A stone marker south of the sanctuary indicates the site of the log building. A replica of the log meeting house was erected north of the present sanctuary.

Adjacent to the church is a historic cemetery. Here lie the bodies of soldiers of the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and both World Wars. People who molded the early religious and political character of America are buried here, including John Harris Jr., William Maclay (the first United States senator from Pennsylvania), and four of the six commissioners who planned the town of Harrisburg with him in 1785. Ministers, legislators, farmers, teachers, men of affairs, and enslaved African Americans are buried here.

<text>South Hanover Township is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,200 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 6,248 tabulated in 2010.

==History==
South Hanover Township was originally a part of Paxtang Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. On March 4, 1785, Dauphin County was formed from Lancaster County, with borders roughly matching those of Paxtang Township. By about 1787 Paxtang was separated into Upper, Middle and Lower Paxtang Townships. Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now known as Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry and Susquehanna townships.

By action of the court of Lancaster in 1785, East Hanover and West Hanover townships separated from Derry Township.

On March 4, 1842, East and West Hanover townships of Dauphin County were finally designated as separate governmental precincts, and South Hanover separated from West Hanover. Hence, South Hanover was established in 1842 as .

In 1845, the village of Union Deposit was laid out. It had two dry goods stores, two shoe stores, one millinery, a tailor shop, a hotel, an iron ore furnace, a flour mill, a wagon factory, a warehouse, a brick yard, and two resident physicians. The early business activity was stimulated by the Union Canal, whose virgin barge trip occurred in 1828. The principal settlement in South Hanover Township from 1750 to 1791. The town was only a fort with six outposts. At one outpost (Milton Hershey Farm Unit 15) was a triangular tower used as a lookout. At the time of the fort, there were only two roads. In 1845, Phillip Wolfsberger and Issac Hershey laid out the land and called it the village of Union Deposit. The name came about due to the area&#x27;s use as a place to deposit goods meant to be transported on the Union Canal. Much of Union Deposit&#x27;s early commercial success as a principal settlement in South Hanover Township stems from the past relationship the area had with a canal along the Swatara Creek. The canal was an important component of the community and was instrumental in its growth.

Hoernerstown became a crossroads village from land originally owned by Major John Hoerner. It was named after the Major&#x27;s father Andrew who emigrated from Prussia in 1755. &quot;A History of Hoernerstown&quot; by Edith Wert is eighteen pages of Enlightenment. Hoerner acquired a land grant, which was later divided into farms with a small portion left for the village. The southwestern and northern sections of South Hanover Township still remain primarily agricultural.

Sand Beach, the cluster of homes in the extreme eastern part of the township, lies at the point where Manada Creek flows into Swatara Creek and was originally called &quot;Manadaville&quot;. The town is known for the covered bridge built in 1906 that crossed Swatara Creek between Derry Township and South Hanover Township. The bridge, restored by Hershey Enterprises in 1964, burned the night of September 3, 1966. Business and industry in this little town included a sawmill, grist mill, cabinet shop, store and schoolhouse.

The original Hanover Township was organized at a session of the Lancaster County Court in 1736–1737. In 1785 it was divided into two separate and distinct townships, named East Hanover and West Hanover. These two townships were divided by Raison Creek until 1813, when Lebanon County was split away from Dauphin County. This split placed East Hanover Township in Lebanon County and West Hanover Township in Dauphin County. On March 4, 1842, the original West Hanover Township was split into East and South Hanover townships.

<text>Steelton is a borough in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States, southeast of Harrisburg. The population was 6,263 at the 2020 census. The borough is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

After initial habitation by Susquehannock Indians and subsequent nearby Harrisburg establishment, the area was owned by the Kelker family of Harrisburg by the 1800s. The 100-acre area was chosen in 1866 by Samuel Morse Felton Sr., president of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, to begin construction of a steel mill. This particular site was favored because of the location&#x27;s proximity to the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Pennsylvania Canal, and the nearby iron mine in Cornwall, Lebanon County. The land was purchased from owners Henry A. and Rudolph F. Kelker; then, steel pioneer Alexander Lyman Holley was chosen to build the mill along the Susquehanna River, which was completed by 1867 (along with a mansion for Felton), and began operation on May 15, 1868. Originally named &quot;Baldwin&quot; after Matthias W. Baldwin, founder of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, by 1871 it had changed to &quot;Steel Works&quot; after the existence of another Baldwin, Pennsylvania Post Office, and finally &quot;Steelton&quot; in 1879 after confusion of the Post Office with the steel mill itself. It was incorporated as a borough on January 19, 1880. The extensive steel works of the Pennsylvania Steel Company later became operated by Bethlehem Steel, ArcelorMittal, and currently Cleveland-Cliffs. Also present at one time were brickyards, a flouring mill, and machine shops.

19 people were killed and 199 injured, when a Baseball Special train from Harrisburg to Philadelphia derailed at Steelton on July 28, 1962. Three of the nine cars landed in the Susquehanna River. A passing U.S. Navy drill team participated in the rescue efforts.

<text>Susquehanna Township is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 26,736 at the time of the 2020 census. This represents a 11.2% increase from the 2010 census count of 24,036. Susquehanna Township has the postal ZIP codes 17109 and 17110, which maintain the Harrisburg place name designation. The township is a suburb of Harrisburg and is connected to Marysville by the Rockville Bridge, the world&#x27;s longest stone-arch rail bridge at the time of its completion.

==History==
Susquehanna Township is located adjacent to the city of Harrisburg in Dauphin County. It was named from the Susquehanna River which runs along its western edge.

On June 4, 1785, the state legislature created Dauphin County from part of Lancaster County. By that time, the territory of today&#x27;s Dauphin County had been divided among the townships of Derry, Londonderry, Lower Paxtang and Upper Paxtang. The spelling &quot;Paxtang&quot; is from the original Indian name &quot;Peshtank&quot;, which meant &quot;standing water&quot; and further morphed into &quot;Paxton.&quot; Susquehanna Township was incorporated from part of Lower Paxtang on May 1, 1815.

The first settlement where Susquehanna Township now lies was known as &quot;Coxestown&quot; and was laid out by Dr. John Cox Jr. of Philadelphia on October 2, 1757. In honor of his wife, Ester, the town was renamed &quot;Estherton&quot; and was the second oldest town in Dauphin County (behind Middletown). In 1774, a second settlement, &quot;Rockville&quot;, and a third in 1815, &quot;Progress&quot; were settled. On January 2, 1952, Susquehanna became a First Class township via the Dauphin County Court.

Up until the 1950s, the Pennsylvania State Police serviced the township, with a township room space in Progress once dedicated to them to use as a substation as a gesture of thanks. In September 1955, Charles S. Hill was sworn in as the first police officer, and he used his own car for patrol duty. With continuing growth, he would become the first chief and by the early 1960s there would be four officers.

The Rockville Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

<text>Swatara Township is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. The population was 27,824 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1729, the Paxtang Township of Lancaster County was established. The spelling &quot;Paxtang&quot; is from the original Indian name &quot;Peshtank&quot;, which meant &quot;standing water&quot;.

On March 4, 1785, Dauphin County was formed from Lancaster County, with the word &quot;Dauphin&quot; referring to the Dauphin of France, the heir apparent to the French throne whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. In August 1787 the legislature separated Paxtang Township into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang, and Lower Paxtang townships.

Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now known as Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry, and Susquehanna townships.

In 1799, a court order divided Lower Paxton Township into two equal parts. &quot;Swatara&quot; was the name chosen for the southern part of the area. The word is thought to be from a Susquehannock word meaning &quot;Where we fed on eels.&quot; Swatara Township was named directly from Swatara Creek.

Within Swatara Township, Calver Island in the Susquehanna River was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

The Seven Stars Inn, located at Concord Road&#x27;s &quot;Five Points&quot; intersection, served as overnight quarters for British General Cornwallis on September 13, 1777, two days after the Battle of the Brandywine, as British forces slowly pursued George Washington&#x27;s army.

The following day, three Hessian soldiers were convicted of plundering a local house. Two, selected by lot, were hanged by the third soldier, and the two corpses were left hanging. David Glasgow Farragut frequented the tavern as a young student in 1817. The Delaware County Odd Fellows were organized there in 1831 and during the 1920s, the tavern became a speakeasy. The building was destroyed in 1949 and replaced by a gas station.

A new veterans&#x27; memorial, dedicated to all veterans who lived in the township (and present-day Chester Heights prior to 1948) from the American Revolution to the present-day Operation Iraqi Freedom, along with Aston Township EMTs, police, and firefighters killed in the line of duty, has been built at the same intersection, opposite the former inn site. An unveiling ceremony occurred on November 11, 2006, with the formal dedication ceremony on April 28, 2007. Endless Pools, a major manufacturer of electric swimming machines, is headquartered and manufactures in Aston Township.

Bethel Township was the smallest of all the original townships of Chester County. The township is mentioned as early as 1683, and means &quot;House of God&quot;. In 1683, Edward Beazer and Edward Brown had 500 acres surveyed to them in the northeasterly end of the township. On this tract, Bethel hamlet, afterwards known as Corner Catch (Ketch), is the location of the current village of Chelsea. In 1686, the road now known as Bethel Road was laid out from Bethel to Chichester (Marcus Hook).

==History==
Brookhaven, Pennsylvania was originally part of a land grant given to William Penn in 1681 by King Charles II of England. The Proprietor negotiated with the Lenni-Lenape Indians, who were the original occupants of the land, the land was then divided into municipal districts. The area of Brookhaven was included in the Municipal District of Chester Township. 317 acres (1.3 km) were surveyed to Thomas Coebourn who settled in 1682 along with Richard Few who was granted 227 acres (0.9 km). Thomas Brassey was granted 385 acres (1.6 km) in 1684. These original grants were parceled eventually into smaller pieces of land and sold to subsequent settlers, such as Trimble, Edwards, Lister and Shepherd, among others. Many of these original settlers have streets named after them in the borough. The elementary school is named Coebourn Elementary (on Coebourn Blvd) after Thomas Coebourn and there are streets named Trimble, Edwards, Lister and Shepherd.

For approximately two hundred and fifty years, the region was dependent upon a farming and dairy economy as well as two thriving mill businesses spanning both Chester Creek and Ridley Creek. Bisected by the 1687 Edgmont Great Road, Brookhaven developed into a town of small crossroads, at Sneath&#x27;s Corners in the mid-19th century. The road from Hinkson&#x27;s Corners (now Brookhaven Road), was established sometime before 1816 as a service road to the mills on Ridley and to Chester Creeks in 1847. These byways became major highways and at the crossroads of these two highways grew a cluster of services, professional offices and summer homes. In 1872, the name &quot;Brookhaven&quot; became most widely used after it was published in the letterhead of the Beatty Brothers General Store at Sneath&#x27;s (later Beatty&#x27;s) Corners.

The Brookhaven community attracted numerous doctors and lawyers, and at the start of the 20th century, was a popular locale for Sunday outings amongst residents of the river tier communities.

Brookhaven&#x27;s mills were perhaps its most notable commercial activity. Thomas Coebourn established the second gristmill in the new Pennsylvania colony, successfully challenging William Penn&#x27;s monopoly vested in the Caleb Pusey Mill (the Caleb Pusey house is still standing) downstream on Chester Creek. After a 1687 court battle went in Coebourne&#x27;s favor and granted individuals the right to establish mills, the area&#x27;s creeks powered a multitude of industries. The original Coebourne Log Mill was replaced in 1750 by a stone structure which was sold to Jonathan Dutton (Dutton Mill Road is a major road in the area) in 1792. A redrawing of Chester Township&#x27;s borders in 1829 placed this site in present Middletown Township, with only the mill race and the owner&#x27;s mansion in Brookhaven. The Johnson Ax Factory, the Lower Bank (Todmorden-Sackville) Hair Cloth Mills, Bickley&#x27;s Gristmill and the Crozer Cloth Mill all utilized the notable drop for streams from the inland plateau to power their machinery. Both the 1826 and the post-flood 1844 mill surveys show large outputs for these factories.

In the latter part of the 19th century, several large stock farms were thriving; by the 1900s most of these were consolidated under the ownership of John Price Crozer (the namesake of Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland) who bred racehorses and prize bulls. After Crozer&#x27;s death and World War II, these farms were sold off to developers.

In 1902, the New Chester Water Company built a filtration and storage facility which then serviced the entire city and Chester Township. This plant, on Harrison&#x27;s Hill, is still in active use. The Delaware Valley&#x27;s rapid industrial expansion and the resulting baby boom of World War II, brought increasing pressure for suburban housing.

At the time of Brookhaven Borough&#x27;s incorporation on April 4, 1945, the Borough had 672 persons and 150 homes. The trolley line which had run from Chester, Pennsylvania to Media via Edgmont Avenue stopped in 1938. The trolley tracks were removed in 1945 and the road was realigned and widened as most of the area&#x27;s transportation had become automotive. In the last fifty years, Brookhaven has evolved very dramatically from a dairy and stock farm economy to a residential community of over 8,000 people living in over 3,600 homes, apartments and condominiums and supporting approximately 150 businesses.

==Retail==
Cambridge Shopping Center, opened in 1972, is a Brookhaven landmark. It is currently anchored by Lowe&#x27;s and was anchored by one of the first Giant stores in the Philadelphia area (now closed).

A famous haunt of Brookhaven is Tom Jones Restaurant, which was sued by Tom Jones for taking his name. The lawsuit was later dropped, and Tom Jones is still there to this day, but is under new ownership and is no longer open 24 hours.

==Transportation==

As of 2008, there were of public roads in Brookhaven, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Pennsylvania Route 352 is the only numbered highway serving Brookhaven. It follows Edgmont Avenue along a southeast-to-northwest alignment though the central portion of the borough.

Brookhaven is approximately 15 minutes away from South Philadelphia and 20 minutes from Wilmington, Delaware.

==Education==
Brookhaven is a part of the Penn-Delco School District,
It is also home to Coebourn Elementary School.

Our Lady of Charity School of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia was in Brookhaven. It closed in 2011 due to a decrease in the number of students. During the 2010-2011 school year, it had 176 students, along with 89 prospective students for the 2011-2012 school year who did not arrive. The &quot;Delco Times&quot; stated that had the school remained open, it would have had to reduce enrichment services. At least one grade level would have had an enrollment under five. The average class size would have been nine.

== Athletics ==
Brookhaven is home to Brookhaven Babe Ruth Baseball, a youth baseball league that operates out of Scott Park.
Brookhaven also has a youth Basketball league that operates out of the Brookhaven Municipal Center.

Incorporated in 1682, Chester is the oldest city in Pennsylvania and was the location of William Penn&#x27;s first arrival in the Province of Pennsylvania. It was the county seat for Chester County from 1682 to 1788 and of Delaware County from 1789 to 1851.

From the second half of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, the city was a major center of heavy industry, manufacturing and shipping. The city became a boomtown during World War I and World War II. The availability of employment in factories, dock work, and shipbuilding attracted immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe and African-American migrants from southern states. Since the mid-20th century, it has lost most of its manufacturing base and has struggled as a post-industrial city dealing with crime, pollution, and poverty. Pennsylvania declared Chester a financially distressed municipality in 1995 and a fiscal emergency in 2020. In 2022, Chester became the 31st city in the United States to declare bankruptcy.

The city is home to Widener University, Harrah&#x27;s Philadelphia, the Chester Waterside Station, the William Penn Landing Site, and Subaru Park, home of the Major League Soccer team, the Philadelphia Union.

== History ==
===Early history===

The indigenous tribe that owned the land where Chester now stands were the Okehockings, removed by order of William Penn in 1702 to other lands in Chester County. The original indigenous name of Chester was Mecoponaca, which means &quot;the stream along which large potatoes grow&quot;.

The first European settlers in the area were members of the New Sweden colony. The settlement that became Chester was first called &quot;Finlandia&quot; (the Latin name for Finland) and then &quot;Upland&quot; after the Swedish province of Uppland. The New Sweden settlers built Fort Mecoponacka in 1641 to defend the settlement.

In 1644, the present site of Chester was a tobacco plantation operated by the New Sweden colonists.

By 1682, Upland was the most populous town of the new Province of Pennsylvania. On October 27, the ship &quot;Welcome&quot; arrived bearing William Penn on his first visit to the province. Penn renamed the settlement after the English city of Chester.

===18th century===


Chester County originally stretched from the Delaware River to the Susquehanna River from its founding in 1682 until 1729 when Lancaster County was formed from the western part. Chester served as the county seat for Chester County from 1682 to 1788. In 1724, the Chester Courthouse was built to support the legal needs of the county.

Chester played only a small role in the American Revolutionary War. Throughout 1776 and 1777, there were significant forces stationed in Chester and nearby Marcus Hook.

In April 1776, nearly 1,000 men were stationed in Chester under Colonel Samuel Miles in preparation for the defense of Philadelphia. However, Colonel Miles led the troops to New York City in July 1776 when it became clear that the British Fleet was threatening New York rather than Philadelphia.

In 1777, the Continental Army led by George Washington passed through Chester on the way to meet the British Army led by General Howe at the Battle of Brandywine. John Armstrong was ordered to take command of the militia stationed at Chester. The Continental Army fled back to Chester after defeat at the Battle of Brandywine. A portion of the British force occupied Chester as they chased the Continental Army fleeing to Philadelphia.

In 1788, the Chester County seat was moved from Chester to West Chester.
In 1789, Delaware County was formed from the eastern part of Chester County, and Chester became the new county seat.

The borough of Chester was governed under the charter granted by Penn in 1701 until March 5, 1795, when it was incorporated by the Pennsylvania Assembly.

===19th century===
In the 1700s and 1800s, Chester was a hub for business due to easy access to the Delaware River for the transport of raw materials and finished goods by ship. By the mid-1800s, many textile mills and factories were built along Chester Creek including the Upland Mills by John Price Crozer and the Powhattan Mills by David Reese Esrey and Hugh Shaw.

During the War of 1812, a group of volunteers from Chester called the Mifflin Guards was raised and led by Samuel Anderson. The troops were sent to Fort DuPont to defend the Delaware River from the threatened attack of British Admiral George Cockburn but did not see any action.

In 1851, the Delaware County seat was moved from Chester to the borough of Media. On February 14, 1866, Chester was incorporated as a city and the first mayor elected was John Larkin, Jr.

In 1871, the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works was opened by John Roach through the purchase of the Reaney, Son &amp; Archbold shipyard. The first steel ships of the U.S. Navy were built at the Roach shipyard. For the first 15 years of operation, it was the largest and most productive shipyard in the United States. More tonnage of ships were built at the Roach shipyard than its next two competitors combined.

Roach built other businesses to supply materials for his shipbuilding including the Chester Rolling Mill in 1873 to supply metal hull plates and beams, the Chester Pipe and Tube Company in 1877 for the manufacture of iron pipes and boiler tubes, and the Standard Steel Casting Company in 1883 to supply steel ingots.

Roach built the Combination Steel and Iron Company in 1880 to supply steel rails and other products for businesses beyond the Roach shipyard. He lost control of the company after his shipbuilding enterprise entered receivership in 1885.

===20th century===


Chester was known as a freewheeling destination for vices such as drugs, alcohol, numbers rackets, gambling and prostitution. Chester was widely known as Greater Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Saloon Town&quot;. By 1914, Chester had more saloons than police officers; approximately 1 saloon per every 987 residents.

During and following World War I, Chester grew significantly as people migrated to the city for jobs, 63% of which were in manufacturing. Between 1910 and 1920, Chester&#x27;s population increased from 38,000 to 58,000 due to the influx of poor Southern European and Eastern European immigrants and African-American migrants from the South, searching for employment in the city&#x27;s expanding shipbuilding and manufacturing industries. The Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. was opened in 1917 to build ships for the United States until its closure in 1990. The idled Roach shipyard was purchased in 1917 by W. Averell Harriman to build merchant ships during World War I, and renamed the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation. The shipyard closed permanently in 1923.

Like many boomtowns, Chester was unprepared for the social changes that came along with rapid growth. As southern blacks migrated to Pennsylvania as part of the Great Migration, racial violence broke out, racially segregated neighborhoods expanded and economic discrimination emerged. A four-day race riot that resulted in seven deaths broke out in the city in July 1917, and the separation of blacks and whites in Chester&#x27;s neighborhoods and workplaces became more defined.

In 1927, the Ford Motor Company opened the Chester Assembly factory on the site of the previous Roach and Merchant shipyard and built cars there until its closure in 1961.

Chester experienced its second growth period during World War II. Manufacturing increased exponentially including companies such as Wetherill Steel and Boilermakers, Congoleum-Nairn, Aberfoyles Textiles, Scott Paper Company, Belmont Iron Works, American Steel Foundries, Crew Levick Oil, Crown Smelting, Fields Brick Company, Hetzel and Ford Motor Company. During World War II, the Sun Shipyard became the largest single shipyard in the world.
 The increased labor needs brought a flood of new workers to the city. The wartime labor force for industries along the waterfront soared to 100,000.

Chester began losing its mainstay manufacturing jobs by the early 1960s. Ford Motor Company shuttered its Chester plant, American Viscose Corporation in nearby Marcus Hook closed, Baldwin Locomotive Works in nearby Eddystone was close to bankruptcy and Sun Shipyard employment had fallen from a high of 35,000 in 1945 to 4,000 in 1962. Chester&#x27;s precipitous drop in jobs in the late 20th and early 21st centuries caused the city&#x27;s population to diminish from over 66,000 in 1950 to under 34,000 in 2010.

In 1963 and 1964, the Chester school protests fought to end the de facto segregation that resulted in the racial categorization of Chester public schools, even after the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. The racial unrest and civil rights protests were led by George Raymond of the NAACP and Stanley Branche of CFFN and made Chester one of the key battlegrounds of the civil rights movement.

In April 1964, a series of almost nightly protests brought chaos to Chester. Mayor James Gorbey issued &quot;The Police Position to Preserve the Public Peace&quot;, a 10-point statement promising an immediate return to law and order. The city deputized firemen and trash collectors to help handle demonstrators. The State of Pennsylvania deployed 50 state troopers to assist the 77-member Chester police force. The demonstrations were marked by violence and police brutality with Chester being dubbed the &quot;Birmingham of the North&quot; by civil rights activist James Farmer. Over 600 people were arrested over a two-month period of civil rights rallies, marches, pickets, boycotts, and sit-ins. National civil rights leaders such as Gloria Richardson, Malcolm X and Dick Gregory came to Chester in support of the demonstrations. Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton became involved in the negotiations and convinced the protestors to obey a court-ordered moratorium on demonstrations by agreeing to hold hearings on the de facto segregation of public schools in Chester.

The Pennsylvania Human Relations Committee determined that the Chester School Board had violated the law and the Chester School District was ordered to desegregate the city&#x27;s six predominantly African-American schools. The city appealed the ruling, which delayed implementation, but the schools were eventually desegregated.

In 1978, an intense fire broke out at Wade Dump, a rubber recycling facility and illegal industrial chemical dumping site. It burned out of control for several days. The burning chemicals caused multi-colored smoke and noxious fumes which injured 43 firemen and caused long-term health problems for the first responders to the fire. In 1981, the location was declared a Superfund cleanup site and remediation occurred throughout the 1980s. In 1989, the site was deemed safe and removed from the Superfund national priorities list. In 2004, the site was converted to a parking lot for Commodore Barry Bridge Park.

By the 1980s, Chester was a city bereft of industry. Many bottom-rung projects were initiated in Chester, including the Westinghouse trash incinerator, a sewage treatment plant, and a prison. Chester residents and politicians began pushing back against the placement of projects that increased concerns about pollution, noise, and trucks, such as a contaminated soil remediation facility, the trash incinerator, the DELCORA sewage waste treatment center and the Abbonizio recycling center.

In 1995, the state designated Chester as a financially distressed municipality.

===21st century===
Recent programs to foster investment into Chester include the Pennsylvania Keystone Opportunity Zone (KOZ) program, which incentivizes companies with state and local tax breaks to invest in KOZ-designated areas. The Wharf at Rivertown, a $60 million renovation of the Chester Waterside Station of the Philadelphia Electric Company, originally built in 1918, provides recreational and office space for businesses.

Harrah&#x27;s Casino and Racetrack began harness racing in September 2006 and opened its racino in January 2007. Subaru Park, home of the Major League Soccer Philadelphia Union franchise, opened in 2010.

Despite the recent investments into the community, Governor Tom Wolf declared a fiscal emergency for Chester in 2020 and the city declared bankruptcy in 2022. It was the 31st municipality to declare bankruptcy since the U.S. Congress offered the program in the 1930s.

National Register of Historic Places in Chester are: Delaware County National Bank, 1724 Chester Courthouse, Chester Waterside Station of the Philadelphia Electric Company, Old Main and Chemistry Building, Third Presbyterian Church, William Penn Landing Site, and the former Second Street Bridge.

==Geography==

Chester borders on (clockwise from southwest to northeast) Trainer Borough, Upper Chichester Township, Chester Township, Upland Borough, Parkside Borough, Brookhaven Borough, Nether Providence Township, Ridley Township, and Eddystone Borough in Pennsylvania. Chester is bordered to the south by the Delaware River. The city has a total area of , of which is land and of which (19.42%) is water, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Chester Creek meets the Delaware River in Chester. Chester&#x27;s northeastern border is at Ridley Creek. The Port of Chester is located in Chester along the Delaware River.

===Climate===
Located at a low elevation between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, Chester experiences a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;.) The hardiness zone is 7b. 

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
===2010 census===
As of Census 2010, the racial makeup of the city was 74.7% African American, 17.2% White, 9.0% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 0.6% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. 

There were 11,662 households, out of which 37.3% had children under the age of 18, 19.5% were headed by married couples living together, 35.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.1% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.1% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64, and the average family size was 3.34.

==Government==

Chester has a mayor-council government system, consisting of a popularly elected city mayor and city council. The terms of the mayor and members are four years.

The current mayor of the City of Chester is Stefan Roots, who won the Democratic nomination in May 2021, over incumbent Mayor Thaddeus Kirkland. In May 2023, Roots defeated Kirkland in the Chester Democratic mayoral primary election. Roots defeated independent candidate Anita J. Littleton in the November 2023 general election and was sworn into office on January 3, 2024.

The Chester City Council consists of the mayor and four council members. Council members are elected at-large to serve the entire city. Council meetings are generally held the second and fourth Wednesday of each month. The five help administer the five municipal departments:
* The Department of Public Affairs
* The Department of Public Safety
* The Department of Public Works
* The Parks and Recreation Department
* The Finance and Tax Office

The city government has been in financial distress for many years and has operated under the state&#x27;s Act 47 provisions for twenty-one years. The act provides for municipalities that are near bankruptcy.

===Political corruption===
Chester has been hurt for decades by corrupt politicians and organized crime. Chester&#x27;s Republican Party political machine was one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most corrupt. John J. McClure took over from his father, William McClure, in 1907 and was the political boss for the machine until his death in 1965. In 1933, McClure was found guilty in federal court and sentenced to 18 months in prison for vice and rum-running, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.

In 1941, McClure was indicted for conspiracy to gain a $250,000 profit from the sale of the Chester Water Works to a private buyer. McClure and four Chester City Council members were acquitted but also ordered by the court to return the money to the city of Chester.

With the exception of 1904–1905, the Republican political machine controlled Chester politics for over a century. The first non-machine mayor was elected in 1992: Barbara Bohannan-Sheppard; however, in 1995, she lost her re-election bid and was replaced by Republican Aaron Wilson, Jr.

In the 1990s, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission reported that Chester&#x27;s government had been dominated by &quot;a triad of criminals, corrupt politicians and rogue law-enforcement officers&quot; since the 1960s. John H. Nacrelli, the mayor of Chester from 1968 to 1979, was convicted of racketeering and income tax evasion for accepting $22,000 in bribes from an illegal gambling operation with ties to organized crime and served two years in prison.

==Economy==
For the period 2010–2014, the estimated median annual income for a household in the city was $28,607, and the median income for a family was $34,840. Male full-time workers had a median income of $34,354 versus $30,634 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,516. About 27.3% of families and 33.1% of the total population were below the poverty line, including 47.7% of those under age 18 and 18.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Sports==
===Horse racing===
With the construction of Harrah&#x27;s Philadelphia, the city received a series of horse races that were once held at the Brandywine Raceway and the now-defunct Liberty Bell Park Racetrack. The racino opened on January 22, 2008, and features a specially constructed bridge that enables the midpoint of races, contested at one mile, to take place over the Delaware River.

===Soccer===
Chester is the home of the Major League Soccer Philadelphia Union franchise, which plays its home games at Subaru Park, a soccer-specific stadium at the base of the Commodore Barry Bridge. Located on the Delaware River, the stadium is part of a larger development called Rivertown. Financing for the Rivertown development was announced in early 2008 by Governor Ed Rendell and Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, with $25 million going to the construction of Subaru Park, and an additional $7 million towards a two-phase project composing of 186 townhouses, 25 apartments, of office space, a convention center, more than of retail space, and a parking structure to house 1,350 cars. In phase two, another 200 apartments will be built, along with of office space and of retail space.

==Education==

In 1995, the city&#x27;s schools ranked last among the state&#x27;s 501 districts, leading Pennsylvania education officials in 2001 to hire the for-profit Edison Schools to run the local school district for three years.

===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====
The Chester-Upland School District serves the city, along with nearby Chester Township and the borough of Upland.

====Parochial schools====
Drexel Neumann Academy, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, is Chester&#x27;s only parochial school. It is run by the Saint Katharine Drexel Roman Catholic Church which was established in 1993 by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia with the consolidation of all Roman Catholic parishes in the city.

Resurrection of Our Lord School in Chester closed in 1993. St. James High School for Boys closed its doors in 1993 due to low enrollment.

====Charter schools====

Chester Charter Scholars Academy began in 2008 as a small public-private partnership between The Chester Fund for Education and the Arts and the Chester-Upland school district. The school was originally called the Chester Upland School for the Arts (CUSA) and operated until 2011 when significant staff reduction occurred due to state funding cuts. In 2012, a charter school application was accepted and the school operated in Aston until September 2017 when a $30 million campus was built on Highland Ave.

Chester Community Charter School is a charter school established in 1998 that serves over 4,000 students in grades K-8. The school operates four campuses, the Upland campus at 1100 Main Street in Upland, the Aston campus at 200 Commerce Drive in Aston, the East Campus at 302 East 5th Street and the West Campus at 2730 Bethel Road in Chester Township.

Widener Partnership Charter School was first launched in 2006, and is located across from the main campus of Widener University. It enrolls students from kindergarten to eighth grade. Widener University provides support to the charter school including educating staff, providing work to graduate students, and use of the university facilities. The school also has a number of outside partners that include 21st Century Learning Communities, Andrew Hicks Foundation, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Big Friends, Chester Education Foundation, Earth Force, Exelon Foundation, Incredible Years, PECO, and Soccer for Success. The Widener Partnership Charter School also has recently added a new $4.6 million wing of the school at 1450 Edgmont Ave. This new edition includes a science learning center, an extension of the library, a gymnasium, eight classrooms and eight offices.

===Colleges and universities===

Widener University is a private university in Chester. Its main campus sits on . The university has three other campuses: two in Pennsylvania (Harrisburg and Exton) and one in Wilmington, Delaware.

Founded as The Bullock School for Boys in 1821, the school was established in Wilmington, Delaware. It became The Alsop School for Boys from 1846 to 1853, and then Hyatt&#x27;s Select School for Boys from 1853 to 1859. Military instruction was introduced in 1858, and in 1859, the school changed its name to Delaware Military Academy. It moved to Chester in 1862 and became Pennsylvania Military Academy. It was known as Pennsylvania Military College after 1892 and adopted the Widener name in 1972.

About 3,300 undergraduates and 3,300 graduate students attend Widener in eight degree-granting schools. The university offers associates, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in areas ranging from traditional liberal arts to professional programs. The Carnegie Foundation classifies Widener as a &quot;Doctoral/Research University&quot; and a &quot;Community Engagement Institution&quot;.
Sleeper&#x27;s College was a vocational school founded in 1910 for &quot;office and commercial training&quot;.

==Transportation==
As of 2015, there were of public roads in Chester, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the city.

In Chester, east–west streets are numbered, while north–south streets carry names. The main bisecting street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both Pennsylvania Route 320 (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to Interstate 95) and Pennsylvania Route 352. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned Pennsylvania Route 291 from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway. This widening and realignment project, spearheaded by the late State Senator Clarence D. Bell, allowed PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direction.

===Highways and bridges===

Chester is served by Interstate 95, with Interstate 476 terminating outside the city limits in Crum Lynne. I-95 was built in the 1960s and originally terminated just north of the Chester/Eddystone line at the present-day I-95/I-476 junction. It was extended north in the 1970s, with the section around Philadelphia International Airport being completed in 1985. Three exits on I-95 allow access to Highland Avenue, Kerlin Street, and Edgmont Avenue/Avenue of the States (Rts. 320 &amp; 352).
Two federal highway routes, U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 322, also run through Chester. US 13 enters Chester from Trainer on W. 4th Street, becomes part of Highland Avenue between W. 4th Street and W. 9th Street, and then continues on 9th Street to Morton Avenue. US 13 follows Morton Avenue in the city&#x27;s Sun Village section until it crosses Ridley Creek and becomes Chester Pike in Eddystone.

US 322 enters Chester from the northeast, merges with I-95 briefly and crosses the Delaware River over the Commodore Barry Bridge. Prior to the bridge&#x27;s opening in 1974, US 322 would cross the Delaware River on the Chester-Bridgeport Ferry, via Flower Street, causing major backups because of limited space on the ferries. With the expansion of State Rt. 291 and the redevelopment of the Chester Waterfront, both the Delaware River Port Authority and PennDOT built a pair of entrance (westbound) and exit (eastbound) ramps to PA Rt. 291, providing direct access to the waterfront without using local streets. The ramps were built between 2007 and 2010 and were opened in 2011.

Plans for reconstruction of US 322 and the merge with I-95 are underway. The road currently requires traffic to merge onto I-95 in the left lane and requires changing lanes three times to the Commodore Barry Bridge exit ramp in less than a mile.

A $16.6 million project to repair eight I-95 bridges will begin March 2017 and is expected to be finished in November 2018. Improvements to Chestnut Street and Morton Avenue are also included in the project.

===Public transportation===

Public bus transportation in Chester is provided by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which acquired the former Suburban Philadelphia Transit Authority (aka &quot;Red Arrow&quot; Lines) in 1968. Seven bus routes (Routes , and ) serve the city, with the Chester Transportation Center as the hub.

The city is also served by the SEPTA Wilmington/Newark Line commuter rail service. The Chester Transportation Center and Highland Avenue stations are the two SEPTA train stations in Chester. The Lamokin Street station was run as a flagstop station until it was closed and demolished in 2003 due to low usage.

The Chester Transportation Center was both a commuter and intercity stop on the former Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s New York City–Washington, D.C. route. The Chester Transportation Center was bypassed when Amtrak took over intercity rail passenger services in 1971, with the exception from April 30, 1978, to October 29, 1983, when the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; stopped once daily in each direction between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.

==Public safety==
===Law enforcement ===
City of Chester Police Department is the primary agency for the city of Chester. Chester Housing Authority Police Department, Delaware River and Port Authority Police Department, and Pennsylvania State Police also support Chester Police Department in their daily functions acting both in coordination and on their own within the scope of their jurisdiction throughout the city of Chester. Chester Police Department regularly requests support from neighboring municipalities for incidents occurring in the city.

Chester is the only municipality in Delaware County with its own sector: Delaware County Sector 3.

City of Chester Police Department works daily with the US Marshal Service and Delaware County CID to bring Chester&#x27;s fugitives to justice.

Though not law enforcement, Widener University&#x27;s Campus Safety Officers have the power to detain and arrest on the immediate and adjacent vicinity of university property. Most of Widener&#x27;s issues are handled by Campus Safety Officers, unless it requires police assistance which is handled by Chester Police Department.

===Crime===
According to a report in 2020 by NeighborhoodScout, Chester ranked 20th on a list of the &quot;Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S.&quot;. NeighborhoodScout says one&#x27;s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in Chester is one in 21, and that &quot;Within Pennsylvania, more than 99% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Chester.&quot;
However, over the past few years, Chester has seen a dramatic decrease in violent crime, with almost a 72% decrease in shootings with victims from 2019 to 2023.

==Religion==
Chester has several churches of historical importance:

*Asbury AME Church - Founded in 1845, it is the second oldest African Methodist Episcopal Church in Chester behind the Union African Methodist Church built in 1832
*Calvary Baptist Church - A Baptist church founded in 1879. Martin Luther King Jr. attended Calvary Baptist when he was a student at Crozer Theological Seminary from 1948 to 1951
*Chester Friends Meetinghouse - The first Quaker meetinghouse was built in 1693 and William Penn was known to speak there
*St. Paul&#x27;s Church and Old Burial Ground - An Episcopal church originally built in 1702. In 1859, a new church was built on Third Street. In 1900, the current St. Paul&#x27;s Church was built at 9th and Madison Street. The Old Burial Ground contains the remains of John Morton, signer of the Declaration of Independence; David Lloyd, Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Colony and Major William Anderson, officer in the Continental Army and U.S. Congressman
*Third Presbyterian Church - A Presbyterian church founded in 1872. It was the location of the first summer bible school in 1912. It was severely damaged by fire in 2020.

St. Katharine Drexel Church is the only Roman Catholic parish remaining in Chester. It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and is the result of the conglomeration of six Chester parishes in 1993.

<text>Chester Heights is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,531 at the 2010 census. Most of the borough lies south of U.S. 1, about a mile southwest of Wawa.

==History==
The history of Chester Heights predates grants of William Penn, when the Swedes had penetrated some distance inland from the Delaware River and had found the rich soil very conducive to productive farming. To a remarkable extent, the area had continued to be so used until the last decade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the borough was part of Aston Township, though this northernmost section of Aston did not have a village aspect as such. With the advent of a railroad, which made its first run-through on Christmas Day 1833, a concentration of houses developed. With the reach of the automobile, a settlement of homes sprang up along the oldest road in the borough. That route, now Valleybrook Road, was once known as the &quot;Logtown Road&quot; and was one of the earliest routes from Chester settlement to the interior. It wanders over and along the West Branch of Chester Creek and is noted for its abrupt curves at the borough&#x27;s southern end.

An 1836 school building on Valleybrook Road and Llewellyn Road was, in its day, rented by its owners to Aston for $2 a month for use as the school for this area. It was subsequently known as the Logtown School and changed to the Chester Heights School in 1880. A second, much later stone school building stands in its place today. The borough was the Fourth Ward of Aston and had been referred to for some time as Chester Heights and Wawa. It was in the northern or &quot;Wawa&quot; area that, over the past one hundred years or more, several large land parcels were acquired for summer residences. To date, most of these tracts have remained relatively unchanged, though they are now used as year-round private residences. (&quot;Wawa&quot; was the Indian name for wild goose.)

In 1852 the cornerstone of St. Thomas the Apostle Church was laid, to house a Roman Catholic congregation that had been meeting on the property of the Willcox family since 1728. It stands today with the addition of a modern church, parochial school and residences. In 1872 an association of Methodists purchased a farm in Aston, incorporating as the Chester Heights Camp-Meeting Associations, and it still convenes each July for religious retreats. The borough of Chester Heights was officially incorporated in 1945.

Today, approximately one dozen early fieldstone or brick dwellings remain intact, though not necessarily restored. The oldest homes date to 1720 or earlier; many of them were established by 1777 when &quot;a number of the stragglers from the defeated American Army, hungry, demoralized and exhausted in their flight from the field at Brandywine, collected in the neighborhood of Logtown, where they passed the night, sleeping in the outbuildings and open fields.&quot; Altogether, the houses represent an historically valuable span of 18th century to Victorian architecture in the borough.

The Chester Heights Camp Meeting Historic District, Chamberlain-Pennell House, and Stonehaven are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Chester Heights was also the home of the fictional Grogan family from the 2008 movie &quot;Marley and Me&quot;.

<text>Clifton Heights is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States, located on Darby Creek west of downtown Philadelphia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,863.

==History==
The demographics of the greater Delaware Valley were significantly impacted by European colonization. By 1754, Native American populations in this region had been significantly displaced, however various uprisings of Native Americans were common throughout the region.

According to historian Freas B. Snyder, settlers set up a large tin kettle at a high point on what is now Oak Avenue, between Baltimore Avenue and Springfield Road. When hostile Indians were moving through the area, an alert would be sounded by banging on the tin kettle. This high point was called &quot;Tin Kettle Hill&quot; and would become a landmark used in three-point calculation surveying, along with a point in Central Philadelphia and a point on the Delaware River to the south.

The high point, Tin Kettle Hill, is believed to be the origin of &quot;Heights&quot; in the borough&#x27;s name.

In 1839, Thomas Kent settled in the area and established the J. and T. Kent Company, which manufactured carpet yarn. The company&#x27;s workers built houses throughout Clifton Heights, surrounding the Kent Mills factory. The original factory building and many of the millworker houses still exist today.

In the early 1950s, Clifton Precision, a defense contractor, built a factory in Clifton Heights, designed by architect Nathan Cronheim. Completed in 1955, the company designed and manufactured motors and other electronic components out of the location. The company was later acquired by Litton Industries and operated until the late 1990s, when the property was sold and converted into offices and warehouse space.

The population of the borough was 1,820 in 1890, 3,155 in 1910, and reached a maximum of 10,268 in 1960.

==History==
Concord Township is first mentioned in court records on June 27, 1683, when John Mendenhall was appointed constable of &quot;Concord liberty&quot;.

The paper for the first currency printed by the Continental Congress was made at the Ivy Mills founded by Thomas Willcox and Thomas Brown. The Ivy Mills was the second oldest paper mill in the United States. The mill made printing paper for Benjamin Franklin and paper for currency for several Continental governments, the US government and many South American countries. The oldest Roman Catholic parish in Pennsylvania began as a mission at the home of the Willcox family in 1730. The church was later moved approximately one mile east to the top of the hill into what later became the Borough of Chester Heights and is known as St. Thomas the Apostle Church.

In 1702, the St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church was founded on land donated by John Hannum, a successful farmer and tavern owner who was baptized by the former Quaker George Keith. Keith was known to conduct services at the Hannum home on Concord Road.

The Newlin Grist Mill has been grinding grain since 1704. It has an tall stone wheel housed in a timber frame. The mill and processing complex passed through various hands and, in the 1950s, it was purchased by a direct descendant of Nicholas Newlin, which along with of surrounding countryside became the Newlin Mill Historic Park. The mill complex area was the location of the Markham post office and Markham train station (Philadelphia/Baltimore rail traffic).

The name &quot;Concord&quot; was believed to have been given by the earliest European settlers of the township and reflects the harmonious feelings among them at the time. Title to all real estate in the township can be traced back to a grant from William Penn.

Concord Township was a part of Chester County until 1789, at which point Delaware County was created by act of legislature. Farmers in the northern and western reaches of Chester County were weary of travelling a period of days to the county seat in Chester, on the Delaware River. The seat of Chester County was moved to Turk&#x27;s Head, now West Chester, and was centrally located in the county.

The Brandywine Summit Camp Meeting, Concord Friends Meetinghouse, Concordville Historic District, Handwrought (also known as the Thomas Marshall House), High Hill Farm, Ivy Mills Historic District, Newlin Mill Complex, Nicholas Newlin House and Thompson Cottage are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

US 1 and US 322 head eastward from their junction with US 202 along Baltimore Pike, with US 1 continuing northeastward across the northern portion of the township and US 322 breaking off to the southeast along Conchester Highway through the central and eastern portions of the township.

<text>Darby is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough is located along Darby Creek southwest of Center City Philadelphia. The borough of Darby is distinct from the nearby municipality of Darby Township.

==History==
===17th century===
Darby was settled in 1682 by seven Quaker families led by abolitionist and fair trade advocate John Blunston. The name Darby is derived from the English city of Derby (pronounced &quot;Darby&quot;), the county town of Derbyshire (pronounced &quot;Darbyshire&quot;), the origin of many early settlers. Incorporated on May 3, 1853, it had 3,429 residents in 1900, 6,305 in 1910, 10,334 in 1940, and 10,687 at the 2010 census.

Darby founder John Blunston immigrated to Pennsylvania in October 1682. He was involved in real estate, agriculture, and goods trading. An early Quaker settler, Blunston was a close associate of William Penn and an active political figure in early Pennsylvania. He first served in the Colonial Assembly from 1683 to 1688. In this early stage of provincial government, Blunston became a strong proponent for the rights of the Assembly. In 1685 Blunston was appointed to a committee that argued against the Provincial Council&#x27;s practice of enacting laws without legislative approval. In the same year, Blunston led the Assembly in their attempt to impeach Chief Justice Nicholas More. Blunston returned to the Assembly for the 1695 term. During his second period of service in the Assembly, he was elected the 12th Speaker of the Assembly on May 10, 1697. He was re-elected Speaker on May 10, 1699, and again on May 10, 1700. During this time he was instrumental in drafting a new frame of government for the Province. He retired from the Assembly after the 1701 term.

===18th century===
In addition to Blunston&#x27;s service in the Assembly, he served as a Provincial Councilor starting in 1700 and ending in 1723. He served as justice of the peace for Chester County from 1684 to 1693 and again from 1695 to 1703. He was also actively involved with Darby Quaker Meeting House in what was then Chester County (now Delaware County), and was one of the Quakers who fought to cease the slave trade amongst Friends. He called upon purchasers to boycott products made by slaves as stolen products, thus advocating a &quot;Fair Trade&quot; policy. He represented the Chester Quarterly Meeting at the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends 17 times between 1688 and 1715.

Darby is home to the fifth-oldest all-volunteer Fire Department and the Darby Free Library, one of the oldest libraries in the United States, founded in 1743. The Darby Friends Burial Ground is the oldest Cemetery in Pennsylvania in continuous use, opened in 1682.

===19th century===
The first temperance society in Pennsylvania, &quot;Darby Association for Discouraging the Unnecessary Use of Spirituous Liquors&quot;, was organized at the Darby Friends Meetinghouse in 1819.

In 1833, three of the founding fourteen members of the Pennsylvania Female Anti Slavery Society were members of the Darby Friends Meeting.

===20th century===

Violent racial incidents hit all over the country as part of the 1919 Red Summer. The Darby 1919 lynching attempt was the attempted lynching of Samuel Gorman of Darby on July 23, 1919. Samuel Gorman, a 17-year-old black boy, was sent to jail for the alleged murder of William E. Taylor.

Union Avenue to the west separates Lansdowne from Upper Darby, while the East Lansdowne border is near Hirst Avenue, leaving a one-block expanse of land that is part of Upper Darby Township.

==Education==
William Penn School District serves East Lansdowne. The district was created in 1972.
* East Lansdowne Basics Magnet Elementary School (K-6)
** In 1972 the school&#x27;s library was open to the public, one of the few school libraries to do so, as East Lansdowne had no other public library. That year, it had an area for sports called the &quot;dust bowl&quot;. That year John Hilferty of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described it as &quot;even more minuscule&quot; compared to the East Lansdowne borough, which he called &quot;Lilliputian&quot; due to its size.
* Vision Academy Charter School (K-8)
* Penn Wood Middle School (7-8) (Darby)
* Penn Wood High School, Cypress Street Campus (9-10)(Yeadon)
* Penn Wood High School, Green Ave Campus (11-12) (Lansdowne)

===Private schools===
Saint Cyril of Alexandria Catholic Elementary School (K-8), founded in September, 1929, was moved to and combined with St. Philomena in nearby Lansdowne, PA in 2021 after a protracted battle to keep the school open.

In December, 2005 the archdiocese proposed closing it, but it remained open after community members, inspired by a child with cystic fibrosis who asked for the Make a Wish foundation to save his school, donated $200,000 to keep it open. This was dubbed the &quot;Miracle at St. Cyril.&quot; In 2012 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia proposed closing it again, intending to merge it into St. Andrew School of Upper Darby. However the archdiocese reversed that decision. Instead it became the Independence Mission Schools, not operated by the archdiocese. In 2012 there were 207 students.

Vision Academy Charter School purchased the St. Cyril of Alexandria buildings from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and opened during the 2021-22 school year.

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operates Catholic churches. St. Cyril of Alexandria Church in East Lansdowne opened in June 1928. In 2013, St. Cyril of Alexandria merged into St. Philomena Church in Lansdowne, with the St. Cyril parish closed.

<doc id="132419" wikidata="Q1132373" url="?curid=132419" title="Eddystone, Pennsylvania">
<text>Eddystone is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,410 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area at the mouth of Ridley Creek was first called &quot;Tequirassy&quot; by Native Americans. The land was owned by Olof Persson Stille, one of the early settlers from New Sweden, who had immigrated in 1641. Olof Stille, a millwright by trade, came from Penningby Manor in Länna in the county of Uppland, north of Stockholm, Sweden. After the conquest of the colony by the Dutch in 1658, Stille was one of the four commissaries or magistrates appointed to administer justice among the inhabitants, and thus became a judge of the first court on the banks of the Delaware.

The borough of Eddystone was formed around the Eddystone Print Works. William Simpson &amp; Sons established the Eddystone Print Works on the land that is now Eddystone in October 1873, after the land on which their previous factory had operated was condemned to make way for Fairmount Park.

Eddystone Borough was incorporated on December 7, 1888. Eddystone&#x27;s petition for incorporation was challenged in court on several grounds, including that &quot;the finances of the township of Ridley and of the Ridley school district will be diminished by the creation of this borough.&quot; On December 3, 1888, the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas issued an opinion rejecting these claims, noting that while Ridley&#x27;s &quot;revenues...will be diminished, so will its burdens.&quot;

On April 10, 1917, an explosion at the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation near Chester resulted in the deaths of 133 workers, mostly women.

==Education==
Children in Eddystone attend school at the Eddystone Elementary School on 9th Street. The elementary school is located on the site of the old Eddystone High School, which burned down in 1960. The students were accommodated by Eddystone United Methodist Church during that time and many of today’s senior citizens remember the church as their school. After children pass the fifth grade, they move onto Ridley Middle School, a part of the Ridley School District.

==Geography==
Eddystone is located in southern Delaware County at (39.859345, -75.340920), on the north bank of the Delaware River. It is bordered to the east by Crum Creek, to the west by Ridley Creek. Ridley Township borders Eddystone to the north and east, the city of Chester is on the western border, and Gloucester County, New Jersey, is to the south across the Delaware.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Eddystone has a total area of , of which is land and , or 34.70%, is water, primarily the Delaware River.

==Industrial history==

Eddystone has a history of heavy industry. Eddystone Arsenal became the largest Baldwin Locomotive Works plant (the smaller being in Spring Garden, Philadelphia). Baldwin was once the largest manufacturer of steam locomotives in the world. Today an Exelon generating station occupies some of the riverfront. The Platt-LePage Aircraft Company built some of the earliest rotorcraft on adjacent land to the northeast (outside the borough). The site&#x27;s association with military helicopters continued through McDonnell Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas all the way to the present, as a Boeing Integrated Defense Systems plant now operates there.

During World War I, Remington Arms opened the Eddystone Rifle Plant on Baldwin land with Baldwin management. Here it produced the Pattern 1914 Enfield rifle and M1917 Enfield rifle. A large portion of the rifles used by American soldiers in France in World War I were made at Eddystone. In January 1918 Remington Arms was absorbed by Midvale Steel and Ordnance Company, which took over the rifle plant.

Baldwin also formed a subsidiary company (Eddystone Ammunition Corporation) in 1915 to build artillery shells (Russian-model on British order). On 10 April 1917, 133 people were killed in an explosion at the artillery shell plant. A monument in the Chester Rural Cemetery recognizes the unidentified victims.

In 1917 the U.S. government also placed artillery shell orders, and bought out some of the assets of the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation. A new corporation, the similarly named Eddystone Munitions Company, was formed by Baldwin to make the shrapnel for the shells.

==Religion==
Eddystone United Methodist Church was established in 1891 and is pictured above. The Simpson Family (William Simpson &amp; Sons of the Eddystone Print Works (1873)were the main supporters and contributors. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operates Catholic churches. St. Rose of Lima Church, established in 1890, is in Eddystone. The number of parishioners increased by 20% from 2008 to 2012, with 4,158 congregants in the latter year.

==Culture==
Eddystone has the headquarters of the St. James High School for Boys alumni association, a building which has a banquet area, a bar and a chapel. Timothy Logue of &quot;Delaware County Daily Times&quot; described the building as &quot;de facto museum of everything St. James&quot;.

==Transportation==
As of 2010, there were of public roads in Eddystone, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Two numbered highways pass through Eddystone: U.S. Route 13 follows Chester Pike on a southwest-to-northeast alignment along the northwestern edge of the borough, while Pennsylvania Route 291 follows Industrial Highway on a similar alignment through the center of the borough.
Eddystone Station is a SEPTA train station on the Wilmington/Newark Line. Eddystone is served by SEPTA bus route 37, providing service to Philadelphia International Airport and South Philadelphia, and bus route 114 serving Chester transportation center and Penn State Brandywine.

Delmar Drive was once part of Calcon Hook Road. &quot;Calcon&quot; is the Swedish word for &quot;turkey&quot;, and &quot;Hook&quot; is the Swedish word for &quot;road&quot;. The original road was a Leni Lenape trail called &quot;Turkey&#x27;s Neck Trail&quot; by the settlers, and was no more than wide.

Originally productive farmlands, it became a residential suburb of Philadelphia with the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad through the area in 1874. A passenger stop was built and named Folcroft, or &quot;leafy fields&quot;. Originally part of Darby Township, Folcroft was incorporated as a borough in 1922.

In August 1963, the Baker family became the first African-American family to purchase a house in Folcroft in the Delmar village complex. When local white residents learned of the purchase, the house was vandalized and a crowd of over a thousand people prevented the Baker family from entering their home. 100 Pennsylvania State Troopers were required to control the crowd and allow the Bakers to enter their home. The harassment and vandalism continued and forced the Bakers to sell the home and move in 1966.

In July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Folcroft became the first municipality in Delaware County to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.

On January 3, 2022, Franny DiCicco was sworn in as the first female Mayor of Folcroft in its 100 year history. The incoming Mayor won election along with Democratic candidates in a clean sweep of the open seats of the borough on Election Day 2021.

==Environmental issues==
Through the grassroots support of local citizens, organizations and politicians, Congress declared Tinicum Marsh along Darby Creek a National Wildlife Refuge in 1972. The John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum is just one of over 530 national wildlife refuges managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In the shadow of Philadelphia, visitors can watch pintail ducks feeding, red-bellied turtles basking, butterflies flitting, and foxes play. With just of marshes, fields, streams and forests, the refuge is small in area but significant biologically. Tinicum&#x27;s Marshes, along with other wetlands in the Delaware estuary, are the nursery for commercial and sport fisheries along the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency placed the Lower Darby Creek Area on the National Priorities List in June 2001. The site consists of two landfills: the Clearview Landfill and the Folcroft Landfill and Annex. EPA held a meeting in September 2001 to inform the community that the Lower Darby Creek Area is now a Superfund site.

The Lower Darby Creek Area site consists of two landfills, the Clearview Landfill and the Folcroft Landfill and Annex, along Darby Creek in Philadelphia and Delaware counties. Clearview Landfill is on the east side of Darby Creek, and about downstream is the Folcroft Landfill/Annex on the west side of Darby Creek. The Folcroft Landfill/Annex is part of the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The two landfills operated from the 1950s to the 1970s and were eventually closed in the mid-1970s. During operation they disposed of a variety of waste including municipal, demolition, and hospital waste.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service owns the Folcroft Landfill/Annex and, accordingly, they will have the lead on cleaning it up. Presently, EPA is in discussions with potentially responsible parties to form a group to perform the RI/FS at the Folcroft Landfill/Annex.
