<text>Lebanon is a city in and the county seat of Warren County, Ohio, United States. The population was 20,841 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.

==History==
Lebanon is in the Symmes Purchase. The first European settler in what is now Lebanon was Ichabod Corwin, uncle of Ohio Governor Thomas Corwin, who came to Ohio from Bourbon County, Kentucky, and settled on the north branch of Turtle Creek in March 1796. The site of his cabin is now on the grounds of Berry Intermediate School on North Broadway and is marked with a monument erected by the Warren County Historical Society.

The town was laid out in September 1802 on land owned by Ichabod Corwin, Silas Hurin, Ephraim Hathaway, and Samuel Manning in Sections 35 and 35 of Town 5, Range 3 North and Sections 5 and 6 of Town 4, Range 3 North of the Between the Miami Rivers Survey. Lebanon was named after the Biblical Lebanon because of the many juniper or Eastern Red cedar trees there, similar to the Lebanon Cedar. It is known today as &quot;The Cedar City&quot;.

City legend has it that Lebanon didn&#x27;t grow as large as Cincinnati or Dayton because of the &#x27;Shaker Curse&#x27;. During their migration, the Shakers decided an area outside of town was a suitable place for them to create a homeland for themselves. There was a disagreement with some of the locals and it was said the Shakers placed a curse on the city to hinder the city&#x27;s prosperity. In reality, the Shakers thrived in the area, and built a settlement about west of Lebanon called Union Village. A local man, Malchalm Worley was their first convert. Since the Shakers did not engage in procreation, they relied on converts to increase their numbers. By 1900, there were almost no Shakers left in Ohio.

The city is one of the few in the nation to once operate a government-run cable television and telephone service, as well as being a fiber-to-the-neighborhood Internet service provider. Controversial since it began operation in 1999, the Lebanon telecommunications system had struggled to recover its expenses and had accumulated over $8 million in debt. However, residents in the area at the time paid up to 50% less for the aforementioned services than neighboring communities, therefore saving over $40 million of the residents&#x27; money. In the 2006 general election, however, voters approved the sale of this city-run telecommunications system to Cincinnati Bell.

<text>Mason is a city in southwestern Warren County, Ohio, United States, approximately north of downtown Cincinnati. As of the 2020 census, Mason&#x27;s population was 34,792. It is home to Kings Island amusement park and one of the largest tennis stadiums in the world, the Lindner Family Tennis Center, home of the Cincinnati Open, one of the world&#x27;s top tennis tournaments for both men and women.

==History==
On June 1, 1803, Revolutionary War veteran William Mason paid $1,700 at auction to purchase of land in what is now downtown Mason. In 1815, he platted 16 lots on this land and named the village &quot;Palmyra.&quot;

In 1835, a petition was sent to the federal post office to correct the name of the town. The town had been listed as Kirkwood, possibly an error because the postmaster at the time was named William Kirkwood. When village officials were informed that there was another Palmyra in Ohio, the name was officially changed to &quot;Mason.&quot;

In 1923 Main Street was paved, prompting a celebration throughout the town.

Mason remained a small farming community for another 125 years. In 1970, a year before the town was incorporated to become a city, there were fewer than 5,700 residents.

In February 1997, Mason withdrew from surrounding Deerfield Township by forming a paper township called Mason Township.

=== Voice of America ===
In 1928 the 50,000 watt, 831-foot WLW-AM tower was built on Tylersville Road. Six years after its construction President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the tower to operate 10 times it original power capacity. The new 500,000 wattage would be powerful enough to broadcast across the Atlantic ocean. This new strength would prove tedious for locals as they could hear the broadcast through their bedsprings, downspouts, and fencing.

After complaints from other radio stations due to signal interference, the power would eventually be reduced in 1939 after the Federal Communications Commission chose not to renew the experimental broadcast, reducing the wattage back to its original 50,000 capacity. This decision was appealed by the Crosley Corporation, the company who operated the tower, all the way to the supreme court where it was still denied.

<doc id="129938" wikidata="Q816175" url="?curid=129938" title="Belpre, Ohio">
<text>Belpre (historically spelled Belpré; pronounced ) is a city in Washington County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River across from Parkersburg, West Virginia. The population was 6,728 at the 2020 census. Its name derives from &quot;Belle Prairie&quot; (French for &quot;beautiful meadow&quot;), the name given to the valley by French trappers prior to the first American settlement at the site.

Part of the Marietta micropolitan area, Belpre is located about 14 miles (22 km) downriver from Marietta. In 1870, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed the Parkersburg Bridge (CSX) across the river; at , it was reportedly the longest in the world.

==History==
The first settlement at Belpre was made in 1788. In 1845 railroad developers founded the Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad, but the destination was changed to Marietta, with a corresponding name change in 1851. For a considerable period of time, travelers had to go by steamboat to connect between Marietta and Parkersburg, Virginia; the latter received service from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1857. This was shortly before the western part of Virginia seceded in 1861 after the start of the American Civil War to form Unionist West Virginia. Belpre and Marietta were later connected by rail. Coal service is still active on this line.

From 1868–1870, the B&amp;O built the Parkersburg Bridge (CSX) between West Virginia and Belpre, on its main line to St. Louis, Missouri. Designed by Jacob Linville, when completed in 1870 the bridge was reportedly the longest in the world at . The bridge attracted more trade to the town, enabled shipping Ohio coal to the East Coast, and improved access on both sides of the river.

Developing in a different pattern from the more industrial cities of eastern Ohio, Belpre reached its peak of population in 1980. It has had some losses since then with the decline of heavy industry, but is relatively stable compared to the former industrial cities, which have lost half their residents since peaks in 1940 and 1950. A small settlement, Rockland, has been absorbed into the Belpre community.

==Geography==

<text>Lowell is a village in Washington County, Ohio, United States, along the Muskingum River. The population was 549 at the 2020 census. The village is located about north of Marietta, Ohio.

==History==

The first European settlers to the land that would become Lowell arrived in the late 18th century after the 1787 Northwest Ordinance opened the territory for settlement. Soon after the Ordinance took effect, the Ohio Company of Associates purchased of land along the Muskingum River and proceeded to survey the area. The first settlement in what would become the state of Ohio was Marietta, founded in 1788 near the mouth of the Muskingum about downstream from the site that would become Lowell. By 1789, settlement had spread north to the area where the Cats Creek enters the Muskingum River.

By the 1830s the Muskingum Valley had long been settled, and local leaders created a plan to improve the Muskingum River for use as a source of power. In 1836 the State Legislature approved a bill that appropriated $400,000 to create a series of locks and dams along the river as far north as Dresden. Between 1837 and 1841, eleven dams and twelve locks were built at a cost that had ballooned to over $1.6 million. The third lock was built within a one-mile (1.6 km) long canal constructed near the mouth of the Cats Creek to bypass a series of rapids in the Muskingum. Two competing companies bought land near the canal with the intentions of building a town. The first settlement was laid out on November 8, 1837, and was named Lowell with the idea that it would grow into a large manufacturing city similar to Lowell, Massachusetts. It was located along the upper end of the canal on the west side of the Cats Creek. The second settlement, called Buell&#x27;s Lowell, was laid out on March 22, 1838. The second settlement quickly grew to dominate to the point that the first settlement became known as Upper Lowell. In 1850, Buell&#x27;s Lowell was incorporated as a village and in 1889 officially changed its name to Lowell.

During the second half the 19th century several mills, tanneries, and factories were built along the canal. In 1888 the Zanesville and Ohio River Railroad was constructed across the river from Lowell giving the small village rail access to Zanesville in the north and Marietta in the south. By the turn of the 20th century, Lowell&#x27;s fortunes began to decline as river trade was replaced by the railroads and later automobiles. Industry in the city declined and much of the land along the canal has since been replaced by parkland. Today many Lowell residents rely on Parkersburg and Marietta for jobs and shopping.

On November 10, 2015, no one ran against Steve Weber and he was elected Mayor.

<text>Macksburg is a village in Washington County, Ohio, United States, along the West Fork of Duck Creek. The population was 120 at the 2020 census. The village is about south of Cambridge, Ohio.

==History==
In 1860, an oil seep in the area of Duck Creek led to the discovery of oil at a depth of 59 feet, on William Rayley&#x27;s farm. The resulting Macksburg Oil Field became one of Ohio&#x27;s first oil fields. The subsequent oil boom peaked in 1886, but production had ceased by 1900.

A post office called Macksburg(h) has been in operation since 1873. The name may be derived from McIntosh, the name of a village merchant.

<doc id="129944" wikidata="Q985482" url="?curid=129944" title="Marietta, Ohio">
<text>Marietta is a city in and the county seat of Washington County, Ohio, United States. It is located in southeastern Ohio at the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio Rivers, northeast of Parkersburg, West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, Marietta has a population of 13,385 people. It is the principal city of the Marietta micropolitan area, which includes all of Washington County, and is the second-largest city in the Parkersburg–Marietta–Vienna combined statistical area.

Founded in 1788 by pioneers to the Ohio Country, Marietta was the first permanent U.S. settlement in the newly established Northwest Territory, created in 1787, and what would later become the state of Ohio. It is named for Marie Antoinette, then Queen of France, in honor of French aid in the American Revolution. The area was inhabited by various native tribes of the Hopewell tradition, who built the Marietta Earthworks, a complex more than 1,500 years old, whose Great Mound and other major monuments were preserved by the earliest settlers in parks such as Mound Cemetery. Since 1835 the city has been home to Marietta College, a private, nonsectarian liberal arts school with approximately 1,200 students. Leading up to the American Civil War, the city was a station on the Underground Railroad.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
Succeeding Indigenous cultures lived along the Ohio River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Among them were more than one culture who built earthwork mounds, monuments which generally expressed their cosmology, often with links to astronomical events.

Between 100 BC and AD 500, the Hopewell culture built the multi-earthwork complex on the terrace east of the Muskingum River near its mouth with the Ohio. It is now known as the Marietta Earthworks. Developed over many years, it had a large enclosed square, within which were four platform mounds, used for ceremonial purposes and elite residential; another square, and a larger conical mound used for burials. A walled, graded path led to the river&#x27;s edge. By the time of the historic tribes, such as the Shawnee, the purposes and makers of the monuments were no longer known.

===Settlement===

French explorers entered this area in the 18th century, and in 1749 buried numerous leaden plates to mark their claim to the Ohio Country (which they called the Illinois Territory, as they had more settlements near the Mississippi River.) They later ceded their territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain after the French and Indian War. Two of their plates were discovered in the Marietta area in 1798, and one was replicated for what is known as the French monument, erected in the 20th century (see photo).

In 1770, the future U.S. president George Washington, then a surveyor, began exploring large tracts of land west of his native Virginia. During the Revolutionary War, Washington told his friend General Rufus Putnam of the beauty he had seen in his travels through the Ohio Valley and of his ideas for settling the territory. In the summer of 1781, John Carpenter built Carpenter&#x27;s Fort, or Carpenter&#x27;s Station as it was sometimes called, a fortified house above the mouth of Short Creek on the Ohio side of the Ohio River, near present-day Marietta.

After the American Revolutionary War, the U.S. sold or granted large tracts of land to stimulate development in this area. Marietta was founded by settlers from New England who were investors in the Ohio Company of Associates. It was the first of numerous New England settlements in what was then the Northwest Territory. These New Englanders, or &quot;Yankees&quot; as they were called, were descended from the Puritan English colonists who had settled New England in the 1600s and were primarily Congregationalists. The first church constructed in Marietta was a Congregationalist church, founded around 1786. Before the mid-1790s services were held at the fort or in Munsell&#x27;s Hall at nearby Point Harmar. In 1798 the Muskingum Academy was built on the site of the 19th century Marietta Congregationalist Church. The academy building served both educational and religious purposes.

After the war, the newly formed United States had little cash but plenty of land. Eager to develop additional lands, the new government decided to pay veterans of the Revolution with warrants for land in the Northwest Territory, which was organized under federal authority in 1787 by the Northwest Ordinance. Competing states had agreed to end their claims to the lands; Pennsylvania and Virginia received some lands in a settlement. Arthur St. Clair was appointed by the president as governor of the new territory. He was inaugurated on a site now marked by the Start Westward Memorial.

The Ohio Company of Associates had supported provisions in the ordinance to allow veterans to use their warrants to purchase the land. They bought 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) of land from Congress. On April 7, 1788, 48 men of the Ohio Company of Associates, led by General Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. The site was on the east side of the Muskingum River, across from Fort Harmar, a military outpost built three years prior.

Bringing with them the first government sanctioned by the US for this area, they established the first permanent United States settlement in the Northwest Territory. (Older European settlements in the Northwest Territory region include Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, 1668; Cahokia, Illinois, 1696, Detroit, 1701; Kaskaskia, Illinois, 1703, Ouiatenon, Indiana, 1717, Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, 1720; Vincennes, Indiana, 1732, Clarksville, Indiana, 1783, Martin&#x27;s Ferry, Ohio, 1785, Fort Finney/Jeffersonville, Indiana, 1786, most settled by ethnic French colonists from Canada.) The Americans named Marietta in honor of Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who had aided the colonies in their battle for independence from Great Britain.

The settlers immediately started construction of two forts: Campus Martius, whose former site is now occupied by the museum of the same name, and Picketed Point Stockade, at the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. At the same time, the settlers started developing their community, platted according to plans they had made in Boston.

In 1788, George Washington said: 

The families of the settlers began arriving within a few months. By the end of 1788, 137 people populated the area.
In 1789, the United States signed the Treaty of Fort Harmar with several Indigenous tribes that occupied areas of the Northwest Territory, to settle issues related to trade, as well as the boundary between their lands and United States settlement. The US did not address the Indigenous people&#x27;s major grievance about American settlers moving into their lands, particularly in the Western Reserve, where there were disputes over land. Although Congress authorized Governor Arthur St. Clair to give land back to the Indigenous people, he did not do so. Conflict increased as the Indigenous people tried to push the settlers out. After years of warfare in the region, they were defeated. The US signed the Treaty of Greenville (1795) with the Indigenous people, which secured the safety of settlers to leave the forts and develop their farms. 

The settlers held services regularly and chartered the first church in 1799. It was a Congregational institution; its charter was unusually inclusive due to the varied religious backgrounds of its members. The congregation constructed the first church building in 1807. The original church burned in 1905 and another constructed in its place in 1906. The church, First Congregational Church United Church of Christ, is the longest continuously worshiping congregation west of the Alleghenies.

Education was important to the settlers, many of whom had been officers during the Revolution. During that first winter, they began a basic school for the children at Campus Martius. In 1797, settlers founded Muskingum Academy. The town had numerous abolitionists, and Ephraim Cutler was instrumental as a state delegate in 1802 at the state convention in swaying the vote for the state to be free of slavery.

===19th century===
Townspeople organized and chartered Marietta College in 1835. It was used as a station on the Underground Railroad to help slaves escape from the South. Ohio University was founded earlier in Athens, on land reserved for public education under the Northwest Ordinance.

The settlers preserved the Great Mound, or &quot;Conus,&quot; by planning their own cemetery around it. They also preserved the two largest platform mounds, which they called &quot;Capitolinus&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenus.&quot; The former was developed as the site for the city library. As of 1900, the Mound Cemetery had the highest number of burials of Revolutionary War officers in the nation, indicating the nature of the generation that settled Marietta.

Marietta&#x27;s location on two major navigable rivers made it ideal for industry and commerce. Boat building was one of the early industries. Artisans built oceangoing vessels and sailed them downriver to the Mississippi River and south to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. In less than two decades after settlement, the steamboat had been developed, and was also constructed here. Brick factories and sawmills supplied materials for homes and public buildings. An iron mill, along with several foundries, provided rails for the growing railroad industry; the Marietta Chair Factory made furniture.

Interest in the prehistoric culture that built the Marietta Earthworks continued. The complex was surveyed and drawn by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis, whose large project on numerous prehistoric mounds throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1848 as &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley.&quot; It was the first book published by the Smithsonian. Their drawing above shows the plan of the original complex, which &quot;included a large square enclosure surrounding four flat-topped pyramidal mounds, another smaller square, and a circular enclosure with a large burial mound at its center.&quot; The walled, graded path, called by the settlers the &quot;Sacra Via&quot;, led from the largest enclosure to the lower river&#x27;s edge. This pathway was destroyed in 1843 during mid-nineteenth century development.

===Railroads and oil===
Local development began with the Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad (B&amp;C); it was founded in 1845. It was intended to connect from Belpre, Ohio, the next town downriver, to a planned Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) spur to Parkersburg. But, for years, the Virginia government did not allow the B&amp;O to construct track south of Wheeling. In 1851 developers changed the Ohio state terminus to Marietta and changed the name of the railroad to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad that year. The right-of-way for an alternate connection to the B&amp;O extended upriver from Marietta to Bellaire, Ohio. The M&amp;C was bankrupt by 1857, but construction of track continued west to reach Cincinnati. The first through-train from Cincinnati ran on April 9, 1857. The M&amp;C got out of bankruptcy in 1860.

In 1871, the Ohio Valley Railroad was formed and for the next two years built tracks going north for 103 miles. Their home office was in Marietta, with treasurer offices in Pittsburgh. The Ohio Valley railroad was reorganized as the Marietta and Cleveland. The Pennsylvania Railroad in its expansion later purchased the railroad and its right-of-way between Marietta and Bellaire.

Passengers traveling between Marietta and Parkersburg, Virginia (now West Virginia) had to take a steamboat for the 14 miles between the two towns and transfer. With help from the B&amp;O and the Baltimore City Council, the Union Railroad finally connected Marietta to Belpre, Ohio in 1860. Later absorbed by the B&amp;O, this section of track is still in operation (2008), with unit coal trains providing most of the traffic.

The planned bridge from Parkersburg across the Ohio River to Belpre was finally built 1868–1870 by the B&amp;O, as part of its main line from Baltimore to St. Louis, Missouri. This cut Marietta off from traffic and trade, although it retained local and Ohio service. In the early 20th century, 24 passenger trains served Marietta each day, most of which ran on the PRR tracks.

William P. Cutler was a major figure in the M&amp;C. He also backed the Union Railroad and the Marietta, Columbus and Cleveland Railroad, among other local railroads. Cutler served as General Manager and as President of the M&amp;C for many years.

In 1860, oil was first drilled in the Marietta region. Oil booms in 1875 and 1910 made investors rich, who constructed numerous lavish houses in town, of which many still stand. The Dawes brothers of Marietta founded the Pure Oil Company. All four brothers became nationally prominent businessmen or politicians: Charles Gates Dawes, Rufus C. Dawes, Beman Gates Dawes and Henry May Dawes. Charles Dawes was elected in 1924 with President Calvin Coolidge to serve as the 30th Vice President of the United States (1925–1929). In 1925, he shared the Nobel Peace Prize, based on his work on the Dawes Plan and relieving an international crisis in 1923 related to German reparations after World War I.

In 1880, the first Putnam Street Bridge was opened to connect Marietta to Fort Harmar. It provided the first free crossing of the Muskingum River.

===20th century===

As transportation advanced along railroads and highways, Marietta was initially passed by. From 1868 to 1870, the B &amp; O Railroad built a bridge to connect Parkersburg, West Virginia and Belpre; and the National Road went further north through Zanesville.

But the Pennsylvania Railroad expanded in the late 19th century and had a station in Marietta, running 26 daily trains between Marietta and Pittsburgh. After WWII passenger service decreased as the railroads restructured and the federal government invested in highway construction. The last rail passenger service ended in 1953.

<text>Bryan is a city in, and the county seat of, Williams County, Ohio, United States. It is located in the state&#x27;s northwestern corner, southwest of Toledo. The population was 8,729 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Bryan was platted in 1840 by John A. Bryan, and named for him. It was incorporated as a village in 1841, and reincorporated as a city in 1941.

Williams County was originally part of Defiance County, with Defiance as the county seat. The area was later split into Williams and Defiance counties. Bryan was named the seat for the new county, but not without conflict; the village of Montpelier was considered a more centralized location. The people of Montpelier petitioned the state legislature, but in the end Bryan was named county seat because of its greater industrial and commercial importance and because of its higher population. To this day, many people still argue about the state&#x27;s decision and a rivalry of sorts remains between the two communities.

A strip of Williams County north of Bryan was originally part of a conflict known as the Toledo War, between Ohio and Michigan. Both states claimed the land, the Toledo Strip, which was named for the port city of Toledo at its eastern end. The conflict was eventually resolved in favor of Ohio, with Michigan being compensated with what is now the western Upper Peninsula.

The Williams County Courthouse downtown was completed in 1891. It is the third courthouse to occupy the property.

The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, later absorbed into the New York Central Railroad as part of its Chicago mainline, began serving Bryan in 1869. Due to the New York Central&#x27;s line between Stryker, Ohio and Butler, Indiana, being both straight and flat, on July 23, 1966, Bryan was a mid-point of a record-setting speed run by a New York Central RDC-3, M-497 Black Beetle, modified with a pair of jet engines. The car reached a speed of , an American rail speed record that still stands today. From 1905 to 1939, Bryan was also the western terminus for the Toledo and Indiana Railway, an interurban that began operation between Toledo and Stryker in 1901.

Bowling Green was first settled in 1832, was incorporated as a town in 1855, and became a city in 1901. The village was named after Bowling Green, Kentucky, by a retired postal worker who had once delivered mail there.

===Growth and oil boom===
In 1868 Bowling Green was designated as the county seat, succeeding Perrysburg.

With the discovery of oil in the area in the late 19th and early 20th century, Bowling Green enjoyed a boom to its economy.

A new county courthouse was also constructed in the 1890s. The Neoclassical US post office was erected in 1913.

===Industrialization===
This period was followed by an expansion of the automobile industry. In late 1922 or early 1923, Coats Steam Car moved to the area and hired numerous workers. It eventually went out of business as the industry became centralized in Detroit, Michigan.

Bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd and Billy the Killer encountered police in Bowling Green in April 1931. Their armed confrontation resulted in the death of Billy the Killer.

During World War II Italian and German prisoners of war were held nearby. They were used to staff the Heinz Tomato Ketchup factory in town. The ketchup factory closed in 1975.

A runaway freight train carrying hazardous liquids passed through Bowling Green in 2001, in what is known as the known as the CSX 8888 incident. It traveled more than 65 miles south of Toledo before being stopped by a veteran railroad worker near Kenton; he jumped into the train while it was moving. No one was hurt and there was no property damage in the incident.

<text>Grand Rapids is a village in Grand Rapids Township, Wood County, Ohio, United States, along the Maumee River. The population was 925 at the 2020 census. Grand Rapids is served by a branch of the Weston Public Library.

==History==
Grand Rapids was originally called Gilead, and under the latter name was platted in 1833. To meet the challenges of keeping enough water in its canals in the 1840s, the state of Ohio built a large dam across the Maumee River at Gilead in 1845. Because the dam replaced a smaller dam that had been built to provide power to a mill and thereby restricted the water power provided to the mill, the outraged citizens of Gilead destroyed the dam. Following the destruction of the dam, a side cut canal was built that connected Gilead with the main canal. This caused an economic boom in Gilead and the village was incorporated as Grand Rapids in 1855.

A post office called Gilead was established in 1837, and the name was changed to Grand Rapids in 1868. The village was incorporated in 1885.

An ice jam led to a major flood in February 1959, resulting in extensive damage and displacing 130 residents.

<text>William Ernest Powell Giles (20 July 1835 – 13 November 1897), best known as Ernest Giles, was an Australian explorer. He led five major expeditions to parts of South Australia and Western Australia.

== Early life ==
Ernest Giles was born in Bristol, England, the eldest son of William Giles ( – 28 May 1860), a merchant, and Jane Elizabeth Giles, &quot;née&quot; Powell ( – 15 March 1879).
Their family had been in comfortable circumstances but fell on hard times and emigrated to Australia. William Giles was living in North Adelaide by 1850 and Melbourne by 1853. William was later employed by Customs in Victoria, and his wife founded a successful school for girls in that colony.

Giles was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school, Newgate, London. In 1850, at the age of 15, he emigrated to Australia, joining his parents in Adelaide. In 1852 Giles went to the Victorian goldfields, then became a clerk at the Post Office in Melbourne, and later at the County Court. Soon tiring of town life Giles went to the back country and gained valuable experience as a bushman. In 1865, he explored north-west of the Darling River in the Yancannia Range looking for pastoral country and land capable of cultivating hemp, as it was valuable for rope at the time.

== Exploration ==

Giles did not attempt an organised expedition until 22 August 1872, when he left Chambers Pillar with two other men and traversed much uncharted country to the north-west and west. Finding their way barred by Lake Amadeus and that their horses were getting very weak, a return was made to the Finke River and then to Charlotte Waters and Adelaide, where Giles arrived in January 1873. Giles looked upon his expedition as a failure, but he had done well considering the size and equipment of his party.

== Second expedition ==
Giles&#x27; friend Baron von Mueller raised a subscription so that a new expedition could be made. The services of William Tietkens as first assistant were obtained, and with two other men a start was made on 4 August 1873. The journey began considerably south from the previous expedition and from the Alberga River a generally western course was traversed. A month later in the Musgrave Ranges a fine running river was found and named the Ferdinand and by 3 October 1873 the party was approaching longitude 128 East. The country was extremely dry and though tested in various directions it was a constant struggle to get enough water to keep the horses going. Early in November, having passed longitude 126, a partial return was made and on 20 December 1873 the neighbourhood of Mount Scott was reached. A turn to the north and then west was made and the farthest westerly point was reached on 23 April 1874. Giles and one of the men, Alfred Gibson, had been scouting ahead when the latter&#x27;s horse died. Giles gave him his own horse with instructions to follow their tracks back and obtain assistance. Giles made his way back to their depot on foot in eight days, almost completely exhausted, to find that Gibson had not reached the camp. A search was made for him for several days without success. The stores were almost finished, nothing further could be done, and on 21 May 1874 the return journey began. Giles named the desert Gibson Desert after his companion. On 24 June 1874 they were on a good track to the Finke River and on 13 July 1874 Charlotte Waters was reached. Giles had again failed to cross the continent, but in the circumstances all had been done that was possible.

Giles was the first European to see the rock formations named &quot;The Olgas&quot;, now officially known by Kata Tjuta/Mount Olga, and Lake Amadeus. He had wanted to name these Mt Mueller and Lake Ferdinand respectively, to honour his benefactor Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, however Mueller prevailed on him to instead honour the King Amadeus of Spain and Queen Olga of Württemberg. Giles supposedly discovered Uluru, but was beaten to the claim by a competing explorer, William Gosse.

== Third, fourth and fifth expeditions ==

Early in 1875 Giles prepared his diaries for publication under the title &quot;Geographic Travels in Central Australia&quot;, and on 13 March 1875, with the generous help of Sir Thomas Elder, he began his third expedition. Proceeding far northwards from Fowler&#x27;s Bay, the country was found to be very dry. Retracing his steps Giles turned east, and eventually going round the north side of Lake Torrens, reached Elder&#x27;s station at Beltana.

At Beltana the preparations for his fourth journey were made, and with Tietkens again his lieutenant, and with a caravan of camels, a start was made on 6 May. Afghan cameleer Mahomet Saleh, who had accompanied explorer Peter Warburton to Western Australia two years previously, drove and managed the camels. They reached Port Augusta on 23 May and, after taking a northerly course to clear the lakes, followed a generally westerly course. Some water was carried, and the party was saved the continual excursions in search of water for horses that had caused so much difficulty during previous expeditions. Towards the end of September, over had been covered in 17 days without finding water, when on 25 September one of the Aboriginal guides in the expedition party, Tommy Oldham, found an abundant supply in a small hollow between sand dunes at a location which Giles subsequently named Queen Victoria Spring, and the party was saved. After a rest of nine days the journey was resumed on 6 October, still heading west. Ten days later the expedition was attacked by a large number of Aborigines and Giles fired on them. On 4 November they met a white stockman at Tootra out-camp, east of Bindi Bindi, Western Australia. Their course was west to Walebing Station, then south-west and on 11 November they arrived at New Norcia where they were welcomed by Bishop Salvado. On 17 November 1875 the party arrived at Guildford, and at Perth the next day, where they received an enthusiastic reception.

Giles stayed for two months at Perth. Tietkens and Jess Young, another member of the expedition, went back to Adelaide by sea, and on 13 January 1876 Giles began the return journey (fifth expedition) taking a course generally about north of the last journey. They arrived at Adelaide in September 1876, after a good journey during which the camels were found to be invaluable.

== Late life and legacy ==

Giles worked as a land classifier in the Western District of Victoria from 1877 to 1879.

In 1880 he published &quot;The Journal of a Forgotten Expedition&quot;, an account of his second and third expeditions, then, in 1889, appeared &quot;Australia Twice Traversed: The Romance of Exploration&quot; in two substantial volumes. This gives an account of his five expeditions. He made a number of other minor journeys and his last years were spent as a clerk in the Inspector of Mines&#x27; office at Coolgardie, where his great knowledge of the interior was always available for prospectors. Giles was made a fellow and awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1880 and was made &quot;Cavaliere dell&#x27;Ordine della Corona d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy) by King Vittorio Emanuele II.

Despite his explorations, the various Australian governments at the time turned their respective backs on his achievements once they had been completed, and refused to patronise any further exploits or give him much in the way of financial reward. Governor Sir William Jervois claimed on 11 October 1881, &quot;I am informed that he gambles and that his habits are not always strictly sober&quot;.

After a short illness Giles died of pneumonia at his nephew&#x27;s house in Coolgardie on 13 November 1897 and was buried at the Coolgardie Cemetery. He was unmarried. It was reported at the time: 

H. H. Finlayson in &quot;The Red Centre: man and beast in the heart of Australia&quot; (1935) said of Giles:
In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.

Mount Giles, the third highest mountain in the Northern Territory; Lake Giles, 160 km (100 mi) north of Southern Cross, Western Australia; and the Giles Weather Station, near the Western Australian-South Australian border, were named after him.

==Plant names==
The unrelated Christopher Giles (c. 1841–1917) assisted Giles&#x27;s 1872–73 and 1873–74 expeditions, collecting plants for von Mueller in the region of Charlotte Waters. Specimens collected by E. Giles are cared for at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

* The genus &quot;Gilesia&quot;, which contains one species, &quot;Gilesia biniflora&quot; , the western tar-vine, is named for both Christopher and Ernest Giles.
* &quot;Cyperus gilesii&quot; and &quot;Panicum gilesii&quot; are usually listed as honouring Ernest Giles, but the type details for both species are given by George Bentham only as &quot;Central Australia. Charlotte Waters, Giles&quot;.
* Christopher Giles was honoured in the species &quot;Eremophila christopheri&quot;, the dolomite fuchsia bush, whereas the desert fuchsia, &quot;Eremophila gilesii&quot;, which is widespread across the region, honours Ernest.
* A species of wattle, &quot;Acacia gilesiana&quot;, is named for Ernest Giles.

<text>Northwood is a city and eastern suburb in Wood County, Ohio, United States, within the Toledo metropolitan area. The population was 5,160 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Northwood was originally Ross Township. It was the northernmost township in Wood County from its establishment on April 18, 1874 until December 1, 1962. Farms, gardens, orchards, and railroads covered the area located just south of east Toledo. In 1898 Edward Ford&#x27;s glass factory was built along the Maumee River, which ultimately led to the incorporation of the village of Rossford in 1939 within the western portion of the township. Ross Township was then divided so that Rossford Township would serve as a barrier between Rossford and the remaining Ross Township. On December 1, 1962, Ross Township ceased to exist when it became incorporated as the city of Northwood, so aptly named because of its location at the top of Wood County. With its departure, Wood County dropped its number of townships from 20 to 19.

The original boundary of Ross Township can be observed as follows: beginning at the southeastern corner of Northwood, thence westward along the southern border to Rossford, thence westward along the line of Elm Tree Street to the Maumee River, thence northeastward and eastward along the Lucas County border until the Ottawa County border, and thence southward to the point of beginning.

<doc id="129986" wikidata="Q998647" url="?curid=129986" title="Perrysburg, Ohio">
<text>Perrysburg is a city located in Wood County, Ohio, United States, along the south side of the Maumee River. The population was 25,041 at the 2020 census. Part of the Toledo metropolitan area, the city is southwest of Toledo. Perrysburg served as the county seat from 1822 to 1868.

Perrysburg was surveyed and platted by a federal survey team in summer 1816. A local legend has held that it was designed by noted architect Charles Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, after he planned Washington, DC, but this has not been supported by fact.

==History==
===Early history===
Perrysburg lies near the center of the Twelve Mile Square Reservation, a tract of land ceded in 1795 to the United States by the Odawa people following their defeat in the Northwest Indian Wars. They had occupied this territory since the turn of the 18th century, after having settled in the region of the French trading post at Fort Detroit. Also known as the Ottawa, they had controlled much of the territory along the Maumee River in present-day northwestern Ohio.

In 1810, early European-American settlers here were Major Amos Spafford (1753–1818), his wife Olive (1756–1823), and their four children. In 1796, Spafford, a native of Connecticut, was a surveyor for the Connecticut Land Company. He drew the first map laying out Cleveland and named the city. He left there in 1810 following appointment as US Customs Collector and postmaster for the new port at the Foot of the Rapids of the Miami of the Lake Maumee River. Two years later, 67 families lived in the area, but most fled at the outbreak of the War of 1812.

After the war and the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs, which extinguished the Ottawa claim to this area, Spafford returned to the area. He settled on a 160-acre land grant, signed by President James Monroe, on River Tract #64 in Waynesfield Township. Other veterans who received land grants for their service during that war also settled in this area.

===War of 1812===
When the War of 1812 progressed toward Northwest Ohio, General William Henry Harrison ordered the construction of the fort, beginning in February 1813. Harrison was General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s former aide-de-camp. Later he was elected as the country&#x27;s ninth president. The installation was named Fort Meigs in honor of Ohio&#x27;s fourth governor, Return Jonathan Meigs. Fort Meigs was constructed on a bluff above the Maumee River, and built from a design by army engineer Captain Eleazer D. Wood, for whom the county would be named. Two critical battles with the British were fought at the fort during the War of 1812.

Early settlers in the area fled to Huron during the War of 1812. They returned to settle in the floodplain below Fort Meigs, calling the settlement Orleans. They moved to higher ground after being flooded out.

Alexander Bourne led a surveying team to plan and plat Perrysburg. He was appointed to that position by Edward Tiffin, Surveyor General of the United States. This survey was performed in late June and early July 1816, by surveyors Joseph Wampler and William Brookfield under the auspices of Bourne and Josiah Meigs, Surveyor General of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri.

Some postings on the Internet have claimed that Charles Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, noted designer of Washington, DC, had also surveyed and platted Perrysburg, Ohio. Prior to the city&#x27;s 200th anniversary celebration, the Historical Society hired former engineers to assess this claim. The researchers studied local, state and federal archives, but found no support for this position.

===Growth of Perrysburg===

The town soon became a center for shipbuilding and commerce on Lake Erie. It was named after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, naval commander during the War of 1812 and hero of the Battle of Lake Erie. From 1822 to 1868 Perrysburg served as the county seat.

In 1833, Perrysburg contained a courthouse, jail, schoolhouse, two stores, two taverns, two physicians, two lawyers, about 60 houses, and 250 inhabitants.

Henry Bibb spent the winter of 1837–38 in Perrysburg following his first escape from slavery. He was adopted by the free Black community, which included many fugitive slaves. Bibb was able to obtain gainful employment and managed to save $15 over the course of the winter, which he put towards his plan to rescue his wife and children from slavery. Bibb&#x27;s knowledge of Perrysburg helped him in a subsequent escape attempt, when he was able to allay suspicions by claiming to be a free resident of Perrysburg and accurately answering questions about the town&#x27;s residents.

In 1854, an epidemic of cholera devastated the population. It had spread with residents and travelers along the waterways because of the lack of adequate sanitation. Perryville closed down for two months in that summer, trying to contain the epidemic at a time when people did not understand how the disease was transmitted. More than 100 people died. Other towns along the Maumee River also suffered high losses from the epidemic. Providence, Ohio was abandoned. It had suffered a disastrous fire less than a decade before.

The railroad arrived in 1859 with the completion of the Dayton and Michigan Railroad, later part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. the line is part of the Toledo Subdivision of CSX, though it hosts no passenger service.

===Modern Perrysburg===
On October 12, 1984 President Ronald Reagan made a whistle stop in Perrysburg while traveling in the historic &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot; railroad car. He drew a crowd of over 20,000.

<text>Rossford is a city in Wood County, Ohio, United States, located along the Maumee River in the Toledo metropolitan area. The population was 6,299 at the 2020 census. The town includes the intersection of Interstate 75 and the Ohio Turnpike. Rossford Public Library and WPAY serve the community.

Rossford was founded as a company town by Edward Ford of the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company. In 1898, Ford purchased along the Maumee River to build the Edward Ford Plate Glass Company.

As workers came to the factory, Ford named the resulting town &quot;Rossford&quot; by combining the last name of his second wife, Caroline Ross, with his. Shortly after the foundation of the plant, Ford built the Ford Club next to the plant, so workers could socialize. In 1998, Rossford&#x27;s centennial, the town built a memorial next to the Ford Club in memory of the foundation of the town. The centennial was marked by a street fair, parade, concert, and several other accommodations.

Edward Ford&#x27;s father John Baptiste Ford earlier founded Ford City, Pennsylvania as a plate glass company town.

<text>Upper Sandusky is a city in and the county seat of Wyandot County, Ohio, United States, along the upper Sandusky River. The city lies approximately south of Toledo and north of Columbus. The population was 6,698 at the 2020 census.

The city was founded in 1843 and named for an earlier Wyandot village of the same name, which was located nearby. It was named &quot;Upper&quot; because it is located near the headwaters of the Sandusky River, which flows into Lake Erie.

==History==
Upper Sandusky was a 19th-century Wyandot town named for its location at the headwaters of the Sandusky River in northwestern Ohio. This was the primary Wyandot town during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), and was sometimes also known as Half-King&#x27;s Town, after Dunquat, the Wyandot &quot;Half-King&quot;. The town and the surrounding settlements, like Captain Pipe&#x27;s Town, were closely allied with the British at Fort Detroit. During the Crawford expedition of 1782, Pennsylvania militiamen sought to destroy the town after the Wyandot began killing American settlers in the region, but were defeated en route.

After the war, in September 1783, a number of Native Americans met at Upper Sandusky and formed the Western Confederacy, a confederation intended to resist U.S. expansion into the Northwest Territory. The Northwest Indian War followed.

In the War of 1812, the village became the site of Fort Feree (or Ferree) on a bluff overlooking the flood plain of the Sandusky River The Fort was built in late 1812 by Pennsylvania militia led by Lieutenant Colonel Joel Ferree, by order of General William Henry Harrison.

Upper Sandusky became part of the Wyandot Grand Reserve in the Upper Sandusky River area created by the Treaty of Fort Meigs in 1817. Prior to that, it was in northwestern Ohio Indian country above the Greenville Treaty line of 1795. Numerous indigenous Wyandot kept their settlements here until 1842, when they were driven out under the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to what became Wyandotte County, Kansas. A small community of free Black people also lived in the old village.

A new town of Upper Sandusky was platted nearby the forcibly abandoned Wyandot village in 1843 and the first colonizer&#x27;s house was built in 1845. The first building in town was the county jail in 1846. It was designated as the seat of Wyandot County in 1848.

==Bell waterline project==
In the early 1980s, the Cherokee Nation, under the direction of Wilma Mankiller (then the director of the Cherokee Nation Community Development Department, later principal chief) and her colleague (and future husband) Charlie Soap, put together a project to build a 16-mile waterline to Bell, where many of the residents still had no indoor plumbing. The tribe provided equipment and technological assistance, while Bell residents contributed most of the labor on a volunteer basis. The project drew widespread attention and launched Mankiller&#x27;s political career. The project is the subject of a 2013 feature film, &quot;The Cherokee Word for Water&quot;.

==School closure and consolidation==
In June 2010, after systemic auditing by the Oklahoma state Board of Education, the 200-year-old school district was demanded to be closed by the state. This was due to declared financial impropriety discovered during the auditing process. The Kindergarten through Eighth grade district, composed 97% by Cherokee children, was merged with two separate district. The Stilwell and Belfonte school districts will take fiscal responsibility for the students from the Bell district, and the former Bell school building will remain open.

The Oklahoma governor and legislature proclaimed Stilwell as the &quot;Strawberry Capital of the World” in 1949, but the role of strawberries in the local economy has diminished significantly since then. Today, residents of Stilwell are among the poorest and most impoverished in the United States. Stilwell also serves as a gateway to Lake Tenkiller and Adair Park, formerly called Adair State Park before it was defunded.

==History==
Stilwell&#x27;s history began in 1838 as an end point of the Trail of Tears, with the ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of thousands of Indigenous people to the Stilwell area. The trail was called &quot;nu na da ul tsun yi&quot; in Cherokee language, or &quot;the place where they cried&quot;. The U.S. federal government set up a “disbandment depot” outside what is present-day Stilwell in the early months of 1839 to distribute food and supplies to the newly arrived Indigenous people. Those with resources quickly left to settle across the rest of Indian Territory, but the sickest and poorest stayed in the Stilwell area, close to the safety of the depot.

The U.S. government opened the Stilwell area to American settlers in 1893. The Kansas City Southern Railway built a rail line through what is present-day Stilwell in 1896. The municipality developed because of the rail line and it was incorporated as a town on January 2, 1897. The town was named after Arthur Stilwell, founder of the Kansas City Southern Railway. By the turn of the twentieth century, white settlers outnumbered the Cherokee people.

As early as 1901, Stilwell and Westville, in anticipation of Oklahoma statehood, vied for the role of county seat. When Adair County was formed in 1907, Westville was identified as the county seat, due partly to its location at the intersection of two major railroads: the Kansas City Southern Railway and the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. After three intensely contested elections, however, Oklahoma governor Charles Haskell proclaimed Stilwell as the county seat on May 6, 1910.

In 1944, during World War II, a prisoner of war (P.O.W.) camp was established south of Stilwell. The camp housed 200 axis soldiers.

Stilwell was served by Kansas City Southern&#x27;s &quot;Southern Belle&quot; passenger rail line until November 2, 1969. The rail line connected Stilwell with daily trains to New Orleans and Kansas City, with stops in Northwest Arkansas, Joplin, Shreveport, Baton Rouge and many other cities in-between. A second passenger line, &quot;The Flying Crow&quot;, also stopped in the town. The town&#x27;s train station fell into disrepair due to vandalism and was closed on February 22, 1971. The station building itself was restored in 2004 though passenger rail service was not.

During the Great Depression, strawberries emerged a major crop and cornerstone of the local economy. In 1948, a strawberry festival was organized, and in 1949, the state governor and legislature proclaimed Stilwell as &quot;Strawberry Capital of the World.&quot; Stilwell&#x27;s strawberry festival became an annual event. Over time, the strawberry industry weakened, cultivated acreage decreased and the role of strawberries in the local economy dissipated. Despite this, Stilwell still holds a strawberry festival annually and the town&#x27;s 2015 festival had approximately 30,000 people in attendance. Stilwell&#x27;s 2022 strawberry festival featured the largest parade in its 75-year history with over 100 floats.

==Geography==

Stilwell is west of the Arkansas state line and east of Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Stilwell is at the intersection of U.S. Highway 59 and State Highway 51. Sallisaw and Little Lee creeks are nearby. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.63%) is water.

Earthquakes are often felt in Stilwell due to oil and gas production activities in central Oklahoma.

According to Jennifer Patterson, Oklahoma State University Adair County Extension Director, Stilwell is good for growing strawberries because of its rocky, acidic soil and good drainage. Below the ground in Stilwell lays chert rock, which breaks down into the soil and purportedly gives strawberries a unique taste.

Agriculture has been the mainstay of the local economy for a century. Strawberry farming was particularly successful during the Great Depression and World War II. At its peak, the town had about 2,000 acres of farmland devoted to strawberries. Over time, the role of strawberries diminished significantly and only seven strawberry farms remained as of 2022. Ranching became important around 1960 and the town&#x27;s local industries were largely an outgrowth of agriculture. Employers included Tyson Foods, the Stilwell Canning Company and its successor, Mrs. Smith&#x27;s Bakery/Stilwell Foods, Cherokee Nation Industries, and Facet Industries. As of 2022, the minimum wage in Stilwell is $7.25 per hour. For full-time students, tipped employees, farm workers, seasonal workers and people with disabilities, the minimum wage is $2.13 per hour.

==Health==
Scientists have suggested Stilwell&#x27;s environment may be contaminated with unsafe levels of mercury, and as of 2021, studies are ongoing. Rainfall samples collected over a 13-year span at an air quality station near Stilwell found abnormally high levels of mercury. The study found an annual average mercury concentration of nearly 11 ng/L, about one and a half times higher than the national average. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality warned residents against eating certain fish from Stilwell&#x27;s city lake in 2019, furthering suspicion that the town&#x27;s aquifer could be contaminated.

Stilwell was labelled &quot;the early death capital of the world&quot; after a detailed report by the National Center for Health Statistics surfaced in 2018 indicating the life expectancy of the town&#x27;s residents was just 56.3 years. The agency stated the report was their &quot;most detailed local health data ever released&quot; and the life expectancy of Stilwell residents was lower than that in every jurisdiction in North America, Europe or Asia, with a similar life-expectancy to the poorest regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The Cherokee Nation disputed the report initially before further studies were done, stating the data &quot;has to be flawed.” In February 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated they would soon release their own report increasing the town&#x27;s life expectancy figure to 74 years. The CDC stated that the National Center for Health Statistics report was &quot;flawed&quot; because 90 deceased individuals with P.O. box addresses in Stilwell that lived outside city limits were included in the report, producing inaccurate data. Despite the correction, Stilwell&#x27;s Roberts Reed Culver Funeral Home reports half of all funerals performed in 2018 were for people in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.

16% of adults in Stilwell have diabetes, 27% smoke, and 42% are obese, according to the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. Health services include the Cherokee Nation Wilma Mankiller Health Clinic, the Stilwell Memorial Hospital, the Oklahoma Department of Public Health, and the Stilwell Nursing Home. According to the Census Bureau, 28.5% of all residents, and 60% of those in Stilwell who are unemployed do not have health insurance.

Stilwell city council passed a mask mandate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on July 8, 2020, taking advice from a local infectious disease specialist. Just 10 days later, city council struck down the mandate advising face masks would no longer required after receiving &quot;extremely hostile&quot; responses and threats against officials.

Stilwell was briefly served by the Flaming Rainbow University, a private, baccalaureate university between 1971 - 1989. Despite being dubbed a &quot;non-traditional university&quot;, it obtained accreditation from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education in 1974 and was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. According to its founder, David Hilligoss, the school was created to &quot;Provide an education to&quot; &quot;Isolated Indians and rural whites in this beautifully treed and poverty stricken section of the state&quot;. The Flaming Rainbow University was named in honor of a Sioux medicine man&#x27;s vision, which featured a rainbow symbolizing knowledge and its power. The university lost all accreditation in 1989 and closed.

==Government==
Stilwell has a mayor-council form of government, with five members on the city council.

The murder rate in Stilwell is 10 per 100,000 people, double the national average. In response to the town&#x27;s high crime rate, Stilwell has a year-round curfew in place that prohibits people under the age of 18 from being in public past midnight.

Three bombs were detonated in Stilwell on January 23, 2012. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Adair County Sheriffs, and Stilwell city police investigated the explosions. The investigation concluded the explosions were intentional and were caused by pipe bombs.

Approximately southeast of Stilwell is Elohim City, an armed, evangelical, white supremacist compound with alleged ties to the Oklahoma City Bombing. The enclave has ties to myriad criminal, terror and racist organizations, including the Aryan Resistance Movement. An Associated Press investigation from 2003 concluded that white supremacists from Elohim City played a “major role” in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed 168 people. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the compound “the meeting ground for America’s most sinister extremists”.

<text>Watts is a town in northern Adair County, Oklahoma, United States. It was named for John Watts, also known as Young Tassel, a Chickamauga Cherokee chief, who died in 1802. The population was 324 at the 2010 census, an increase of 2.5 percent over the figure of 316 recorded in 2000.

==History==
Watts is near the site of Old Fort Wayne, which was founded in 1838. The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) built a line through the area in 1895-96, and in 1912, relocated its division point from Stillwell to Watts Switch, one mile north of a community called Ballard. Most of Ballard&#x27;s merchants moved to the new community of Watts, along with gamblers, land speculators, construction workers and KCS employees.

Frank C. Adair and Frank Howard organized the Guarantee Bank. After statehood, Adair also became the first sheriff of Adair County. Several other businesses sprang up in Watts. Hotels and rooming houses catered to the construction workers and railroad travelers. A lumberyard moved from Ballard, a hardware store and two livery stables were not far behind. At some point in these early days, three doctors opened practices in town. No doubt their patients supported the two drug stores in town. Prosperity had apparently come to Watts, because A. W. Willey opened a bakery and a man called &quot;Cigar&quot; Smith moved from Stilwell to manufacture cigars. The local newspaper, the &quot;Watts Watchman&quot;, began publication sometime in the 1910s. A post office was established inside a store March 30, 1912.

The town began to decline even before the Great Depression took hold. KCS, like many American railroads, fell on hard times between World War I and World War II. During this period, KCS began dismantling its operations in Watts. It removed the roundhouse, coal chute, water pump station, icehouse, and water tower, as they were no longer needed. The depot, razed in the 1980s, was the last thing to go. Idled workers had to find work elsewhere.

No census data were reported at either the time of statehood or the 1910 U.S. Census. An unofficial estimate of 300 residents was made in 1913. The first official count was 396 at the 1920 census. This declined to 353 in 1930, then reached its bottom of 267 in 1950, before rising to 326 in 1970, and going back to 303 in 1990.

By 2000, Watts had only two feed mill businesses. Most of the employed residents commuted to work in other towns, especially Siloam Springs, Arkansas, which was only north.

==Geography==

Watts is located on U.S. Highway 59 north of Westville.

<text>Westville is a town in Adair County, Oklahoma, located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. Westville lies at the junction of U.S. Highways 59 and 62, and approximately 13 miles north of Stilwell, the county seat.

==History==
Before statehood, Westville was a community in the Goingsnake District of the Cherokee Nation. The town was founded in 1895, when the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (later acquired by the Kansas City Southern Railroad) was constructing a rail line from Kansas City to the Gulf Coast. The Westville post office was established on November 18, 1895. The town name honored Jim West, who lived one mile south of nearby Cincinnati, Arkansas, and whose son, Jim West Jr., was an attorney for the Kansas City Southern Railway.

The original plat for the included 175 acres. Expansion came soon with the development of the William D. Williams addition and the Pat Dore Addition.

In 1902 a second rail line, the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway, which ran from Fayetteville, Arkansas, to Okmulgee, Oklahoma, began operations through Westville, giving the town an enviable position at the rail junction. That line, later owned by St. Louis – San Francisco Railway, discontinued service to Westville in the late 1940s.

When Adair County was formed in 1907, Westville was identified as the county seat, due partly to its location at the intersection of two major railroads: the Kansas City Southern Railway and the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway. The county seat was moved to Stilwell in 1910.

<text>Amorita is a town in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 38 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==
Amorita was founded in September 1901. It is speculated that &quot;Amorita&quot; was likely named after the wife of railroad owner, Charles E. Ingersoll. At the time of its founding, the area was part of the much larger Woods county. It did not become part of present-day Alfalfa county until the time of statehood in 1907.

The town was established in Byron township in 1901 approximately two miles north of the existing town of Byron, by what was then known as the Choctaw Northern Railroad, later owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. In that year, the railroad became the county&#x27;s first, connecting Amorita to the other Alfalfa county towns of Aline, Augusta, Ingersoll, Lambert, Driftwood, and on into Kansas. City lots were sold when the railroad completed its rail line through the county in November 1901.

Although the initial sale of lots in November was small, within a month a butcher shop and a coal and grain business were established, and by February of the following year, two grain elevators were also opened. Farming was the predominant economic activity in the area at the time. The town was temporarily given a competitive advantage as a transportation hub because nearby Byron did not acquire its own competing railroad access (the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway) until October 1902.

Residents voted to incorporate their town in May 1912. In 1919 a fifty-thousand-dollar bond was approved to construct a new school building for the consolidated schools of Amorita and two other districts. In 1921, voters of both Byron and Amorita jointly approved the construction of power lines extending from Kansas to supply electricity to both their towns.

The railroad abandoned its line through the town in 1936. In the 1960s, the Amorita school was consolidated into a single entity along with the nearby districts of Burlington, Byron, and Driftwood, which was located in Burlington. 

==Geography==
Amorita lies along State Highway 58, between Byron to the south and the Kansas border to the north.

The town has a total area of , all land, with a population density of 153 people per square mile.

<text>Burlington is a town in northwestern Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 152 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Originally the town of Burlington was named &quot;Drumm&quot;, for prominent cattle rancher Major Andrew Drumm. Major Drumm had operated the 150,000 acre U Ranch in the area from 1874 until 1888 on land leased from the Cherokees and was a founder of the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association. Drumm was also the founder of the Andrew Drumm Institute in Independence Missouri.

Its post office was established under the name Drumm on June 6, 1906. But when the initial plans in July 1907 to rename the town &quot;Wheaton&quot; fell through, the town&#x27;s name was officially changed to Burlington on August 21 of that year, which it remains to this day.

A member-owned agricultural cooperative called Burlington Grain Company was formed in 1916. It currently operates as Burlington Cooperative Association. The elevator at Burlington has a capacity of 1,774,000 bushels. A second facility in nearby Amorita has storage space of 342,000 bushels.

Alfalfa County&#x27;s first consolidated school was organized in Burlington in April 1908. The following year, the first school building was completed. By 1913, it had 150 students and four teachers. A two-story brick building was constructed in 1923. In 1948 a new gymnasium was added. In the 1960s, the schools of Burlington, Driftwood, Byron, and Amorita consolidated into a single school district, located in Burlington. In 1963 a new school building was built. Many additions have been added since that time – the most recent being a band room and agriculture shop addition in 2014. Also in 2014, there were approximately 150 (pre-K-12th) students.

<text>Byron is a town in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 35 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
Byron was named by Postmaster V. C. Spurrier, who received a postal designation on April 27, 1898, for a town to be named Byron - after his relative, Byron Spurrier, who owned a store there. Originally located in Woods County, Byron became part of the newly organized Alfalfa County in 1907, at the time of statehood.

While the town was listed in an 1898 state gazetteer, its lack of railroad access caused the new settlement to develop slowly at first. However, in April 1901, W. C. Edwards purchased land for a new townsite about a mile south and one-half mile east of the original settlement and within the course of a month the existing business buildings were moved from the old to the new town site and a new bank, meat market, and lumberyard had been opened. In April 1902, the Woods County commission incorporated the town of Byron. In anticipation of the arrival of the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway line that ran south from Kansas through the county, a grain elevator was constructed in October. Upon completion of the line to Byron on October 21 of that year, &quot;the town celebrated with a huge bonfire, and the railroad laborers were treated to lemonade, cigars, and locally grown apples.&quot;

After the arrival of the railroad, Byron flourished economically. The town&#x27;s population reached it peak of 286 by 1909. Notable businesses included the Byron State Bank, two newspapers - the Byron Republican and the Byron Promoter - and both a Christian and a Methodist church. It also sported two hardware stores, three general stores, a blacksmith, and a flour mill.

Area farms produced both wheat and alfalfa and the town became an important market and shipping point for grain and livestock. In 1929, one of the state&#x27;s four warm-water fish hatcheries was established to produce sport fish for state lakes and farm ponds, which remains to this day. However, Byron began a slow economic decline as falling agricultural prices and the Great Depression both took their toll. By 1930, the census counted only 197 residents.

An interesting political development briefly brought Byron into the news, when in 1935 five women unseated five male incumbents on the town board. They proceeded to pay off the town&#x27;s debt and began to produce income through the sale of electricity to its residents.

Nonetheless, in 1942, the railroad abandoned its line through town. Through the 1940s and 1950s, only a half-dozen businesses were still in operation. A declining rural population prompted the combining of Byron&#x27;s school with those of nearby Driftwood. Then in the 1960s, Burlington, Amorita, Byron, and Driftwood schools consolidated into a single school located in Burlington. Its population continued to fall to 131 in 1950, 72 in 1970, and only 57 in 1990. Byron ended the twentieth century with a population of 45, and by 2010, the U.S. Census counted just 35 residents.

<text>Cherokee is the largest city within, and county seat of, Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,476 at the 2020 census, a decline of 1.5 percent from 2010.

==History==

===Settlement and founding===
After the land opening of 1893, developers wanted to attract railroads to build through the former Cherokee Outlet to transport the large wheat crops to markets. The Kansas and Oklahoma Construction Company, through its subsidiary the Cherokee Investment Company, bought along its route, platted the town which it named Cherokee, and held a sale of lots on February 9, 1901. Cherokee officially incorporated in July 1901. Two years later, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad (later owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) constructed a line through Cherokee. To gain access to the railroad, residents of the nearby community of Erwin, which already had a post office by that name, relocated to Cherokee. Erwin then ceased to exist and Cherokee took its place. This post office was renamed &quot;Cherokee&quot; in March, 1903.

By 1905, a second railroad, the Denver, Enid, and Gulf, built a line through the community. The community was soon transformed into a dominant regional center for agricultural services, banking, wholesale-retail trade, and transportation, providing markets and services to the surrounding smaller communities, such as Ingersoll, Burlington, Driftwood, Byron, and Amorita. The town grew around its twin railroad depots, and by 1909 Cherokee had three banks, three newspapers, three mills (flour, alfalfa, and planning), a concrete block plant, and a school desk factory. There were also Baptist, Catholic, Christian, Friends, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches.

Alfalfa County itself - named after Governor &#x27;Alfalfa Bill&#x27; Murray - was created at the time of statehood in 1907, when the state reorganized several counties out of part of what was once the much larger Woods County. Cherokee&#x27;s status as the official county seat of Alfalfa County was confirmed in January 1909. The city&#x27;s incorporation was reconfirmed in March of that same year.

===Years of prosperity===
The Masonic hospital was relocated from nearby Aline in 1918. A new high school building was completed in 1921. There were a variety of industries to provide employment, including: Cherokee Mills Company which produced flour, the McDowell Standard Battery Company&#x27;s factory, an ice plant, and a planing mill. With a successful bond election, a new county courthouse was completed in 1924. The 1920s also saw a variety of other public projects, including street improvements and public water supply. In addition, oil-field activity within the county during the late 1920s and the mid-1930s contributed to the city&#x27;s prosperity, with a half-dozen oil companies maintaining storage facilities near the railroad yards. At the onset of the Great Depression, Cherokee had become &quot;an important urban and trading center.&quot;

Cherokee was better situated than most communities to weather the downturn of the depression. With its many hotels, including: The Hotel Cherokee, Hotel Henderson, the Ideal Hotel, Jobe&#x27;s Hotel, and the Orient Hotel, the city&#x27;s business owners worked hard to promote the town as a convention destination. They were successful in attracting a variety of organizations including the Oklahoma State Holiness Association, the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, and the 4-H Clubs in 1933, the Baptist Association and the Tri-County Masonic Association in 1935, and the Oklahoma Press Association Regional Meeting and the Northwestern Oklahoma Baptist Association Annual Dinner in 1936.

By 1936, the city boasted eleven gasoline stations, five automobile dealerships, five garages, plus three lumber yards. There were also four grain elevators in operation, plus an ice cream factory. In addition, Cherokee had nine restaurants, five groceries, two bakeries, two banks, two hardware stores, two department stores, as well as approximately two dozen other retail businesses. Two newspapers, the &quot;Alfalfa County News&quot; and the &quot;Cherokee Messenger&quot;, informed the public.

The Works Progress Administration (WPA) completed construction of a National Guard Armory in 1937, along with a public library in 1939. Its proximity to the Great Salt Plains area attracted sporting activities including bird-hunting excursions, which boosted the economy by bringing in hundreds of travelers. Construction of a dam on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River begun in 1938 - completed in 1941 - would create the Great Salt Plains Lake, making the area even more desirable as a hunting and tourism spot.

===1950s onward===
The population of Cherokee would peak in 1950, at 2,635, according to the U.S. Census, and continue to trend downward at each enumeration from that decade onward. By 1970, 125 businesses remained operating in a city of 2,119 inhabitants. The county took over the operation of the former Masonic hospital in 1976. A new industrial park was established in that same decade. By 1990, the population had fallen to below 2000 - to 1,787 - for the first time since the city was recognized as the county seat. The Santa Fe Railroad maintained its trunk line running north–south through the mid-1990s, and the city&#x27;s east–west line, by then part of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, ceased operations shortly thereafter.

The city of Cherokee has a city manager form of government. It maintains three parks plus a swimming pool. Cherokee continues to be the home of one of three public school districts (in addition to Burlington and Timberlake) to educate the county&#x27;s children. Cherokee has one high school. The school mascot is the Cherokee Chiefs.

===National Register of Historic Places designations===
Cherokee is the home of several sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), including the Cherokee Friends Church, constructed in 1919, and the Cherokee IOOF Lodge No. 219, built in 1931. Other Cherokee sites listed with the NRHP are the Farmers&#x27; Federation Elevator (ca. 1917), the Alfalfa County Courthouse (ca. 1921), the Cherokee National Guard Armory (ca. 1936), and the Hotel Cherokee (ca. 1929) - which currently serves as the county history center.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Cherokee has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with influences from a cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;)


Please note: Many temperatures claiming to be above are &quot;unverifiable claims&quot; due to &quot;improper equipment at site to confirm&quot; during the event. The hottest verifiable temperature ever recorded for the state of Oklahoma is The world&#x27;s hottest verifiable temperature remains , recorded on 10 July 1913 at Furnace Creek Ranch, in Death Valley in the United States.

<text>Goltry is an incorporated rural small town in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 249 at the 2010 census.
Located there are a town hall, a post office, a farmer&#x27;s co-op with gas service, a fire department, and a bank, with several blocks of homes.

==History==
Originally part of the Cherokee Outlet, the area of present-day Goltry was not open to non-Indian settlement until September 1893. After the opening, a settlement called Karoma emerged on the John Streich farm, approximately one and one-half miles southeast of present Goltry. The Arkansas Valley and Western Railway (later part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, or Frisco, system) constructed a line in 1904 from east to west apart the former Woods County that became present-day Alfalfa County, after the creation of the latter 1907. The people of Karoma moved most of their homes and businesses closer to the railroad. In 1904, John Linden’s townsite company surveyed and platted the town on 240 acres. The new community was incorporated and named for Enid resident Charles Goltry, who owned the land and whose milling company constructed a grain elevator there. Many of the early settlers were Germans from Russia, in addition to a number from the then German state of Bohemia and from Switzerland. At one time, Goltry was home to two German Mennonite churches. The remaining Mennonite church, the &quot;Pleasant View Church of God in Christ Mennonite&quot;, was organized in 1905, by settlers who began to arrive in 1900. As late as 2000, one-third of the town&#x27;s residents claimed German ancestry. Goltry is also the birthplace of Wally Parks (1913-2007), the founder of the National Hot Rod Association.

<text>Helena is a town in southeastern Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States. Residents pronounce the town&#x27;s name with a long E: &quot;Heh-LEE&#x27;-nuh.&quot; The population was 1,403 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In June 1915, Helen S. Monroe received a postal designation for Helena. Monroe became the first postmaster and the town&#x27;s namesake.

Shortly after the Cherokee Outlet opened to settlement, numerous small communities emerged in what was then southwestern Woods County (now Alfalfa county). When the Arkansas Valley and Western Railway survey bypassed the nearby settlement of Carwile, those residents began migrating closer to the proposed railroad, near where H. H. Anderson had established a store around 1896. The townsite was laid out nearby in 1902, and the village was incorporated the following year, by which time the population was 160.

The Woods County High School, one of only two in Oklahoma Territory at that time, was constructed in 1903 and opened in 1904 with 400 students. On January 6, 1904, the Arkansas Valley and Western Railway (part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway system) reached Helena. Growing fast, by mid-1905 it was estimated that 700 residents supported two banks, two schools, two newspapers, four grain elevators, a flour mill, and two lumberyards. By 1909, there were Baptist, Christian, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches. The 1910 census showed 760 residents, a number which had increased to 776 by 1940.

===Mammoth===
In July 2013, the remains of a mammoth were found two miles northwest of Helena by workers of Access Midstream, a natural gas provider, on land owned by brothers Dr. Michael Thorp and Tom Thorp. Oklahoma State University geographer Carlos Cordova, and geography doctoral student Tom Cox excavated the site from September 2013 until October 2013. Oklahoma State University has plans to display the mammoth, which was donated by the Thorp&#x27;s.

The Choctaw Northern Railroad (later owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific

By 1909, Lambert had 127 inhabitants and four churches, a hotel, a bank, an elevator, and two grain buyers. In addition, a half-dozen stores served the local community. Its population peaked in 1920 at 130, having since declined over the decades to the population of five reported in the 2020 Census.

Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Farmers&#x27; Bank&quot; had the peculiar distinction of having been robbed twice, first in 1904 and then again in 1919.

<text>Atoka is a city in and the county seat of Atoka County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 3,195 as of the 2020 Census, a 2.4% increase over the 3,107 reported at the 2010 census, which was itself an increase of 4.0 percent from the figure of 2,988 in 2000.

The city was settled by the Choctaw and named in 1867 by a Baptist missionary for Chief Atoka, whose name means &quot;ball ground&quot; in English.

==History==
Atoka was founded by the Choctaw Indians in the 1850s, and named for Captain Atoka, a leader of the Choctaw Nation and the signatory of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which began the process of re-locating the Choctaw people from Mississippi to Oklahoma in 1830. The name &quot;Atoka&quot; is derived from the Choctaw word &#x27; (or &#x27;), which means &quot;ball ground&quot; in English. He is believed to be buried near the town of Farris. Atoka is the site of the oldest Catholic parish in the Indian Territory, the oldest chapter of the Freemasons in Oklahoma, and the oldest chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star in Oklahoma.

===Battle of Middle Boggy Depot===

A small Civil War confrontation occurred on February 13, 1864, north of Atoka. Early in 1864, Colonel William A. Philips set out with some 1,500 Union troops from Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, to cut a swath through Confederate Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Their purpose was to break Confederate control over the Indian Territory and gain the support and possibly recruits from the Native Americans.
&quot;I take you with me to clean out the Indian Nation south of the river and drive away and destroy rebels. Let me say a few words to you that you are not to forget ... Those who are still in arms are rebels, who ought to die. Do not kill a prisoner after he has surrendered. But I do not ask you to take prisoners. I ask you to make your footsteps severe and terrible. Muskogees! (Creeks) the time has now come when you are to remember the authors of all your sufferings; those who started a needless and wicked war ... Stand by me faithfully and we will soon have peace ...&quot; -- Colonel William A. Philips, to his men before beginning the campaign
Along the way, Colonel Phillips sent out an advance of about 350 men toward Boggy Depot, a large Confederate supply base located on the Texas Road with the intention of capturing the outpost. While en route, his command encountered a small Confederate camp on the banks of the Middle Boggy River, made up of around 90 Confederate soldiers.

In the ensuing skirmish 47 Confederate soldiers were killed. Among the dead were those wounded who had been left behind when their comrades retreated. They were found on the battlefield with their throats slashed. There were no Union deaths as a result of the battle.

The Confederate Museum in Atoka (since 2016 the Atoka Museum) commemorates this battle.

===Founding===
Though the Choctaw Indians had inhabited the area since the 1830s with a small town located near the city today, the city was officially founded by a Baptist missionary named J.S. Murrow in 1867 and quickly supplanted the dying town of Boggy Depot as the chief city in Atoka County, Choctaw Nation, a territorial-era county which included portions of today&#x27;s Atoka, Coal, Hughes and Pittsburg counties. A main contributing factor in the early growth of Atoka was the MKT Railroad, which came through the area in 1872. The railroad provided the economic lifeblood to Atoka that any isolated rural town needs to survive and flourish. Many businesses quickly moved to Atoka from Boggy Depot.

Also in 1872, Father Michael Smyth founded St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church. This was the first Roman Catholic church in what became the state of Oklahoma. On October 12, 1875, the Sacred Heart Mission, what later became St. Gregory&#x27;s University, was founded in Atoka by the Benedictine monks Father Isidore Robot, O.S.B., and Brother Dominic Lambert, O.S.B. In 1876, the mission relocated to near Konawa, Oklahoma and became an abbey.

About 1896, Robert L. Williams, who would become the third Governor of Oklahoma and first Chief Justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, moved to Atoka (then a part of the old Indian Territory) from Troy, Alabama. In 1898, land allotments were implemented and town lots were sold, as required by the Dawes Commission.

===Recent developments===
Despite being strategically located at the intersection of two major highways (especially U.S. 69, a major transportation artery in the region), Atoka is struggling to create a town attractive to both new business and new residents. Even though the town has experienced an economic upturn in the past few years, it still lacks the main thing that ensures economic prosperity and attracts new residents: well-paying jobs.

However, there is a beacon of hope for Atoka in the future. For the past several years, economic growth has been steadily moving northward along U.S. 75 from Dallas, Texas. Two towns located to the south of Atoka, Durant, Oklahoma, and Sherman, Texas, are experiencing tremendous economic and population growth. As this wave of development gradually moves north, the next town in line is the city of Atoka. If the growth continues, it is possible that Atoka could begin to see the type of expansion currently underway across the Red River to the south.

In 2023, Reba McEntire partnered with the Choctaw Nation and the city of Atoka to open a restaurant called &quot;Reba&#x27;s Place&quot; in downtown Atoka. The restaurant has increased tourism in the Atoka area and is helping to spark economic growth.

==Economy==

In the 19th century, the economy of Atoka and the surrounding area was founded on wood products. There were rich stands of hardwood nearby and ample water from Boggy River to power sawmills. The railroad facilitated shipment of the products.

In the early 20th century, Atoka became a ranching and farming community, with its economic base firmly planted in agriculturally related venues. However, in recent years, efforts have been made by the Chamber of Commerce, the city council, and various other local leaders to create new industrial jobs in Atoka and Atoka County. Currently, an industrial park is open for development north of the city on U.S. Highway 69, as well as a smaller park on U.S. Highway 75, west of town.

In August 2006, the city&#x27;s largest employer, Ethan Allen Furniture, announced that it would be closing its Atoka plant in favor of &quot;selected off-shore vendors&quot;, as reported in &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; following the announcement of the plant&#x27;s closing. With the closure of the Ethan Allen plant, located north of the city proper, more than two hundred people lost their jobs (many of whom had held them since the plant opened). As of May 2007, Ethan Allen has resumed operations at the Atoka plant, converting the former manufacturing facility to a distribution center.

In addition to revenue generated at convenience stores, fast food restaurants, etc., Atoka (and Atoka County) is a popular hunting and fishing area; as well, scenic tourism plays a small, albeit important role in the city&#x27;s economy. An effort is currently underway to place Atoka along a scenic byway.

==Transportation==
Four highways intersect in Atoka: U.S. Route 69 (a major transportation artery that travels from Texas to Minnesota), State Highway 3, State Highway 7, and U.S. Highway 75, thus making it a convenient stop for motorists. It is located where U.S. 69 and U.S. 75 converge (heading south toward Texoma).

Atoka Municipal Airport (KAQR, or FAA ID: AQR), located 1 mile northwest of town, has a 3015’ x 60’ paved runway.

For commercial air transportation, Atoka is roughly equidistant from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (130 miles south-southwest), Will Rogers World Airport (137 miles northwest), and Tulsa International Airport (140 miles north).

==Media==
Atoka is served by several media outlets, including the &quot;Atoka County Times&quot;, published weekly on Wednesdays, 102.1 KHKC, a radio station headquartered on the county line between Atoka and Coal counties, and KXII and KTEN, television stations broadcasting from Sherman, Texas.

Tradio, a locally well-known radio show, is broadcast every weekday morning. Tradio was known for, among many things, its host John Reuben. The shows consists of callers advertising items such as cars, furniture and animals, or events such as auctions and garage sales over the air. The tagline for show is, &quot;Good morning, you&#x27;re on Tradio,&quot; which is repeated by Reuben as he answers each call.
The current host, Derek Reid, still sometimes answers the phone to people saying &quot;Good Morning Brother John&quot;, as a nod to Reuben.

==Education==
The vast majority of Atoka is in the Atoka Public Schools System, while a portion of the city limits to the south is in the Tushka Public Schools school district.

The Atoka district has students from all over Atoka County due to offering several other academic and extra-curricular activities, such as football, track, robotics, and more.

===Atoka High School===
The Atoka High School campus is located on the west side of the town, and enrollment averages between 300 and 400 students from grades 9 to 12. Besides offering the basic courses and several Advanced Placement programs, Atoka High School offers classes in Spanish, Choir, Agricultural Education (FFA), and Drama, among others.

==History==

Sources differ as to the origins of the name: one suggests the original name was Springtown for a local sulphur spring but a spelling mistake labeled it Stringtown, while another suggests it got the name because businesses were strung out along the railroad tracks. Once home to a bank, theater, and pub, the town has grown recently, both economically and in population. Companies noticing business opportunities in game hunting. population growth since the 1990 census and the addition of a new café have brought new life to the town. Annually in September, the Good Ole Days Festival celebrates the town&#x27;s past with a parade, cookout, and concert.
A post office was established at Stringtown, Indian Territory on August 17, 1874. For a few weeks in July 1877 the official name of the post office was Sulphur Springs, Indian Territory. the present name is a modification of Springtown, the original name of the settlement. At the time of its founding, Stringtown was located in Atoka County, Choctaw Nation, a territorial-era government unit that included parts of today&#x27;s Atoka, Coal, Hughes, and Pittsburg counties.

On August 5, 1932, while Bonnie Parker was visiting her mother, Clyde Barrow and two associates were drinking alcohol at a dance in Stringtown (illegal under Prohibition). They were approached by Sheriff C. G. Maxwell and his deputy, at which time Clyde opened fire, killing deputy Eugene C. Moore. That was the first killing of a lawman by what was later known as the Barrow Gang, a total which would eventually amount to nine slain officers.

In the 1940s during World War II, Fritz Johann Hansgirg, the Austrian inventor of magnesium and heavy water processes was interned at the U.S. alien internment camp located in Stringtown.

In the late 1960s, a tornado touched down in the town directly on top of the (then) recently built Community Center, now the Senior Citizens Center. The tornado was only on the ground for a few seconds, but during that time the building was almost destroyed. It was an unusual occurrence for a tornado to touch down in the town itself, given its location between two chains of steep hills.

The nearby Mack Alford State Penitentiary is a large source of employment in the county. It was an internment camp for Japanese Americans arrested as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; and later for German POWs during World War II.

Despite its small size, Stringtown (2010 pop. 410) is the second-largest town in Atoka County, behind Atoka (pop. 3,107) and ahead of Tushka (pop. 312). On January 14, 2014, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol disbanded the Stringtown Police Department for generating too much of the city’s revenue off of writing traffic tickets, a violation of the state &quot;speed trap&quot; law.

The Garside house is one of the biggest historical sites of the town, next to the Bonnie and Clyde monument. The land the Garside house sits on was allotted to Joseph and Sarah Garside and their two children in 1902. In the middle of building the house, a tornado came through the town and tore down the part of the house that had been built. The Garsides had to start over again, but in 1915 they finished a two-story house. The house and land was later purchased by E. H. Colbertson, the first white man to buy land in that area. Approximately four years ago, the house was remodeled and decorated to be a museum.

The Southwest Stone Company, also known as the Rock Crusher, is one of the biggest sources of employment in the county. The crusher moved from Chockee to Stringtown in the early 1900s. Up until that point, Stringtown had not had electricity yet.

The railroad that runs through Stringtown stretches from south Texas, takes several routes in Oklahoma and Kansas, and reaches to the northern parts of Missouri. The part that runs through Stringtown was built in 1872 and is known now as the Union Pacific Railroad.

Stringtown was once home to a sawmill and a cotton gin that had the biggest production rate in the late 1800s. When a fire burnt the town on July 15, 1954, the sawmill and cotton gin burned down, along with half the town, including a café, a jailhouse, a barbershop, a bank, and a hotel. All that was left was Robert’s Store and a few homes. The town never really was rebuilt after this. Today, there is a school, a church, a fire department, City Hall, Dianna’s Store, and a senior citizens center.

<text>Beaver is a town and county seat in Beaver County, Oklahoma, United States. The community is in the Oklahoma Panhandle. As of the 2020 census, the town’s population was 1,280. The city is host to the annual World Cow Chip Throwing Championship. Held in April, &quot;Cow Chip&quot; brings attention from nearby cities with a parade, carnival, and cowchip throwing.

==History==
Beaver is located by Beaver River, also known as North Canadian River, and began as the location of a fur-trading post in 1879. Its original name was Beaver City, and was planned to be the capital of the short-lived Cimarron Territory. The Federal government never recognized the proposed Territory, but Beaver City remained the center of business and law enforcement for the area. In 1890, the territory was assigned to Oklahoma Territory, and Beaver City became the seat for the entire Oklahoma Panhandle, then known as Seventh County.

Beaver began as a stop on the Jones and Plummer Trail. In 1880, Jim Lane built a house on the south side of Beaver Creek, that also served as a general store, saloon, hotel, and restaurant. Beaver slowly sprouted along the banks of Beaver Creek. The first post office had been established on the north side of the river in 1883. In 1884 Lane moved the post office to his store and became the postmaster. He also added a corral and livery stable to accommodate freighters and cattle drivers. The Presbyterian Church was built in 1887. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as &quot;&quot;the oldest church in Oklahoma Territory&quot;. The Groves Hotel (later renamed the Thompson Hotel) was said to be the first business in town, when it was built in 1885. In 1891, Carter Tracy opened a general hardware and implement store. The first newspaper, the &quot;Territorial Advocate&quot;, began printing in 1887.

Although the Oklahoma Panhandle is noted for its lack of rainfall, it is occasionally subjected to flash floods. One such event occurred early in Beaver&#x27;s history, and flooded Main Street, where many of the businesses had been built. Another street, Douglas, had already been built, running south up a hill from the river, where the businesses relocated to prevent a recurrence.

The population grew to 112 in 1900, the main reason for its existence was to support cattle ranches located in the Panhandle area. In 1901–02, the Homestead Act encouraged farmers to move in to the area. Growth continued after the turn of 1900. A telephone exchange was built in 1905, and the Bank of Beaver City and the First National Bank, were established. The Beaver, Meade and Englewood Railroad (BME) was built to connect to the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, a.k.a. M-K-T or &quot;Katy&quot;, in Forgan, Oklahoma, to the north. The BME track to Forgan was not completed until 1915. Meanwhile, the BME was extended into Texas and Cimarron Counties. Soon, the M-K-T bought the BME system for $2 million.

During the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression most of the Panhandle and its communities suffered great economic hardships and lost population. The city of Beaver actually gained population. In 1920, it had 920 residents, which grew to 1028 in 1930 and 1146 in 1940.

Between Beaver and Guymon along Beaver Creek there are several plains Indians ruins. They are on private property and not accessible to the public. These ruins are associated with the Buried City Plains Indian Ruins near Perryton, Texas.

<text>Gate is a town in Beaver County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 60 at the time of the 2020 census. The community was named for the fact it was the &quot;gateway&quot; to a ranching area.

==History==

===Hangman&#x27;s Tree===
The area was a part of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; or the Oklahoma Panhandle, where no laws from other states could reach. Outlaws could commit crimes in Kansas or Texas, ride across the border and live protected from the laws. Violence, claim jumping, and thieving forced the honest settlers to form vigilance committees. Gate and Neutral City (located approximately five miles west) had carved a niche in badman history with hot lead. Low regard for property and human life was rampant across this lawless land. Between Gate and Neutral City, (the most wicked towns in No Man&#x27;s Land) three trees grew, one of which had a low hanging branch. This branch was used in rendering the &quot;hanging&quot; punishment. The tree measured 15 ft. in circumference, is approximately 40 ft. tall, There is no record of how many were hanged on the tree but one man said he witnessed three of them at once. The accused was in place with a rope around his neck when one of the men drew a line in the sand with the heel of his boot stating &quot;If anyone objects let him step across the line.&quot; One man by the name of G. C. (Nease Maphet) stepped across the line.

=== Silica mine ===
Volcanic ash is believed by geologists to have come from a volcano in north-central New Mexico. During the volcanic age, immense quantities of materials were thrown out of these volcanoes and the ash or dust was carried by the prevailing winds and collected in depressions or drifts in the same manner that snow does. There is evidence in the deposits that settled here that the ash settled into a lake, which accounts for the uniform quality of the main deposits, which became a hill. A canyon cut through the center of the deposit and exposed the deposit as cliffs. According to a certified analysis the Gate deposit is composed of 73% silica, 14% alumina and smaller amounts of iron, calcium, magnesium and alkalis.

=== Indian Battle ===
The hills on the south side are where the cavalry took their stand. Buttons from uniforms and shells they used have been found there. One man told about the battle he was a part of that drove the renegade of Indians back to the reservation they were assigned.

=== Old Gate ===
In 1886, with the establishment of a post office, Gate City came to being. In 1894, an application was filed to move the post office for the third time. It was moved 113 rods southeast, to where several business were established and the name was changed to just Gate. Here Gate grew until the railroad came, in 1910. By this time Gate had two livery stables, a hotel, barber shop, pool hall, harness shop, grocery, real estate, hardware stores, bank, doctor&#x27;s office and drug store, Masonic hall, numerous churches, furniture store, funeral home, bakery, U.S. Land office, millinery shop, lumber yard, two black smiths and a feed mill. When the railroad bypassed the town, the businessmen moved the town to the railroad, the present site of Gate.

<doc id="130039" wikidata="Q1007885" url="?curid=130039" title="Elk City, Oklahoma">
<text>Elk City is a city in Beckham County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 11,561 at the time of the 2020 census, a slight decrease from the 11,693 figure of the 2010 census. Elk City is located on Interstate 40 and Historic U.S. Route 66 in western Oklahoma, approximately west of Oklahoma City and east of Amarillo, Texas.

==History==
===European exploration===

In 1541, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado became the first known European to pass through the area. The Spanish conquistador was traveling northeast across the prairie in search of a place called Quivira, a city said to be fabulously wealthy with gold. Because Coronado&#x27;s route across the plains is speculative, it is quite possible that the expedition passed through present-day Elk City or the nearby area.

===Founding to statehood===
Elk City&#x27;s history dates back to the days immediately following the opening of the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation in western Oklahoma Territory on April 19, 1892, when the first white settlers made their appearance. Prior to this time, many early ranchers had driven cattle over the Great Western Cattle Trail from Texas to Dodge City, Kansas, the present townsite of Elk City being in the direct path of that famous trail.

The creation of Elk City was an idea conceived by land promoters from Weatherford, Oklahoma, when they learned that the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (CO &amp; G) was coming to the area (in 1898, the CO &amp; G Railroad completed its western route to Weatherford; beginning in 1901, it continued building west). They formed the Choctaw Townsite and Development Company. These men with great foresight determined that the area at the source of Elk Creek would be an ideal location for a town, so they came to the area to purchase lands from the homesteaders who had claims along the railroad.

Probably the most important day in Elk City&#x27;s history is March 20, 1901, the date the first lots were sold by the Choctaw Townsite and Development Company. By this time, hundreds of prospective purchasers had built a tent city. On that day, the townsite company sold $32,000 worth of property (about $870,000 in 2012 dollars) and continued doing a good business for some time thereafter.
There is some confusion about how Elk City got its name. Elk City was so named because it is located at the head of Elk Creek, which in turn was named by U.S. Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy who was leading an expedition to explore the Red River in 1852. Marcy and his troops had left the Wichita Mountains and the waterway which he named Otter Creek during his exploration, and they were traveling northwest along the North Fork of the Red River. On May 31, in the official journal of the expedition, Marcy wrote about the productive soil, the dense grass, and the vertical red clay banks of a &quot;bold running stream of good water.&quot; Continuing, he wrote, &quot;From the circumstance of having seen elk tracks upon the stream we passed in our march today, I have called it &#x27;Elk Creek&#x27;. I am informed by our guide that five years since, elk were frequently seen in the Wichita Mountains; but now they are seldom met with in this part of the country.&quot; Confusion also stems from the early post offices that served the residents of the town. Even though the town of Elk City has had only one name, its early settlers were served by a post office named Crowe, and later, one named Busch. Consequently, on many early maps of Oklahoma Territory the names of &quot;Crowe&quot; or &quot;Busch&quot; are seen instead of &quot;Elk City&quot;. Finally, on July 20, 1907, shortly before statehood, the Busch Post Office had its name officially changed to Elk City Post Office.

On August 13, 1901, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (purchased in 1904 by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1904) laid its last rail on the so-called &quot;Choctaw Route&quot;, bringing rail access to Elk City. The first regular train service commenced seven days later on August 20, and city folk rejoiced, predicting that the dugouts, claim shacks, and prairie stables would soon disappear and be replaced by handsome residences, commodious barns, and granaries.
By January 1902, Elk City had more than sixty businesses and a population exceeding 1,000. Paving the streets with bricks also began in 1902. Though not yet a year old, the town had become one of the largest in western Oklahoma. Even with two devastating fires (one on October 28, 1903, which destroyed more than a dozen businesses, and the other in March 1906 which burned sixteen businesses to the ground), Elk City continued to grow into a major transportation and commercial hub, and by statehood in 1907, the population had more than tripled to 3,000 people. The prairie community had become a boomtown.

Because of this, the city is the self-proclaimed &quot;Natural Gas Capital of the World&quot;, complete with Parker Drilling Rig #114, located downtown. The rig dominates the Elk City skyline, and at in height, is the world&#x27;s tallest, non-operating oil rig. Elk City has enjoyed significant growth due to the opening and location of oil field services and drilling companies in the city. The petroleum geologist Gustavus &quot;Gus&quot; E. Archie, known for Archie&#x27;s law, played an important role in establishing the Elk City oil and natural gas field.

Agriculture doesn&#x27;t play as prominent of a role as it did in the 20th century, with the only remaining viable agricultural market being the livestock auction. Nevertheless, Elk City still serves as a vital retail center for farmers and ranchers in the area.

In early 2009, Acciona Energy commissioned the first local wind farm, the Red Hills Wind Farm, located approximately north of Elk City. The Red Hills Wind Farm includes 82 wind turbine generators that produce 123 MW of clean energy, enough to power more than 40,000 homes.

Transportation has played an important part in Elk City&#x27;s economy throughout its history, beginning with the building of the famed U.S. Route 66 through the heart of the city in the early 1930s. Today, Interstate 40 serves the city, with 60,000 consumers traveling through Elk City each day, and connects with Oklahoma City to the east and Amarillo, Texas, to the west. The city is also served by Oklahoma State Highway 6, which connects Elk City with Altus to the south, and Oklahoma State Highway 34, connecting Elk City with Woodward to the north. The Elk City Regional Business Airport is located in the northeast part of the city, from the Interstate.

Given that Historic U.S. Route 66 runs through Elk City, a sprawling museum complex has developed, which includes the National Route 66 Museum, the Old Town Museum, the Transportation Museum, the Farm and Ranch Museum, and the Blacksmith Museum. Each museum is housed in separate buildings, which altogether depict a mockup of early Elk City, complete with general stores, bank, a railroad depot and train caboose, opera house, and other buildings. Elk City is also in close proximity to many other attractions in Western Oklahoma, including Foss State Park, Foss Reservoir, the Washita National Wildlife Refuge, Black Kettle National Grassland, the Wichita Mountains, the Antelope Hills, the Quartz Mountains, and the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site.

Bar-S Foods Company operates a packaged-meat warehouse and distribution center in Elk City.

Great Plains Regional Medical Center is Elk City&#x27;s largest employer and serves Western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle. The hospital has been named by &quot;OKCBusiness&quot; and Best Companies Group as one of the &quot;Thirty Best Places to Work in Oklahoma&quot; for three consecutive years: 2006, 2007, and 2008. On May 11, 2007, construction began on a new, $60 million, hospital that opened in July 2009.

In June 2009, it was announced that a Walmart Supercenter would be constructed, bringing at least 150 jobs to the city. Soon afterward, a $2.2 million federal grant was provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to help fund the project and bring more jobs to Elk City. It opened in October 2010 off I-40 at Exit 40. Featuring area, it is the largest store between Amarillo and Oklahoma City.

<doc id="130040" wikidata="Q612755" url="?curid=130040" title="Erick, Oklahoma">
<text>Erick ( ) is a city in Beckham County, Oklahoma, United States. It is located west of Sayre, the county seat, and east of the Oklahoma-Texas border. The population was an even 1,000 at the time of the 2020 census.

A post office, originally named Dennis, was established to serve the local community on November 8, 1900. This community developed along the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad line (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway), built in 1902. On November 16, 1901, the name was changed to honor Beeks Erick, the townsite developer and president of the Choctaw Townsite and Improvement Company, and the town incorporated that year.

==History==
Erick was established in 1901 as an agricultural community on what would become the edge of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression of the 1930s. It was located on the National Old Trails Road, one of the predecessors to the 1926 numbered US Highway system. Large segments of that road became part of U.S. Route 66.

At statehood in 1907, the population was reported as 686. In June 1908, Erick competed with Sayre for becoming the county seat, and only lost by a small margin in the election. By 1909, Erick had become a busy community. In that year, it could boast of having 13 general stores, 2 hardware stores, multiple cotton gins and blacksmiths, a livery, a harness shop, a lumber store, five meat markets, several grocery stores, a bakery, and a confectionary, two banks and two weekly newspapers (the &quot;Beckham County Democrat&quot; and the &quot;Erick Altruist&quot;. Baptists, Christian, Methodists and Presbyterians had organized churches. By the 1910 U.S. census, population had grown to 915, increasing to 971 in the 1920 census, and reaching a peak population of 2,231 in 1930 due to a brief oil boom. The city economy was bolstered by six cotton gins, a high-density cotton compress, and an ice plant. But in 1940 the census reported 1,591 residents.

The city prospered briefly in the era between WWI and WWII, when natural gas deposits were found in the area. On July 14, 1930, the &quot;Frederick (Maryland) Post&quot; published, &quot;Reports received here by Sheriff W.K. McLemore, Wheeler County, said negroes were driven out of Erick Oklahoma last night and from Texola, Oklahoma today by a mob seeking reprisal for the death of Mrs. Harry Vaughn, wife of a farmer in a nearby county in Texas, who was beaten to death Friday by a Negro.&quot; In a separate incident in 1933, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow (better known as Bonnie and Clyde) kidnapped law enforcement officers from the Wellington, Texas area, drove them to a point near Erick, and left them tied to a tree with barbed wire cut from a fence. The officers freed themselves, but the trail of the criminals had gone cold.

Steinbeck&#x27;s Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939, was poorly received locally. According to Erick city clerk Nyla Tennery, &quot;I can remember plainly when the book came out my parents and other people who stayed here were just real upset. That book gave all Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma people a shiftless, bad name, like that was the only kind of people who were here.&quot;

===U.S. Route 66===
Early motor courts began to appear by 1940, with the DeLuxe Courts being the first local Route 66 lodging to appear in the &quot;AAA Directory of Motor Courts and Cottages&quot;. While civilian motorcar travel was greatly curtailed due to wartime rationing, by 1946 guidebooks listed the Erick Court and trailer park, the Elms Garage, cafés and filling stations.

Erick prospered in the post-war heyday of Route 66, with various roadside businesses catering to motorists. Guidebooks promoted the tiny city as &quot;the first town you encounter, going west, which has a true &#x27;western&#x27; look with its wide, sun-baked streets, frequent horsemen, occasional sidewalk awnings and similar touches.&quot;

The four lanes of Route 66 from Sayre, Oklahoma to Erick were the last Oklahoma section of US 66 to be bypassed by I-40, in 1975.

Many of the original Route 66 business are now gone or have been converted to other uses.

World War II navy veteran Cal Rogers opened Cal&#x27;s Country Cooking on US 66 in May 1946, relocating to a new log cabin restaurant on an Interstate 40 exit in October 1979 after the Interstate bypassed traffic away from the old road. The family sold the business and antiques in a 1999 auction; the building is now a steak house.

The West Winds Motel, originally built with individual carport garages and promoted in its heyday with neon signage of bucking broncos, still stands but is no longer open to visitors despite attempts to restore the property.

Efforts to put &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; back onto maps as a tourist attraction date to the late 1980s, with the first Route 66 Association established three years after the last section of original highway (in Williams, Arizona) was bypassed by Interstate highway in 1984. Various local businesses and attractions cater to seasonal tourists attempting to find what remains of the old road.

The former City Meat Market building is now the Sandhills Curiosity Shop, one of the many Route 66 stops on Pixar&#x27;s research trips for 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot;. Its owners Harley and Annabelle Russell, who bill themselves as the &quot;Mediocre Music Makers&quot;, served as model for the country hillbilly accent used by Larry the Cable Guy&#x27;s character Mater in the film.

The 3000 square foot Roger Miller Museum was a museum opened at the corner of US 66 (Roger Miller Boulevard) and Oklahoma 30 (Sheb Wooley Avenue) in 2004 in a former 1929 café and drugstore building. It closed permanently on December 23, 2017. The space is now home to the 100th Meridian Museum.

===Country musicians===
Erick was home to two of country music&#x27;s more idiosyncratic performers. Sheb Wooley, the actor, songwriter, and singer who recorded the saga of the &quot;one-eyed one-horned flying purple people eater&quot; was born there in 1921.

<text>Sayre is a city in and the county seat of Beckham County, in western Oklahoma, United States. It is halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas on Interstate 40 and the former U.S. Route 66. The population was 4,809 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase over the 4,375 figure from the 2010 census, and the largest population ever recorded by a census since Sayre&#x27;s founding. 

==History==
After the Civil War, Congress wanted to stimulate the economy and aid the growth of the nation. One way that they achieved this was to promote the building of the western railroads. Upon completion of the Union Pacific-Central Pacific joining in 1869 with the Golden Spike, other railroads trying to capitalize on commerce and trade also began crossing the western country. This included the Great Northern and Burlington in the far north, and the Southern Pacific on the extreme southern border.

Eventually this would lead to rails crossing Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma, around the start of the 20th century. A new rail line was extended from Weatherford to Texola by McCabe &amp; Steen Contractors in July 1901. Entrepreneurs would buy land near where the new tracks were being laid, and also near a source of water. The Choctaw Town Site and Improvement Company did this, and when the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad crossed the North Fork of the Red River in Western Indian Territory an instant town sprang up, which incorporated on 14 September 1901.

The Choctaw Townsite &amp; Improvement Company began selling lots to new &quot;Sooners&quot; arriving to start a new life. The seeds of a new town were sown, businessmen came to sell their wares to the new town folk, and within one year the town&#x27;s population was up to around 1,000. Pennsylvanian Robert Heysham Sayre, a stockholder of the railroad, gave his name to the newly formed town in 1901.

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company (called the &quot;Rock Island&quot;) leased the new line. The Rock Island would complete its march to the Pacific by filling in the line to Tucumcari, New Mexico.

During the period of 1901–1907, Sayre was part of Roger Mills County in Oklahoma Territory. At the time Oklahoma became a state, Beckham County was created and Sayre, which was within the boundary of Beckham County, was named as the temporary county seat. An election in 1908 confirmed Sayre as the permanent seat, with voters preferring it to the town of Erick. The Beckham County Courthouse was completed in 1911, and is still in service over a century later. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The discovery of oil and gas nearby caused the population to boom between 1920 and 1930. In the 1930s U.S. Route 66, a dream forwarded by fellow Oklahoman Cyrus Avery, would come through Sayre, cementing the town&#x27;s fate to fuel the cars and feed the people exploring the country.

In 1940 film director John Ford used Sayre&#x27;s Beckham County Courthouse in the film &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, based on the famous book by John Steinbeck.

During the 1970s Sayre and the surrounding area benefited from the natural gas and oil development in the Panhandle-Hugoton field, the largest-volume gas field in the United States, and the world&#x27;s largest known source of helium. Between 1973 and 1993 the field produced over 8 trillion cubic feet (230,000,000 m³) of gas.

==Economy==
Sayre&#x27;s economy has been based on agriculture and the production of oil and gas. By the 1930s, the town had five oil companies and one gasoline plant in operation. United Carbon Company built a carbon black plant there. Circa 2000 the Flying J truck stop opened on a plot of land along Interstate 40 in Sayre; it paid $150,000 in annual sales taxes and had 117 employees. The city government had purchased the land and sold it to the developer at cost in order to attract the development.

The North Fork Correctional Facility, a privately owned, medium-security prison opened in 1998. This prison had 270 employees as of 2001, and that year Peter T. Kilborn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the prison &quot;is responsible for lifting Sayre&#x27;s spirits and reigniting its economy.&quot; Circa 2003 the community experienced economic issues when prisoners from Wisconsin were recalled from the prison.

<text>Texola is a town in Beckham County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 43 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase over the 36 figure from the 2010 census.

==History==

The History of Texola dates back to the early 1900s. Before being named Texola, the town site had been called Texokla and Texoma. Because of its location near the 100th Meridian, the town was surveyed eight different times, which meant that some early residents lived in both Texas and Oklahoma without ever moving. Texola was originally part of northern Greer County until Beckham County was formed after Oklahoma gained statehood in 1907. A post office was established in the community on December 12, 1901, with Reuben H. Grimes serving as the first postmaster. In 1902, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (later owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway) was built through the town. A weekly newspaper, the &quot;Texola Herald&quot;, began publishing in 1902 and continued to operate into the early 1920s. By 1909, Texola had two cotton gins as well as a corn and grist mill. The local economy was agriculturally based and several businesses opened in the community.

The 1910 census recorded 361 people living in Texola. That same year, a small Territorial Jail was built. After a slight decline in population during the 1910s, Texola grew rapidly in the 1920s. The population peaked at 581 in the 1930 census. The arrival of Route 66 (also known as 5th Street) had a positive impact on the local economy. Cotton production increased during the decade, necessitating the need for two additional gins. As the town prospered, amenities such as a ten-acre park and an auditorium capable of seating 300 people were found in the community. The population began to decline in the 1940s and continued to do so throughout the remainder of the twentieth century. By 1980, Texola was a town of 106 residents. When the next census was conducted in 1990, Texola had lost nearly 58 percent of its population, leaving just 45 people in the town. The figure is nearly the same in the 2020 census, at 43 people.
===Historic places===
The Magnolia Service Station in Texola is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Beckham County, Oklahoma, being placed on the list in 1995. The station was built in 1930 by the Magnolia Petroleum Company on Route 66.

Texola is not directly served by the Oklahoma state highway system. However, the town can be accessed from I-40 Exit 1. U.S. Route 66 passed through the town, bringing scores of travelers for decades, until I-40 was completed to the north in 1975.

<text>Longdale is a town in northwestern Blaine County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 262 at the 2010 census, down 18.3 percent from the figure of 310 in 2000.

==History==
The town was named for Lucious Walter Long, the husband of Carrie M. Millerman, who had obtained a homestead in the Cheyenne-Arapaho Opening of April 19, 1892. The two married and made her homestead the town site. They donated on the north side of their property to the Union Real Estate and Townsite Company, while retaining the southern side themselves, which they divided into residential and commercial lots. The Longs wanted to name their new community Longview, but agreed to change to Longdale to avoid confusion with the already existing community of Fairview.

Historians have sometimes confused Longdale with Cainville. The latter was north of Longdale, and already had a post office, where the residents of Longdale could receive their mail. The Cainville post office was discontinued and moved to Longdale on November 28, 1903, with Robert L. Eaton as the new postmaster. On October 23, 1903, G.

<text>Watonga is a city in Blaine County, Oklahoma. It is 70 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. The population was 2,690 as of the 2020 United States census. It is the county seat of Blaine County.

==History==
Watonga is located on former Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation lands that were allotted to individual tribal members, and the excess opened to white settlers in the Land Run of 1892. Watonga is named after Arapaho Chief Watonga, whose name means &quot;Black Coyote&quot;.

The town began as a tent city on April 19, 1892. A post office opened in Watonga during the same year. However, the first railroad line through Watonga was not built until 1901–02, when the Enid and Anadarko Railway (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway) constructed a rail line from Guthrie.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.28%, is water.

==Demographics==

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.91% of the population.

There were 1,273 households, out of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.3% were married couples living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.6% were non-families. 30.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.16.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 20.5% under the age of 18, 12.5% from 18 to 24, 36.7% from 25 to 44, 17.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 169.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 191.1 males.

==Economy==
Since statehood, Watonga&#x27;s economy has largely been based on agriculture. In the early days, local farmers primarily produced wheat.
The dairy industry grew in western Oklahoma and led to the opening of the Watonga Cheese Factory in 1941. It was one of the state&#x27;s five active dairy product plants in 2004. The plant subsequently closed in 2007.

Love&#x27;s Travel Stops &amp; Country Stores began with a single leased gas station in Watonga in the mid-1960s. Love&#x27;s is now in 41 states, is approaching 500 travel centers, and employs 25,000 nationwide.

The city hosted the Diamondback Correctional Facility, owned by the Corrections Corporation of America from 1998, and the prison grew to become the town&#x27;s largest employer. But the prison, housing Arizona inmates, experienced a riot in May 2004. The contract to utilize the facility was not renewed, resulting in the prison closing in May 2010. This left 300 prison workers jobless or transferred elsewhere. The prison was still vacant in March 2017.

The town Walmart closed in 2016.

==Government==
Watonga has an aldermanic form of government.

==Arts and culture==
The city hosts an annual Watonga Cheese Festival in October. The festival was formed in 1976 by the Watonga Chamber of Commerce because the town had the only cheese factory in Oklahoma at the time. The festival continued even after the factory closed in 2007. In 2013, a wine competition was added to the festival.

The town newspaper, the Watonga Republican, has been published since 1892.

In 1853, a Presbyterian minister named A. G. Lansing established Mount Pleasant Mission Station near present-day Matoy in the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. Lansing turned the mission operation over to Rev. Charles C. Copeland, who moved the mission a few miles farther south because the original site was in a boggy and remote location that was unhealthy. Copeland renamed the mission Bennington Mission Station, honoring his home town of Bennington, Vermont. A post office was established in 1873, but closed in 1878. It was reestablished in 1884.

The early inhabitants were Caddos and Choctaws, at least in the early 19th Century. A local legend says that the Caddos and the Choctaws had a fierce battle in 1840, about southeast of the site of present-day Caddo, The Choctaws won the battle, driving off the Caddos.

After a patent for the land, located on a buffalo trail, was obtained in 1872, the first settlers lived in tents.

In 1872, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (Katy) built a line through the Choctaw Nation and established a station at Caddo. A post office was opened December 18, 1872, and the railroad reached Denison, Texas by Christmas Day. In 1873, the town population was about four hundred people. Caddo quickly became a shipping and trade center for the surrounding area. By 1890, Caddo had five cotton gins and a population of 2,170. Caddo incorporated as a city in 1898. It was then the most populous town in the region.

At the time of its founding Caddo was located in Blue County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.

Caddo was on the route of the Jefferson Highway established in 1915, with that road running more than 2,300 miles from Winnipeg, Manitoba to New Orleans, Louisiana.

When the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (Frisco) planned to build an east–west line through the area, land prices jumped up. Frisco officials decided to build their line through Durant instead of Caddo. Durant then became the fastest-growing town, and became the county seat when Bryan County was formed at statehood. By 1930, Caddo&#x27;s population had fallen to 933.

In 1943, Guy A. Crossett, the editor of The &quot;Caddo Herald&quot; newspaper described Caddo&#x27;s decline. “Caddo was a thriving town when Durant was a switch; when Hugo was a prairie; when Madill was unborn; when Coalgate was un-thought-of; when Ardmore was only in Pennsylvania; when Idabel was yet to be; when Atoka was a small village. Yet all have outgrown us. The reason is plain. We did not elect a delegate to Bill Murray’s famous Constitutional Convention; and tried to live upon the glories of the past. Finding out too late that we could not run the mill with water that has passed. Yet Caddo’s part in the history of the state is honorable. That is secure. The future is another thing.”

<doc id="130055" wikidata="Q2691836" url="?curid=130055" title="Colbert, Oklahoma">
<text>Colbert is a town in Bryan County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 1,140 at the 2010 census, a 7 percent increase over the figure of 1,065 recorded in 2000. It was incorporated in 1939.

==History==
Colbert men became prominent leaders among the Chickasaw for most of the 18th and 19th centuries, starting with William &quot;de Blainville&quot; Colbert from France born of Scottish blood. His parents fled during the Glorious Revolution in Scotland; hence, he was born in exile in Blainville-sur-Orne, France. William traveled to the New World to seek a new line of work as a fur trader since the Jacobite uprisings had ruined his entitlements as a &quot;King Baron.&quot; These Colberts were also related to Jean Baptiste Colbert, Treasurer to King Louis XIV. There is a chateau named after Jean Baptiste Colbert in the aforementioned French town located on the Atlantic coast; it became a safe haven beginning in 1688.

Once in the New World, William Colbert ended up marrying the Chickasaw chief&#x27;s eldest daughter in order to gain more influence in his trading of furs with the native tribes. It was from this union that the Colbert men started gaining prominence, especially since the next two generations married Chickasaw/Cherokee wives. They also became chiefs such as George Colbert (&quot;Tootemastubbe&quot;) and Levi Colbert (&quot;Itawamba Mingo&quot;).
