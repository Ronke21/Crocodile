<text>Haverford Township is a home rule municipality township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Haverford is named after the town of Haverfordwest in Wales. It is a commuting suburb located due west of Philadelphia and is officially known as the Township of Haverford. It is referred to, like many townships in Pennsylvania, simply as Haverford. Despite being under a home rule charter since 1977, it continues to operate under a Board of Commissioners divided into wards, as do &quot;First Class&quot; townships that are still under the Pennsylvania Township Code. Haverford Township was founded in 1682 and incorporated in 1911.

Haverford Township contains portions of the unincorporated communities of Haverford, Ardmore, and Wynnewood and the census designated places of Bryn Mawr and Drexel Hill. The unincorporated community of Havertown lies wholly within Haverford Township. Much of Haverford Township developed as part of the Philadelphia Main Line, growing alongside the Paoli/Thorndale Line, Norristown High Speed Line, and the former trolley routes, now SEPTA Route 103 and SEPTA Route 104. The township population as of the 2020 census was 50,431, making it the 16th-most populous municipality in the state.

Haverford Township holds the distinction of having hosted two different men&#x27;s major golf championships at two different golf clubs: Merion Golf Club hosted the 1934, 1950, 1971, 1981, and 2013 U.S. Open, and Llanerch Country Club hosted the 1958 PGA Championship.

Haverford, along with Upper Darby, Cheltenham, Lower Merion together form as the major inner ring suburbs of Philadelphia.

==History==
===17th century===

Haverford Township was laid out by William Penn as part of the Welsh Tract or Barony. In 1681, a representative group of Welsh Quakers met with Penn to discuss their settlement having purchased forty thousand acres of land which today comprises all of Haverford, Radnor and Lower Merion Townships. &quot;Companies of Adventurers&quot; were formed, with the most prominent person in each taking out the patent on 5,000 acres of land as trustee. The first three families arrived in Haverford Township in 1682. Lewis David, Henry Lewis, and William Howell selected land along the southern border. The original settlers, led by John Roberts who had negotiated with William Penn in 1684 to constitute the Tract as a separate county whose local government would use the Welsh language never saw their dream realized. The earliest map of Penn&#x27;s province dates from 1687. 

The area was primarily agricultural until the second decade of the 20th century. The census returns of 1860 show the value of livestock as $62,485.00; animals slaughtered $11,255.00; 46,049 bushels of grain harvested and the value of orchard and garden produce, $4,090.00. 

The two creeks that mark part of the township boundaries, Cobbs Creek and Darby Creek provided mill seats for the early settlers. &quot;As early as the year 1688 a small grist-mill, known as the &quot;Haverford Mill,&quot; was built on Cobb&#x27;s Creek, near where that stream is crossed by the road leading past Haverford Meetinghouse. 

===18th century===

Daniel Humphreys purchased the property in 1703 and built a sawmill and fulling and dyeing mill. These were added to Dennis Kelly&#x27;s holding in 1826 and became the Castle Hill Mills. This site is just north of Eagle Road on the west bank of Cobb&#x27;s Creek.

On Darby Creek to the west, Richard Hayes Jr., David Morris and Samuel Lewis erected a gristmill, known as Haverford New Mill, in 1707. Later a sawmill was attached. This mill operated until 1904. Near the border with Marple Township, Humphrey Ellis operated a very early fulling mill. In 1807 Henry Lawrence built a sawmill on this site, and in 1832 his son, William, built a gristmill close by. The sawmill remained in the family ownership for more than 125 years, and was, until its demolition, the oldest industry extant in Haverford Township.

About 1800 grist and sawmills were built on the headwaters of Cobb&#x27;s Creek by Peter Brown, and in 1810 Jonathan Miller built grist and sawmills at what is now the Juncture of Mill Road and Karakung Drive.

===19th century===

Israel Whelen Sr., built the Nitre Hall Powder Mills on Cobb&#x27;s Creek, which were in operation by 1810. During the American Revolution very little black powder was manufactured in this country, and it was needed for engineering and mining. Between 1810 and 1840, these mills were the second largest powder mills in the U.S., with production of 800,000 pounds in 1812. The mills ceased operations in 1840 and were sold to Dennis Kelly, who converted them for the manufacture of cotton and wooden goods.

In 1814, Dennis Kelly borrowed capital to purchase a mill-seat on Cobb&#x27;s Creek. He erected a small wooden factory known as Clinton Mills. This was a highly successful venture and, after enlarging the mill, he built Cedar Grove Mill further downstream. Dennis Kelly provided material for the U.S. government from 1817 until 1860 with contracts ranging from $1,800.00 to $41,370.00. Improved transportation opened the township to development.

===20th century===
The transformation of Haverford Township from an agrarian spread of farms and mills began just after the turn of the 20th century. The railroads bought acres of land west of Cobb&#x27;s Creek for their planned developments. Rail lines ran from 69th Street in Upper Darby outward to Ardmore, West Chester and Norristown. Along the rail lines the railroad built the first planned suburban communities Llanerch, 1897 and the most fully developed, Brookline, 1909. While Beechwood, Oakmont and Manoa date from the same period the major housing tracts do not appear until after World War II along with the development of Chatham Park. These communities are now included under the postal address &quot;Havertown.&quot;

Several golf courses were developed. Merion Cricket Club Golf Association incorporated Clifton Hall an old farmhouse, in their clubhouse. They have 140 acres in the main course or East Course and 160 acres in the West Course. The Llanerch Country Club consists of 126 acres. The Pennsylvania Railroad Golf Club was established in 1925 on 109 acres bounded by Earlington Road, Manoa Road and City Line. This property was sold in 1943 to Warner West Corporation, which developed Chatham Park.

==Historical Sites==
=== Lawrence Cabin ===

David Lawrence was one of the early Welsh settlers in Haverford Township. He emigrated with his wife Elinor Ellis and her family in 1684, and took up part of his father-in-law&#x27;s land grant. His son Henry Lawrence purchased 209 acres along Cobbs Creek in 1709. It has not been determined whether the log house predates this purchase, but a -story stone addition was built c. 1730, and later a clapboard summer kitchen was added. It became known as the Three Generation House, and remained in Lawrence family ownership until 1942.

=== Federal School ===
The first record of the purchase of land for a school in Haverford Township was October 29, 1797. Alexander Symington received 5 shillings for an irregularly shaped building lot of one quarter of an acre and three perches near the present day intersection of Darby and Coopertown Roads. Payment for the land was made by five trustees: Philip Sheaff, William Brook, Francis Lee, David Lyons and Benjamin Hayes Smith, &quot;for the purpose of erecting a school thereon for the use of said Township of Haverford&quot;. The 1797 Federal School is on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Pont Reading House ===

&quot;Pont Reading House&quot; is situated on the Easterly side of Haverford Road, Haverford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at the corner where the Ardmore Trolley passes en route between Brookline—Oakmont and Ardmore, and near Ardmore Junction Station of the Philadelphia and Western Railway. It was the home of Joshua Humphreys, the shipbuilder and naval architect known for constructing the original six frigates of the United States Navy. Here, this beautiful specimen of early American homes still stands, in an excellent state of preservation and repair, as it has since 1813, when the front section was built and added to the middle three-story section erected 1730–60, which in turn was then added to the rear and original two-story structure, built possibly as early as 1683. One of the log walls of this first and original section can still be seen as one enters a door on one of the sides thereof, All surrounded and shaded with some large trees, of the original forest, still surviving.

=== Nitre Hall ===

The Nitre Hall Powder Mills, which gave the valley its name, were built by Israel Whelen shortly after 1800. The young nation had growing needs for explosives, and the mills prospered with an output of 800,000 pounds during the War of 1812. Nitre Hall Mills produced a quality and quantity of black powder in the U.S. second only to the Dupont Mills on the Brandywine. After the powder mills closed in 1840, Dennis Kelly bought the property and converted the buildings to the manufacture of textiles. Nitre Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Grange Estate ===
The Grange Estate, also known as Maen-Coch and Clifton Hall, is a historic mansion in Havertown, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Built in 1750 and expanded several times through the 1850s, it was purchased by Haverford Township in 1974. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 as The Grange.

William Penn School District serves Lansdowne. The district was created in 1972; prior to that year, Lansdowne was in the Lansdowne-Aldan School District.
* Ardmore Avenue Elementary School (K-6)
* Penn Wood Middle School (7-8) (Darby)
* Penn Wood High School 9th Grade Academy, Cypress Street Campus, (9) (Yeadon)
* Penn Wood High School, Green Avenue Campus, (10-12)

====Private schools====
Lansdowne Friends School is a Quaker elementary school.

Saint Philomena School of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operated for over 100 years before closing in 2011 due to a decrease in the number of students. In the 2010–2011 school year it had 141 students. It had 88 would-be students for the 2011–2012 school year that did not arrive. The &quot;Delco Times&quot; stated that had the school remained open, it would have had to reduce enrichment services. There would have been four students in the second grade, and three other classes each would have had fewer than 10 students.

==Features==

Lansdowne was once a vacation resort for residents of Philadelphia. People traveled by rail and horse to relax in the borough&#x27;s Victorian homes. Many of the homes have since been turned into multiple-dwelling apartments which, due to zoning law changes, is no longer an option. Lansdowne is trying to preserve the integrity of its stately homes.

It is home to numerous arts and music organizations, including the Lansdowne Symphony Orchestra, Celebration Theater, the Lansdowne Folk Club, Jamey&#x27;s House of Music and the Lansdowne Arts Festival. The Farmers Market runs, rain or shine, on Saturdays from 9 am to 1 pm, between Memorial Day and Halloween.
The fire department was incorporated December 4, 1894, and provides a career ambulance service alongside a volunteer fire service. The borough&#x27;s fire service is supplemented by the Yeadon, Clifton Heights, East Lansdowne, and Garrettford-Drexel Hill Fire Companies. Lansdowne is also the site of the Delaware County Healthcare Clinic to treat addiction, run by Recovery Centers of America.

The borough has several historic buildings, including a movie theater and clubhouse, and two areas that are on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Lansdowne Theater, Twentieth Century Club of Lansdowne, Henry Albertson Subdivision Historic District, and Lansdowne Park Historic District. There has recently been a movement to re-open the theater. The marquee was ceremoniously re-lit on October 5, 2012 after much reconstruction, indicating that the movement is healthy.

A community of Scottish weavers lived and worked on Scottdale Road by the Darby Creek in the 19th century. Some of their houses are still in existence. A Quaker community and a Friends&#x27; Meeting House are located on Lansdowne Avenue.

Lansdowne is also home to a 350-year-old sycamore tree, one of the largest in the state of Pennsylvania.

==Environmental remediation==
The W.L. Cummings Radium Processing Co. conducted radium enrichment processing for medical research at their facility on Austin Avenue from 1915 to 1920. The operations created radioactive waste of a sandy material called tailings. Building contractors used the tailings in mortar for the construction of walls and foundations in houses and businesses built nearby. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) checked thousands of properties in a 12.5 mile radius of the original contaminated site through usage of a van loaded with radiation detection instrumentation. The EPA discovered 40 residential properties in Lansdowne and nearby East Lansdowne, Upper Darby, Aldan, Yeadon and Darby contaminated with radium, thorium, radon and asbestos. In 1995, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers partnered to conduct clean-up operations which included dismantling the contaminated W.L. Cummings warehouse, removal of contaminated soil and rebuilding 11 homes. A five-year review conducted by the EPA in 2000 concluded that the clean-up has been effective.

A University of Pennsylvania professor, Dicran Kabakjian, developed the radium enrichment process for W.L. Cummings. He set up a separate business in the basement of his home at 105 Stratford Avenue. From 1924 to 1944, Kabakjian processed enriched radium ore for usage in radium-tipped needles. The processing activities in the basement resulted in radium contamination of the house and nearby properties. The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List in 1985 and conducted clean-up activities between 1986 and 1989. The house was dismantled and carted away by the EPA to a special landfill at a cost of $12 million. Following clean-up activities, the site was removed from the Superfund list in 1991.

==Transportation==

As of 2010 there were of public roads in Lansdowne, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

No numbered highways serve Lansdowne directly. Main thoroughfares in the borough include Baltimore Avenue, which follows a southwest-to-northwest alignment, and Lansdowne Avenue, which follows as northwest-to-southeast alignment. The two roads meet near the center of town.

Lansdowne is served by SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Media/Wawa Line at Lansdowne Station and Gladstone Station providing service to Center City Philadelphia. SEPTA Suburban Bus routes , and connect the borough with 69th Street Transportation Center, Darby Transportation Center, and Chester Transportation Center. The Media–Sharon Hill Line is immediately adjacent to the borough along Garrett Road in nearby Upper Darby Township

<text>Marcus Hook is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,397 at the 2010 census. The current mayor is Gene Taylor. The borough calls itself &quot;The Cornerstone of Pennsylvania&quot;. The 2005 film &quot;One Last Thing&quot;... was set and partially filmed in Marcus Hook.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===
The earliest inhabitants of Marcus Hook were members of the Lenape Native American tribe and their indigenous ancestors, whose succeeding cultures occupied present-day Marcus Hook and surrounding areas for thousands of years.

===17th century===

The Lenape had a major settlement in Marcus Hook; New Sweden colonists established a trading post here in the 1640s. The village was called &quot;Chammassungh&quot;, or &quot;Finland&quot; by the Swedes. It was located on the west side of the Delaware River, between Marcus Hook Creek and Naamans Creek. Dutch colonists renamed the settlement as &quot;Marrites Hoeck&quot; after they conquered the area in 1655. The name is derived from the word Hook, meaning promontory, or point of land projecting into the water and Marcus, a corruption of the name of the Indian chief, called &quot;Maarte&quot; by the Dutch, who lived at the Hook.

English colonists gained control of the Dutch colonies and founded St. Martin&#x27;s Church in 1699; the new church opened for worship in 1702. Walter Martin of Upper Chichester founded this church as an alternative place of worship and burial for Christian non-Quakers.

===18th century===
Marcus Hook became a prosperous community and market town and in 1708 was of equal prominence to nearby Chester, Pennsylvania, with each location having approximately 100 houses.

In the early 1700s, Marcus Hook was a haven for pirates who plagued the lower Delaware River. The market at Marcus Hook provided the pirates a place to sell plundered goods and re-supply away from the authorities and custom officials in Philadelphia. Early maps of Marcus Hook show the current Second Street was originally named &quot;Discord Lane&quot;, since it was the location of the pirates&#x27; revelry when they were in town.

Marcus Hook Plank House reportedly was once the home of a Swedish mistress of the pirate Blackbeard, named Margaret.

By the mid-18th century, Marcus Hook became a major regional center for the building of wooden sailing ships and remained so until the late 19th century. By that time, larger tonnage ships became more popular than the sloops and schooners built in Marcus Hook.

During the American Revolutionary War, two tiers of underwater &quot;chevaux-de-frise&quot; obstacles were placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook to provide a first line of defense of Philadelphia against British naval forces. Marcus Hook also served as a training center for the Pennsylvania militia. The Continental Army was stationed at Marcus Hook during the fall of 1777. As the town was bombarded by British warships, there are very few pre-Revolutionary houses in Marcus Hook.

===19th century===
Marcus Hook served as a defensive post along the Delaware River during the War of 1812, with over 5,000 United States troops placed there.

The borough was officially incorporated on March 7, 1892. The convergence of rail, roads, a deep water port, and the nation&#x27;s growing thirst for petroleum gave rise to the refineries that became the borough&#x27;s dominant industry.

===20th century===

Sun Oil Company opened the Marcus Hook refinery in 1901 to refine crude oil brought by ship from Texas. It was the first of seven major refineries that made up the largest fuel-manufacturing center in the Northeast. The refinery was closed in 2011 due to deteriorating market conditions. The refinery was reopened as Marcus Hook Industrial Complex operated by Energy Transfer Partners. Processing Marcellus Shale gas transferred via the Mariner East and Mariner XL Pipelines.

In 1910, the American Viscose Corporation opened a plant in Marcus Hook for the production of rayon and other synthetic fibers.

On February 4, 1932, the MS &quot;Bidwell&quot;, a motor tanker belonging to Sun Oil, exploded and burned at the Sinclair Dock while tanks were being cleaned of residual crude oil in preparation for loading of gasoline. The first explosion occurred at 12:20 am and was followed by three more explosions within 25 minutes, resulting in 17 or 18 dead, including the entire crew and captain, and four were injured. The disaster induced Sun Oil to develop cargo tank inerting and install it on all their ships beginning the following year, in 1933.

== History ==

The Delaware County area was first settled by Quakers who came to Pennsylvania by the Delaware River on September 29, 1683. The ship they used was called the &quot;Endeavor.&quot; Marple Township was originally settled in 1684 and was recognized as a township in the same year. The original spelling of the township was Marpool, but the spelling was changed to Marple in the Thomas Holme map of 1687. The Marpool spelling may have been an error.

One of the settlers who arrived on the &quot;Endeavor&quot; was Thomas Massey. He obtained a 300-acre plantation in the township from William Penn. The house he built on the land is still preserved today, as well as some of its surrounding gardens. Another historical family known as the Van Leers built several historical sites and lived in the area. Dr. Bernardhus Van Leer owned the nearby Van Leer House and his family built the nearby Van Leer Cabin.

In 1948 Marple Township got its first police station. Before, there was no local branch, no patrols of the police, and only a county sheriff. Crimes were mostly settled between victims and perpetrators themselves.

Marple became a first-class township in 1961.

<text>Media is a borough in and the county seat of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located about west of Philadelphia. It is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

Media was incorporated in 1850 at the same time that it was named the county seat. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 5,991.

==History==
The history of the area goes back to William Penn, but the area remained predominantly rural until the 20th century.

===17th century===
Land in the area was sold and settled soon after William Penn was named proprietor of the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania in 1681 by King Charles II of England. Peter and William Taylor bought the land where Media is now located, directly from Penn. At the time, the land was located in Chester County. Providence Township was organized in 1684, and later divided into Upper Providence and Nether Providence townships by 1690, even though they only had 40 taxable properties at the time. The current borough, formed in 1850, sits between the two townships.

In 1683, the Court of Chester County approved the construction of &quot;Providence Great Road&quot;, now Pennsylvania Route 252. The road, which runs north from Chester to within a few blocks of today&#x27;s downtown, is shown on a 1687 map along with the names of local landowners. It forms the eastern border of the borough.

Thomas Minshall, a Quaker, was an early Media resident, settling just outside the small village then known as &quot;Providence&quot;, along Providence Great Road. The village then included a tailor shop, blacksmith shop, wheelwright shop, barn and other buildings.

Minshall bought from William Penn and arrived in 1682. The Providence Friends Meetinghouse was established at his house in February 1688.

===18th century===
The original Friends Meetinghouse was built out of logs in 1699 or 1700, and the current building was completed in 1814. A house on Minshall&#x27;s property, built around 1750, still stands and was given to the citizens of the borough in 1975.

In 1789, Chester County, Pennsylvania was divided, with the eastern portion becoming Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

===19th century===
The area in the center of the new county remained rural through 1850. On March 11, 1850, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by Special Act of Assembly incorporated the Borough of Media, and made the sale of malt and spirituous liquors unlawful within its borders. At the same time, the county seat of Delaware County was moved to Media from Chester. The borough was formed from four farms purchased by the county, totaling only . The borders of the borough have not changed since that time.

Streets were plotted in a rectangular grid around the location of the new courthouse, lots were sold at public auctions, and the construction of houses began. Sources agree that Minshall Painter, a descendant of Thomas Minshall, suggested the name &quot;Media&quot;, but do not agree on the reason. The name most likely comes from the borough&#x27;s median location in the direct center of Delaware County.

===20th century===
In 1940, the Pennsylvania guide described Media by noting that &quot;[t]he majority of its houses, almost all built since the American Civil War, sit far back on shaded lawns and seem somewhat gloomy. The borough has a large and prosperous business section and a few small industrial plants; many townspeople work in Philadelphia or Chester.&quot;

The John J. Tyler Arboretum occupies part of Thomas Minshall&#x27;s original . This farm and a nearby Village of Lima was used by the Underground Railroad. The land was donated to a public trust in 1944 by an eighth-generation descendant. The arboretum was started as a private collection by brothers Jacob and Minshall Painter. In 1825, they began systematically planting over 1,000 varieties of trees and shrubs. Over twenty of their original trees survive, including a giant sequoia.

Minshall Painter was also a leader of the Delaware County Institute of Science, which was formed on September 21, 1833, with just four other members: George Miller, John Miller, George Smith, M.D., and John Cassin. The institute was incorporated in 1836. About 1850, Painter gave the institute the land where its building currently stands at 11 Veterans Square, and the building was constructed in 1867.

In the second half of the 19th century, Media was a summer resort for well-to-do Philadelphians. The borough&#x27;s large vacation hotels included the Idlewild Hotel (1871) on Lincoln Street at Gayley Terrace, Chestnut Grove House or &quot;The Colonial&quot; (1860) on Orange Street, and Brooke Hall on Orange Street and Washington Avenue (now Baltimore Avenue). The Chestnut Grove was used for a year by nearby Swarthmore College due to a fire on its campus.

The West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad was built through Media on October 19, 1854. Electrified service was opened on December 2, 1928. Up to 50 trains passed through each day. The railroad became part of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and eventually the Penn Central. SEPTA took over operations in 1983. Woodrow Wilson spoke at the Media Station in 1912 during his first election campaign. Trolley transportation lines spread to and through Media in the 1890s and early 1900s.
The Media Theatre opened as a vaudeville house in 1927. The first talkie film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, was shown there. It remained a popular cinema through the 1970s and 1980s. In 1994, the theater underwent a $1 million (~$ in ) restoration by Walter Strine Sr. and re-opened as the Media Theatre for the Performing Arts. Shows produced there have included &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;.

On March 8, 1971, the Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI raided an FBI &quot;resident agency&quot; in Media. They later released thousands of documents to major newspapers around the country. These documents revealed FBI tactics, like the recruitment of Boy Scouts as informants, and confirmed for the first time the existence of COINTELPRO, an FBI program to &quot;expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize&quot; dissident groups in the United States.

===21st century===
In June 2006, Media became the first town in the United States to follow over 300 towns in Europe in attaining fair trade certification. To meet the criteria for certification, Media passed a council resolution in support of fair trade, served fair-trade coffee and tea in local government meetings and offices, ensured that a range of fair-trade products were available in local restaurants and businesses, raised popular support and provided media coverage for the fair-trade campaign, and convened a fair-trade steering committee to ensure continued commitment.

The archdiocese had originally planned to make Nativity BVM the regional campus, but changed when St. John Chrystosom had appealed the decision. After the closure, Media Elementary School occupied the campus while renovations of the permanent Media Elementary occurred.

<text>Middletown Township is a township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 15,807 at the 2010 census. The Pennsylvania State University has an undergraduate satellite campus called Penn State Brandywine located in the north-central portion of the township. Located outside of Philadelphia, it constitutes part of the Delaware Valley (i.e. the Philadelphia metro area).

Originally established in 1686, Middletown Township adopted a Home Rule Charter in 1978.

==History==
Middletown Township was probably established as a township in 1686, but it is first mentioned in 1687 when John Martin was established as constable. The name of the township is believed to be derived from its position in the middle or center of Chester County where it resided until 1789, when Delaware County was created from the eastern portion of Chester County. Delaware County played an important role in the anti-slavery movement. Not only did residents advocate for manumission, noted local families such as the Van Leers bought and sold lots to free black tradesmen or only to people who were supportive of the free black community. The location is now known as Van Leer Avenue. The local community grew with support from local neighbors.

<text>Millbourne Borough is a self-governing municipal borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population is 1,212. Millbourne borders Philadelphia along Cobbs Creek. The name &quot;Millbourne&quot; comes from the word Mill and &quot;bourne&quot; meaning creek.

Millbourne was settled by Samuel Sellers in 1682. Samuel&#x27;s descendants later owned a gristmill in Millbourne called Millbourne Mills. In the early 1900s, developers Samuel Shoemaker and John L. Fry developed housing in Millbourne, leading to its separation from Upper Darby and its official incorporation as a borough in 1909. Millbourne Mills shut down in 1926 and was replaced by a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. store, which operated until 1988 when it relocated to Upper Darby, causing financial strain on Millbourne. Millbourne was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1998 and was removed from the list in 2014.

Throughout its history, Millbourne has experienced waves of diverse ethnic populations, starting with Greek Americans, followed by East Asian Americans, and currently hosting a significant South Asian American community. Millbourne holds the distinction of having the most concentrated South Asian population in the entire United States.

Millbourne is served by its own SEPTA station known as Millbourne Station. Additionally, the town had its own police department and fire department, both established in 1909. However, the Millbourne Fire Company, which operated the fire department, ceased operations in 2019. In 2022, the former Sears site underwent redevelopment, resulting in the establishment of a logistics facility for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia.

== History ==

=== First settlement ===
Before the arrival of European settlers, the Lenape people were already in the Delaware Valley. After William Penn&#x27;s signing of the Treaty of Shackamaxon, Samuel Sellers, the pioneering settler of the Sellers family, came from Derbyshire, England in 1682, with his brother George Sellers. Both brothers purchased two tracts of land totaling and from William Penn. The official survey for the land was not completed until 1690. Over time, Samuel, his sons, and grandsons expanded their land holdings through additional purchases in the surrounding area. George Sellers later died due to an unexplained death involving a tomahawk.

Samuel Sellers, the original settler, was a skilled weaver who played a pivotal role in the early industrial development of the region. He is credited with establishing the first twisting-mill in America. Building upon his father&#x27;s legacy, Samuel&#x27;s son, also named Samuel, and his grandson, John, continued the family tradition of weaving.

=== Millbourne Mills ===
The presence of a dam in Millbourne was first documented in an important deed issued by John Sellers on August 27, 1752. John Sellers recognized the potential of harnessing the waterpower of Cobbs Creek, leading to the development of six sites along the waterway. These sites became essential for subsequent generations and contributed to the growth of Millbourne Mills, first called Sellers Mills.

During this time, Millbourne was part of Darby Township. But in 1786, Millbourne was separated with other municipalities to form Upper Darby Township.

Following John Sellers&#x27; passing in 1804, his estate was inherited by his sons, with George receiving the majority of Millbourne. John Sellers II inherited the grist and sawmills, which were already established before 1749. Millbourne Mills were initially operated by James Steel under the ownership of John Sellers Sr., and later by Thomas Steel, who took over in 1805.

In 1814, Thomas Steel acquired the Darby Mills and relocated, while John Sellers II. expanded the existing mill, resulting in the construction of the original section. John Sellers also owned a tannery on the Wayside farm in 1782. Additionally, an oil mill operated near the dam supplying water to Millbourne Mills until 1848.

The original gristmill underwent changes over time until its discontinuation. The new mill, built in 1814, was managed by John Sellers II. and featured advanced machinery. It achieved significant grain production, including wheat, rye, corn, buckwheat, and oats.

The mill underwent expansions and upgrades, including a four-story addition in 1868. It utilized a turbine wheel and later incorporated auxiliary steam power. John Sellers II passed away in 1878, and his sons continued operating Millbourne Mills with Thomas Steel. Millbourne Mills produced 250 barrels of Millbourne branded flour daily, with substantial wheat purchases and flour production in subsequent years.

=== 20th century ===
In 1906, a patch of Millbourne was sold by John Sellers II&#x27;s son, John, to make way for 69th Street Transportation Center, which connected Upper Darby to Philadelphia.

During the early spring of 1907 and throughout 1908, a considerable amount of construction took place on the hill west of Millbourne Mills, situated on West Chester Pike. Builders Samuel Shoemaker and John L. Fry, seeing a commercial opportunity, undertook the development of a suburban community featuring semi-detached homes. Upon completion, the properties boasted landscaped lawns, while the streets and sidewalks lined with trees. The location offered transportation options. The properties sold, with many units being purchased prior to their completion. Consequently, the homes attracted respectable businessmen and their families, leading to the establishment of a growing community.

In 1909, Judge Issac Johnson of Delaware County issued an opinion that allowed for the incorporation of Millbourne as a borough within Upper Darby Township. The exceptions raised during the proceedings were subsequently dismissed. Attorneys representing the petitioners, who included a significant portion of the community, prepared a decree in accordance with the judge&#x27;s opinion. Millbourne became the fourth borough to be formed in the township, joining Clifton Heights, Lansdowne, and Aldan at the time. The Millbourne Fire Company and the Millbourne Police Department opened shortly after.

The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT, now SEPTA) opened a rapid transit station in Millbourne on March 4, 1907.

In 1910, Millbourne Mills was sold to the Shane Brothers and continued to produce flour until 1921. Millbourne Mills ceased operations in 1926 and was demolished to make way for a Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. store.

Millbourne students would attend schools in the Millbourne School District but in 1971, Millbourne merged with other municipalities to form the Upper Darby School District.

==== Financially distressed municipality ====
The Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. store operated from 1926 until 1988. The owner of the property Morris Willner, president of Willner Realty and Development Co., announced in April 1988 that Sears would move from Millbourne to a former Gimbel&#x27;s Department Store in 69th Street in Upper Darby. After the move, Millbourne continued to collect parking fees from the former Sears parking lot. But in May 1990, Willner announced that Millbourne was no longer permitted to collect fees. There was plans to develop a discount supply store, but the company went bankrupt before plans could be arranged. The former Sears site was demolished in the 2000s.

During the early 1980s, Millbourne had the highest crime rate in all of Delaware County. In 1989, The Millbourne Fire Company was temporarily closed due to budget problems. After years of negotiations, The Millbourne Fire Company reopened in 1992.

After the relocation of Sears, Millbourne went into financial hardship. By the 1990s, due to mismanagement of borough funds, Millbourne was on the brink of bankruptcy. To receive enough funds to stay afloat, Millbourne had to be designated as a financially distressed municipality by the state of Pennsylvania, be absorbed back into Upper Darby, or contract municipal services within Millbourne out to Upper Darby Township.

Millbourne was designated a financially distressed municipality on January 7, 1993, by the state of Pennsylvania. Factors that led to a distress determination included revenue loss created from the closure of Sears and an evaluation by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. Fairmount Capital Advisors Inc., hired by the state of Pennsylvania, presented a five-year plan to recover Millbourne. The plan included:

* reducing the numbers of officials in Millbourne council;
* hiring a borough manager;
* establishing a business office and a civil service commission;
* acquiring market-rate, tax-exempt bond financing to finance bank debt, and raise capital for infrastructure repair; and
* improving financial management with new computer systems.

Susana Smith of Bloomfield, New Jersey was hired as the borough manager. Taxes for homeowners in Millbourne rose between 1993 and 2014. A 40% increase in real-estate taxes in the 1995 preliminary budget was adopted by Millbourne due to the distress determination.

=== 21st Century ===
In the 2000s, Millbourne was still designated as a financially distressed municipality. Since the 1970s, Millbourne has seen a notable rise in its South Asian population. Following the events of the September 11th attacks, Sikh New York cab drivers, relocated to Millbourne in order to seek safety from instances of hate crimes. Millbourne gradually became a secure haven for the expanding Sikh community due to its appealing amenities and the presence of a gurdwara. Millbourne became known as a &quot;Little India.&quot;

In 2009, under the leadership of mayor Thomas Kramer, Millbourne enacted land value tax. Millbourne began imposing taxes on the land itself and not on the structures built there. This allowed Millbourne to raise the necessary funds to stay afloat. The former Sears lot became the largest source of revenue for Millbourne. On October 21, 2014, Millbourne was removed from the financially distressed municipality list. Millbourne had not overspent its budget in 5 years and even went as far as to use goats to remove weeds. The South Asian population in Millbourne continued to rise. In 2019, The Millbourne Fire Company closed indefinitely. In 2022, the former Sears site was developed and a Service and Logistics facility for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia opened.

In the 1980s, Millbourne had a majority of Greek Americans and East Asians. Since the 2000s, Millbourne has been considered the first municipality in Pennsylvania with a Desi majority. Millbourne is often called a &quot;Little India&quot; due to this large Indian presence. Most residents stay for a few years before moving to other places, after they become financially stable.

The increase in the South Asian population in Millbourne can be attributed to the migration of Sikh cab drivers from New York following the September 11th attacks. Seeking refuge from potential hate crimes targeting their use of turbans, as well as drawn by Millbourne&#x27;s economic opportunities. Another contributing factor to the rise in the South Asian population in Millbourne is the presence of relatives already living in the area, allowing for family reunification.

==== Philadelphia Sikhi Society ====
The Philadelphia Sikhi Society is a gurdwara located on Garden Court. Since the 1990s, it has been Millbourne&#x27;s only place of worship. It was founded after a small Sikh population in Philadelphia used a storefront as their place of worship until the 1990s when more Sikh immigrants arrived. The growing population required a larger space, so they purchased an old warehouse in Millbourne and transformed it into a new gurdwara. The Sikh temple&#x27;s move to Millbourne led to a significant increase in the population. The gurdwara offers prayer services every Sunday and Friday. Annually, the Philadelphia Sikhi Society holds a Sikh Guru Nanak parade in celebration of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.

=== Public safety ===

==== Millbourne Police Department ====
The Millbourne Police Department was founded in 1909. Millbourne maintains its own police department, which provides frequent coverage of each street. Millbourne had an unreliable relationship with its police department in the early 1950s due to Millbourne&#x27;s civil service laws being &quot;carelessly&quot; administered, according to the Delaware County Daily Times. Police officers in the police department were also the lowest paid officers in Delaware County. Since then, tensions between two parties have been resolved. During the early 1980s, Millbourne had the highest crime rate in all of Delaware County. Since then, crime has lowered, with exceptions in the rise of larceny.

Millbourne has a Town Watch, a volunteer organization run in cooperation with the police department. The Town Watch was formed after Upper Darby officials urged nearby residents to form neighborhood watch groups in 2011. Magisterial courts with presiding jurisdiction for Millbourne are located in Upper Darby.

==== Millbourne Fire Company ====
The Millbourne Fire Company was founded in 1909 and provided Millbourne with firefighting services until its closure in 2019. Upper Darby Township Fire Company, the East Lansdowne Fire Company and the Yeadon Fire Company now service Millbourne.

===== 1990s Finance Issues =====
In October 1989, the Millbourne Fire Company temporarily ceased operations due to insufficient funds for insurance. However, an extension was granted by the insurance company after Millbourne Borough could not afford the insurance premiums. To ensure fire protection, Millbourne Borough voting to contract services with Upper Darby Township, replacing the volunteer-run fire company with a paid one. The Millbourne Fire Company disputed Millbourne Borough&#x27;s decision and was shut down again due to lack of funds. In response to the challenge, Delaware County Judge John Diggins ordered a referendum. On May 16, 1990, Residents were presented with the following question in the referendum: &quot;Do you support the replacement of the Volunteer Fire Company with a paid fire company in the Borough of Millbourne?&quot; Subsequently, the referendum was held, and the results revealed that 66 individuals voted in favor of the replacement, whereas 76 individuals voted against it. Millbourne Fire Company was allowed to stay and Millbourne Borough was ordered to pay $12,000 ($ in 2022) for funding.

The Millbourne Fire Company only received $500 ($ in 2022) both in July and August 1990. Millbourne Borough appealed the Diggins decision, and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania reversed the decision. The Millbourne Fire Company attempted to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania but was rejected on March 11, 1992. On October 1, 1992, after Millbourne Borough presented Millbourne Fire Company with $4,200 ($ in 2022) in funding, Millbourne Fire Company finally reopened after over 2 years of closure.

===== 2019 Closure =====
On April 23, 2019, in a meeting, ten members unanimously voted to close the Millbourne Fire Company after 110 years of service. Fire Chief Joseph Artmont Jr. and President Andy Formanes were elected to handle any remaining tasks. Failed negotiations with Millbourne Borough led to the closure, and the firehouse has been locked with agreements of sale on two fire trucks.

The Millbourne Fire Company issued a letter addressing misinformation and outlining issues between Millbourne Fire Company and Millbourne Borough. They had requested funding for part-time paid firefighters, but the proposals were rejected. The department faced challenges due to a shortage of volunteers and insufficient resources. The closure leaves Millbourne relying on neighboring fire departments for coverage.

== Economy ==
Millbourne relied on property taxes from a Sears store but faced financial hardship after its closure in 1988. Mismanagement of funds pushed Millbourne towards bankruptcy. The state of Pennsylvania designated Millbourne as financially distressed in 1993 and hired Fairmount Capital Advisors Inc. for a recovery plan. Taxes increased for homeowners. In the 2000s, Millbourne implemented a land value tax, generating revenue from the land itself. The former Sears lot became a major income source. On October 21, 2014, Millbourne was removed from the distressed list.

In 2012, a development plan was created for the vacant plot of land that originally hosted Sears. It included multiple retail stores and anchors, housing units and apartments, and new townhall. Due to the property lying within the Cobb&#x27;s Creek floodplain and being located in a disadvantaged area, the plan was scrapped. On October 7, 2022, after 7 years of planning, the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia opened a logistics facility at the former Sears lot. With the arrival of the new facility, Delaware Country reassessed the site&#x27;s value at $50.6 million.

Millbourne appealed the decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, wanting to be independent and send students to other schools on a tuition basis.

<text>Newtown Township, also referred to by the name of its post office of Newtown Square, is a township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Prior to 1789, it was part of Chester County, along with the rest of Delaware County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 15,002.

==History==
The first mention of the township was in 1684, when Thomas Norbury and John Humphrey were appointed collectors of the &quot;Levie for the cort house and Prison for ye Township of Newtowne&quot;. Newtown Square was the name used for the townstead with the majority of early settlers being Welshmen. These Welsh &quot;Friends&quot; (Quakers) needed a road to facilitate their journey to meeting, the only established road at the time being Newtown Street Road, which ran north and south. As such, in 1687, an east–west road was laid out (Goshen Road) so the Friends could attend either Goshen or the Haverford Friends Meeting. By 1696, these friends had become numerous enough to hold their own meeting in Newtown and continued to meet in a private home until the completion of the Newtown Square Friends Meetinghouse in 1711. In the 18th century, Newtown was basically a farming community. Blacksmith and wheelwright shops emerged on the main arteries to service horse and buggy travelers. Taverns and inns were also opened to accommodate local patrons as well as drovers taking their livestock to the markets in Philadelphia.

During the Revolutionary War, Newtown township was visited several times by foraging parties of the British Army. On Goshen Road, west of Newtown Square, were the outpost and headquarters of General Potter.

During the 19th century a number of mills sprang up along Crum Creek (the western border) and Darby Creek (in the northeast corner of the Township). These included saw mills, paper mills, shingle mills, and a woolen factory. In the Darby Creek area a number of tenement houses were built as well as a general store to service the needs of the mill workers.
In 1860, the population of Newtown Township was 830; the population of Philadelphia was approximately half a million. At this time, the railroad was laying track out of Philadelphia in all directions with services to Chester, Media, West Chester, and Radnor, but not Newtown Square. As these towns, as well as stops along the way, grew and prospered, mills closed and businesses declined in Newtown Square. By 1890, the population had fallen to 648.

As an agricultural community, stone farmhouses graced the country landscape throughout the 19th century. Additions were made to the early simple dwellings as families grew and more living space was required. Prosperity, due to a growing market, also enabled property owners to make additions, not only to their own homes, but on the property as well as in the form of tenements and outbuildings.

In 1859, the Rose Tree Hunt Club was organized south of the township, followed by the Lima Hunt Club to the west (1885) and the Radnor Hunt Club at the intersection of Darby-Paoli and Goshen Roads in 1886. With these developments, many country estates were built in the rolling hills of Newtown Square for &quot;either country gentlemen of Old Quaker blood ... or rich Philadelphians who loved hunting, owned good horses, and were not afraid to ride them.&quot; Major transportation developments for the Township did not occur until the mid-1890s, when trolley service was opened to Newtown Square. Before this time, railroad lines had been proposed, but due to a series of reorganizations and competition between companies for rights of way, as of 1892 no track had been laid. In 1894, however, a mule-drawn service was initiated by the Philadelphia and Delaware County Railroad, with steam dummies used to help out on the hills. Electrification was completed the following year and the trolley was open from Newtown to Fernwood in 1895. By 1889, the reorganized Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company had completed the track to West Chester.

At the turn of the 20th century, the automobile began to disperse the urban populations over the countryside. The trolleys, along with automobiles transformed the country farmers into suburban commuters. Farms were sold and the land subdivided. Newtown Square boomed. Many city dwellers retained their country estates; however, these became hidden amidst gridiron developments. Although construction slackened during the depression, another boom was experienced after World War II.

Today Newtown Township has a land area of , and a population of 15,002 individuals. Some farms and large estates remain, but for the most part, the township was developed into a suburban community with old stone homes and structures dotting the landscape to serve as reminders of days gone by.

===Historic sites===

Five sites in Newtown are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
*Hood Octagonal School (1842) – the last eight-sided one-room school house in Delaware County. Located on West Chester Pike on the grounds of Dunwoody Village.
*Bartram&#x27;s Covered Bridge (1860) – the last remaining covered bridge in Delaware County (spanning Crum Creek – connecting with Chester County), located at Goshen and Boot roads. Restored in 1996.
*Old. St. David&#x27;s Church (1715) – the oldest non-Quaker church in Delaware County, founded by Welsh Anglicans; burial place of General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne, located on S. Valley Forge Road in the very corner of the Township. In March 1880, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow attended the church and wrote the poem &quot;Old St. David&#x27;s at Radnor&quot;.
*Square Tavern (1742) – also known as &quot;The Square Inn&quot; and &quot;John West House&quot; – the childhood site of famous American painter Benjamin West, restored in 1981 and again in 2008, located at the corner of Newtown Street Road (Rt. 252) and Goshen Roads
*Paper Mill House (1770, 1845) – mill workers&#x27; home and general store, restored in the 1980s and now used as museum and headquarters for the Newtown Square Historical Society. Located at St. David&#x27;s and Paper Mill Roads.

==Government==
Newtown is classified as a second class township, having a Board of Supervisors of five members. Supervisors are elected at large by the all registered voting residents of the town for overlapping six-year terms. The board sets policies for the municipality given under the Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code. The current board consists of Chair Leonard B. Altieri, III, Esq., Vice Chair Christina Roberts Lightcap, Supervisor Paul Sanfrancesco, Supervisor Mike Russo, and Supervisor Kathryn V. Chandless, Esq.

Prospect Hill Baptist Church in Prospect Park claims a prominent role in instituting the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on United States coins and currency. A former pastor, Mark R. Watkinson, felt that the Civil War was going to leave the country with a bad name, &quot;brother fighting brother in a civil war&quot;, and wrote a letter to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting &quot;God, Liberty, Law,&quot; be put on the coins. Chase referred the matter to James B. Longacre, Mint Engraver. A committee later settled on &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, and the words first appeared on a 2-cent coin. A plaque on the outside of the church announces the birthplace of the phrase.

<text>Ridley Park is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,002 at the 2010 census. Ridley Park is the home of Boeing&#x27;s CH-47 Chinook helicopter division.
== History ==

===Native American===
The Lenape inhabited the Delaware River region several centuries before the arrival of European explorers and traders. The Okehocking Tribe of the Lenni Lenape Nation established small permanent villages along the river and its main tributaries. Land adjacent to Stoney Creek in Ridley Township has been identified as a Native American town site. Historians also believe that additional villages may have existed at other locations along Stoney Creek and Crum Creek in Ridley Park.
Native Americans significantly influenced the built environment through their network of paths laid out for travel and communication purposes. Their footpaths through the densely forested countryside grew into the first roads of the area. Chester Pike is believed to have developed from a footpath created by the Lenni Lenape as their main thoroughfare in the area.

===Colonial===
The borough is named after a place in Cheshire, England. John Morton, signer of the American Declaration of Independence, was born and raised in a log cabin adjacent to East Ridley Avenue. He later replaced the cabin with a brick house and began farming in the Ridley Park area. Chester Pike, originally a footpath, was realigned and widened by William Penn. Known then as the “Queens Highway,” it was one of the region&#x27;s first roads stretching from Chester to Darby, and by 1715, it reached Philadelphia. General George Washington led his troops down this earthen road to Wilmington and eventually to Brandywine to confront the British in 1777. In 1799, the “Queens Highway” was improved as a plank road, and tolls were levied. The population of the area continued to increase after the American Revolutionary War. Consequently, a private elementary subscription school was founded in 1800 on a site at Chester Pike and Myrtle Avenue. This was one of the first schools in Delaware County.

===Railroad suburb===
Ridley Park was founded by Isaac Hinckley in 1871. He was the President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. He wanted to expand the company&#x27;s rail line to gain more business in the same way the Pennsylvania Railroad had earlier created a Main Line from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia to Paoli. The Pennsylvania Railroad bought up farmland and developed towns all along its rail line. City dwellers, seeking relief from the urban crowds with their potential to spread malaria, a disease that was a major health concern at the time, quickly purchased the new homes being built. 
Seeing the success of this, Hinckley came up with the idea of putting in a rail line that would pass through Darby and continue all the way to the semi-rural city of Chester in what became known as the Darby Improvement Hinckley&#x27;s plans met with initial resistance from farmers, and at the end of the first year, he had managed to buy only one farm. Undaunted, he traveled further south on Chester Pike to the area now known as Ridley Park.
In an effort to avoid his previous bad experience, in May 1871, Hinckley formed an association to acquire the land. Hinckley hired Robert Morris Copeland, a noted Boston landscape architect, to develop a master plan for a suburban park community which became known as the Borough of Ridley Park. Copeland&#x27;s design is Delaware County&#x27;s first planned community. Because of its beautifully landscaped streets and parks, and its man-made lake, Ridley Park became popular in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century as a summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians who built most of the Victorian style homes still lived in today.

Between January and May 1870, many farms were purchased. The streets in the new development were named after the families who sold their farmland. Names such as Burk, Dutton, Free, Henderson, Stewart and Ward, are still used today. The first train of passengers-cars stopped at Ridley Park on October 19, 1872. By that time, the town had a hotel, and a dam had been built across Crum Creek, creating a lake. By 1880, the U.S. census return recorded the population of Ridley Park as 439. The railroad was, and continues today to be an integral part of the town.

====Public schools====
The borough is served by the Ridley School District. It consists of Ridley Township, and the boroughs of Ridley Park and Eddystone. The district has one high school, one middle school, and seven elementary schools. At all levels, the schools use the Green Raiders as their mascot. While originally the Raiders referred to Native Americans from the Lenni Lenape Nation, the district has ceased use of most material relating to the tribe. Ridley High School is home to the WRSD radio station.

====Parochial schools====
The St. James Regional, formerly St. Madeline-St. Rose School, serves grades 1st through 8. Originally, these were two separate parishes but in 1993, with declining enrollments, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia consolidated the St. Madeline Parish in Ridley Park, and the St. Rose of Lima Parish in nearby Eddystone. The Archdiocese had an area wide consolidation of schools due to declining enrollment. The school is now called St. James Regional School after combining with St. Gabriel&#x27;s in Norwood in 2012. The name originated from the former St. James High School for Boys in Chester. The St. James High alumni association suggested the name, and the new school asked to use not only the name but also the mascot and colors. When it opened it had 402 students, with around 201 being from St. Gabriel.

Cardinal O&#x27;Hara High School, serving grades 9 through 12, is a coeducational school located in Springfield, and serves the Ridley Park, Chester, Swarthmore, and Springfield area.

<doc id="132442" wikidata="Q1181867" url="?curid=132442" title="Rose Valley, Pennsylvania">
<text>Rose Valley is a small, historic borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its area is , and the population was 913 at the 2010 census. The area was settled by Quaker farmers in 1682, and later water mills along Ridley Creek drove manufacturing in the nineteenth century.

In 1901, Rose Valley was founded as an Arts and Crafts community by architect William Lightfoot Price, who bought of land around the former Rose Valley textile mill. Price was a follower of Henry George&#x27;s economics (Georgism). Price also co-founded Arden, Delaware, a utopian single tax community based on Henry George&#x27;s economic model. Nevertheless, the Georgist single-tax ideal was never implemented in Rose Valley. Crafts works soon foundered, leaving a legacy of impressive architecture, a preserved landscape, and a regional theatre, the Hedgerow Theatre (founded in 1923), as well as an artistic community that includes writers, painters, and architects. As a former mayor said, &quot;Rose Valley is an island of non-conformity.&quot; The Rose Valley Historic District, covering essentially all of the borough, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

==History==
Native Americans of the Leni Lenape or Delaware tribe lived in the area when Europeans began arriving. A major trade route, the Great Minquas Path, passed through the site of the present borough, along Long Point, a hairpin turn in Ridley Creek, and then across the creek and through the center of the borough. Furs were carried along the path from Native Americans on the Susquehanna River to European traders on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers.

Soon after William Penn received his charter for the Colony of Pennsylvania, three brothers, Thomas, Robert, and Randall Vernon, received land grants from Penn to settle over in the present borough of Rose Valley and Nether Providence Township. The brothers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1682 and began farming the area, about north of Chester, which was then the largest settlement in the colony. Though the brothers purchased their land in 1681 while still in London, the land was not surveyed and patents were not granted for the land until years, perhaps decades, later. The Providence Great Road (now PA 252), just to the north of the borough, was laid out in the 1680s, and Brookhaven Road, on the borough&#x27;s eastern boundary, was laid out in 1705.

Randall Vernon&#x27;s house was built before 1700, and still stands. Robert Vernon may have built the house known as the &quot;Bishop White House&quot; about 1695. The name of the house comes from its use by the family of Bishop William White during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 in Philadelphia. Though the bishop visited the house, he generally stayed in Philadelphia in 1793. William Lightfoot Price modified this house after 1900, adding a stone porch and red tile roof. The Vernon families continued living in the area into the nineteenth century. The American Revolution split family members, who served as soldiers on both the American and British sides.

Many veterans of the Revolution are buried in now unmarked graves in the cemetery of the Old Union Methodist Church, the only church in the borough. The roots of the church may go back to 1804, and it was officially organized in 1811. The current building dates to 1835.

Following the Revolution, land in the southwest corner of the present borough was confiscated from a Vernon family member who had supported the British. The land was eventually sold to Jacob Benninghove, a Philadelphia tobacconist, who built a large mansion there in 1787. About the same time, he built a dam on Ridley Creek and a water-powered snuff mill. Samuel Bancroft bought the house in 1831 and named it Todmorden Mansion. He lost the house in bankruptcy in 1842, but bought it back in 1857 and lived there until 1889. He built tunnels and secret chambers in the house for use in the Underground Railroad.

==Mills==

At least three mills operated in the area of Rose Valley. Little remains except a silted-in dam pond of what may have been the earliest mill, located on Vernon Run near the present Pool and Tennis Club. Near the Bishop White House, on Ridley Creek, the remains of a dam and millrace can be seen leading up to the &quot;Old Mill&quot;, which is now used as the town hall. Benninghove&#x27;s snuff mill was likely built here c. 1789. Between 1826 and 1850, it was run as a paper mill. It was reconstructed as a textile mill in 1861 and burned down in 1885. After 1900, William Lightfoot Price built a furniture mill or craft shop on the foundations and later it was used as a meeting hall. After extensive fire damage, it was reconstructed into today&#x27;s town hall.

Hutton&#x27;s mill, on Rose Valley Road by Vernon Run, was built &quot;circa&quot; 1840 as a feed mill. In 1847, it became a turning mill. It was used to produce bobbins for the nearby textile mill as well as serving as a warehouse. Later, it produced sandpaper. William Lightfoot Price also reconstructed this mill into a meeting house and theater. It also suffered fire damage, was again reconstructed, and now houses the Hedgerow Theatre.

==Arts and Crafts project==
Under the leadership of William Lightfoot Price, the Rose Valley Association was formed in July 1901 to start an intentional community based on the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement. The association bought approximately of land, an area that is the nucleus of today&#x27;s borough. Investors contributed about $25,000 in capital, including $9,000 borrowed from nearby Swarthmore College to buy and improve the land. Price&#x27;s vision placed artisan workshops at the center of the community, thus aligning with the socialist utopia that Arts and Crafts proponent William Morris described in his novel, &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;.

Price&#x27;s liberal views led to some misconceptions about the project, according to his niece Eleanore Price Mather: &quot;First, it was not a free love colony. Second it was not single tax ... And third, it was not communistic. Rose Valley was essentially an arts and crafts project.&quot;

Price had led a discussion group, including Edward Bok and brothers Samuel and Joseph Fels, and many in this group became investors or residents in Rose Valley. Other early residents included Hawley McLanahan, who became Price&#x27;s architectural partner; McLanahan&#x27;s father-in-law Charles T. Schoen; Price&#x27;s employees at his architectural firm; and his relatives, including his brother Walter, also an architect. Feminist Anna Howard Shaw lived nearby. Administration of the project was in the form of a town meeting, called the &quot;Folk Mote&quot;.
The Rose Valley Association did not produce arts and crafts itself, but rather rented out working space to craftsmen, and provided them housing, generally designed or renovated by Price. The crafts were sold from Price&#x27;s office at 1624 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. Furniture, as well as ceramics and book binding, were produced at the Old Mill until about 1907. A journal, &quot;The Artsman&quot;, was published from 1903 to 1907. An art gallery was located in the old bobbin mill, then called &quot;Artsman&#x27;s Hall&quot;, and, starting in 1904, run by well-known artist Alice Barber Stephens, who lived in the mill until a nearby barn was converted by Price into her house, Thunderbird Lodge. Artsman&#x27;s Hall was also used for theater, with the first play &quot;The Carpet Bagger&#x27;s Revenge&quot; presented on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1904. Eventually the building became used solely by the Hedgerow Theatre, which is still active.

By 1910, however, craft production had faded and the community had become essentially a commuter suburb of Philadelphia, using the nearby Moylan - Rose Valley Station. The buildings designed or renovated by Price during this period may be Rose Valley&#x27;s major achievement. According to George E. Thomas, &quot;Rose Valley is of exceptional importance, a major American architectural landmark.&quot;

After 1910 Schoen, McLanahan, and Price bought the remaining land from the Rose Valley Association, and Price designed the &quot;Rose Valley Improvement Company Houses&quot; near the old bobbin mill. As a group, these are the most important group of houses designed, rather than renovated, by Price in Rose Valley.

In 1926 a Pennsylvania State historic marker was installed on Rose Valley Road to the south of Thunderbird Lodge. It commemorates the Great Minquas Path, a Native American trail that ran nearby. It features a sculpture of a beaver by Albert Laessle.
==Transportation==

As of 2008 there were of public roads in Rose Valley, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

No numbered highways serve Rose Valley directly. Main thoroughfares include Rose Valley Road, which follows a northwest-to-southeast alignment through the heart of the borough, and Brookhaven Road, which follows a northeast-to-southwest alignment along the southeastern edge of the borough.

<text>Rutledge is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 782 at the 2020 census, down from 860 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
Rutledge was founded in 1885 by a group of Philadelphia businessmen, and incorporated as a borough in 1887. A promotional brochure produced in 1897 described the community as follows:

&quot;Located ten miles from Philadelphia, on the line of the Central Division of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, three minutes walk from Morton Station – it is reached in from 20 to 30 minutes by 21 trains daily… To the west lies the magnificent Swarthmore College, and to the southeast, three miles away, lies the Delaware River... its school is one of the finest in the county; its houses are neat and attractive, and their owners take great pride in their homes and the adornment of their grounds.&quot;

Since then, there have been a few name changes. The train line is SEPTA&#x27;s Media/Wawa Line, which provides 26 trains on weekdays from Philadelphia to what is now called the Morton-Rutledge Station. But in many ways, this description still holds true today. The schools in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District are among the finest in the state, and the homes, many of them dating back to the late 19th century, are still kept with pride by their owners.
There is a long-standing legend that the borough was named after Ann Rutledge, the first-love of Abraham Lincoln. This erroneous story is perpetuated in the Keystone Marker that greets those approaching Rutledge from the south on Morton Avenue. The actual story, according to the founders&#x27; brochure, is that the town was named after a then-popular romantic novel &quot;Rutledge&quot; written by Miriam Coles Harris published in 1860. However, the site of what is now Rutledge borough was once a section of land on the estate of Edward Rutledge, who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from South Carolina and was the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence.

In 1958, George Raymond, the president of the NAACP Chester branch, purchased a house in Rutledge. The day before he was to move in, a fire burned down the house. After the fire, the township attempted to exercise eminent domain and claim Raymond&#x27;s property as a site for a new town hall. Raymond threatened legal action and the township backed down. The house was rebuilt and Raymond took residence in the house in 1959.

<text>Springfield Township, or simply Springfield, is a township in Delaware County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The population was 25,070 at the 2020 census. Springfield is a suburb of Philadelphia, located about west of the city.

==History==
First settled by Quakers who arrived in Pennsylvania with William Penn, Springfield was first recognized as a governmental entity in 1686. Many of the streets in Springfield are named after former prominent citizens, including Kennerly, Lownes, Levis, Maris, Thomas, Beatty, Lewis, Foulke, Evans, Powell, Pancoast, Worrell, and Edge. Originally, Springfield was primarily a farming town.

On December 9, 1687, the settlers began laying the road to Amosland as it was then called. This road is now known as Springfield Road. In 1701 construction began on the Baltimore Pike; the road was formed of sturdy oak planks, some of which still exist under the current Baltimore Pike. 1701 also marked the year that construction began on the first Quaker meeting house. The meeting house burned in 1737 and was rebuilt. The current meeting house that stands in its spot was constructed in 1851.

By the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, it is estimated from tax records that about 300 people resided in Springfield.

By the 19th century, Springfield had become more industrialized. Taking advantage of its many creeks for power, the inhabitants erected many mills. Well-known mill owners included William Fell, Samuel Pancoast, William Beatty, Samuel Levis, and Moses and Emanuel Hey.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Springfield&#x27;s Baltimore Pike had become one of the busiest commercial areas outside of Philadelphia. The long, straight stretch of Baltimore Pike in the township was referred to as &quot;The Golden Mile&quot;, commonly known for its many automobile dealerships. Baltimore Pike remains true to its history with many dealerships lining the side of the road. The Golden Mile is a unique corridor that is essentially a compact commercial strip that cuts directly through bedroom communities on both sides. Residents are currently attempting to undo the emblematic effects of urban sprawl along the mile through the implementation of green initiatives, responsible traffic planning, and zoning improvements.

In the past century, all of Springfield&#x27;s farmland was slowly bought up by developers who turned Springfield into the town it is today, that is, largely comprising developments of standard suburban single-family homes. One of the largest single developments was the Stoney Creek development. Construction began in 1949 and was completed in only five years. The huge development stretched from West Avenue to Providence Road and ran all the way up to Baltimore Pike. Over 75 homes were constructed in the development. Similar to most housing developments of their time, no two houses in Stoney Creek were built exactly the same. While all resemble each other with their stone fronts and common size, additional luxuries such as porches and window placement were available for purchase to make each one slightly individualized.

Though all of the farmland of Springfield&#x27;s past is gone, many of the woods and fields of the past still remain standing today in some of the many parks located throughout the community.

The bulk of Springfield&#x27;s history lies recorded in the archives of the Heritage Society of Springfield, and the Springfield Township Public Library (a member of the Delaware County Library System).

Springfield has three sister cities, Lisbon, Portugal, Lima, Peru, and Vancouver, Canada.

<text>Swarthmore ( , ) is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Swarthmore was originally named Westdale in honor of painter Benjamin West, who was one of the early residents of the town.

==History==

Originally, the area belonged to the Lenape people. It was settled in the late 1600s by Quakers after William Penn granted them the land. By the early 1800s, it was still mainly farmland, and was known as Westdale in honor of local artist Benjamin West. It was part of Springfield Township, but the area began to become a distinct town after Swarthmore College was founded in 1864. The advent of passenger rail service from Philadelphia in the 1880s greatly enhanced the desirability of the borough as a commuter suburb, and the borough was incorporated in 1893. 

About one third of the borough&#x27;s land area consists of the Swarthmore College campus. Many of the streets in the southern half of town are named for eastern colleges, and much of the borough&#x27;s housing stock dates from the Victorian period through the 1920s.

==History==
Thornbury Township lies in the drainage area of the Delaware River, named in honor of Thomas West, governor of the colony of Virginia. The river and its bay were explored by Henry Hudson in 1609, and over the next several decades the region was variously claimed by the Swedes, the Dutch, and the English. Its original human inhabitants were the Lenni-Lenape tribe of American Indians.

Once the Dutch were defeated, King Charles II of England made his grant to William Penn in order to found the colony which came to be named Pennsylvania. The land within the present boundaries of Thornbury Township was taken up by &quot;first purchasers&quot; from William Penn. The original grant documents were copper-plate prints on parchment; some still survive and show a price of 100 English pounds for .

The Court of Equity in Chester recognized a separate Thornbury Township in 1687, and appointed township officers. At the time, the area was in Chester County, one of the original counties chartered by William Penn; Delaware County had not yet been formed. Thornbury was named after the English birthplace of the wife of George Pearce, who in 1685 had been granted title to in the township.

The Battle of Brandywine, the only major battle of the American Revolution fought in Pennsylvania, was within sight and sound of the western part of the township; follow-up military operations took place in the township (see below).

In 1769, the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized the division of Chester County and the creation of Delaware County. In plotting the boundary between the two, Thornbury Township was divided. Border landowners were asked if they wished to remain in Chester County or be in Delaware County. The line thus drawn was quite irregular, and as a result, the northern boundary of the Delaware County township (like the southern boundary of its Chester County counterpart) is distinctly jagged (see map).

Thornbury Township was enlarged by annexing the northern portion of Aston Township in 1837; that township was dissolved. The boundaries of Thornbury have remained unchanged since. The township is the location of &quot;Thornbury&quot; house, home of Revolutionary War figure Persifor Frazer. After the Battle of Brandywine, his wife Mary stood down a British raiding party in a celebrated incident. The house and barn survived the war, but are now in ruins.

Chester Creek Historic District, John Cheney Log Tenant House and Farm, Melrose, and Thornton Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In September 2000, the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma received 11.5 acres of land in Thornbury Township.

<text>Upland is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Upland is governed by an elected seven-member borough council. The population was 3,239 at the 2010 census, up from 2,974 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Upland is located in southern Delaware County at (39.856762, -75.379429). It is bordered to the west by Chester Township, to the north by the boroughs of Brookhaven and Parkside, and to the northeast, east, and south by the city of Chester. Chester Creek, a southeastward-flowing tributary of the Delaware River, forms the southern boundary of the borough.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The first European settlers in this area were from the Swedish colony of New Sweden. They arrived in the area in 1643 and built a permanent settlement at Tinicum Island. Although the name literally means &quot;up land&quot;, it also reflects the Swedish province of Uppland.

The settlement of Upland was built around the point where Chester Creek flows into the Delaware River, which is part of the city of Chester, formerly also called &quot;Upland&quot;. The colonists had plantations devoted to the cultivation of tobacco for export to Sweden. Upland was reflected on the early map of New Sweden made by Peter Lindstrom in 1654.

During this period, three governments were competing for colonial supremacy in the mid-Atlantic coastal area: the Dutch, the Swedish and the English. The Swedish settlement was incorporated into Dutch New Netherland on September 15, 1655. In 1664, the English captured New Netherland from the Dutch. In 1676, the Duke of York&#x27;s laws were promulgated as the rule of conduct on the Delaware River, and courts were established, one of which was the Upland.

By the mid-1800s, the Upland Mills were built along Chester Creek in Upland by the wealthy textile manufacturer John Price Crozer. The mills produced clothing for the US Army and other customers.

The borough of Upland was founded May 24, 1869.
The John P. Crozer II Mansion, George K. Crozer Mansion, Caleb Pusey House, Old Main of the Crozer Theological Seminary, and Pusey-Crozier Mill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Pusey House is one of the oldest buildings in the United States, completed in 1696, and one of the only extant buildings known to have been visited by William Penn (in addition to the Merion Friends Meeting House).

==Education==
Residents in Upland are zoned to the Chester-Upland School District. Main Street Elementary School is the elementary school in Upland. Residents are also zoned to Smedley Middle School and Chester High School.

Crozer Theological Seminary was a multi-denominational religious institution built in 1858 by the wealthy industrialist John Price Crozer. Its most famous student was Martin Luther King Jr., who graduated in 1951 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree.

In 1970, the school was moved to Rochester, New York in a merger that formed the Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School. The Old Main Building of the Crozer Theological Seminary was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The seminary grounds are part of the Crozer Arboretum and the Old Main building is part of the Crozer-Chester Medical Center.

<text>Upper Chichester Township is a civil township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 16,738 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Lenni Lenape Indians were the earliest occupants of Upper Chichester. They erected several semi-permanent villages in the area tied to fishing and hunting cycles with some farming.

The Upper Chichester area was claimed by New Sweden in 1643 and the Dutch in 1654, but both nations were primary interested in trading with the Lenni Lenape Indians.

The first European settlers to Upper Chichester were in 1681 under the Penn&#x27;s Grant of land to William Penn from King Charles II. The first purchasers under Penn&#x27;s authority were fourteen English and Welshmen, mostly Quakers.

Upper Chichester Township was originally part of the section of Chester County called Chichester. Chichester comprised the area now known as Upper and Lower Chichester. It is named after the town Chichester in West Sussex, England from which many of its settlers came from.

Upper Chichester Township, at the time called &quot;Chichester Liberty,&quot; is considered by most to be one of the first settlements within the land grant of Pennsylvania.

Among the earliest settlers of the township was Walter Martin, the founder of St. Martin&#x27;s Church, in the late 17th century. The road from Chichester to Aston traversing the township almost due north, was laid out 1688, while the Upper Chichester road was laid out on October 25, 1687. At the southwestern limit of the territory was a tract of , which was located September 5 and 6, 1681. The &quot;Twelve-Mile Circle&quot; (the circular northern boundary line of the state of Delaware) traverses this tract.

The division of Chichester into Upper and Lower Chichester was made early in 1700 to facilitate public business. In 1753, an effort was made to have the division officially recognized. The movement was, however, met by sturdy opposition from the leading citizens and land-owners of Lower Chichester, stating that the township as it currently stood was convenient enough and did not need any separation. They further argued that recent work to mend the highways in Lower Chichester, and the need to provide for several poor in the township were more important uses of funds than the cost of the survey.

The matter was permitted to drag along for six years, during which time the reasons for the official recognition of the separation of the two townships became apparent to all. In August 1759, a petition to formally separate the two townships was presented, bearing the signatures of almost every freeholder in Upper and Lower Chichester as well as those in Nether Providence.

Edwin Booth, a significant land owner within Upper Chichester Township, is the namesake for the town of Boothwyn within Upper Chichester Township Boundaries. Local Pennsylvania Amish market &quot;Booth&#x27;s Corner&quot; also inherit&#x27;s his name and rests on the upper left corner of Booth&#x27;s former land holdings.

Upper Chichester became a first class township on December 30, 1941.

The Chichester Friends Meetinghouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Upper Darby Township, often shortened to Upper Darby, is a home rule township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the township had a total population of 85,681, making it the state&#x27;s sixth-most populated municipality after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Reading, and Erie. Upper Darby borders Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-most populous city, and constitutes part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, the nation&#x27;s seventh-largest metropolitan area.

Upper Darby is home to the Tower Theater, a historic music venue on 69th Street built in the 1920s, and to several Underground Railroad sites. In August 2019, the radio tower on top of the theater was removed due to structural concerns.

==History==
===Settlement and 17th century===
In 1650, the area that eventually became Upper Darby had been inhabited by the Lenape tribe of Native Americans for thousands of years. The Lenape were part of the larger late Woodland culture, living in longhouses and birch bark homes, and engaging in the type of agriculture featuring companion planting of the Three Sisters (winter squash, maize, and beans).

The first permanent Europeans settlers arrived in late 1653 with a group from New Sweden. Soon after, in 1655, New Sweden was taken over by the Dutch, and then came under English rule in October 1664 as part of England&#x27;s overall conquest of New Amsterdam. The region was controlled as a possession of the English king until it was included in a large land grant to William Penn in 1681.

Upon Penn&#x27;s founding of the colony of Pennsylvania the next year, the area was designated as part of the municipality of Darby Township, in Chester County. It was subsequently part of the eastern section of that county which was split off on September 26, 1789, to form Delaware County.

The Lower Swedish Cabin, thought to have been built in 1654, is located on Creek Road along the Darby Creek and is believed by many to be a remnant of the early Swedes, who introduced the log cabin to this area. Today the &quot;Swedish Cabin&quot; is designated with a Pennsylvania Historical Marker. The Cabin is also on the National Register of Historic Places.

===18th century===

Darby Township originally occupied the area between the current border of Upper Darby to the north, Cobbs Creek and then Darby Creek to the east and south, and Ridley and Springfield townships to the west. This continued until 1747, when, for the convenience of the inhabitants, it was decided at a town meeting to separate the upper part from the lower &quot;in all matters save the levies made for the support of the poor,&quot; with the northern part thereafter to be called Upper Darby Township. The exact boundary was not established until 1786, when a petition was presented to the court. The following is an excerpt from this petition:

The abundance of creeks and streams in the area favored the development of mills, and it was in Upper Darby that some of the first mills in Delaware County could be found. Some notable examples were the Cardington Mills in the Cardington section of the township and the Kent Mills in the Kellyville section. The site of the former Kent Mills is now a recreation area and dog park known as Kent Park. One local mill owner was the Garrett family, who owned mills along the Darby Creek.

===19th century===
In addition to mills, the township was part of a region that was home to rock quarries, factories, and other various industrial concerns. Industrialization greatly increased the township&#x27;s population from just over 800 in 1800 to almost 5,000 by 1890 and spurred residential and commercial development that attracted an influx of European immigrants. To serve this influx, churches were founded across the township.

The township&#x27;s population explosion turned out to be a double-edged sword as beginning in 1885, the township lost large sections of territory as the citizens of more populated neighborhoods petitioned the state to be recognized as separate municipalities. The first of these was the borough of Clifton Heights (incorporated on June 1, 1885), followed by the boroughs of Lansdowne (July 6, 1893), Aldan (September 22, 1893), Millbourne (October 12, 1909), and East Lansdowne (June 3, 1911). Part of the territory of Aldan was also taken from Darby Township.

Reflecting the Quaker background of its earliest English settlers, Upper Darby was active in the antislavery movement. At least one abolition society existed prior to 1830, and sent a committee of twelve prominent citizens to the 1830 meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia.

Many homes in the area were stops on the Underground Railroad, including Hoodland, the home of abolitionist Abraham L. Pennock and Thomas Pennock, which was eventually bequeathed to the township&#x27;s public library and which currently houses the children&#x27;s library, connected to a much larger modern annex which houses the Main Branch. Another prominent abolitionist, Thomas Garrett, grew up in Upper Darby and Thornfield, his home until the age of 32, still stands at Garrett Road and Maple Avenue in the Drexel Hill neighborhood.

The influx of immigrants drawn to the township by industrialization caused the township&#x27;s population to explode, and also gave Upper Darby a role in the Civil War. Two regiments from Upper Darby took part in the American Civil War, including the 106th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, which was involved in the Battle of Antietam and Battle of Gettysburg.

In addition to mills, the township was part of a region that was home to rock quarries, factories, and other various industrial concerns. Industrialization greatly increased the township&#x27;s population from just over 800 in 1800 to almost 5,000 by 1890 and spurred residential and commercial development that attracted an influx of European immigrants. To serve this influx, churches were founded across the township.

Part of the territory of Aldan was also taken from Darby Township.

===20th century===
In 1907, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company recognized the potential for growth in the township and extended the Market-Frankford elevated train line, or the &quot;El&quot;, from just west of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia to 69th and Market Streets in Upper Darby. The El terminus at 69th Street Station became a busy terminal serving several trolley and light rail lines into the suburbs, as well as numerous city and suburban bus routes. Commuter traffic spurred the development of the 69th St. shopping district in the 1920s by John McClatchy, and made Upper Darby the second-busiest shopping area in the region after Center City Philadelphia. The business district is noted for many fine examples of Art Deco style buildings. A population explosion in the township followed; by the 1960s, Upper Darby was the seventh-most populous municipality in Pennsylvania.

In the early 1970s, students from Highland Park Elementary School began a campaign to have the Pennsylvania Firefly declared the official state insect of Pennsylvania. With advice and support from state legislators, the students began a campaign that included letter writing, the circulation of petitions, and the distribution of bumper stickers. On April 10, 1974, Governor Milton J. Shapp signed their bill making the Pennsylvania Firefly their state&#x27;s official insect. A couple of years later, Highland Park Elementary School was presented with a bronze plaque in honor of the students&#x27; achievement.

===21st century===
In the wake of the 2020 racial uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd, several protests and actions took place in Upper Darby, including a die-in at 69th and Market Streets.

In 2020, the community voted on a motto for Upper Darby, &quot;The World in One Place,&quot; reflecting the multicultural community of the present day.

Upper Darby has seen a rise in LGBTQ activism of late, and Upper Darby Pride, a non-profit organization planned the first Upper Darby Pride Fest for June 2020. It was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it was held a year later by U.D.T.J. on the grounds of Upper Darby High School and accompanied by other Pride events in the township.

In 2023, the Pride celebration in Upper Darby grew into what is now Delaware County Pride. Delaware County Pride hosted its inaugural festival in Downtown Upper Darby June 10, 2023.

==Paper mill==
The major industry in Johnsonburg is paper, with the largest mill owned by the Domtar Corporation. It was built more than a century ago, originally owned principally by the Armstrong family of Philadelphia (1888). By 1890 the Armstrong&#x27;s had merged with the paper mills owned by Augustus Paine of New York to become the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Company. The Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; purchased the mill in 1925. By 1950, it was believed to be the largest coated paper mill in the world. By the end of 1960s, Curtis Publishing filed for bankruptcy and closed the mill. Six months later, investors, including industrialist George S. Petty, formed a group called Penntech Papers, to purchase the mill assets, and continued it in operation for the next 20 years. In 1990, Penntech sold the mill to Willamette Industries, which was acquired by Weyerhaeuser in February 2002 in a hostile takeover and then in 2007 was acquired by Domtar.
Paper Excellence acquired Domtar in 2021 for $3 billion cash.

<text>Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte (; ; 19 January 1798 – 5 September 1857) was a French philosopher, mathematician and writer who formulated the doctrine of positivism. He is often regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte&#x27;s ideas were also fundamental to the development of sociology, with him inventing the very term and treating the discipline as the crowning achievement of the sciences.

Influenced by Henri de Saint-Simon, Comte&#x27;s work attempted to remedy the social disorder caused by the French Revolution, which he believed indicated an imminent transition to a new form of society. He sought to establish a new social doctrine based on science, which he labeled &quot;positivism&quot;. He had a major impact on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and George Eliot. His concept of &quot;Sociology&quot; and social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer, evolving into modern academic sociology presented by Émile Durkheim as practical and objective social research.

Comte&#x27;s social theories culminated in his &quot;Religion of Humanity&quot;, which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organizations in the 19th century. He may also have coined the word &quot;altruism&quot; (altruism).

==Life==
Auguste Comte was born in Montpellier, Hérault on 19 January 1798, at the time under the rule of the newly founded French First Republic. After attending the Lycée Joffre and then the University of Montpellier, Comte was admitted to École Polytechnique in Paris. The École Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of republicanism and progress. The École closed in 1816 for reorganization, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the École Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission.

Following his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his Catholic and monarchist family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. Comte had abandoned Catholicism under the influence of his first teacher and Protestant pastor Daniel Encontre.

In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 Rue Bonaparte in Paris&#x27;s 6th arrondissement (where he lived until 1822). Later that year he became a student and secretary to Henri de Saint-Simon, who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time, Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, &quot;L&#x27;Industrie&quot;, &quot;Le Politique&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Organisateur&quot; (Charles Dunoyer and Charles Comte&#x27;s &quot;Le Censeur Européen&quot;), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819&#x27;s &quot;La séparation générale entre les opinions et les désirs&quot; (&quot;The general separation of opinions and desires&quot;).

In 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a &quot;Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société&quot; (1822) (&quot;Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society&quot;). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.

Comte married Caroline Massin in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured – only stabilized by French alienist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol – so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the Pont des Arts). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his &quot;Cours.&quot;

Comte developed a close friendship with John Stuart Mill. In 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic Clotilde de Vaux, although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846, this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new &quot;Religion of Humanity&quot;. John Kells Ingram, an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855.
He published four volumes of &quot;Système de politique positive&quot; (1851–1854). His final work, the first volume of &quot;La Synthèse Subjective&quot; (&quot;The Subjective Synthesis&quot;), was published in 1856. Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery, surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux.
His apartment from 1841 to 1857 is now conserved as the Maison d&#x27;Auguste Comte and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in Paris&#x27; 6th arrondissement.

==Work==
===Comte&#x27;s positivism===

Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in &quot;The Course in Positive Philosophy&quot;, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, &quot;A General View of Positivism&quot; (published in English in 1865). The first 3 volumes of the &quot;Course&quot; dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex &quot;Queen science&quot; of human society itself. His work &quot;View of Positivism&quot; would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of the sociological method. 

Comte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general law of three stages.

Comte&#x27;s stages were (1) the &quot;theological&quot; stage, (2) the &quot;metaphysical&quot; stage, and (3) the &quot;positive&quot; stage.
# The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the Age of Enlightenment, in which man&#x27;s place in society and society&#x27;s restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in supernatural power. Fetishism played a significant role during this time.
# By the &quot;Metaphysical&quot; stage, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of Aristotle or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the French Revolution of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of &quot;universal rights&quot; as being on a vaunted higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of the investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of the investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion.
# In the Scientific stage, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of Napoleon, people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of &quot;human rights&quot; or prophecy of &quot;the will of God.&quot; Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard, he was similar to Karl Marx and Jeremy Bentham. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although, from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of classical physics and academic history.
Comte&#x27;s law of three stages was one of the first theories of social evolutionism.

 He once wrote: &#x27;It is evident, the Solar System is badly designed&#x27;

The other universal law he called the &quot;encyclopedic law&quot;. By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics (astronomy, earth science and chemistry) and organic physics (biology and, for the first time, &quot;physique sociale&quot;, later renamed &quot;Sociologie&quot;). Independently from Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès&#x27;s introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented &quot;sociologie&quot;, and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term &quot;social physics&quot;, but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by Adolphe Quetelet.

This idea of a special science (not the humanities, not metaphysics) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term &quot;sociology&quot; (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836). The ambitious (or many would say &#x27;grandiose&#x27;) ways that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered &quot;Anthropology, or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science.&quot;

Comte&#x27;s explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice, and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of Harriet Martineau&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte&quot;, we see his observation that, &quot;If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part, we could not even perceive them.&quot;

Comte&#x27;s emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern functionalism. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte&#x27;s time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition.

His emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA, the Shewhart cycle). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.

The early sociology of Herbert Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms.

Comte&#x27;s fame today owes in part to Émile Littré, who founded &quot;The Positivist Review&quot; in 1867.

Auguste Comte did not create the idea of Sociology, the study of society, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture, but instead, he expanded it greatly. Positivism, the principle of conducting sociology through empiricism and the scientific method, was the primary way that Comte studied sociology. He split sociology into two different areas of study. One, social statics, how society holds itself together, and two, social dynamics, the study of the causes of societal changes. He saw these areas as parts of the same system. Comte compared society and sociology to the human body and anatomy. &quot;Comte ascribed the functions of connection and boundaries to the social structures of language, religion, and division of labor.&quot; Through language, everybody in society, both past, and present, can communicate with each other. Religion unites society under a common belief system and functions in harmony under a system. Finally, the division of labor allows everyone in society to depend upon each other.

===The Utopian Project===
Comte is often disregarded when talking about utopia. However, he made many contributions to utopian literature and influenced the modern-day debate. Some intellectuals allude to the fact that the utopian system of modern life &quot;served as a catalyst for various world-making activities during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries&quot; (Willson, M. 2019) . In this utopian project, Comte introduces three major concepts: altruism, sociocracy, and the religion of Humanity. In the 19th century, Comte coined altruism as &quot;a theory of conduct that regards the good of others as the end of moral action.&quot; (Britannica, T, 2013). Furthermore, Comte explains sociocracy as the governance by people who know each other, friends, or allies. After the French revolution, Comte was looking for a rational basis for government, after developing the Positivism philosophy he developed sociocracy to the &quot;scientific method&quot; of the government.

===The religion of humanity===

In later years, Comte developed the Religion of Humanity for positivist societies to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the &#x27;positivist calendar&#x27;. For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a &quot;good Comte&quot; (the author of the &quot;Course in Positive Philosophy&quot;) and a &quot;bad Comte&quot; (the author of the secular-religious &quot;system&quot;). The &quot;system&quot; was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte&#x27;s English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to &quot;vivre pour autrui&quot; (&quot;live for others&quot;), from which comes the word &quot;altruism&quot;.

===Law of three stages===

Comte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how the history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind. 

The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system &quot;has lost its power&quot; and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. (Lenzer 1975, pg 10) The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an &quot;organic&quot; new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment in society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there need to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a &quot;series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters&quot;. The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.
The Law of Three Stages is split into stages, much like how the human mind changes from stage to stage. The three stages are the theological stage, the metaphysical stage, and the positive stage, also known as the Law of Three Stages. The theological stage happened before the 1300s, in which all societies lived a life that was completely theocentric. The metaphysical stage was when the society seeks universal rights and freedom. With the third and final stage, the positive stage, Comte takes a stand on the question, &quot;how should the relations among philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be seen.&quot; He says that sociology and history are not mutually exclusive, but that history is the method of sociology, thus he calls sociology the &quot;final science&quot;. This positive stage was to solve social problems and forcing these social problems to be fixed without care for &quot;the will of God&quot; or &quot;human rights&quot;. Comte finds that these stages can be seen across different societies across all of history.

==== Theological stage ====
The first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because &quot;the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents&quot;. The Theological Stage is the &quot;necessary starting point of human intelligence&quot; when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena. In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved of this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena were caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon&#x27;s philosophy that &quot;there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts&quot;, but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories. &quot;For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other&quot;. Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been &quot;incapable of remembering facts&quot;, and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life. Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary at the beginning of the developing primitive mind.

The first theological state is the necessary starting point of human intelligence. The human mind primarily focuses its attention on the &quot;inner nature of beings and to the first and final causes of all phenomena it observes.&quot; (Ferre 2) This means that the mind is looking for the cause and effect of an action that will govern the social world. Therefore, it &quot;represents these phenomena as being produced by a direct and continuous action of more or less numerous supernatural agents, whose arbitrary interventions explain all the apparent anomalies of the universe.&quot; (Ferre 2)

This primary subset of the theological state is known as fetishism, where the phenomena must be caused and created by a theological supernatural being such as God, making humans view every event in the universe as a direct will from these supernatural agents. Some people believed in souls or spirits that possessed inanimate objects and practiced Animism. These natural spiritual beings who possessed souls and may exist apart from the material bodies were capable of interacting with humans, therefore requiring sacrifices and worship to please the agents.

With all these new reasons behind phenomena, numerous fetishisms occur, needing several gods to continue to explain events. 
People begin to believe that every object or event has a unique god attached to it. This belief is called polytheism. The mind &quot;substituted the providential action of a single being for the varied play of numerous independent gods which have been imagined by the primitive mind.&quot;

These Gods often took on both human and animal resemblance. In Egypt, there were multiple gods with animal body parts such as Ra, who had the head of a hawk and had sun associations with the Egyptians. The polytheistic Greeks had several gods such as Poseidon who controlled the sea and Demeter who was the goddess of fertility. However, with all these new gods governing the phenomena of society, the brain can get confused with the numerous gods it needs to remember.

The human mind eliminates this problem by believing in a sub-stage called monotheism. Rather than having multiple gods, there is simply one all-knowing and omnipotent God who is the center of power controlling the world. This creates harmony with the universe because everything is under one ruler. This leaves no confusion of how to act or who is the superior ruler out of the several gods seen in polytheism. The theological state functions well as the first state of the mind when making a belief about an event because it creates a temporary placeholder for the cause of the action which can later be replaced. By allowing the brain to think of the reason behind phenomena, the polytheistic gods are fillers that can be replaced by monotheistic gods.

The theological stage shows how the primitive mind views supernatural phenomena and how it defines and sorts the causes. &quot;The earliest progress of the human mind could only have been produced by the theological method, the only method which can develop spontaneously. It alone has the important property of offering us a provisional theory,… which immediately groups the first facts, with its help, by cultivating our capacity for observation, we were able to prepare the age of a wholly positive philosophy.&quot; (Comte 149)

Comte believed the theological stage was necessary because of the foundational belief that man&#x27;s earliest philosophy of explanation is the act of connecting phenomena around him to his own actions; that man may &quot;apply the study of external nature to his own&quot;. This first stage is necessary to remove mankind from the &quot;vicious circle in which it was confined by the two necessities of observing first, in order to form conceptions, and of forming theories first, in order to observe&quot;. Additionally, the theological stage is able to organize society by directing &quot;the first social organization, as it first forms a system of common opinions, and by forming such a system&quot;. Though, according to Comte, it could not last, this stage was able to establish an intellectual unity that made an impressive political system. The theological state was also necessary for human progress on account that it creates a class in a society dedicated to &quot;speculative activity&quot;. It is in this way that Comte sees the theological stage continue to exist into the Enlightenment. Comte momentarily admires the theological stage for its remarkable ability to enact this activity amidst a time when it was argued to be impractical. It is to this stage that the human mind owes &quot;the first effectual separation between theory and practice, which could take place in no other manner&quot; other than through the institution provided by the theological stage.

The Theological Stage is the stage that was seen primarily among the civilizations in the distant past. Having been used before the 1300s, this is a very basic view of the world with little to no involvement in the world of science, and a world of illusions and delusions, as Freud would put it. To seek the nature of all beings, mankind puts its focus on sentiments, feelings, and emotions. This turned mankind towards theology and the creation of gods to answer all their questions.

The Theological Stage is broken into three sections:
# Fetishism is the philosophy in which mankind puts the power of a god into an inanimate object. Every object could hold this power of a god, so it started to confuse those who believed in Fetishism and created multiple gods.
# Polytheism is, in basic terms, the belief in an order of multiple gods who rule over the universe. Within polytheism, each god is assigned a specific thing in which they are the good of. Examples of this would be the Greek god, Zeus, the god of the sky/lightning, or Ra, the sun god, in Egyptian mythology. A group of priests was often assigned to these gods to offer sacrifices and receive blessings from those gods, but once again, because of the innumerable number of gods, it got confusing, so civilization turned to Monotheism.
# Monotheism is the belief in one, all-powerful God who rules over every aspect of the universe. The removal of an emotional and imaginational aspects of both Fetishism and Polytheism resulted in intellectual awakening. This removal allowed for the Enlightenment to occur as well as the expansion of the scientific world. With the Enlightenment came many famous philosophers who brought about a great change in the world. This is the reason why &quot;Monotheism is the climax of the theological stage of thinking.&quot;

==== Metaphysical or abstract stage ====
The second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an &quot;abstract entity&quot;; it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own.

The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because &quot;Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible&quot;, and their &quot;conceptions are so radically opposed in character&quot;, human intelligence must have a gradual transition. Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity. The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through &quot;over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question&quot;. The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage.

In understanding Comte&#x27;s argument, it is important to note that Comte explains the theological and positive stages first and only then returns to explain the metaphysical stage. His rationale in this decision is that &quot;any intermediate state can be judged only after a precise analysis of two extremes&quot;. Only upon arrival to the rational positive state can the metaphysical state be analyzed, serving only a purpose of aiding in the transition from the theological to a positive state. Furthermore, this state &quot;reconciles, for a time, the radical opposition of the other two, adapting itself to the gradual decline of the one and the preparatory rise of the other&quot;. Therefore, the transition between the two states is almost unperceivable. Unlike its predecessor and successor, the metaphysical state does not have a strong intellectual foundation nor social power for a political organization. Rather it simply serves to guide man until the transition from imaginative theological state to rational positive state is complete.

==== Positive stage ====
The last stage – the positive stage – is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world. This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was &quot;the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge&quot; because it organized all of human behavior.

The final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena. Humans realize that laws exist and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation.

Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage. He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the &quot;science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes&quot;, is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe. Astronomy is the most simple science and is the first &quot;to be subjected to positive theories&quot;. Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the &quot;general laws of the inorganic world&quot;, and are harder to distinguish. Physiology completes the system of natural sciences and is the most important of all sciences because it is the &quot;only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves&quot;. This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace.

It is through observation that humanity is able to gather knowledge. The only way within society to gather evidence and build upon what we do not already know to strengthen society is to observe and experience our situational surroundings. &quot;In the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of phenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them; likewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones,&quot; The imperfection of humanity is not a result of the way we think, rather our perspective that guides the way we think.

Comte expresses the idea that we have to open our eyes to different ideas and ways to evaluate our surroundings such as focusing outside of the simple facts and abstract ideas but instead dive into the supernatural. This does not make mean that what is around us is not critical to look out for as our observations are critical assets to our thinking. The things that are &quot;lost&quot; or knowledge that is in the past are still relevant to recent knowledge. It is what is before our time that guides why things are the way they are today. We would always be relying on our own facts and would never hypothesize to reveal the supernatural if we do not observe.

Observing strives to further our thinking processes. According to Comte, &quot;&#x27;The dead govern the living,&#x27; which is likely a reference to the cumulative nature of positivism and the fact that our current world is shaped by the actions and discoveries of those who came before us,&quot; As this is true, the observations only relevant to humanity and not abstractly related to humanity are distinct and seen situationally. The situation leads to human observation as a reflection of the tension in society can be reviewed, overall helping to enhance knowledge development.

Upon our observation skills, our thinking shifts. As thinkers and observers, we switch from trying to identify truth and turn toward the rationality and reason nature brings, giving us the ability to observe. This distinct switch takes on the transition from the abstract to the supernatural.

&quot;Comte&#x27;s classification of the sciences was based upon the hypothesis that the sciences had developed from the understanding of simple and abstract principles to the understanding of complex and concrete phenomena.&quot; Instead of taking what we believe to be true we turn it around to use the phenomena of science and the observation of natural law to justify what we believe to be true within society. 
The condensing and formulation of human knowledge is what Comte drives us toward to ultimately build the strongest society possible. If scientists do not take the chance to research why a certain animal species are going distinct and their facts researched by those in the past are no longer true of the present, how is the data supposed to grow? How are we to gain more knowledge?

These facts of life are valuable, but it is beyond these facts that Comte gestures us to look to. Instead of the culmination of facts with little sufficiency, knowledge altogether takes on its role in the realm of science. In connection to science, Comte relates to science in two specific fields to rebuild the construction of human knowledge. As science is broad, Comte reveals this scientific classification for the sake of thinking and the future organization of society. &quot;Comte divided sociology into two main fields, or branches: social statistics, or the study of the forces that hold society together; and social dynamics, or the study of the causes of social change,&quot; In doing this, society is reconstructed. By reconstructing human thinking and observation, societal operation alters. The attention is drawn to science, hypothesis&#x27;, natural law, and supernatural ideas, allows sociology to be divided into these two categories.

By combining the simple facts from the abstract to the supernatural and switching our thinking towards hypothetical observation, the sciences culminate in order to formulate sociology and this new societal division. &quot;Every social system… aims definitively at directing all special forces towards a general result, for the exercise of a general and combined activity is the essence of the society,&quot; Social phenomena Comte believed can be transferred into laws and that systemization could become the prime guide to sociology so that all can maintain knowledge to continue building a strong intellectual society.

To continue building a strong intellectual society, Comte believed the building or reformation requires intricate steps to achieve success. First, the new society must be created after the old society is destroyed because &quot;without…destruction no adequate conception could be formed of what must be done,&quot;. Essentially a new society cannot be formed if it is constantly hindered by the ghost of its past. On the same terms, there will be no room for progress if the new society continues to compare itself to the old society. If humanity does not destroy the old society, the old society will destroy humanity.

Or on the other hand, if one destroys the old society, &quot;without ever replacing it, the people march onwards towards total anarchy,&quot;.  If the society is continuously chipped away without being replaced with new ideal societal structures, then society will fall deeper back into its old faults. The burdens will grow deep and entangle the platforms for the new society, thus prohibiting progress, and ultimately fulfilling the cursed seesaw of remodeling and destroying society. Hence, according to Comte, to design a successful new society, one must keep the balance of reconstruction and deconstruction. This balance allows for progress to continue without fault.

===Predictions===
Auguste Comte is well known for writing in his book &quot;The Positive Philosophy&quot; that people would never learn the chemical composition of the stars. This has been called a very poor prediction regarding human limits in science. In thirty years people were beginning to learn the composition of stars through spectroscopy.

===Auguste Comte and reflexivity===
Beyond Comte&#x27;s substantive theoretical corpus, a less well-known yet interesting aspect of his work is his reflections upon the relation between self and knowledge production. Comte was troubled by the problem of how an individual that is the product of actually existing society could produce science aimed at transforming said society, and speaks in &quot;Positive Polity&quot; of a process of self-transformation aimed at improving himself as a knowledge producer. As the methodologist Audrey Alejandro has elaborated, these considerations by Comte foreshadow key concerns in contemporary social science regarding the importance of &quot;reflexivity&quot;, meaning by this the necessity to be critically aware and to assess the ways personal dispositions and unconscious discourses shape the production of knowledge. Moving forward, Alejandro has seen in Comte a foundation to develop a reflexive discourse analysis (RDA) framework, so as to provide social scientists with applicable tools from discourse analysis for the task of implementing reflexivity in practice.

<doc id="132472" wikidata="Q32641" url="?curid=132472" title="Valencian language">
<text>Valencian () or the Valencian language () is the official, historical and traditional name used in the Valencian Community of its Romance language. 
 either as a whole or in its Valencia-specific linguistic forms. The Valencian Community&#x27;s 1982 Statute of Autonomy officially recognises &quot;Valencian&quot; as the name of the native language.

Valencian displays transitional features between Ibero-Romance languages and Gallo-Romance languages. According to philological studies, the varieties of this language spoken in the Valencian Community and Carche cannot be considered a single dialect restricted to these borders: the several dialects of Valencian (Alicante&#x27;s Valencian, Southern Valencian, Central Valencian or , Northern Valencian or Castellon&#x27;s Valencian and Transitional Valencian) belong to the Western group of Catalan dialects.

There is political controversy within the Valencian Community regarding whether it is a glottonym or an independent language. Official reports from 2014 showed that the majority of the people in the Valencian Community considered it as a separate language, different from Catalan, although the same studies show that this percentage decreases among younger generations and people with more education. According to the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, Valencian is regulated by the (AVL), following the legacy established by the Castelló Norms, which adapt Catalan orthography to Valencian idiosyncrasies.

Some of the most important works of Valencian literature experienced a Golden Age during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Important works include Joanot Martorell&#x27;s chivalric romance , and Ausiàs March&#x27;s poetry. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in the Valencian variety. The earliest recorded chess game with modern rules for moves of the queen and bishop was in the Valencian poem (1475).

== History ==
The Valencian language is usually assumed to have spread in the Kingdom of Valencia when Catalan and Aragonese colonists settled the territory after the conquests carried out by James the Conqueror. A new resettlement in the 17th century, after the expulsion of the Moriscos, largely led by Castilians, defined the Spanish language varieties of inland Valencia. However, Valencian has historically been the predominant and administrative language in the kingdom.

The first documental reference to the usage of the term to refer to the spoken language of the Valencians is found in a judicial process of Minorca against Gil de Lozano, dated between 1343 and 1346, in which it is said that the mother of the indicted, Sibila, speaks because she was from Orihuela (formerly Oriola).

The concept of Valencian language appeared in the second half of the 14th century and it was progressively consolidated at the same time that its meaning changed due to events of a diverse nature (political, social, economic). In the previous centuries the Catalan spoken in the territory of the Kingdom of Valencia was called in different ways: (13th century) and (during the 14th century, for the medieval concept of nation as a linguistic community). The concept of the Valencian language appeared with a particularistic character due to the reinforced nature of the legal entity of the Kingdom of Valencia for being the Mediterranean commercial power during the 14th and 15th centuries, becoming in the cultural and literary centre of the Crown of Aragon. Thus, the Valencians, together with the Majorcans, presented themselves to other peoples as Catalans while they referred to themselves as Valencians and Majorcans to themselves to emphasise the different legal citizenship of each kingdom.

In the 15th century, the so-called Valencian Golden Age, the name &quot;Valencian&quot; was already the usual name of the predominant language of the Kingdom of Valencia, and the names of , or had fallen into disuse. Joanot Martorell, author of the novel &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, said: &quot;.&quot; (&quot;I dare to express myself: not only in English in Portuguese. But even so from Portuguese to vulgar Valencian: for that the nation I am from born can rejoice&quot;).

Since the Spanish democratic transition, the autonomy or heteronomy of Valencian with respect to the rest of the Valencian-Catalan linguistic system has been the subject of debate and controversy among Valencians, usually with a political background. Although in the academic field (universities and institutions of recognised prestige) of linguists the unity of the language has never been questioned since studies of the Romance languages, part of Valencian public opinion believes and affirms that Valencian and Catalan are different languages, an idea that began to spread during the turbulent Valencian transition by sectors of the regionalist right and by the so-called (Blaverism). There is an alternative secessionist linguistic regulation, the &quot;Normes del Puig&quot; (Norms of El Puig), drawn up by the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (, RACV), an institution founded in 1915 by the Deputation of Valencia, but its use is very marginal.

== Official status ==
The official status of Valencian is regulated by the Spanish Constitution and the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, together with the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian (ca).

Article 6 of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy sets the legal status of Valencian, establishing that:
:*&quot;The native language of the Valencian Community is Valencian.&quot;
:*&quot;Valencian is the official language in the Valencian Community, along with Spanish, which is the official language of Spain. Everyone shall have the right to know and use them, and to receive education on Valencian and in Valencian.&quot;
:*&quot;No one can be discriminated against by reason of their language&quot;.
:*&quot;Special protection and respect shall be given to the recuperation of Valencian&quot;.
:*&quot;The shall be the normative institution of the Valencian language&quot;.

Passed in 1983, the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian develops this framework, providing for the implementation of a bilingual educational system, regulating the use of Valencian in the public administration and judiciary system, where citizens can freely use it when acting before both, or establishing the right to be informed by media in Valencian among others.

Valencian is also protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by Spain. However, the Committee of Experts of the Charter has pointed out a considerable number of deficiencies in the application of the Charter by the Spanish and Valencian governments.

== Distribution and usage ==

=== Distribution ===

Unlike in other bilingual autonomous communities, Valencian has not historically been spoken to the same extent throughout the Valencian Community. Slightly more than a quarter of its territory, equivalent to 10-15% of the population (its inland and southernmost areas), is Spanish-speaking since the Middle Ages.
Additionally, it is also spoken by a small number of people in the Carche comarca, a rural area in the Region of Murcia adjoining the Valencian Community. Nevertheless, Valencian does not have any official recognition in this area. Nowadays about 600 people are able to speak Valencian in Carche.

The Valencian language is traditionally spoken along the coast and in some inland areas in the provinces of Alicante and Castellón, from Vinaròs (northernmost point of the extension of Valencian on the coast of the Valencian Community) to Guardamar (southernmost point of Valencian).

=== Knowledge and usage ===
In 2010 the Generalitat Valenciana, or Valencian government, published a study, (Knowledge and Social Use of Valencian), which included a survey sampling more than 6,600 people in the provinces of Castellón, Valencia, and Alicante. The survey simply collected the answers of respondents and did not include any testing or verification. The results were:

* Valencian was the language &quot;always, generally, or most commonly used&quot;:
** at home: 31.6%
** with friends: 28.0%
** in internal business relations: 24.7%

* For ability:
** 48.5% answered they can speak Valencian &quot;perfectly&quot; or &quot;quite well&quot; (54.3% in the Valencian-speaking areas and 10% in the Spanish-speaking areas)
** 26.2% answered they can write Valencian &quot;perfectly&quot; or &quot;quite well&quot; (29.5% in the Valencian-speaking areas and 5.8% in the Spanish-speaking areas)

The survey shows that, although Valencian is still the common language in many areas in the Valencian Community, where slightly more than half of the Valencian population are able to speak it, most Valencians do not usually use Valencian in their social relations.

Moreover, according to the most recent survey in 2021, there is a downward trend in everyday Valencian users. The lowest numbers are in the major cities of Valencia and Alicante, where the percentage of everyday speakers is at single-digit numbers. However, the percentage of residents who claim to be able to understand and read Valencian seems to have increased since 2015.

Due to a number of political and social factors, including repression, immigration and lack of formal instruction in Valencian, the number of speakers has severely decreased, and the influence of Spanish has led to the appearance of a number of barbarisms.

== Features of Valencian ==
This is a list of features of the main forms of Valencian. There is a great deal of variety within the Valencian Community, and by no means do the features below apply to every local version. For more general information about other linguistic varieties, see Catalan language.

The (AVL) specifies Standard Valencian as having some specific syntax, vocabulary, verb conjugations and accent marks compared to Standard Catalan.

=== Phonology ===

==== Vowels ====

* The stressed vowel system of Valencian (V) is the same as that of Eastern Catalan (EC):
** , , , , , , and (with and being considerably lower than in EC).

:; Close (and close-mid) vowels
:* The vowels and are more open and centralised than in Spanish.
:** This effect is more pronounced in unstressed syllables, where the phones are best transcribed (e.g. &#x27;boy&#x27;). As the process is completely predictable, the latter symbols are not used elsewhere in the article.
:*** (Due to the proximity of unstressed close and/or close-mid/mid vowels, non-standard colloquial Valencian may feature further lowerings producing vowel alterations or metathesis, e.g. → * &#x27;pool&#x27;).
:* The vowel is somewhat retracted and is somewhat advanced both in stressed and unstressed syllables (e.g. &#x27;metro&#x27;).
:** and can be realised as mid vowels in some cases. This occurs more often with (e.g. &#x27;love&#x27;).

:; Open vowels
:* The so-called &quot;open vowels&quot;, and , are generally as low as in most Valencian dialects. The phonetic realisations of approaches and is as open as (as in traditional RP &quot;dog&quot;). This feature is also found in Balearic. For a list showing the frequency of these vowels, see cases where /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ are found in Valencian.
:** is slightly more open and centralised before liquids (e.g. &#x27;greens&#x27;) and in monosyllabics ( &#x27;seven&#x27;).
:** is most often a back vowel ( &#x27;clog&#x27;, &#x27;bull&#x27;).
:*** In some dialects (including Balearic) can be unrounded (, ).
:* The vowel is slightly more fronted and closed than in Central EC (but less fronted and closed than in Majorcan). The precise phonetic realisation of the vowel in Valencian is [ ~ ], this vowel is subject to assimilation in many instances.
:** Stressed can be retracted to in contact with velar consonants (including the velarised ): (&#x27;stick&#x27;); and fronted to in contact with palatals: (&#x27;botched job&#x27;). This is not transcribed in the article.
:*** The palatal pronunciation of may merge with by some speakers: (&#x27;ray&#x27;).

:; Vowel reduction
:* There are five general unstressed vowels (rare instances of and are found through compounding and vowel harmony). Although unstressed vowels are more stable than in EC dialects, there are many cases where they merge:
:** : final unstressed may have the following values: [ ~ ~ ] (phonetically , and traditionally transcribed without diacritics and/or atypical characters: for simplicity), depending on the preceding sounds and/or dialect (see vowel harmony below).
:*** In some regions of the Valencian Community (especially Southern Valencian) unstressed followed by stressed becomes : (&#x27;grape&#x27;). states, that final is close to in some towns of Marina Alta: (&#x27;girl&#x27;).
:** : unstressed and may be realised as (phonetically , , , etc.) in initial position in contact with sibilants, nasals and certain approximants and liquids (e.g. &#x27;swarm&#x27;).
:*** Similarly (although not recommended by the AVL), unstressed and merges with (phonetically ) in contact with palatal consonants (e.g. &#x27;knee&#x27;), and especially (in this case it is accepted) in lexical derivation with the suffix (e.g. &#x27;knowledge&#x27;).
:**** In the standard ( → ) is only accepted in words with the suffix ).
:** : it is more open and centralised in unstressed position.
:** : unstressed and may be realised as (phonetically ) before labial consonants (e.g. &quot;coberts&quot; &#x27;cutlery&#x27;), before a stressed syllable with a high vowel (e.g. &#x27;they sighs&#x27;) and in some given names (e.g. &#x27;Joseph&#x27;).
:*** (Note in some colloquial speeches initial unstressed can diphthongise to , ) &#x27;smell (n.)&#x27;). This is regarded as non-standard.
:** : it is more open and centralised in unstressed position.

::; Elision and diphthongisation
::* In certain cases, unstressed and become silent when followed or preceded by a stressed vowel:
::** Unstressed : or (&#x27;what time is it?&#x27;)
::** Unstressed : (&#x27;this man&#x27;).
::* In some accents, vowels occurring at the end of a prosodic unit may be realised as centring diphthongs for special emphasis, so that &#x27;Hey you! Come here!&#x27; may be pronounced . The non-syllabic (phonetically ) is unrelated to this phenomenon as it is an unstressed non-syllabic allophone of that occurs after vowels, much like in Spanish.

:; Vowel harmony 
:* Many Valencian dialects feature some sort of vowel harmony (). This process is normally progressive (i.e. preceding vowels affect those pronounced afterwards) over the last unstressed vowel of a word; e.g. &gt; &#x27;fabric, cloth&#x27;, &gt; &#x27;hour&#x27;. However (although regarded as non-standard), there are cases where regressive metaphony occurs over pretonic vowels; e.g. &gt; &#x27;affects&#x27;, &gt; &#x27;towel&#x27;.
:** Vowel harmony differs greatly from dialect to dialect, while many varieties assimilate both to the height and the quality of the preceding stressed vowel (e.g. &#x27;Earth, land&#x27; and &#x27;woman&#x27;); in other varieties, it is just the height that assimilates, so that and can be realised with either ( and/or ) or with ( and/or ), depending on the region and speaker.
:*** In some subvarieties the unstressed vowels produced by vowel harmony may actually be higher than the stressed ones (e.g. &#x27;door&#x27;).
:* In a wider sense, vowel assimilations can occur in further instances (that is all or most instances of final unstressed , regardless of the preceding sounds and involving palatalisation and/or velarisation): or (&#x27;girl&#x27;). This is considered non-standard.

:; Other sound changes
::; Vowel nasalisation and lengthening
::* All vowels are phonetically nasalised between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal (e.g. , colloquial &#x27;Sunday&#x27;).
::* Vowels can be lengthened in some contexts (e.g. &#x27;co-ordination&#x27;).

==== Consonants ====
; Nasals
* is bilabial, except before and where it becomes labiodental .
*  is apical front alveolar , and laminal denti-alveolar before and .
** In addition,  is postalveolar  or alveolo-palatal  before , , and ; velar  before  and ; and labiodental  before  and , where it merges with . It also merges with  (to ) before  and .
* is laminal front alveolo-palatal .
* is velar and is only found in the coda.

; Obstruents
* Obstruents assimilate to the voicing of the following consonant and vowel: (&#x27;the friends&#x27;).
** Voiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing so that (&#x27;cold&#x27;, m. s.) is pronounced with (or ) while (&#x27;cold&#x27;, f. pl.) is pronounced with . (See also &quot;plosives&quot; and &quot;affricates and fricatives&quot;).

:; Plosives 
:* and are bilabial.
:** is lenited to the approximant (or fricative) (or ) in betacist dialects, after a continuant, i.e. a vowel or any type of consonant other than a stop or nasal (e.g. &#x27;big head, stubborn&#x27; vs. &#x27;change&#x27;, Standard without betacism: and ).
:** Voiced contrast is lost word finally, so (&#x27;cube&#x27;) and (&#x27;winepress&#x27;) are both pronounced with final (also represented as ).
:*** Final may be lenited before a vowel: or (&#x27;narrow head&#x27;).
:*** Final after nasals is preserved in most dialects: (&#x27;field&#x27;).
:* and are laminal denti-alveolar  and . After  and , they are laminal alveolar  and .
:** is lenited to the approximant (or fricative) (or ), after a continuant, i.e. a vowel or any type of consonant other than a stop or nasal (exceptions include after lateral consonants): &#x27;fairies&#x27; vs. (&#x27;skirts&#x27;).
:*** is often elided between vowels following a stressed syllable (found notably in feminine participles, → , and in the suffix ); e.g. ( &lt; ) &#x27;fideuà&#x27;, &#x27;tissue&#x27; (note this feature, although widely spread in south Valencia, is not recommended in Standard Valencian, except for reborrowed terms such as , , the previously mentioned , etc.).
:** Voiced contrast is lost word finally, so (&#x27;deaf&#x27;) and (&#x27;luck&#x27;) are both pronounced with final (also represented as ).
:*** Final may be lenited before a vowel: (&#x27;all this&#x27;).
:*** Final after nasals and laterals is preserved in most dialects: (&#x27;hundred&#x27;) and (&#x27;very&#x27;).
:* and are velar.
:** and are fronted to pre-velar position [, ] before front vowels: (&#x27;who&#x27;). This is not transcribed in broader transcriptions of Valencian.
:** is lenited to the approximant (or fricative) (or ) after a continuant, i.e. a vowel or any type of consonant other than a stop or nasal.
:*** In some dialects, may lenite in all environments (e.g. ), except after nasal ( &#x27;anguish&#x27;).
:** Voiced contrast is lost word finally, so (&#x27;irrigation&#x27;) and (&#x27;irrigation ditch&#x27;) are both pronounced with final (also represented as ).
:*** Final may be lenited before a vowel: (&#x27;not very tall&#x27;).
:*** Final after nasals is preserved in most dialects: (&#x27;bank&#x27;).

:; Affricates and fricatives 
:*  and  are apical alveolar  and . They may be somewhat fronted, so that the stop component is laminal denti-alveolar, while the fricative component is apical post-dental.  is rare and may not be phonemic.
:** In the Standard, intervocalic , e.g. (&#x27;sixteen&#x27;), and , e.g. (&#x27;maybe&#x27;), are recommended to be pronounced with a gemination of the stop element ( and , respectively. However this is not transcribed in standard transcriptions.
:*** Note is deaffricated to in verbs ending in and derivatives: (&#x27;to analyse&#x27;), (&#x27;organisation&#x27;). Also in words like (&#x27;horn&#x27;), (&#x27;horizon&#x27;) and (&#x27;storehouse&#x27;) (c.f. , &#x27;kick&#x27; (from an animal)).
:* , , (), and are described as back alveolo-palatal, or postalveolar.
:** Valencian has preserved in most of its varieties the mediaeval voiced pre-palatal affricate (similar to the &quot;j&quot; in English &quot;jeep&quot;) in contexts where other modern dialects have developed fricative consonants (like the &quot;si&quot; in English &quot;vision&quot;), e.g. (&#x27;Thursday&#x27;).
:** Note the fricative (and ) appears only as a voiced allophone of (and ) before vowels and voiced consonants; e.g. (&#x27;oven fish&#x27;).
:** Unlike other Catalan dialects, and do not geminate (in most accents): (&#x27;medic&#x27;), and (&#x27;car&#x27;). Exceptions may include learned terms like (&#x27;pidgin&#x27;).
:** Final etymological is devoiced to : (&#x27;ugly&#x27;).
:* and are apical back alveolar and , also described as postalveolar.
:** In some dialects, is pronounced or after . In the Standard only is accepted after (in the inchoative form with → ), and after : (&#x27;they&#x27;). In some variants the result may be an affricate.
:** Final is devoiced to (also represented as ): (&#x27;they buzzes&#x27;).
:* and are labiodental.
:** occurs in Balearic, Alguerese, Standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia (e.g. , &#x27;they lives&#x27;). It has merged with elsewhere.
:*** is realised as an approximant after continuants: (&#x27;advance&#x27;). This is not transcribed in this article.

; Semivowels
* The vowels and have as non-vocalic correlates the semivowels and , respectively, which form a diphthong with the preceding or following vowel (e.g. &#x27;hyena&#x27;, &#x27;I / they was doing&#x27;, &#x27;mine&#x27;, &#x27;Easter&#x27;).

=== Morphology ===
* The present first-person singular of verbs differs from Central Catalan. All those forms without final -&quot;o&quot; are more akin to mediaeval Catalan and contemporary Balearic Catalan.
* Present subjunctive is more akin to medieval Catalan and Spanish; -&quot;ar&quot; infinitives end , -&quot;re&quot;, -&quot;er&quot; and -&quot;ir&quot; verbs end in (in contemporary Central Catalan present subjunctive ends in ).
* An exclusive feature of Valencian is the subjunctive imperfect morpheme -&quot;ra&quot;: (&#x27;that he might come&#x27;).
* Valencian has -&quot;i&quot;- as theme vowel for inchoative verbs of the third conjugation; e.g. (&#x27;they serves&#x27;), like North-Western Catalan. Although, again, this cannot be generalised since there are Valencian dialects that utilise -&quot;ei&quot;-, e.g. .
* In Valencian the simple past tense (e.g. &#x27;he sang&#x27;) is more frequently used in speech than in Central Catalan, where the periphrastic past (e.g. &#x27;he sang&#x27;) is prevailing and the simple past mostly appears in written language. The same, however, may be said of the Balearic dialects.
* The second-person singular of the present tense of the verb (&#x27;to be&#x27;), (&#x27;you are&#x27;), has been replaced by in colloquial speech.
* The infinitive (&#x27;to see&#x27;) has the variant , which belongs to more informal and spontaneous registers.
* The usage of the periphrasis of obligation + + infinitive is widely spread in colloquial Valencian, instead of the Standard + (equivalent to English &quot;have to&quot;).

;Clitics
* In general, use of modern forms of the determinate article (, &#x27;the&#x27;) and the third-person unstressed object pronouns (, &#x27;him, them&#x27;), though some dialects (for instance the one spoken in Vinaròs area) preserve etymological forms , as in Lleida. For the other unstressed object pronouns, etymological old forms (, , , , , ...) can be found, depending on places, in conjunction with the more modern reinforced ones (, , , , , ...).
** Several local variations for , (&#x27;we, you&#x27;): , , , etc.; , , , etc.; also for the weak form / instead of standard // (&#x27;us&#x27;) and / instead of / (&#x27;you pl.&#x27;), the latter (, instead of ) is considered standard.
* The adverbial pronoun (&#x27;there&#x27;) is almost never used in speech and is replaced by other pronouns. The adverbial pronoun (&#x27;him/her/them/it&#x27;) is used less than in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.
* Combined weak clitics with (&#x27;him/her/it&#x27;) preserve the , whereas in Central Catalan it is replaced by . For example, the combination + gives in Valencian ( in Central Catalan).
* The weak pronoun (&#x27;it&#x27;) is pronounced as:
** , when it forms syllable with a pronoun: , (&#x27;they give it to me&#x27;)
** or , when it comes before a verb starting with consonant: (or ) (&#x27;they give it&#x27;)
** , when precedes a vowel or when coming after a vowel: (&#x27;they give it to her/him&#x27;), (&#x27;you give it&#x27;)
** , when it comes after a consonant or a semivowel: (&#x27;to give it&#x27;).
* The personal pronoun (&#x27;I&#x27;) and the adverb (&#x27;already&#x27;) are not pronounced according to the spelling, but to the etymology ( and , instead of and ). Similar pronunciations can be heard in North-Western Catalan and Ibizan.
* The preposition (&#x27;with&#x27;) merges with (&#x27;in&#x27;) in most Valencian dialects.
* The compound preposition (&#x27;for&#x27;) is usually reduced to in colloquial Valencian.
* Valencian preserves the mediaeval system of demonstratives with three different levels of demonstrative precision ( or //, or //, // or , where and are almost never used) (feature shared with modern Ribagorçan and Tortosan).
** The colloquial variant of (&#x27;this&#x27;), , is heard frequently in Alicante&#x27;s Valencian.

=== Vocabulary ===
Valencian vocabulary contains words both restricted to the Valencian-speaking domain, as well as words shared with other Catalan varieties, especially with North-Western ones. Words are rarely spread evenly over the Valencian Community, but are usually contained to parts of it, or spread out into other dialectal areas. Examples include &#x27;today&#x27; (found in all of Valencia except transitional dialects, in Northern dialects ) and &#x27;mirror&#x27; (shared with North-Western dialects, Central Catalan ). There is also variation within Valencia, such as &#x27;corn&#x27;, which is in Central and Southern Valencian, but in Alicante and Northern Valencian (as well as in North-Western Catalan). Since Standard Valencian is based on the Southern dialect, words from this dialect are often used as primary forms in the standard language, despite other words traditionally being used in other Valencian dialects. Examples of this are &#x27;tomato&#x27; (which is outside of Southern Valencian) and &#x27;mattress&#x27; (which is in parts of Valencia, including the Southern Valencian area). 

Below are a selection of words which differ or have different forms in Standard Valencian and Catalan. In many cases, both standards include this variation in their respective dictionaries, but differ as to what form is considered primary. In other cases, Valencian includes colloquial forms not present in the IEC standard. Primary forms in each standard are shown in bold (and may be more than one form). Words in brackets are present in the standard in question, but differ in meaning from how the cognate is used in the other standard. 

== Writing system ==

Valencian and Catalan use the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan-Valencian orthographies are systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardisation of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans (IEC), founded in 1911, published the &quot;Normes ortogràfiques&quot; in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called &quot;Normes de Castelló&quot; (Castelló Norms), a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra&#x27;s Catalan language norms.

The letters k, y and w only appear in loanwords. In the case of y it also appears in the digraph ny. Most of the letters are pronounced the same in both standards (Valencian and Catalan). The letters c and g have a soft and hard pronunciation similar to English and other Romance languages, ç (found also in Portuguese and French) always has a soft pronunciation and may appear in word final position. The only differences between the main standards are the contrast of b and v (also found in Insular Catalan), the treatment of long consonants with a tendency to simplification in Valencian (see table with main digraphs and letter combinations), the affrication () of both soft g (after front vowels) and j (in most cases), the affrication () of initial and postconsonantal x (except in some cases) and the lenition (deaffrication) of tz in most instances (especially the -&quot;itzar&quot; suffix).

== Varieties of Valencian ==

=== Standard Valencian ===
The Academy of Valencian Studies (&quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&quot;, AVL), established by law in 1998 by the Valencian autonomous government and constituted in 2001, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian. Currently, the majority of people who write in Valencian use this standard.

Standard Valencian is based on the standard of the Institute of Catalan Studies (, IEC), used in Catalonia, with a few adaptations. This standard roughly follows the Castelló Norms () from 1932, a set of othographic guidelines regarded as a compromise between the essence and style of Pompeu Fabra&#x27;s guidelines, but also allowing the use of Valencian idiosyncrasies.

=== Valencian dialects ===

* Northern area: 
** Transitional Valencian () or Tortosan (), also ambiguously termed Northern Valencian: spoken only in the northernmost areas of the province of Castellon in towns like Benicarló or Vinaròs, the area of Matarranya in Aragon (province of Teruel), and a southern border area of Catalonia surrounding Tortosa, in the province of Tarragona.
*** Word-initial and postconsonantal (Catalan and ) alternates with intervocalically; e.g. (&#x27;game&#x27;), but (&#x27;worse&#x27;), (&#x27;crazy&#x27;) (Standard Valencian , ; ; Standard Catalan , and ).
*** Final is not pronounced in infinitives; e.g. (Standard ) (&#x27;to sing&#x27;).
*** Archaic articles , (&#x27;the&#x27;) are used instead of , ; e.g. (&#x27;the boy&#x27;), (&#x27;the men&#x27;).
** Northern Valencian () or Castellon&#x27;s Valencian (): spoken in an area surrounding the city of Castellón de la Plana.
*** Use of sound instead of standard in the third person singular of most verbs; e.g. (Standard ) &#x27;he sang&#x27;. Thus, Northern Valencian dialects contrast forms like (&#x27;I sang&#x27;) with (&#x27;he sang&#x27;), but merges (&#x27;I sing&#x27;) with (&#x27;he sings&#x27;).
*** Palatalisation of &gt; and &gt; ; e.g. &gt; (&#x27;cans, jars, you can&#x27;), &gt; (&#x27;twelve&#x27;). Thus, this dialect may merge (&#x27;walk&#x27;) and (&#x27;little steps&#x27;).
*** Depalatalization of to by some speakers; e.g. (&#x27;box&#x27;).
* Central area:
** Central Valencian (), or , spoken in Valencia city and its area, but not used as standard by the Valencian media.
*** Sibilant merger: all voiced sibilants are devoiced (, , ); that is, pronounces (&#x27;house&#x27;) and (&#x27;game&#x27;), where other Valencians would pronounce and (feature shared with Ribagorçan).
*** Betacism, that is the merge of into ; e.g. (instead of ) (&#x27;he lives&#x27;).
*** Fortition (gemination) and vocalisation of final consonants; (instead of ) (&#x27;night&#x27;).
*** It preserves the strong simple past, which has been substituted by an analytic past (periphrastic past) with + infinitive in the rest of modern Catalan and Valencian variants. For example, &quot;aní&quot; instead of (&#x27;I went&#x27;).
* Southern area:
** Southern Valencian () or Upper Southern Valencian: spoken in the contiguous located in the southernmost part of the Valencia province and the northernmost part in the province of Alicante. This dialect is considered as Standard Valencian.
*** Vowel harmony: the final syllable of a disyllabic word adopts a preceding open () and/or () if the final vowel is an unstressed -; e.g. (&#x27;Earth, land&#x27;), (&#x27;woman&#x27;). Further merges (such as and ) depends on the town and speaker.
*** This dialect retain geminate consonants ( and ); e.g. (&#x27;quail&#x27;), (&#x27;rind&#x27;).
*** Weak pronouns are &quot;reinforced&quot; in front of the verb (, , , , etc.) contrary to other dialects which maintains &quot;full form&quot; (, , , , etc.).
** Alicante&#x27;s Valencian () or Lower Southern Valencian: spoken in the southern half of the province of Alicante, and the area of Carche in Murcia.
*** Vowel harmony like in the central Southern areas.
*** Intervocalic elision in most instances; e.g. (&#x27;wheel&#x27;), (&#x27;Christmas&#x27;).
*** Yod is not pronounced in ; e.g. (&#x27;box&#x27;).
*** Final is not pronounced in infinitives in some areas and/or contexts; e.g. (&#x27;to sing&#x27;).
*** There are some archaisms like: instead of (&#x27;before&#x27;), instead of (&#x27;less&#x27;), instead of (&#x27;into&#x27;) or instead of (&#x27;towards&#x27;).
*** There are more interferences with Spanish than other dialects: (from ) instead of (or ) (&#x27;azure&#x27;), (from ) instead of (&#x27;to clean&#x27;) or (from ) instead of (&#x27;take out&#x27;).

== Media in Valencian ==
Until its dissolution in November 2013, the public-service Ràdio Televisió Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in Valencian language. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the freedom of information of the Valencian people in their own language. It was reopened again in 2018 in the same location but under a different name, À Punt, and it is owned by À Punt Media, a group owned by the Generalitat Valenciana. The new television channel claims to be plural, informative and neutral for all of the Valencian population. It is bilingual, with a focus on the Valencian language. It is recognised as a regional TV channel.

Prior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the People&#x27;s Party (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the Valencia Metro derailment in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat Francisco Camps in the Gürtel scandal in 2009. Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of sexual harassment.

In face of an increasing debt due to excessive expenditure by the PP, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the National Court after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat Alberto Fabra (also from PP) announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable. On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organised to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV&#x27;s last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013.

Having lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media. Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other autonomous communities in Spain, including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated.

In July 2016 a new public corporation, Valencian Media Corporation, was launched in substitution of RTVV. It manages and controls several public media in the Valencian Community, including the television channel À Punt, which started broadcasting in June 2018.

== Politico-linguistic controversy ==

Linguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian community, the Valencian Language Academy (&quot;Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua,&quot; AVL) considers Valencian and Catalan to be two names for the same language.


The AVL was established in 1998 by the PP-UV government of Eduardo Zaplana. According to El País, Jordi Pujol, then president of Catalonia and of the CiU, negotiated with Zaplana in 1996 to ensure the linguistic unity of Catalan in exchange for CiU support of the appointment of José María Aznar as Prime Minister of Spain. Zaplana has denied this, claiming that &quot;[n]ever, never, was I able to negotiate that which is not negotiable, neither that which is not in the negotiating scope of a politician. That is, the unity of the language&quot;. The AVL orthography is based on the Normes de Castelló, a set of rules for writing Valencian established in 1932.

A rival set of rules, called Normes del Puig, were established in 1979 by the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (&quot;Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana&quot;, RACV), which considers itself a rival language academy to the AVL, and promotes an alternative orthography, treating Valencian as an independent language, as opposed to a variety of Catalan. Compared to Standard Valencian, this orthography excludes many words not traditionally used in the Valencian Community, and also prefers spellings such as ⟨ch⟩ for /tʃ/ and ⟨y⟩ for /j/ (as in Spanish). Besides, these alternative Norms are also promoted and taught by the cultural association Lo Rat Penat.
Valencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (Province of Lleida and most of the Province of Tarragona). The various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible (ranging from 90% to 95%)

Despite the position of the official organisations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority (65%) of the Valencian people (both Valencian and Spanish speakers) consider Valencian different from Catalan: this position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicate that younger people educated in Valencian speaking areas are considerably less likely to hold these views. According to an official poll in 2014, 54% of Valencians considered Valencian to be a language different from Catalan, while 41% considered the languages to be the same. By applying a binary logistic regression to the same data, it was also found that different opinions about the unity of the language are different between people with certain levels of studies and the opinion also differs between each of the Valencian provinces. The opinion agreeing on the unity of Valencian and Catalan has significant differences regarding age, level of education and province of residence, with a majority of those aged 18–24 (51%) and those with a higher education (58%) considering Valencian to be the same language as Catalan. This can be compared to those aged 65 and above (29%) and those with only primary education (32%), where the same view has its lowest support. People living in the province of Castellón are more prone to be in favor of the unity of the language, while people living in the province of Alicante are more prone to be against the unity of the language, especially in the areas where Valencian is not a mandatory language at schools. Later studies also showed that the results differ significantly depending on the way the question is posed.

The ambiguity regarding the term Valencian and its relation to Catalan has sometimes led to confusion and controversy. In 2004, during the drafting of the European Constitution, the regional governments of Spain where a language other than Spanish is co-official were asked to submit translations into the relevant language in question. Since different names are used in Catalonia (&quot;Catalan&quot;) and in the Valencian Community (&quot;Valencian&quot;), the two regions each provided one version, which were identical to each other.

<doc id="132477" wikidata="Q1132048" url="?curid=132477" title="Corry, Pennsylvania">
<text>Corry is a city in northwestern Pennsylvania, United States. With a population of 6,217 at the 2020 United States Census, it is the second largest city in Erie County. Corry is a part of the Erie, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city became famous in the late-19th and early-20th centuries for being the manufacturer of Climax locomotives.

==History==
Erie County was formed from parts of Allegheny County on March 12, 1800. On May 27, 1861, tracks owned by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad intersected with those of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad and was called the &quot;Atlantic and Erie Junction&quot;. Land at the junction was owned by Hiram Cory, who sold a portion to the Atlantic and Great Western in October 1861. The railroad built a ticket office at the junction and named it for Cory, but through a misspelling it became Corry.

The combination of railroad growth and the first national oil wells developed by Edwin Drake for the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company in nearby Titusville contributed greatly to Corry&#x27;s development. This boomtown was chartered as a borough in 1863 and designated as a city in 1866. Industry has played a big part in Corry&#x27;s growth, and the Corry Area Historical Society, Inc. maintains a museum where one of the Climax locomotives (the steam engine used in logging operations that brought fame to Corry) is on display. Since 2020 a &quot;Class A&quot; Climax locomotive is being restored at a location near the original locomotive works by a local non-profit organization set up for this project.

<text>Edinboro is a borough in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,920 at the 2020 census. It is a small college town, home to Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro. It is part of the Erie metropolitan area.

==History==
Members of the Eriez, Iroquois, and Cornplanter Native tribes were the first known inhabitants of the area that is now known as Edinboro. These nations called the region &quot;Conneauttee&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the living snowflake&quot;. William Culbertson moved to the area in 1801, building a gristmill near Conneauttee Lake.

From 1801 to 1825, the roots of the town were formed when congregations of Presbyterian and Methodist churches began moving to the area and building houses and churches, some of which are still standing today. The first settler, William Culbertson, built the first school around 1825. The first post office was built around 1837 when it was included in the Erie and Crawford counties&#x27; postal routes. The farms helped the area grow during this time, and the area was incorporated in 1840 with a population of 232 at about . A turnpike between Erie and Meadville was constructed in the 1840s; it was made of wooden planks, and completed in 1852. In 1857, an academy was started, which was renamed the State Normal School in 1861, and which would eventually become Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.

A trolley station was built by the railway company (which railway company is apparently unknown). That company built an electric railway in the 1900s which drew more traffic to the area. Fires in 1902, 1905, and 1909, destroyed most of the wood-framed, commercial buildings, many of which were replaced with brick structures that are still standing today. Many more houses, condominiums, and apartments were constructed from 1910 through the 1950s, as Edinboro promoted itself, mainly to the surrounding populations in Pittsburgh and Erie as a resort area by the lake. This promotion boosted tourism, while the college gained enrollment and drew more residents to the town.

The 1960s was a significant growth period for the town, as around 400 building permits were issued for both housing and business. A post office was built in 1960, and evolved to first class status by 1966. The demand for water consumption had tripled throughout this period, and prompted the construction of a new sewage plant in 1970.

The borough&#x27;s home rule charter was adopted in 1974, with a new municipal building being constructed in 1975. In 1980, the census placed Edinboro first in population growth in Erie County, with a population increase of 30% from 1970 to 1980 to a total of 6,324. The businesses in the borough continued to grow, and in 1983, Edinboro State College received accreditation by the state and was renamed Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. Between the 1980s and 2000s, Edinboro University has grown to be northwestern Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest university and is a key factor in drawing people to the area. Today, Edinboro is known as a college town in the winter and lake resort during the summer.

Academy Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
==Geography==

The center of the borough is at the south end of Edinboro Lake and around its outlet, Conneauttee Creek, a south-flowing tributary of French Creek and part of the Allegheny River/Ohio River/Mississippi River watershed. Darrows Creek, a tributary of Conneauttee Creek, rises east of town and flows south through the campus of the Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.

U.S. Route 6N passes through the center of Edinboro, leading east to U.S. Routes 6 and 19 near Mill Village, and west to Interstate 79. Pennsylvania Route 99 crosses US 6N in the center of Edinboro, leading north to McKean and southeast to Cambridge Springs. The city of Erie is north via US 6N and I-79.

<text>Erie, officially the City of Erie, is a city on the south shore of Lake Erie and the county seat of Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the fifth-most populous city in Pennsylvania and the most populous in Northwestern Pennsylvania with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census. The two-county Erie metropolitan area had a population of 270,876 in 2020. Erie is about from Buffalo, from Cleveland, and from Pittsburgh. 

The city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Its nicknames include &quot;Gem City&quot;, a reference to its fine natural harbor, the &quot;Gem of the Great Lakes&quot;; and more recently, &quot;Flagship City&quot;, from a local marketing effort to play up the homeport of Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s flagship &quot;Niagara&quot;.

Manufacturing continues to play a large part in Erie&#x27;s economy, with rising contributions from insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.

==History==
Indigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township, west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.

Europeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term &quot;presque-isle&quot; means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years&#x27; War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.

Erie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.

===18th century===

The Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9, 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.

The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year. Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.

===19th century===

President James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie.

Erie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up tracks, and rioted to try to stop the standardization.

===20th and 21st centuries===

On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed underneath more than of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city&#x27;s lower east side.
Erie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city&#x27;s economy began to suffer in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring took place and jobs moved out of the area. The Erie region is considered to be part of the Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline, resulting in a major population downturn in the 1970s.

With the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents. This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as &quot;The Mistake on the Lake&quot; or &quot;Dreary Erie&quot;. Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market. 

Erie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009. In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200, a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.
==Geography==

Erie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at (42.114507, -80.076213), on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, southwest of Buffalo, New York, and north of Pittsburgh. Erie&#x27;s bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers. Lake Erie is about above sea level, while the city of Erie is about above sea level.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with being land and the remaining , or 1.03%, being water. Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as &quot;the Peninsula&quot; or simply &quot;the beach&quot;), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that stretches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.

Erie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area. The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway. The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at , and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at . Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie&#x27;s west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area&#x27;s newer developments.

Post-industrial redevelopment of Erie&#x27;s waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry&#x27;s Landing Marina, Liberty Park &amp; Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania), host the USS &quot;Niagara&quot;. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Erie falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used. It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city&#x27;s lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.

Erie is third on &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;″s list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging ; however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is . Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was . The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.

The coldest maximum temperature on record was in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was . The warmest overnight low on record was once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave. On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy .

On December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania. By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.

The hardiness zone is now 7a along the lakeshore and 6b in the remainder of the city. 

==Demographics==

===2020 census===

As of the 2010 United States Census, 101,786 people, 40,913 households, and 22,915 families were residing in the city. Its 44,790 housing units averaged a vacancy rate of 8%. Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses. The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania&#x27;s third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

Erie&#x27;s population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.

Since the 1980s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Romania, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie&#x27;s community augments religious diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.

===Religion===

In the early 20th century, Erie had a significant community of Russian immigrants, many of whom worked in shipbuilding along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (&quot;Bespopovtsy&quot;) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.

The Erie Jewish community is more than 150 years old. As of 2021, Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, was served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Robert Morais. Congregation Brith Sholom (Jewish Center) is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen has been its spiritual leader since 1989.

Erie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties; at , it is the largest in the state in area. Its diocesan seat is Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a central tower flanked by two towers. Since October 1, 2012, Lawrence T. Persico has been the bishop of Erie; Donald Trautman was the bishop emeritus of the diocese until his death in 2022.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, Erie County had a total population of 280,843 in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.

==Economy==
Erie is Pennsylvania&#x27;s primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.

Since the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The ZIP code 16501 covering some of the downtown areas is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.

Erie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has major operations in Erie. Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.

Over 10% of the nation&#x27;s plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants. Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing over of biofuel a year.

==History==
Girard&#x27;s history began with a petition to &quot;Township Status&quot; in 1832 by reassigning lands previously allocated to neighboring municipalities (Springfield, Fairview, and Elk Creek). The name is in honor of Stephen Girard, a banking tycoon of the late 1700s and early 1800s. Stephen Girard, a resident of Philadelphia at that time, was chosen for a variety of reasons. He owned much of the neighboring Springfield Township, and had been admired by the residents in the region. Additionally, Girard officials had been lobbying with Stephen Girard&#x27;s foundation, upon his death in 1831, to be the site of the bequeathed Girard College. Despite this attempt, his family and will executors chose to establish the boarding school in Philadelphia where Stephen Girard had a long-standing tradition as a local philanthropist.

<doc id="132488" wikidata="Q636203" url="?curid=132488" title="MacCready Gossamer Albatross">
<text>The Gossamer Albatross is a human-powered aircraft built by American aeronautical engineer Dr Paul B MacCready&#x27;s company AeroVironment. On June 12, 1979, it completed a successful crossing of the English Channel to win the second Kremer prize worth £100,000 ().

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed and built by a team led by Paul B. MacCready, a noted American aeronautics engineer, designer, and world soaring champion. &quot;Gossamer Albatross&quot; was his second human-powered aircraft, the first being the &quot;Gossamer Condor&quot;, which had won the first Kremer prize on August 23, 1977, by completing a -long figure-eight course. The second Kremer challenge was then announced as a flight across the English Channel recalling Louis Blériot&#x27;s crossing of 1909.

The aircraft is of &quot;canard&quot; configuration, using a large horizontal stabilizer forward of the wing in a manner similar to the Wright brothers&#x27; successful &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; aircraft and powered using pedals to drive a large, two-bladed propeller. The &quot;Gossamer Albatross&quot; was constructed using a carbon fiber frame, with the ribs of the wings made with expanded polystyrene; the entire structure was then wrapped in a thin, transparent plastic (mylar PET film). The empty mass of the structure was only , although the gross mass for the Channel flight was almost . To maintain the craft in the air, it was designed with very long, tapering wings (high aspect ratio), like those of a glider, allowing the flight to be undertaken with a minimum of power. In still air, the required power was on the order of , though even mild turbulence made this figure rise rapidly.

==The crossing==

Just before 6 am on June 12, 1979, amateur cyclist and pilot Bryan Allen powered the &quot;Albatross&quot; to the rehearsed speed of 75 revolutions per minute and took off from a point near Folkestone, England. The Channel conditions and lack of wind were ideal for the crossing.

However, problems soon began to affect the aircraft and pilot. Allen&#x27;s radio failed for a while and he was only able to communicate with the accompanying boats by hand and head movements. In addition, Allen&#x27;s water supply had been estimated for a two-hour flight, but headwinds delayed the crossing and his supply ran out. Without adequate water, Allen suffered from dehydration and leg cramps.

With increasing headwinds, concern grew that the flight would have to be called off. With the coast of France still unseen, an accompanying boat maneuvered in front of the &quot;Albatross&quot; to hook it to safety. However, for the hooking procedure, Allen had gone a little higher and found less air turbulence, so he continued to pedal the aircraft and see if progress could be made. With a calming surface wind, Allen continued, and landed on a beach at Cap Gris-Nez in France. Allen completed the crossing in 2 hours and 49 minutes, achieving a top speed of and an average altitude of .

==Versions==

MacCready&#x27;s team built two Albatrosses; the back-up plane was jointly tested as part of the NASA Langley/Dryden flight research program in 1980 and was also flown inside the Houston Astrodome, the first ever controlled indoor flight by a human-powered aircraft. The &quot;Gossamer Albatross II&quot; is currently on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

<text>Lake City is a borough in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,936 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Erie Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Prior to European Colonization, the land that now contains Lake City was the home of the Erie people.

===Miles Grove===
The pretty and growing village of Miles Grove, or Girard Station, as it is known to the traveling public, is situated on the Lake Shore Railroad, a little over a mile east of the intersection of the Erie &amp; Pittsburgh, one and three-quarter miles north of Girard, fifteen and a half west of Erie and eighty east of Cleveland. It is four and a half miles from the depot to Fairview Station, five to Fairview Borough, six to Lockport, five to East Springfield, four to North Springfield, ten to Cranesville, eleven to Wellsburg, eleven and a half to Albion and twelve to Franklin. The population of the village by the census of 1880 was 471. The site of Miles Grove is one of the most suitable for a town in Erie County. The country is extremely fine and closely settled – so close, indeed, between there and Girard that it will not be many years till they are one town. The place was named after Judge Miles, who influenced the erection of the depot, the ground for which was given by Austin H. Seeley, who laid out the lots. It grew slowly for some years, but received a new impetus by the completion of the Erie &amp; Pittsburg road, which caused it to be made a general stopping place for the trains. Another start was given to it by the location of A. Denio&#x27;s fork and agricultural works, which furnish employment to about seventy persons. These works – now known as the Otsego Fork Mills – were brought to Mile Grove, part in 1874, and the balance in 1876, the citizens subscribing $5,000 to $5,000 to induce their removal. This important industry was established at Albion thirty years ago. The handle department burned down in the year of 1873, when the entire business was transferred to Miles Grove, where a part of it was already in operation. The village contains, besides a good many fine residences, an Episcopal and a Methodist Episcopal Church, a fine schoolhouse, with three teachers, an iron foundry, a hotel – built by A. M. Osborn in the spring of 1865 – five or six stores, an express office, two shoe shops and two blacksmith shops. The Methodist Episcopal Church was built in 1867. It is used in part by the Presbyterians, according to a condition in the subscription paper. James Sampson donated the land on which the building stands. The Methodist Episcopal Congregation has belonged to Girard charge ever since its organization.

<text>Millcreek Township is a township in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 54,070 at the 2020 census, making it the 14th-largest municipality in the state and the largest township in Western Pennsylvania.

Millcreek Township is home to the entrance to Presque Isle State Park, Waldameer Park, Millcreek Mall, and other attractions. Also located in the township is Erie International Airport, the primary airport serving the Erie metropolitan area. LECOM Health, a non-profit healthcare system serving Erie County and the surrounding areas, also calls the township home.

==History==
Evidence exists of Native American presence in Millcreek Township as early as 3700 BC. The township&#x27;s Sommerheim Park is the location of the Sommerheim Park Archaeological District, which has yielded archaeological artifacts from the Archaic and Woodland periods.

One of the earliest townships in the Erie Triangle to be settled, Millcreek was one of the original 16 townships of Erie County. As families came they moved from the bayfront settlement of Erie and began to form small hamlets such as Federal Hill, Kearsarge, Marvintown, and Weigelville, all to become part of Mill Creek Township. As the Erie settlement grew, first into a borough, then a city, it annexed more and more sections of the township.

After the east–west roads were laid out, taverns began to sprout about every mile or so. Along the Ridge Road on present-day U.S. Route 20, which was laid west through Millcreek in 1805, one of the remaining taverns of the era is Nicholson Tavern. Built in 1836, mostly by Isabella Nicholson and her sons, it is still owned by the family and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Presque Isle Light and Sommerheim Park Archaeological District are also listed.

A recurving sandspit peninsula, Presque Isle, connects to the mainland in western Millcreek. During the War of 1812, Oliver Hazard Perry commanded his fleet in battle and strategically used the peninsula&#x27;s bay as a harbor to construct six out of nine of the ships in his fleet. In 1921, the peninsula was made a state park and was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Today, the park is a bird sanctuary with over 150 different species identified here.

Just west of the entry into Presque Isle was a well-forested area known as Hopkins Grove. The Erie Electric Motor Company purchased the grove in 1896 for development into an amusement park. Waldameer Park is one of the oldest amusement parks in the nation.
