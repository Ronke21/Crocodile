<text>Luling is a city in Caldwell and Guadalupe counties, Texas, United States, along the San Marcos River. The population as of the 2020 census was 5,599.

== History ==
The town was named after a New York banker, Charles Luling. He was a personal friend of Thomas Wentworth Pierce and provided the financing for the railroad as well the purchase of the land that became Luling. Prior to the founding of the town, a small farming community named Atlanta was established nearby, with residents associating themselves with the newly founded Luling, causing Atlanta to fade.

Luling was founded in 1874 as a railroad town and became a rowdy center for the cattle drivers on the Chisholm Trail. Contempt of the law by the cowboys helped Luling become known as the &quot;toughest town in Texas&quot;. After the great cattle drives ended in the late 1880s, Luling quieted down to a town of about 500 and cotton ruled the local economy. Perhaps due to arrival of immigrants, including a sizeable Jewish population, in the late-19th century, Luling began a long, slow, period of growth, and by 1925 the population reached 1,500.

One of the most significant events in Luling&#x27;s history was the discovery of oil by Edgar B. Davis. Davis mortgaged everything he owned to finance drilling operations around Luling. On August 9, 1922, the Rafael Rios No. 1 well struck oil at , producing . To repay his loans, Davis contracted each to Atlantic Oil and Magnolia Oil at $.50 a barrel, plus another to Magnolia at $.75 per barrel.

Davis&#x27; discovery opened up an oilfield long and wide. The economy quickly moved from the railroad and agriculture to oil. The population of the town rapidly increased to over 5,000. By 1924, the Luling Oil Field was producing over of oil per year, and oil formed much of Luling&#x27;s economy for the next 60 years.

As oil grew in importance in the 1930s and 1940s, the railroads that helped form the town declined and largely pulled out of Luling.

<text>Martindale is a city in Caldwell County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Austin metropolitan area. The population was 1,253 at the 2020 census.

In recent years, Martindale has also attracted a surprising number of film scouts that have been attracted to the town&#x27;s turn-of-the-century charm. As a result, various television shows, music videos and movies have been filmed in town most notably: &quot;A Perfect World&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner; &quot;The Newton Boys&quot;, starring Matthew McConaughey and Ethan Hawke; and New Line&#x27;s 2003 remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. Over the years, each subsequent film crew has left its mark on the town. A strand of wood beams sits on a vacant lot next to the bank—all that remains of a saloon that was constructed for one of the westerns.

In 2004, Carlton Carl, a Washington D.C. lobbyist, purchased of commercial property in downtown Martindale. A partial inventory of Carl&#x27;s purchase includes three empty general stores, a former bank, a cotton-seed weigh station, several warehouses, a movie-set courtroom, an aquarium filled with cotton plants, a seed elevator, 16 seed silos and of frontage on the San Marcos River. Carl has been working closely with the residents of Martindale to plan the next phase of the town&#x27;s rejuvenation.
In Fall 2007, Carl worked with students at Texas State University of San Marcos in the Interior Design program, under the guidance of Assistant Professor and Program Coordinator Nancy Granato, to receive help envisioning further planning of the town. The project entailed assigning each group of students a specific building (i.e. silos, weigh station, etc.) to redesign the interior of and to think of a possible business that would work well with the space. One group worked on the landscape plan of the town in relation to planting native species of trees and plants, creating a city park, putting in new sidewalks and outdoor lighting. The ideas were then presented to Carl as well as some of the residents and leaders of the town. Students in the MBA program, under the guidance of Associate Professor Bob Hill, also presented Carl with a market analysis for the town of Martindale, TX. The presentation included an examination of the business district and potential economic opportunities; analysis of economic trends and activities to drive growth; and the identification new retail and restaurant opportunities.

==History==
Martindale was established in 1855 by Nancy Martindale, who moved to Texas from Mississippi in 1851 and donated land for the townsite.

John Crayton, his son James Lasater Crayton and their slaves moved to the banks of the San Marcos River in what is now downtown Martindale in 1839. On January 8, 1852, John Crayton sold the land to George Martindale that Nancy Martindale later donated for the town of Martindale. John Crayton moved to the Republic of Texas from Marion County, Alabama but was born and married in Franklin County, Tennessee. He also donated the land for the Martindale City Cemetery. John Crayton lived in Martindale until his death in 1873.

Martindale Baptist church was organized in 1858, and a post office was established in 1875, when the local population was less than fifty. In 1890, the town had four general stores and four gristmills and gins. By 1892, the population was 200. In 1905, Martindale had two schools with four teachers and 184 white students and one school with one teacher for 73 black students.

From 1910 to 1946, the population was 500. In 1949, cottonseed and hybrid seed corn companies near Martindale, including the legendary Harper Seed Farm, supplied over 65 percent of the hybrid seed corn and a large percentage of the pedigreed cottonseed produced in Texas. The population of Martindale reached a high of 600 in 1957 but subsequently fell to 250 in 1969 and 210 in 1982, when only three businesses were active. In 1982, the town became the third in the county to incorporate. Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, built in 1908, was renovated by the parishioners&#x27; own labor in the mid-1980s and then was burned by an arsonist in 1991. After 1984, the local population increased, reaching 1,068 in 1988, when eleven businesses were in operation.

On the night of August 3, 1979, a fight broke out between Billy Joe Aplin, 35-year-old crabber, and Sau Van Nguyen, a Vietnamese crabber, which ended with the fatal shooting of Aplin. Within hours of the shooting, several Vietnamese boats were burned and there was an attempted bombing of a crab plant that employed Vietnamese workers. Sau Van Nguyen and his brother Chinh Nguyen were tried for murder and acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. The incident inspired the creation of both the 1981 documentary &quot;Fire on the Water&quot; and the 1985 film &quot;Alamo Bay&quot;. In January 2019, Title 8 Productions, LLC premiered an independent documentary called, Seadrift, in Park City Utah. It continues to be screened throughout the United States. The documentary series &quot;Reel South&quot; examined the 1979 incident in the 2020 film &quot;Seadrift&quot;.

The former Callahan County Jail, at 100 W. 5th Street, was originally located in nearby Belle Plain, then the county seat. When the county seat moved to Baird, the jail was disassembled brick by brick, and reassembled at its current location. Belle Plain lost population and became a ghost town.

The town has five churches, four gas stations/convenience stores, and a feed store.

The first settlers came to Clyde around 1876. Mr. Shephard built a log cabin, the first residence, around this time. Many others soon followed. Among the first settlers were people such as R. J. Estes who came all the way from Fort Worth. When he first came, he didn&#x27;t plan on staying. Mrs. Estes and he had stopped only to rest, but soon decided to stay. In their quick decision to stay, they simply left their belongings under a tree while they traveled to get the rest of their belongings for their new home. All their belongings were still as they had left them when they returned a few months later.

The railroad was prominent in Clyde. It started with only a boxcar, then later a station was added. Along with the railroad came more settlers, homes, and work. Soon a school was needed.

The actual origin of the name &quot;Clyde&quot; is not known. Many believe it was named after a crew foreman. The man worked for the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. The company had a tent for the employees to get supplies. They would say, &quot;Let&#x27;s go up to Clyde&#x27;s,&quot; not talking about the town, only the supply tent. Soon the railroad company would call their boxcar location &quot;Clyde&quot;.

Cross Plains was once named &quot;Turkey Creek&quot;, after the stream that now crosses the town&#x27;s Treadaway Park. In its early years, Cross Plains had the basic necessities like a store, a cotton gin and gristmill, but little else. Hugh Henry McDermett and J.C. McDermett, early settlers here, petitioned the federal government to establish a post office in Cross Plains. In 1878, the government granted the post office, named &quot;Cross Plains&quot; for the crossings of stagecoach and military roads prior to the Civil War. East and West Caddo Peaks, located west, were used as landmarks by early Indians, soldiers, and government surveying crews.

The town had one newspaper in 1902 (&quot;The Herald&quot;), but it soon went out of business. The second paper, &quot;The Cross Plains Review&quot;, started in 1909 and continues to publish a weekly newspaper every Wednesday. The town moved from the west banks of Turkey Creek to its present site in January 1911, to be closer to the railroad. On January 12, 1911, a train full of prospective land buyers arrived in Cross Plains. Before the day was out, $75,000.00 worth of land had been purchased. Cross Plains was the last stop on the Texas Central Katy Railroad spur from De Leon and Rising Star. The Katy abandoned the spur in the 1940s.

<doc id="135600" wikidata="Q51693" url="?curid=135600" title="Brownsville, Texas">
<text>Brownsville ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat of Cameron County, located on the western Gulf Coast in South Texas, adjacent to the border with Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The city covers , and had a population of 186,738 at the 2020 census. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, it is the 139th-largest city in the United States and 18th-largest in Texas. It is part of the Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan area. The city is known for its year-round subtropical climate, deep-water seaport, and Hispanic culture.

The city was founded in 1848 by American entrepreneur Charles Stillman after he developed a successful river-boat company nearby. It was named for Fort Brown, itself named after Major Jacob Brown, who fought and died while serving as a U.S. Army soldier during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). As a county seat, the city and county governments are major employers. Other primary employers fall within the service, trade, and manufacturing industries, including a growing aerospace and space transportation sector. It operates international trading through the Port of Brownsville. The city experienced a population increase in the early 1900s, when steel production flourished.

Due to significant historical events, the city has multiple houses and battle sites listed under the National Register of Historic Places. The city played a primary role in the Mexican–American War with the siege of Fort Texas and the first engagements of the war: The Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma. Several key events of the American Civil War took place in the city, such as the Battle of Brownsville and the Battle of Palmito Ranch. The city was also involved in the Texas Revolution. Brownsville&#x27;s idiosyncratic geographic location has made it a wildlife refuge center. Several state parks and historical sites are protected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

Brownsville has a predominantly Hispanic population, which at 93.9% is the fourth-highest proportion of Hispanic Americans of any city in the United States outside of Puerto Rico.

==History==
=== Founding ===
In 1781, Spanish government officials granted José Salvador de la Garza 59 leagues of land (408 sq mi). He used the land to construct a ranch several miles northwest of the area. During the early 1800s, Brownsville was known to residents as &quot;los tejidos&quot; (English: &quot;pasturelands&quot;). The area was inhabited by a few settlers around 1836 when Texas declared its independence from Mexico. On February 4, 1846, President James K. Polk instructed American General Zachary Taylor and his troops, including 2nd LT. Ulysses S. Grant, to begin moving south towards Brownsville. Once Taylor arrived, he built Fort Texas. It was later renamed Fort Brown in honor of Major Jacob Brown, one of two soldiers who died during the siege of Fort Texas.

Charles Stillman arrived in Matamoros in 1828 from Connecticut to help his father in the mercantile business. Brownsville became part of Texas after the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. During that year, Stillman formed a partnership with Samuel Belden and Simon Mussina to form the Brownsville Town Company. They reportedly sold lots valued at $1,500. The city of Brownsville was originally established in late 1848 by Stillman, and was made the county seat of Cameron County on January 13, 1849. The state originally incorporated the city on January 24, 1850. This was repealed on April 1, 1852, because of a land-ownership dispute between Stillman and its former owners (including Juan Cortina, a Mexican rancher). The state reincorporated the city on February 7, 1853; this remains in effect. The issue of ownership was not decided until 1879, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of Stillman.

===Mexican–American War===

On April 25, 1846, Captain Seth B. Thornton received reports of Mexican troops crossing the Rio Grande. Thornton and 63 U.S. dragoons moved to Rancho de Carricitos and discovered several houses in the area. Mexican General Anastasio Torrejón crossed the Rio Grande the previous day. He commanded 1,600 cavalry and infantry troops to surround Thornton&#x27;s troops in fractions. Due to heavy force from Torrejón&#x27;s troops, Thornton&#x27;s troops surrendered. Eleven American casualties were reported; 45 troops and Thornton were held as prisoners. Reports of the incident were sent to President James K. Polk, who announced, &quot;American blood has been spilled upon the American territory.&quot; On May 13, the United States Congress declared war against Mexico.

American General Zachary Taylor retreated from Fort Texas on May 1, 1846; Mexican General Mariano Arista began preparing artillery and troops from across the Rio Grande. On May 3, Arista and the Mexican Army began the siege of Fort Texas, during the first active campaign in the Mexican–American War. This was counteracted by the United States 7th Infantry Regiment. Despite heavy strikes, Mexican General Pedro de Ampudia outlined a traditional siege to move forward. Taylor was notified of the incident and began moving towards Fort Texas. Mexican troops intercepted them near Palo Alto, about north of present-day Brownsville, resulting in the first battle of the war.

The following day, Mexican troops had retreated. Taylor&#x27;s troops charged up to them, resulting in the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, which took place within the present limits. When Taylor arrived at the besieged Fort Texas, he found that two soldiers, including the fort&#x27;s commander, Major Jacob Brown, had died. Brown, who suffered an injury when a cannonball hit his leg, died three days after his injury on May 9. In his honor, General Taylor renamed the facility as Fort Brown. An old cannon at the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College marks the spot where Major Brown received his fatal wound.

On July 13, 1859, Juan Cortina saw Brownsville city Marshal Robert Sheers arrest and beat an elderly man who had been a ranch hand at his mother&#x27;s ranch. Cortina approached the marshal, questioning his motives, before shooting him twice after he refused to release the man. The first shot reportedly missed Sheers, but the second struck his shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground. Cortina and the elderly man rode off on a horse. The following year, Cortina returned with troops, executing four Anglo men and simultaneously releasing several Mexican prisoners. He then issued a proclamation explaining his reasons for the attack.

===Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Brownsville served as a smuggling point for Confederate goods into Mexico. Most significantly, cotton was smuggled to European ships through the Mexican port of Bagdad to avoid Union blockades. The city was located at the end of the &quot;Cotton Road&quot;, southwest of the Cotton Belt. In November 1863, Union troops landed at Port Isabel and marched towards Brownsville to take control of Fort Brown. In the ensuing Battle of Brownsville, Confederate forces abandoned the fort, blowing it up with of explosives. In 1864, Confederate forces commanded by Colonel John Salmon Ford reoccupied the town, and he became mayor of Brownsville.

Robert E. Lee and his Confederate army surrendered to Union commander Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865, signing a hand-written document at the Appomattox Court House, officially ending the American Civil War. Theodore Barrett was ordered to move 500 62nd Regiment troops of colors towards Brazos Island. On May 11, Barrett&#x27;s troops moved inland towards Brownsville and spotted Confederate soldiers. John Salmon Ford received news of this and prepared to attack. On May 15, 1865, 34 days after the signing of the surrender, the Battle of Palmito Ranch took place. Confederates killed or wounded around 30 opponents and captured more than 100 other troops. This is accepted by some historians as the last battle of the American Civil War. President Grant sent Union General Frederick Steele to Brownsville to patrol the United States–Mexico border after the Civil War to aid the &quot;Juaristas&quot; with military supplies.

===20th century===

Texas, like other Southern states, passed a new constitution and Jim Crow laws that established racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans at the turn of the 20th century, generally by raising barriers to voter registration. While Hispanic residents were considered white under the terms of the United States annexation of Texas, legislatures found ways to suppress their participation in politics.

====1906 Brownsville affair and Black soldiers====
On August 13 and 14, 1906, Brownsville was the site of the Brownsville affair. Racial tensions were increasing between white townsfolk and black infantrymen who were stationed at Fort Brown. On the night of August 13, one white bartender was killed, and a white police officer was wounded by rifle shots in the street. Townsfolk, including the mayor, accused the infantrymen of the murders. Without affording them a chance to defend themselves in a hearing, President Theodore Roosevelt dishonorably discharged the entire 167-member regiment due to their alleged &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot;. Investigations in the 1970s revealed that the soldiers were not responsible for the attacks, and the Nixon Administration reversed all dishonorable discharges. Fort Brown was decommissioned after the end of World War II in 1945. In 1948, the city and college acquired the land.

====Public Health====
In the spring of 1991, a cluster of anencephaly cases in the area made national headlines, prompting a public health investigation. A high anencephaly rate, of 19.7 per 10,000 live births, was found. Additionally, it was discovered that other neural tube defects, including spina bifida and encephalocele, had been an ongoing, undetected issue in pregnant Mexican-American women for years in the area. Subsequently, multiple risk factors were found, such as folate deficiency, and that increasing dietary folate intake had a protective effect.

===21st century===
Brownsville has received significant media attention surrounding immigration policies and border-wall funding costs. In 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Secure Fence Act of 2006. The act administered the construction of a tall border &quot;fence&quot; extending from the Pacific Ocean (at San Diego and Tijuana&#x27;s border crossing), through the entry of the Port of Brownsville. In 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security issued a proposal to add of border fence, an action which would potentially reallocate portions of the University of Texas at Brownsville campus. The proposal would have transferred of university land, including several historical monuments and the university&#x27;s golf course, to Mexico. The proposal was altered after Andrew Hanen, a federal district judge, rejected the department&#x27;s idea.

====Border wall issue====
In 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed building a border wall along the United States-Mexico border. Trump&#x27;s proposed wall, if completed, would consist of &quot;of hardened concrete, and ... rebar, and steel&quot; across the southern border, including Brownsville. On January 25, 2017, days after assuming office, Trump issued Executive Order 13767, directing construction for the border wall. Brownsville was also the center of controversy surrounding the new administration&#x27;s continuation of an Obama-era policy of housing immigrant children separate from adults (except for mothers) who entered the country unlawfully.

The city has a total area of , of which are land and are water, according to the United States Census Bureau of 2017.

Brownsville is situated at the intersection of several different climates zones, such as the subtropics, the Chihuahuan Desert, the Gulf Coastal Plain, and the southern reach of the American Great Plains, thus attracting high numbers of migratory birds, and creating a unique biome for many species of plants and animals. Its idiosyncratic network of &quot;resacas&quot; (English: oxbow lakes), distributaries of the Rio Grande, provide habitat for numerous nesting and breeding birds, typically during the spring and fall migrations. Brownsville&#x27;s vegetation is classified as grassland.

===Metropolitan area===
Brownsville is in one metropolitan statistical area as defined by the United States Census Bureau. The Brownsville–Harlingen–Raymondville combined statistical area consists of Cameron County and Willacy County. It includes the Brownsville metropolitan area and the micropolitan area of Raymondville. The city of Raymondville is the county seat of Willacy County. The Brownsville-Harlingen-Raymondville combined statistical area is home to 445,309 people (2017 estimated), making it the 106th-largest combined statistical area in the United States. Based on the Uniform Crime Report conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013, the Brownsville metropolitan area ranked last on its list of the &quot;Most Dangerous Cities&quot; in Texas, with &quot;240 incidents of violent crime per 100,000 people&quot; and a murder rate of 1.4.

In 2011, Brownsville became one of the first cities in the United States to require stores to charge a fee for single-use plastic shopping bags. The ordinance was enacted to reduce pollution and litter around the city. The city repealed the ordinance in 2018 after it was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court of Texas. &quot;Forbes&quot; identified Brownsville as one of 12 metropolitan areas in the United States with the cleanest air. In 2018, the Brownsville–Harlingen area was among the &quot;Cleanest U.S. Cities for Ozone Air Pollution&quot; in the American Lung Association&#x27;s &quot;State of the Air&quot; in 2018.

===Flora and soil===
Broadleaf evergreen plants, including palms, dominate Brownsville neighborhoods to a greater degree than other locations in Texas, including nearby cities such as Harlingen and McAllen. Brownsville is home to the &quot;Sabal mexicana&quot;, the only species of palmetto palm native to Texas with a significant trunk (&quot;Sabal minor&quot;, also native to Texas, is nearly trunkless). Though it used to cover a large portion of the land next to the Rio Grande, the city contains one of the last native stands of &quot;S. mexicana&quot;. &quot;Citharexylum berlandieri&quot; (Tamaulipan fiddlewood), &quot;Rivina humilis&quot; (pigeonberry), and &quot;Leucophyllum frutescens&quot; (Texas sage) are also native flora.

Soils are mostly of clay to silty clay loam texture, moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) to strongly alkaline (pH 8.5) and with a significant degree of salinity in many places; other types of soils present around the city include Cameron clay and sporadic amounts of Laredo silt loam. Due to Brownsville&#x27;s proximity to the coast, Lomalta clay is common around the swamp areas of the vicinity. Several parts of the city have a high risk of localized flooding because of flat topography, ubiquitous low-permeability clay soils, and inadequate infrastructure funding.

According to the United States Geological Survey, Brownsville&#x27;s soils are primarily alluvium and windblown deposits. The majority of the city&#x27;s soil is made of floodplain deposits from the Rio Grande; it consists of clay, sand, silt, gravel, and organic matter. Windblown deposits are made up of &quot;active dunes and dune complexes&quot; that contain mostly clay and silt near the coastal region and combination of clay, sand, and silt inland.

===Climate===

<text>Los Fresnos is a city in Cameron County, Texas, United States. The population was 8,114 at the 2020 census, up from 5,542 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Brownsville–Harlingen–Raymondville and the Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan areas.

Located in south-central Cameron County, the city was named for the &quot;fresnos&quot; (&quot;Fraxinus berlandieriana&quot;) scattered in the woods and along streams. In 1912, Lon Hill, an early landowner, formed a company to develop a canal system that would use the Rio Grande to irrigate land for farming. Railroad construction in the early 1900s began to bring settlers to the area, and by 1915, a post office was established. Because of the fertile, irrigated land, farm products increased, and with the long growing season in the Rio Grande Valley, farming flourished. Today, the city is still surrounded by fertile farm/ranch land. Major crops are cotton, sugarcane, grains, oranges, and red grapefruit.

==Geography==

Los Fresnos is located slightly south of the geographic center of Cameron County at (26.073216, –97.478164). It is north of the center of Brownsville and southeast of Harlingen.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Los Fresnos has a total area of , of which , or 3.98%, is covered by water.

Situated slightly north of the city of Brownsville, Los Fresnos experiences average temperatures, which land the community within the humid subtropical climate zone, but like the rest of the lower Rio Grande Valley, fluctuating temperatures cause the area to transition between a humid subtropical climate and a tropical savanna climate. Due to this, tropical vegetation grows widely around the surrounding area. Temperature extremes range from highs near 100 °F in the summer down to around freezing temperatures about once or twice a year, and not at all during some years. In addition, Los Fresnos is prone to impact from hurricanes. Notable hurricanes to hit the area include Beulah, Allen, and Dolly. Thunderstorm activity occurs usually during the spring and fall when cold fronts cause instability with the region&#x27;s warm climate. While not a common occurrence, the city occasionally experiences hail or brief tornadoes.

<text>San Benito is a city in Cameron County, in the US state of Texas, United States. Its population was 24,861 at the 2020 census. On April 3, 2007, San Benito celebrated the 100th anniversary of its naming.

The post office was named &quot;Diaz&quot; from April to May 1907. The San Benito Museum, Freddy Fender Museum, and Conjunto Music Museum opened in the same building on November 17, 2007.

On October 25, 1975, on the television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, Freddy Fender saluted his hometown of San Benito, population 15,177.

San Benito is part of the Brownsville–Harlingen–Raymondville and the Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan areas.

==History==

San Benito is known as the &quot;Resaca City&quot;. The Resaca de los Fresnos, wide, flows through the city. As indicated by its Spanish name, the &quot;resaca&quot; is a dry river bed. It is now the main canal of a large irrigation system.

San Benito was at first named &quot;Diaz&quot; in honor of Porfirio Díaz, President of Mexico at that time. The people in the San Benito area were predominantly of Mexican ancestry. The Anglo settlers came after the completion of the first irrigation system in 1906. Prior to that time, this region was an arid, mesquite- and cactus-covered wilderness. Irrigation water touched off crop production, supported by the railroad.

On July 4, 1904, the first passenger train arrived at Diaz. To celebrate the coming of the new railroad, the community leaders renamed the railroad station &quot;Bessie&quot;, in honor of Bessie Yoakum, whose father, Benjamin Franklin Yoakum, was instrumental in the construction of the railroad.

Some time later, when the town site was surveyed, the name was changed to &quot;San Benito&quot; in honor of Benjamin Hicks. He was a pioneer rancher whose charitable attitude endeared him to the population. The name was suggested by Rafael Moreno, the popular 90-year-old camp cook of the surveying party. Moreno suggested the name &quot;San Benito&quot; for his beloved &quot;Saint Benjamin&quot; Hicks.

San Benito was a village with a moderate number of homes, businesses, churches, and public schools several years before the town was incorporated in 1911. The original map of the townsite was recorded 28 April 1907. The first school was established in 1907 with 48 pupils and Miss Kate Purvis as the teacher. The post office also opened in 1907. San Benito (Benny) Montalvo was born on September 20, 1907, to Ismael and Francisca Esparza Montalvo. On the night he was born, the city of San Benito was having a celebration in honor of its new name. Upon learning of Benny&#x27;s birth, Col. Sam Robertson suggested to Ismael and Francisca Montalvo to name their new son San Benito, which is how Benny got his name.

In 1927, the city adopted a commission form of government operating under a home rule charter.

In 1920, when the city was included in the U.S. Census count for the first time, San Benito had become a city of 4,070 people. By 1950, the census count expanded to 13,271. In 1960, the population had grown to 16,422. 

The irrigation district was organized in 1906. As a result of the availability of irrigation water, San Benito and all of the Lower Rio Grande Valley cities came to serve a newly developing agricultural territory.

The original townsite, created in 1911, contained . Since then, a series of annexations has increased the incorporated area to .

The mild winter climate in this southmost section of Texas has played a dominant role in the growth of San Benito and the other cities of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Crops grow and flowers bloom year-round. The city has become a hotspot for winter tourists and retired people, providing a substantial percentage of the buying power of this community.

==Landmarks==
===Giant cross===
 A 19-story cross erected by The Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ Ministries is located next to Interstate 40 northwest of the town limits. This free-standing cross can be seen from away and eight months were required to construct the cross. Surrounding the base of the cross are life-sized statues of the 14 Stations of the Cross. In addition to the giant cross and the Stations of the Cross, there is also a visitor center, gift shop and amphitheater located at the site.

Inspired by this cross, residents of Effingham, Illinois, erected a similar cross that is taller. Though some tourist brochures claim this cross to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, it is smaller than the Valle de los Caídos cross in Spain, which is elevated overground. The cross is also shorter than the cross at the Mission Nombre de Dios in St. Augustine, Florida, and shorter than the Lakeuden Risti cross-shaped church tower in Seinäjoki, Finland. The movie &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; was filmed on location near the site of the cross in Groom, but the movie was filmed before the cross was built.

===Leaning water tower===

Also in Groom one can find a leaning water tower, sometimes called The Leaning Tower of Texas or The Leaning Tower of Britten, which currently serves as a decorative item and roadside attraction. The leaning tower was originally a functioning water tower which was slated for demolition until Ralph Britten bought it and moved it to serve as a sign for his truck stop and tourist information center (located on a stretch of interstate that was once a part of U.S. Route 66). This truck stop can still be seen, set back off the road behind the tower, now boarded up and in disrepair following a devastating fire decades ago.

The leaning water tower still remains a popular target for cameras, and the town of Groom turns on a large colored star mounted on the top around Christmas time. The water tower is a common image from Route 66 photography books.

==Education==
The Town of Groom is served by the Groom Independent School District.

==History==
===Early exploration===
The route from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Santa Fe, New Mexico, along the Canadian River was charted circa 1849 by Captain Randolph Barnes Marcy. Published in 1859, Marcy&#x27;s book, &quot;The Prairie Traveler: A Handbook for Overland Expeditions&quot;, contained maps and illustrations of routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific and was used as a basic manual by westward-bound wagon trains and travelers for years.

===Colonel B. B. Groom===
Colonel B. B. Groom, an experienced cattleman near Lexington, Kentucky, leased from the New York and Texas Land Company of land in Hutchinson, Carson, Gray, and Roberts counties in the Texas Panhandle in 1882, resulting in the organization of the Francklyn Land and Cattle Company. Groom purchased an estimated 1,300 head of shorthorns in 1882 and selected the Diamond F brand, approved by the Francklyn officials and filed as the company&#x27;s brand in October 1882. Unfortunately, Groom&#x27;s vision of the finest and most desirable cattle ranch in the United States did not materialize for him. The Francklyn Land and Cattle Company became insolvent in 1886. The bondholders foreclosed and organized a new company known as White Deer Lands (later White Deer Land Company), under the management of the agent Timothy Dwight Hobart, one of the subsequent founders of Pampa, Texas.

===Harrison Groom===
Colonel Groom&#x27;s son, Harrison Groom, established a camp at the edge of a little lake just west of the present town of White Deer.

===The town===
The site of Groom was chosen in 1902, along the route of the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway. Groom was first incorporated in 1911.

<text>Panhandle is the county seat of Carson County, Texas, United States. The population of the town was 2,378 at the 2020 census. Panhandle is part of the Amarillo metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Panhandle derives its name from its central location in the Texas Panhandle. Originally named &quot;Carson City&quot;, it was later changed to &quot;Panhandle City&quot;.

In 1887, Panhandle obtained a post office, and in 1888, the town was planned as the terminus of the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway. At that time, the town was surrounded by several large cattle ranches. The community soon acquired a bank, a mercantile store, a wagonyard, a school, a newspaper, and three saloons.

In 1888, Carson County was organized, and Panhandle became the county seat. The area&#x27;s cattlemen were reconciled to the arrival of farmers because they produced needed forage crops, such as hay, and introduced more families with eligible young women for the cowboy bachelors of the cattle kingdom.

Panhandle was scandalized in 1897 after George E. Morrison, a preacher at the Methodist Episcopal Church, poisoned his wife Minnie with a strychnine-laced apple so that he could marry his mistress Miss Annie Whittlesey of Topeka, Kansas. Morrison was sentenced to die in the gallows at Vernon in Wilbarger County, Texas, his last words being: &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot;.

In 1909, Panhandle voted to incorporate with a mayor-council government.

The population grew in the 1920s when Panhandle became the center of a natural gas field.

A new county courthouse was completed in 1950.

Panhandle continued to thrive in the 1980s as a regional marketing and shipping center for cattle, wheat, and petroleum products.

The Carson County Square House Museum is located inside the oldest house in Panhandle, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Skellytown is a town in Carson County, Texas, United States. Its population was 394 at the 2020 census, down from 473 at the 2010 census. Located in the Texas Panhandle, it is part of the Amarillo metropolitan area. In 1926, Skelly Oil Company purchased a lease from Henry Schafer, a local rancher on whose land the Roxana oil pool was located. Schafer platted a new townsite, which he named &quot;Skelly&quot; in honor of the company&#x27;s founder and president, William Grove Skelly of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

==History==
Skelly was sited between the oil boom camps of Roxana, which was north of Skelly, and Noelette, which was east. The first businesses were company-owned supply stores. Residents had to gather wood for fuel and rely on trucked-in water supplies.

The Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line north in 1927, from White Deer to the oilfields, and established its depot at a site just north of Skelly. All three camps moved their businesses to the new site and formed the Skellytown Townsite Company. Four months later, Skellytown had two oil refineries, a carbon black -manufacturing plant, and about 100 oil wells operating in its vicinity. Also in 1927, a new post office opened, the &quot;Roxana-Skellytown News&quot; began publishing every week, Panhandle Power and Light began to provide utilities, and a four-room emergency hospital opened.

==Geography==

Skellytown is located in northeastern Carson County just northeast of Texas State Highway 152, which leads northwest to Borger and southeast to Pampa.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Skellytown has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===

<text>White Deer is a town in Carson County, Texas, United States. The population was 918 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Amarillo metropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
White Deer is located along U.S. Highway 60 in east central Carson County, northeast of Panhandle, the Carson County seat, and northeast of Amarillo.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, White Deer has a semiarid climate, &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
The community was first settled around 1882, when the British-owned Francklyn Land and Cattle Company, later reorganized as the White Deer Land Company, occupied the area and began stocking it with cattle. George Tyng, general manager of the property, built the headquarters for White Deer or Diamond F Ranch at the site in 1887. Around the same time, the Purcell Company purchased land in the vicinity as a right-of-way for the Southern Kansas Railway of Texas. A depot was built in 1888. The site was initially known as &quot;Paton&quot; (after John Paton), then &quot;Whig&quot;, before being renamed White Deer in January 1899 – after nearby White Deer Creek. During the 1890s, British shareholders began selling land for small farms and ranches to settlers. The community moved to its present location near the railroad line in 1908. A year later, Henry Czerner and Ben Urbanczyk established a community of Polish farmers from Central Texas at the northeastern edge of town. About 50 people were living in White Deer by 1910.

The discovery of oil and gas in Carson County in 1919 brought growth to White Deer and the surrounding area. The community incorporated in 1921, and the population had risen to 200 by the mid-1920s. At the peak of the oil boom in the late 1920s, White Deer was home to nearly 3,000 people. Soon after, the city experienced a period of decline. A disastrous fire in 1931, the negative economic impact of the Great Depression, and tornadoes in 1945 and 1951 were all contributing factors in White Deer&#x27;s decline. In the late 1950s, the town became a shipping point for grain and cattle produced in the area. By 1980, the population was 1,210. That figure decreased to 1,125 in 1990 and 1,060 in 2000.

A statue of a white deer stands on a concrete pedestal in the middle of the town&#x27;s main intersection. At its base is a historical marker, erected in 1965, that commemorates the town&#x27;s rich history.

A rare type of meteorite unique to the Western Hemisphere was discovered near Hart in March 2010. A field worker found a single, large, dense brownish stone weighing 966 grams beside a road located 0.25 miles from the town of Hart. The meteor was subsequently purchased by a collector. The stone was analyzed at the University of Washington and was classified as a Carbonaceous Chondrite (CK3), the most massive example of one of 25 known specimens in the world. The finding was published in The Meteoritical Bulletin, No. 101 (2013) MB 101 with the meteorite being given the official name of &quot;Hart&quot;.

<text>Nazareth is a city in Castro County, Texas, United States. The population was 310 at the 2020 census, slightly down from 311 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Nazareth is located in eastern Castro County on the high plains of the Llano Estacado at . It is east of Dimmitt, the county seat, and west of Tulia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Nazareth has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The town of Nazareth was established through the efforts of a Catholic priest, Joseph Reisdorff, who moved to the site in 1902 with four farmers interested in purchasing land in the area. Father Reisdorff named his colony after the biblical Nazareth and advertised for settlers in several midwestern German Catholic newspapers. By September 1902 the first settlers had begun to arrive. A post office was established in 1903, and later that year the Catholic community finished building its first church. Nazareth had 71 residents by January 1904, and the town was platted latter that year. By 1905, in addition to the church, the settlement included a blacksmith shop, a store, and a school; when the community&#x27;s cemetery was consecrated in 1906, it became the only Catholic cemetery in the area. For many years local church officials supplied what little government the community desired.

In 1914 Nazareth had an estimated 50 residents, and about 150 people were living there by 1927. During the Dust Bowl of the 1930s the area was swept by huge dust storms that uprooted crops and made farming unprofitable; in 1933, the town was estimated to have only 50 residents. Agriculture in Castro County revived during the 1940s, however, and by 1941 about 200 people were living there. The population fluctuated during the 1950s and 1960, dropping to about 75 in 1955, then rising to an estimated 275 by 1964; the census found 274 people living in the town in 1970 and 299 in 1980. As late as the mid-1980s about 85 percent of the town&#x27;s residents were Catholics, and church activities helped to bond the community together. In 1990 the population stood at 293.

<doc id="135661" wikidata="Q204982" url="?curid=135661" title="Anahuac, Texas">
<text>Anahuac ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas on the coast of Trinity Bay. The population of the city was 1,980 at the 2020 census. Anahuac is the county seat of Chambers County and is situated in Southeast Texas. The Texas Legislature designated the city as the &quot;Alligator Capital of Texas&quot; in 1989. Anahuac hosts an annual alligator festival.

== History ==
The Mexican term &quot;Anahuac&quot; comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The name means &quot;place beside the waters.&quot; Anáhuac is the pre-Columbian name of the Valley of Mexico and its former lake basins around Mexico City, often including the Lerma and Pánuco river systems. Despite the name, neither the city of Anahuac, Texas, nor the immediate region were ever part of the Aztec Empire.

The first dwellers in this area were the Atakapan people as well as the Caddo. The first colonist settlers arrived in 1715, The Burkhalter and Morehead families. They established a small settlement near what is now Lake Anahuac. In 1721, Frenchman Jean Baptiste de La Harpe reached this area. In the 19th century the area became known as &quot;Perry&#x27;s Point&quot;, after Colonel Harry Perry, who erected a military post here in 1816.

Two major events in 1832 and 1835, known as the Anahuac Disturbances (caused mainly by rogue bandits termed &quot;Texians&quot; from the Brazos Valley area), helped to precipitate the Texas Revolution that led to the separation of Texas from Mexico. One of these events was the jailing by Mexican authorities of William Travis for illegal slave importation, and the other was unfair taxation and duties on river traffic to the settlers by the Mexican authorities.

In October 1830, Mexican Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn established a customs post atop the same bluff where Perry had camped. Bradburn&#x27;s orders specified that the new post be named Fort Anahuac. The soldiers erected two large kilns to produce bricks to build a more permanent fort. Fort Anahuac would still be intact today had it not been for the locals using the bricks for their own home construction soon after the Texas Revolution; virtually all bricks were taken and none remain to this day. By March 1831, Anahuac comprised 20 houses and seven stores. The town grew quickly. Soldiers were given 25 cents per day to use for food and other supplies, and they spent the money locally. By June 1, the town comprised over 300 civilians and 170 military personnel.

In 1862, a small Confederate outpost was established nearby.

The 1935 discovery of the Anahuac Oil Field and the Monroe City area oil field brought a period of economic development. The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge was established southeast of the city in 1963 by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1989, the local chamber of commerce organized the first Gatorfest, which attracted 14,000 people into the Fort Anahuac Park, and it has been held annually since then. The festival has expanded every year since, and in 2010 hosted the largest festival, with more than 30,000 people attending.

In 2019, Atlas Air Flight 3591, a cargo flight operating for Amazon Air, crashed in the Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, while flying from Miami to Houston.

==Geography==

Anahuac is located near the center of Chambers County at the northeastern end of Trinity Bay and the southern end of Lake Anahuac. The mouth of the Trinity River into Trinity Bay is just west of the city. Lake Anahuac is approximately 33,348 acre-feet it was constructed by the Burkhalter family in 1953.

Texas State Highway 61 follows Washington Avenue and Miller Street in Anahuac and leads east and north to Interstate 10 at a point east of Houston and southwest of Beaumont.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Anahuac has a total area of , all land.

With the City of Houston&#x27;s annexation of the I-10 corridor through Bayton and Mt Belvieu to the Trinity River in Chambers County and possible further expansion to Wallisville Texas, The City of Anahuac is considering annexing and expanding its City Limits on Highway 563 to Wallisville which would possibly bring the Houston Annex to Anahuac as well.

Anahuac is also initiating a $50M School Expansion Bond due to influx of many homes and families around the area and expectation of 1000 additional school aged individuals over the next five years alone.

<text>Beach City is a U.S. city in Chambers County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,221 at the 2020 census. It can now be considered as a part of Greater Houston.

==Geography==

Beach City is located in western Chambers County extending for along the northwestern shore of Trinity Bay. The city is southeast by east of Baytown.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Beach City has a total area of , all land.

==Historical development==

With the boom economy after World War II, people had time and money for recreation. People from Baytown especially began to take advantage of the drawbridge and built small summer/weekend houses or &quot;fishing camps&quot; along the shoreline of the present Beach City. By the early 1950s, they had nicknamed FM-2354 &quot;Tri-City Beach Road&quot;, because the present Baytown resulted from a merger of three smaller towns in 1948.

However, a number who came for recreation decided to stay. By the early 1960s the community commonly called Tri-City Beach had about 500 permanent residents. At that time, the Texas legislature began to consider annexation reform. Previously, Texas municipalities had almost unfettered power to annex adjacent lands. Cities could control vast territories by annexing ten-feet-wide strips surrounding them. During that period, Baytown controlled an area larger than the California city of Los Angeles did. Larger cities could even annex smaller cities, after they had annexed to surround them. Knowing that reform was pending, many cities began a flurry of annexations. Defensively, a number of unincorporated communities began proceedings to incorporate as municipalities. The Tri-City Beach community was one of those.

On April 6, 1963, the Tri-City Beach Civic Association was formed. They met to discuss ways to better their community. The officers were Hayden Harper, a local grocer, President; Nina Harper, Secretary; Georgia Mackrell, Chairman of Publicity; and John Jennings, Chairman of the Membership Committee. The association explored a number of ideas, including the construction of a breakwater, and then began considering incorporation as a city. An Incorporation Committee was formed consisting of George Armer, Ruth Hoover, Eloice Jordan, J.D. Nicholson, and Bill White. Ms. Jordan met with County Judge Oscar F. Nelson, Jr. on March 8, 1966, and presented him with a petition for an incorporation election. On March 24, 1966, the Baytown City Council adopted Ordinance 788, consenting to the inclusion of an unspecified part of what Baytown then claimed as its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the proposed new municipality to be known as the City of Beach City. On April 5, 1966, an election was held to determine if the area would become a municipality. The results were 103 for incorporation to 4 opposed. The incorporation of Beach City was finalized by a decree issued by Judge Nelson on April 11, 1966.

To prevent annexation by the nearby city of Baytown, this community voted in April 1966 to become incorporated. An election was held on May 21, 1966, to select the first municipal officers. Eloice Jordan was elected mayor. W.D. Bush, Alvin J. Crawley, William D. Daniel, J.R. Holland, and J.D. Nicholson were chosen as aldermen for the first city council. Gus Dauzat became the first city marshal. Later Ruth Hoover was appointed by the Council as city secretary and Claude Galloway as deputy marshal.

The mayors of the city have been (by date of election):

*Eloice Jordan – April 6, 1968
*Jimmy McClellan – April 7, 1970
*Herschel Scott – April 27, 1976
*Jim Ainsworth – May, 1982
*A.R. &quot;Rusty&quot; Senac – April, 1986
*James Standridge – May 26, 1992
*A.R. &quot;Rusty&quot; Senac – May 23, 2000
*Guido Persiani – May 25, 2004
*Billy Combs – May 8, 2010

The Beach City Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1967 and still exists. A Tri-City Beach Emergency Medical service organization had been formed before the city&#x27;s incorporation and has since been merged into a county-wide emergency medical service.

With Baytown&#x27;s concurrence, Beach City increased its area on August 19, 1968, by annexing approximately near Point Barrow Road and taking in McCollum Park. The 1968 annexation moved the northern boundary of the city to Lawrence Road. This annexation brought into the city limits the historic home site of early pioneer Solomon Barrow (1801–1858), whose land included the area where McCollum Park is now located. The park, as a matter of record, contains the last resting place of Barrow, his wife Elizabeth Winfree, and Barton Clark, the first husband of their daughter Narcissa Ophelia Henrietta Jane Barrow. On October 27, 1970, again with Baytown&#x27;s concurrence, Beach City annexed the area where the Beach City Community Building and the Beach City VFD fire station are located. That is the only part of the city limits that extends west of FM-2354.

Meanwhile, there were rumors that Baytown intended to annex the community of Cove. On September 22, 1970, Beach City received a petition of 84 residents of Cove to annex the community. The mayor of Beach City at the time was Jimmy McClellan. On November 24, 1970, Beach City annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the Old and Lost Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On December 2, 1970, Beach City extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. This time Baytown did not concur. In 1971, Baytown sued Beach City in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In 1973, Beach City released its claim to what are now the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and the City of Cove was incorporated on May 23, 1973. Leroy Stevens was Cove&#x27;s first mayor. The City Council of Beach City presented to Mayor Stevens Cove&#x27;s first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use.

==History==
An early settler in the region was Martin Lacy, who built Lacy&#x27;s Fort just to the west to the current site of Alto in around 1838. In 1838 and 1839, during the campaign to suppress the Córdova Rebellion, the fort served as an operations and supply base for the Third Militia brigade commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Rusk.

The town of Alto was laid out in 1849 and named for the Spanish word meaning &quot;high,&quot; on account of the site&#x27;s elevation on a drainage divide between the Neches and Angelina Rivers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.
Alto had a prisoner of war camp during World War II, which served the Cherokee County area.

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Alto has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,027 people, 459 households, and 283 families residing in the town.

According to the 2000 U.S. census, there were 1,190 people, 452 households, and 282 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 534 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 65.55% White, 24.79% African American, 0.50% Native American, 0.17% Asian, 6.81% from other races, and 2.18% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.25% of the population.

==Education==

and Alto Elementary School.

==Public safety==
In 2011, the city eliminated its entire police force after the city council cut the police budget to zero, causing residents to brace for increased crime. A councilman is quoted as saying &quot;The police department, being a non-money-making entity, was the easiest to get rid of.&quot; Meanwhile, police services are provided by the county sheriff and, assuming the town&#x27;s finances improve, it will be opened up again in December.

==Notable people==
*James Z. Spearing, member of the United States House of Representatives from Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1924 to 1931, was born in Alto in 1864.

<doc id="135668" wikidata="Q974236" url="?curid=135668" title="Cuney, Texas">
<text>Cuney is a town located in northwestern Cherokee County, Texas, United States. With a population of 116 at the 2020 U.S. census, Cuney was the only &quot;wet&quot; town in Cherokee County from the mid-1980s until 2009, when voters in Rusk came out in favor of beer/wine sales. After that result, voters in Jacksonville and Frankston have since voted in favor of beer/wine sales, and Rusk voters returned to the polls to vote in favor of liquor sales.

==History==
The site was first settled by freed slaves just after the Civil War. The settlement was initially known as Andy, after Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Bragg, one of the area&#x27;s first black homeowners, who arrived in 1870. A community did not develop until 1902, when the site became a flag stop on the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which became part of the Southern Pacific system in 1961.

Around 1914, Palestine cashier H.L. Price and several local investors formed a company and platted a town site. They named the town Cuney, after Price&#x27;s son, Cuney Price, who in turn had been named for Norris Wright Cuney, a prominent black politician and head of the state&#x27;s Republican Party. A post office was established in 1917 and a number of businesses were operating in the community by the early 1920s. With the paving of State Highway 40 in 1929, which would eventually become U.S. Highway 175, most of the businesses moved a mile north of the railroad to take advantage of the increased traffic. The population was estimated at 100 in 1929, but declined to only 25 by the mid-1930s.

A number of businesses closed after World War II as agricultural prices decreased and residents moved to other cities with greater employment opportunities. Cuney had a population of 75 in the early 1950s. From that period, the community steadily grew, and Cuney was incorporated in November 1983. In the 1990 census, the town had 170 residents. That number had fallen to 145 by 2000.

<text>Gallatin is a city in Cherokee County, Texas, United States, with a 2020 U.S. census-tabulated population of 321.

==History==
The area was first settled in the late 1840s, but a community did not develop until 1902, when the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (T&amp;NO) was built through the area. John W. Chandler and his sister, Sophronia, who owned the surrounding land, asked Rusk attorney C. H. Martin to survey a townsite. Chandler named the new town Gallatin, after his hometown of Gallatin, Tennessee (which in turn had been named for Albert Gallatin). The new community, located in a large truck-farming area, quickly developed into a market for tomatoes and other produce. The construction in 1907 of a branch line of the T&amp;NO between Gallatin and Rusk further enhanced the town as a shipping center.

By 1914 Gallatin had a population of 350, several churches, two general stores, a drugstore, a school, and a cotton gin. In 1916, virtually the entire business district was destroyed by fire, but the town was quickly rebuilt, and as late as the mid-1930s it reported 500 residents and five businesses.

After World War II, the community steadily declined. Its school was consolidated with the Rusk schools in the 1950s, and many of the town&#x27;s businesses closed. The population declined to 350 by the early 1950s, and in 1990 only 171 residents and two stores were reported there. Nevertheless, Gallatin was incorporated in the early 1980s. In 1991, it had an estimated population of 382 and three businesses. In 2000, the population was 378 with four businesses.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

At the 2010 United States census, the population was 419. In 2020, its population declined to 321, down from the first record high in 2010.

The racial and ethnic makeup of the city was predominantly non-Hispanic white, and the median household income was $65,673 with a mean income of $68,133.

==Education==
Most of the city of Gallatin is served by the Rusk Independent School District.A small portion of the town is also within the Jacksonville ISD.

<text>Jacksonville is a city located in Cherokee County, Texas, United States. The population was 13,997 at the 2020 U.S. census. It is the principal city of the Jacksonville micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Cherokee County.

Jacksonville is located in East Texas, north of the county seat, Rusk, and south of Tyler, in Smith County.

Area production and shipping of tomatoes gained the town the title &quot;Tomato Capital of the World&quot;. The impressive red iron ore rock Tomato Bowl, built by Works Progress Administration workers during the Great Depression, is home to the Jacksonville High School &quot;Fightin&#x27; Indians&quot; football and soccer teams. Annual events include the &quot;Tops in Texas Rodeo&quot; held in May and the &quot;Tomato Fest&quot; celebration in June.

==History==
Jacksonville began in 1847 as the town of Gum Creek. Jackson Smith built a home and blacksmith shop in the area, and became postmaster in 1848, when a post office was authorized. Shortly afterward, Dr. William Jackson established an office near Smith&#x27;s shop. When the townsite was laid out in 1850, the name Jacksonville was chosen in honor of these two men. The name of the post office was changed from Gum Creek to Jacksonville in June 1850.

Despite never having organized unions in any Walmart stores before, meatcutters working at the Jacksonville Walmart voted in favor of organizing under the wing of the United Food and Commercial Workers union in February 2000. During a flurry of subsequent legal actions, Walmart discontinued store-level meatcutting and started shipping in pre-packaged/pre-frozen meat to their stores. When all the hearings and appeals were exhausted, it was decided that the local meatcutters didn&#x27;t embody the characteristics of a group that could bargain since they weren&#x27;t specialized. Even now, there is no one in the Jacksonville meat department to make special cuts of meat or any union presence there.

<text>Wells is a town in Cherokee County, Texas, United States. The population was 790 at the 2010 census, and 853 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==

Wells is at the junction of U.S. Highway 69 and Farm to Market Road 1247, twenty-three miles south of Rusk in extreme southern Cherokee County. It was established in 1885 as a stop on the newly constructed Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad and was named for Maj. E. H. Wells, a civil engineer for the railroad. A post office opened in 1886, and by 1890 the town had a sawmill, a hotel, a Methodist church, three general stores, and a population of fifty. Shortly after the railroad was completed, the state penitentiary established a satellite camp just outside the town to produce charcoal for the state-run iron works at Rusk. The presence of the prison camp discouraged many potential settlers, and the town&#x27;s population remained small until after 1900, when the charcoal camp was closed. During the 1910s, however, the town boomed; the First State Bank of Wells opened in 1913, and the following year the population reached 300. During the 1920s the community incorporated, and in 1936 Wells reported 475 residents and twenty businesses. The population continued to grow after World War II, rising to 761 by 1990. Over the same period, however, the number of businesses has gradually declined, falling from twenty-six in 1952 to seven in 1990. Farming, cattle ranching, and lumber are the principal industries.

==Geography==

Wells is in the southernmost tip of Cherokee County in East Texas, approximately south of Tyler and north of Lufkin on U.S. 69. Nacogdoches is northeast, Dallas is to the north and west, while Houston is to the south and west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

== Demographics ==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 853 people, 264 households, and 224 families residing in the town, up from 769 in 2000 and 790 at the 2010 census. The racial and ethnic makeup of the town in 2000 was 72.43% White, 18.73% African American, 0.26% Native American, 6.50% from other races, and 2.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino Americans of any race were 9.10% of the population.

== Education ==

Lack of transportation forced most children to walk to school, so for that reason small schoolhouses were scattered at five-mile (8 km) intervals throughout Cherokee county. Approximately 50 of these schoolhouses existed in the county in the 1870s. These schools were usually located in a church or a one-room building. Many of these small community schools sprang up near saw mills and other operations. The earliest schools in the Wells vicinity were at Shook&#x27;s Bluff, Mt. Hope, Pleasant Hill, Damascus, Forest and Sweet Union communities. In 1884, boundaries were redrawn and 69 new school districts were formed in Cherokee County.

The Shook&#x27;s Bluff school, located near Shook&#x27;s Bluff Cemetery, was operating in 1861. It was a crude, one-room, unpainted building. By 1920 people began to move away from the Neches River communities and closer to Wells, so the Shook&#x27;s Bluff school was relocated two miles (3 km) west of Wells. Three teachers employed at that school were Vinnie Solley, Nora McClain, and Effie Wesley. Shook&#x27;s Bluff school finally consolidated with Wells school in 1928.

Forest School was established in 1888 in the Forest Baptist Church, and later occupied a separate building on a lot donated by J. S. Derrough, Jeff Latham, and Hugh Henry. In 1922, Forest School consolidated with the Wildhurst School from the Chronister Lumber Company Camp and a new building was built on the old Jim Hogg Highway north of the Baptist Church in Forest. The new building housed the elementary and three unaccredited high school grades. Forest School consolidated with Wells ISD in 1949.

There were two Mt. Hope Methodist church schools. The first school was established in 1875 and the first teachers were H.S.P. Espie and John Clifford. The other Mt. Hope school consisted of a single 20 x 20 room and all grades were taught by one teacher. Classes were held for three months in the winter and during two summer sessions. Nathan Fulton, the first teacher, was paid $40 a month for his services. Other teachers were Jasper Starling, Asilee Hyde, Charlie Bowden, Quarles McClure, and George B. Terrell.

When Wells began to prosper as a result of the Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad reaching the town in 1885, the Mt. Hope school was moved to the Methodist church in town. Classes later moved to a two-story brick building on the present school site. That building burned in 1917 and was replaced by a similar structure build on the original faulty foundation. When a crack appeared in the back wall a few years later, the school was reduced to a single story. At about that time, Damascus and Crossroads schools consolidated with Wells and three high school grades were added.

Wells Independent School District was formed on June 12, 1921. The first school trustees were W. D. Lewis, Jr., Rube Sessions, W. T. Hunt, R. N. Falvey, T.B. Warner, J. W. Ellerbee, and Steve Cherry. The first superintendent was Hugh Stegall. The federal census showed Wells with a population of 475 when the first four-year high school class graduated in 1930. The school was accredited by the Texas Education Agency in 1934.

As transportation facilities continued to improve, all the county&#x27;s small school districts were gradually absorbed into the five school districts that exist today: Wells, Alto, Rusk, Jacksonville, and New Summerfield.

<doc id="135678" wikidata="Q973936" url="?curid=135678" title="Henrietta, Texas">
<text>Henrietta is a city in and the county seat of Clay County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,111 at the 2020 census, a decline of 30 from the 2010 tabulation of 3,141.

==History==

Henrietta is one of the oldest settled towns in north central Texas. It sits at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 287, U.S. Highway 82, State Highway 148, and Farm to Market Road 1197 in north central Clay County.

Clay and Montague counties were separated in 1857 from Cooke County to the east, and Henrietta was named as the county seat. The etymology of the town remains a mystery, though several explanations have been offered. Regardless of the origin of its name, Henrietta became the center of gravity for the fledgling county. In 1860, as the only town in the county, it had 109 residents, 10 houses, and a general store. It sat at the far western edge of Anglo expansion in north-central Texas, but Native Americans remained a viable threat to current and future settlers. In 1862, Henrietta opened its post office. In the early 1860s, there were continuous attacks from local tribes. By late 1862, Henrietta was abandoned, and white settlers returned east to Cooke and Montague counties. Remaining structures were burned. Anglos continued to attempt resettlement, and in 1865 after the Civil War, a group attempting resettlement was massacred. A number of Quakers attempted to reoccupy the former townsite, but its members were either killed or fled. In 1870, fifty soldiers and Kiowa Indians fought a battle in the ruins of Henrietta.

After the battle, white settlers returned to Henrietta, this time permanently. In 1874, the post office reopened, and Henrietta quickly became the economic hub of north-central Texas. In 1882, the Fort Worth and Denver Railway reached Henrietta on its southern side, and in 1887, Henrietta became the westernmost terminus for the Gainesville, Henrietta, and Western Railway.

In 1895, the Wichita Falls Railway, one of the properties of Joseph A. Kemp and Frank Kell, linked Henrietta with Wichita Falls; sold in 1911, this segment was operated thereafter by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, known as the Katy. This particular track was abandoned in 1970. MK&amp;T then built in Wichita Falls a station, offices, a roundhouse, and three switching tracks.

After heavy lobbying by businessmen, Henrietta became a logistical supply point for various operations in north-central Texas, including mining in Foard and Archer counties. The Southwestern Railway Company in 1910 completed a rail linking Henrietta with Archer City.


Though it had been settled earlier, Henrietta did not incorporate until 1881. The Clay County courthouse was built in 1884 and is still in use. By 1890, the population had reached 2,100, and the town boasted a 400-seat opera house, five churches, a new jailhouse, and a school. From 1893 to 1895, it had a college—Henrietta Normal College—for the training of teachers. It remained the economic hub of the county at the turn of the 20th century.

The St. Elmo Hotel, established about 1895 in Henrietta, had among its guests Quanah Parker, who married two of his wives there, and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, when he toured the North Texas area. When the top floors of the hotel burned, the facility closed and never reopened. A portion of the lower floor now houses an antiques store.

The growth of Henrietta waned in the 20th century as Wichita Falls grew rapidly into the most prosperous economic center in the area. The Southwestern Railway line was abandoned in 1920, and the Gainesville, Henrietta, and Western Railway line closed in 1969. By 1990, the population remained under 3,000. In 2000, it topped 3,000 for the first time since the 1970 census. In many ways, Henrietta is a &quot;bedroom community&quot; for Wichita Falls but is still the largest city in Clay County.

The play &quot;Texas&quot; presented during summers at the Palo Duro Canyon near Amarillo is loosely based on the history of Henrietta.

The 1995 film, &quot;The Stars Fell on Henrietta,&quot; produced by Clint Eastwood and David Valdez, and starring Robert Duvall, Brian Dennehy and Billy Bob Thornton, depicts the Texas oil rush of the 1930s and is set in Henrietta.

<text>Morton is a city in and the county seat of Cochran County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 1,690. This represented a 15.8% population decline since the 2010 Census.

==History==
Famous cattle baron Christopher C. Slaughter died in 1919, and in 1921, his heirs dissolved his cattle company. Slaughter&#x27;s eldest daughter, Minnie Slaughter Veal, hired an agent to sell her share of the property, and this agent—named Morton Smith—founded the town of Morton. In 1923, the townsite was platted, and Smith&#x27;s land office was on the east side of the square. In 1924, Morton became the county seat over a town called Ligon. The Slaughters had founded Ligon and were hoping that it would become the county seat. Cochran County&#x27;s western boundary is along the Texas–New Mexico border.

Ranches continued to be sold as farmland throughout the 1920s. According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;, a family named Winder was so large that it doubled the population of Morton. Mrs. Mary Winder served as Morton&#x27;s first postmistress (1924–1943). Since Cochran County was one of the last in the state to be broken out into farmland and settled, the motto for Morton became &quot;The Last Frontier&quot;.

Morton was spared the fate of many Texas towns that shriveled and died after being bypassed by the railroad during the 1930s and 1940s. Morton being the county seat, plus having all that former rangeland newly broken out into farmland, attracted many new farming families to move in during that time, and helped Morton not only survive, but also to grow and thrive.

In 1933, Morton was incorporated, with Henry Cox as the town&#x27;s first mayor.

Morton was the hometown of Lt. Col. George Andrew Davis, Jr., a World War II ace who was killed in the Korean War.

<text>Santa Anna is a town in Coleman County in Central Texas, United States. Its population was 1,014 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Santa Anna is located in east central Coleman County. Three U.S. highways pass through the center of town. U.S. Route 283 leads south to Brady, U.S. Route 67 leads west to Ballinger, while U.S. Route 84 and US 283 together lead northwest to Coleman, the county seat, and US 67 and 84 together lead east to Brownwood.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Santa Anna has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==

The twin mesas in central Coleman County have always been a landmark. One of the earliest maps of Texas shows a mountain near the center of the state with the notation, &quot;Santa Anna&#x27;s Peaks&quot;. The mountain and later the town were named for Comanche war chief Santanna, or Santa Anna.

Texas Rangers camped at the foot of the mountain long before the area was settled. Cattle drives from South Texas to the northern markets passed through the gap in the mountain along a military road. This road helped supply the outpost forts along the Texas Forts Trail. The first permanent European-American settlers soon built homes near a freshwater spring at the foot of the mountain. One enterprising settler stocked a supply of goods for trail drivers and settlers, starting the first business at &quot;The Gap&quot; in the early 1870s. In 1879, a petition to open a post office was filed, and the name of &quot;Santa Anna&quot; was chosen.

During the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad, a group of residents bought land along the right-of-way. Stone buildings were built from limestone quarried from the cap rock of the west mountain. Several businesses moved from Trickham and Brownwood to be a part of the new community. In 1886, &quot;The Santa Anna News&quot; was established. The first telephone in the county was a private line from Brownwood to Coleman, connected in the Melton Hotel in Santa Anna. A small local exchange was opened in 1892. A drugstore and a bank were opened in the 1880s, and a one-room school was opened that soon expanded to four rooms.

As the open range was preempted and sold, land was cultivated, with cotton the principal crop. Santa Anna eventually had four cotton gins in operation, and was also a major rail shipping point for livestock. The town became a trade center with a thriving business district that included drugstores, hotels, banks, livery stables, and produce houses. One of the early buildings, still a landmark downtown, housed an opera house, where traveling groups and local performers provided entertainment and culture.

After World War I, Dr. T.R. Sealy established a hospital that soon became widely known. A nursing school was founded in the 1920s to provide trained nurses, continuing until the death of Dr. Sealy in the mid-1930s.

During the first half of the 20th century, Santa Anna thrived as a small farming and ranching community. It later developed businesses related to the area oil industry.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, tourism has emerged as a new industry in Santa Anna. Currently, 38 businesses are located in Santa Anna, of which 13 are less than three years old. Custom hand-crafted furniture has become a hallmark of the city. Other popular draws include numerous antique stores, furniture stores, and specialty shops. Santa Anna and the surrounding area are also popular among dove, quail, turkey, and deer hunters.

<text>Allen is a city in Collin County in the U.S. state of Texas, and a northern suburb in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

The Allen area was previously home to the Caddo, Comanche, and other indigenous peoples. The first immigrants from the United States and Europe arrived in the early 1840s.

The railroad allowed the sale of crops across the country before they rotted, causing a shift from the previous cattle-based agriculture. On February 22, 1878, a gang led by Sam Bass committed in Allen what is said to be Texas&#x27;s first train robbery.

From 1908 through 1948, Allen was a stop along the Texas Traction Company&#x27;s interurban line from Denison to Dallas. Allen was a small town of a few hundred residents when it was incorporated in 1953. Since this time, it has grown dramatically due to the construction of U.S. Route 75, the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and the development of nearby Dallas and Plano. Among the more recent developments is the Shaddock Park neighborhood.

As of 2023, Allen is not served by any public transit agencies. The Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) public transit system does not extend north into Allen. Active Red Line service is unable to expand further north because Allen is currently unable to levy the 1% sales tax required for DART membership. Allen levies sales tax at the maximum rate of 8.25% set by Texas law. Redirecting 1% sales tax for DART membership would require scrapping funding for the Allen Economic Development Corporation and the Allen Community Development Corporation. The Texoma Area Paratransit System (TAPS) transit service provided bus routes for a short period from 2013 until Collin County bus service was suspended in 2015.

<text>Anna is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. Located in Collin County, its population was 16,896 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==
Following the American Civil War, the Houston and Texas Central Railway resumed laying track north from Corsicana and passed through the area in 1872. By the time Anna was platted in 1883, it had a population of 20, two stores, a steam gristmill, and a Baptist church. A post office also opened in that year. In 1885, the railroad built a depot.

By 1890 the town had a population of nearly 200. Anna was incorporated in 1913, with John L. Greer as first mayor.

Local historian Chester A. Howell (1921-2019) compiled a brief history of Anna for inclusion in a book, &quot;A Town Named Anna&quot;, that was given to those who attended the Anna school homecoming on October 19, 1985. A one-page list of errata to correct some minor errors was added in 1989. In 2018, the Anna Area Historical Preservation Society published, &quot;The Spark That Ignited The Town Of Anna&quot; (), a collection of stories and pictures of early Anna, Texas.

The Houston and Texas Central Railway extended its track in a north–south route several miles east of Mantua in 1872. Mantua soon declined in favor of the new railroad towns of Van Alstyne (Grayson County) and Anna which developed here in early 1880s.

===Namesake===
The town was named in honor of Miss Anna Quinlan, daughter of George A. Quinlan, superintendent of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad.

===First Christian Church of Anna===
Liberty Christian Church, one of the earliest Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) churches in Texas, was founded in northern Collin County by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J. B. Wilmeth in 1846. In 1854, a Christian seminary was established by members of the Liberty congregation about two miles northwest of Anna in the (then) newly established community of Mantua.

According to local tradition Mantua&#x27;s Christian congregation split between the two new communities. Former Mantua church members and early Anna resident Rebecca Sherley helped organize the First Christian Church of Anna in 1882. The Rev. Alf Douglas served as first Pastor. Services were held in the Sherley home until it burned in 1886. About 1890 the sanctuary was built here at the site of the former Sherley home. Major additions to the rear of the sanctuary were completed in 1949.

===A. Sherley and Brother Hardware Store===
Lewis and Pauline Sherley moved to north Texas from Kentucky about 1853. Their grandsons, brothers Andrew and William Sherley, opened a hardware store in 1894. William Sherley died in 1894 and, his son, Fred bought out his father&#x27;s share of the store. It remained in the family after the store closed in 1979. Over time they were undertakers as well as purveyors of furniture, farming implements and machinery, wagons, cotton, grain and groceries. Wagon-weighing scales in front of the building were removed when the road was widened. The structure is a fine example of an early Texas commercial building, retaining the original canopy and painted signs. Minimal Victorian-era detailing includes corbelled brickwork in the parapet and paneled kickplates on storefront display windows.

===Tornado===
On May 9, 2006, a storm producing two tornadoes swept across Anna, with the first tornado (F0) passing east of the high school, barely missing the incorporated city limits. The second tornado (F3) touched down in neighboring Westminster and Whitewright, destroying many homes and killing three. During the disaster, several volunteers from Collin County Amateur Radio Services worked with the National Weather Service in a Skywarn net. The Anna police and fire departments along with the American Red Cross opened Anna High School up as a shelter to the &quot;walking wounded&quot; and anyone who needed a place to stay due to the road blockages and damage in that area. The tornadoes could be seen from Anna, Van Alstyne, and Melissa, and power was knocked out to several homes in the area.

<doc id="135692" wikidata="Q620310" url="?curid=135692" title="Celina, Texas">
<text>Celina ( ) is a city in Collin and Denton counties in the U.S. state of Texas. Celina is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

The population was 16,739 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 43,317.

The &quot;Dallas Business Journal&quot; has ranked Celina as the fastest-growing city in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex for three consecutive years (2019-2021). The population growth rate of Celina was 50.8% from 2015 to 2019. Celina&#x27;s maximum project buildout population is approximately 378,000.

Celina is the 1st gigabit city in the State of Texas and was recognized by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in May 2022. In 2017, Celina passed a gigabit city ordinance, which was an innovative initiative to provide fiber, gigabit internet speed to all of its residential homes. As of 2021, approximately 9,300 homes have high speed fiber internet, and residents have pure fiber network with unlimited bandwidth and speeds of 1,000 megabits per second.

==History==
Although Celina was not established until 1876, settlers came into the area at a much earlier date. In October 1879, a settlement formed south of its current location. A Methodist church was built in 1880, and it doubled as a schoolhouse for a short time. Celina&#x27;s first postmaster John T. Mulkey renamed the town after his hometown – Celina, Tennessee. By 1884, Celina had a gristmill, cotton gin, school, several general stores, and a drug store that has been opened in “Old Celina.”

In 1902, news had reached Celina that the St. Louis, San Francisco, and Texas Railway would be constructed and extended to reach the area. Shortly thereafter, the merchants of the town made the decision to move the entire town closer to the railway. When the time came to move, the businesses and houses were loaded onto rollers and moved north to be closer to the railway. The town coined itself “Rollertown.” The move was completed in February 1902.

A town site company secured land for the new “Celina,” which was part of a pasture belonging to the late William Willock. The company had taken fences down, marked off streets, and placed lots for sale. Originally, it was intended that the current Main Street would be the Main Street of the town so it was made wider than the other streets and the price of lots were higher. Because of the higher price, the merchants began locating north of Main Street and west of the railroad. In 1907, the town was officially incorporated with Will Newsom serving as the first mayor.

In 1910, Celina resident J. Fred Smith (who later became the first mayor of University Park in Dallas) had the business section rebuilt from a row of frame buildings facing the railroad tracks to uniform brick buildings around a square. By July 1911, Smith&#x27;s effort had paid off as several new buildings were ready for use and gravel streets were constructed, which gave Celina the appearance of a wide-awake, growing little city. Businesses began to relocate from their wooden structures into the new brick buildings, and many of the wooden structures moved into a residential section and transformed into homes. This was a pivotal moment in Celina&#x27;s character as it marked the shift towards the brick features that define the Downtown Square today.

Celina Pike, the first road in the county built exclusively for automobiles, opened in Celina in 1915. At that time, Celina had a newspaper, two banks, and municipal water works. In 1921, Lone Star Gas organized Farmers Gas Company to provide natural gas to Celina and other small rural towns. In 1924, Texas Power and Light began supplying electricity to Celina then replaced by Grayson-Collin Electric Cooperative in 1937.

By 1937, Celina had a variety of businesses and professional services, including a dry good store, seven gas stations, three cotton gins, two drug stores, two grain elevators, two ice houses, flour mill, laundry, lumber yard, shoe and harness shop, jewelry store, blacksmith, movie theatre, and a modern brick school building. During World War II, the diversification of commerce in the Downtown Square continued as it served as a collection points for scrap iron.

<text>Farmersville is a city located in Collin County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,612 at the 2020 census, with the larger Census County Division (CCD) having a population of 12,344.

==History==
Farmersville originated in 1849 as a settlement on the Jefferson-McKinney Road, and near Republic of Texas National Road - now known as US Highway 380 and Texas State Highway 78, respectively. The settlement was named by two of the original settlers - William Pickney Chapman &amp; John Hendrex - after the chief occupation of many of the residents.

After 1854, additional settling families including the Yearys and several families of Sugar Hill (approximately 2 miles northeast) began relocating to Farmersville. 

H.M. Markham, practicing here by 1855, is said to have been Collin County&#x27;s earliest physician. The First United Methodist Church was organized in 1856. On March 4, 1859, William Gotcher donated land for the public town square, now the anchor of Farmersville’s commercial district. 

Records indicate a school operated in town as early as the 1860s. 

The First Baptist Church of Farmersville was organized on May 14, 1865.

The town was incorporated on June 2, 1873, with John S. Rike elected as the first mayor, with a City Council composed of aldermen James Church, Ben King, John Murchison, Tom Tatum, and John P. Utt. Jeff Hines served as the first town Marshal.

Institutions from the 1880s that are still in operation include the &quot;Farmersville Times&quot;, the oldest newspaper in Collin County, and the First Bank (now Independent Financial), as well as the two churches mentioned above.

On June 15, 1945, Audie Murphy, the most decorated combat soldier of World War II, came home to a hero&#x27;s welcome in Farmersville. Thousands of celebrants filled the square to listen to him speak, and the event was noted in the July 16, 1945 edition of &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. A Texas Historical Commission plaque notes the event on The Square.

As the town became a trade center, agriculture kept pace. Farmersville in the 1930s was known as the &quot;Onion Capital of North Texas&quot;, annually shipping over 1,000 carloads of onion. Along with some small industry, cantaloupe, cattle, corn, cotton, and maize crops remained important.

On May 8, 2021, in honor of Audie Murphy and on the 76th anniversary of VE Day - commemorating the end of fighting in the European Theater of Operations during World War II - a &quot;Sister City Pact&quot; between Farmersville and Holtzwihr, France was signed. This ceremony was to cement the common bond between the two cities and recognize Murphy&#x27;s heroism at the Battle of Holtzwihr on January 26, 1945.. Previously, on January 29, 2020, the people of Holtzwihr erected a memorial to the men who fought and died with the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division under command of the 1st French Army. Murphy was selected and memorialized as the soldier who best exemplified the courage, valor and sacrifice the soldiers made in their battle with the Nazi enemy.

<text>McKinney is a city in and the county seat of Collin County, Texas, United States. It is Collin County&#x27;s third-largest city, after Plano and Frisco. A suburb of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, McKinney is about north of Dallas.

The Census Bureau ranked McKinney as the nation&#x27;s fourth fastest-growing large city from 2010 to 2019 and determined the city&#x27;s 2020 population was 195,308. Based on Census Bureau estimates, as of July 2022 the city&#x27;s population was 207,507, making it Texas&#x27;s 15th-most populous city and the 110th most populous in the United States.

==History==
In 1848, McKinney was named the county seat of Collin County due to the original county seat of Buckner not being within three miles of the county&#x27;s geographic center. On March 24, 1849, William Davis, who owned where McKinney now stands, donated for the townsite. That same year, McKinney would be incorporated and in 1859 McKinney was incorporated again. In 1913, the McKinney adopted the commission form of government.

For its first 125 years, McKinney served as the county&#x27;s principal commercial center. The county seat provided farmers with flour, corn, cotton mills, cotton gins, a cotton compress, and a cottonseed oil mill, as well as banks, churches, schools, newspapers, and from the 1880s, an opera house. Businesses also came to include a textile mill, an ice company, a large dairy, and a garment-manufacturing company. The population grew from 35 in 1848 to 4,714 in 1912. By 1953, McKinney had a population of more than 10,000 and 355 businesses. The town continued to serve as an agribusiness center for the county until the late 1960s.

By 1970, Plano surpassed McKinney in size. McKinney experienced moderate population growth, from 15,193 in the 1970 census to 21,283 in the 1990 census. By the mid-1980s, the town had become a commuter center for residents who worked in Plano and Dallas. In 1985, it had a population of just over 16,000 and supported 254 businesses. Since then, McKinney&#x27;s rate of increase has been much more dramatic. In the 2000 census, McKinney had grown to 54,369 with 2,005 businesses and in the 2010 census the population had more than doubled to 131,117 residents. The Census Bureau&#x27;s July 2015 estimate placed the population of McKinney at 162,898. A later estimate placed the city population as of January 1, 2019 as 187,802.

Both the city and the county were named for Collin McKinney, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, and a congressman for the Red River district of the former Republic of Texas. He was the author of a bill establishing counties in the northern part of the state.

==Economy==

In its beginning, McKinney heavily relied on agriculture. Unlike most of the American South, McKinney relied on the production of corn and wheat instead of cotton. This was due to the lack of railroads and general poor infrastructure in Collin County before the 1870s. After the railroads arrived in McKinney in 1872, McKinney would experience major growth in the cotton industry with the city becoming a major distributing point for cotton farmers in Collin County. Collin County itself would become the sixth largest cotton producer in the country by 1926. In 1870, there were only 1 cotton gin in McKinney but by 1876 there were 4 cotton gin in McKinney. The first textile mill in McKinney, the Texas Cotton Mill Company, opened a mill in McKinney in 1910. After World War II, McKinney would start transitioning from its agricultural based economy to one based on industry and manufacturing.

The per capita personal income per person has been consistently rising since at least the mid 2010s with per capita personal income rising from $32,849 in 2014 to $46,671 in 2023.

<text>Melissa is a city in Collin County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,695 at the 2010 census, up from 1,350 at the 2000 census; in 2020, its population grew to 13,901.

==History==
Among Melissa&#x27;s earliest inhabitants were Paleo-Indians; archaeological finds in the area have been dated to approximately 9500 BC. In the centuries since, several Native American tribes called the area home, including the Caddo, Cherokee, Delaware, and the Kickapoo. The Tonkawa people had a settlement in the area, northeast of McKinney. These people were focused primarily on agriculture and a hunting-and-gathering lifestyle, living peacefully from the land&#x27;s bounty.

Initially settlers came from the old Highland community, two and a half miles north of present-day Melissa. C.H. Wysong, a blacksmith, was one of the earliest settlers. A post office was established in 1853 at Highland. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad arrived in Melissa in 1872 and established a depot. The town was laid out at this time. The railroad encouraged many families to come to Melissa. The town is believed to have been named for the daughter of a railroad executive, George A. Quinlan (1838–1901) of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. There is some disagreement about this, as others argue that the town was named after Melissa Huntington, daughter of C. P. Huntington, another well-known railroad executive. Anna, Texas, is named after Anna Elizabeth Quinlan (1878–1952), the only daughter of George Austin Quinlan and his wife Mary Kate Saunders (1851–1884). Quinlan, Texas, is named after George Austin Quinlan himself.
The first school in Melissa was built on land purchased in 1882 by trustees James Graves, John Gibson, and George Fitzhugh (son of William F. Fitzhugh), who were early settlers of the area. The first teacher was Mary Huckerston, who taught there for five years. The school began with 38 pupils. Church services were held there for all faiths on Sundays. A two-story brick schoolhouse was built on this site in 1910 to accommodate growth brought by the railroad.

Melissa was an important shipping point in the early 1900s. Corn, wheat, alfalfa hay, wood, and livestock were all sent out on the railroad.

A deadly F4 tornado struck Melissa on April 13, 1921, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The tornado tore the roof off of the brick school building, but the children inside were not seriously injured. However, all churches in the town, three cotton gins, every business house except a bank, the post office, and the Houston and Texas Central railway station, were wrecked. The Waldon Hotel was lifted by the winds, turned halfway around, and thrown up against the school building.

Eight years later, on August 8, 1929, a fire burned down many of the buildings that had been rebuilt after the tornado. Population declined from a high of 500 in 1925 down to 285 in 1949.

<doc id="135700" wikidata="Q973908" url="?curid=135700" title="Murphy, Texas">
<text>Murphy is a city in suburban Collin County, Texas, United States. The 2020 census reported the population as 21,013 compared to 3,099 in 2000. Murphy is located northeast of Dallas and has a history that goes back to the late 1800s.

==History==
Attracted by the offer of land grants from the Peters colony, the first settlers of the community arrived in the area in 1846. The original townsite, located on land owned by C. A. McMillen, was first called &quot;Old Decator,&quot; after McMillen&#x27;s hometown, and later, &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Branch&quot;. When the St. Louis Southwestern Railway reached the area in 1888, the residents renamed the town &quot;Murphy&quot; in honor of William Murphy, who provided land for the tracks and the construction of a depot. A post office was established there in 1891. From the 1880s until the 1950s, Murphy served as a shipping point for area farmers and stock raisers. The Great Depression, the mechanization of farming, and job opportunities in the Dallas metropolitan area contributed to a decline in the population of Murphy. Though the rural community was never huge, its population was reduced to 150 by the mid-1950s and to 135 by 1961. Mail service was discontinued in 1954. The community was incorporated as a city in 1958. Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, the population increased dramatically. The establishment of businesses in nearby Plano and Richardson made Murphy a commuter community for these two cities. In 1970, 261 residents were reported to have been in Murphy. That figure had risen to 1,547 in 1990.

Few reminders of Murphy&#x27;s early heyday remain; one structure still in use is the First Baptist Church of Murphy, built-in 1901. Although the business district faded out, the school system remained for some time. The school building, which housed elementary and high school students, was built in 1938 as a WPA project. When it closed in 1950, the schoolchildren transferred to Plano. Later, citizens renovated the school building, which became the Community Center, Fire Station, and City Hall. The Fire Station was named after local businessman and Level III Sommelier John A. Wisniowski. Later, the City Hall and Fire Station were moved to a new municipal complex across the street, leaving the old building to be renovated as the Community Center that reopened in February 2012.

==Geography==
Murphy is located in southern Collin County, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Situated midway between Plano and Wylie on FM 544, Murphy is south of the famous Southfork Ranch. Murphy shares borders with Plano to the west, Richardson to the southwest, Sachse to the south, Wylie to the east, and Parker to the north. It is northeast of downtown Dallas and about east of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

Several subdivisions have begun building and are occupied. The newest approved development is on the northeast side of the city along Maxwell Creek. The country living theme is expressed in this development by a linear park, which includes a hike-and-bike trail. Murphy Marketplace is the dominant shopping center in the city. Built-in 2008, the center now contains numerous restaurants and services and encompasses the northeast quadrant of the North Murphy Road and East FM 544 Intersection. The municipal complex comprises a total of five buildings to serve Fire, Police, City Administration, and Public Works, as well as a 2014 addition of the PSA Murphy sports center.

With the opening of the President George Bush Turnpike, access to the West became a reality in 1999. Highways are a significant factor in the growth of the economy of southeast Collin County. Its impact on Murphy has already been felt in the rapid expansion as new homes have been built, with the boom starting in 1999. The population in late 2002 was about 6,500 and continued to grow to around 12,000 in 2006. The 2010 census reported a population of 17,708. The city was rated #7 in the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; survey of Dallas Suburbs in the July 2008 &quot;D Magazine&quot; and #9 in the 2010 edition of the article. (By comparison, Dallas was #54, and neighboring Plano was #18.) In 2011, the city was rated #27 in America by &quot;Money&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s best small towns&quot;. In 2017, Murphy was ranked #2 among over 35,000 US cities and towns, without regard to size, by the &quot;Area Vibes&quot; website.

<text>Nevada ( , unlike the state of Nevada) is a city in Collin County, Texas, United States. The population was 822 at the 2010 census, and 1,314 in 2020.

==History==
First settled in 1835 by John McMinn Stambaugh and named &quot;McMinn Chapel&quot;, the area was settled by Granville Stinebaugh, who named it after the Nevada Territory. Nevada enjoyed some prosperity after becoming a stop on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, and the town incorporated in 1889.

On May 9, 1927, a half-mile-wide F4 tornado ripped through Nevada, leaving 19 dead, 100 injured, and property damage exceeding $650,000. The town had a difficult recovery; citizens voted to unincorporate, and placed the restoration of the community in the hands of the Collin County authorities. However, the growing mechanisation involved in agriculture, along with the Great Depression, caused the town to fall into stagnation. The railroad later removed its tracks from the area.

Recent growth in Collin County during the last 25 years has moderately improved life in Nevada. The population has again reached the heights of 1927.

==Geography==
Nevada is located in southeastern Collin County east of Lavon and 4 miles west of Josephine. It is northeast of Garland and northeast of downtown Dallas.

<doc id="135704" wikidata="Q620301" url="?curid=135704" title="Princeton, Texas">
<text>Princeton is a city in Collin County, Texas, United States. The population was 17,027 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 28,027.

==History==
In the late 1870s T. B. Wilson and his brother George began farming near the site of future Princeton. In 1881 the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad Company extended its line from Greenville to McKinney, passing through land owned by the brothers. The name &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Switch&quot; was commonly used to designate the area. When residents applied for a post office branch, however, they learned that the name Wilson was already being used. The community then submitted the name &quot;Princeton&quot; in honor of Prince Dowlin, a landowner and promoter of the town. This name was accepted, and a post office was established in 1888.

In 1940, a camp of 76 cabins was built west of Princeton to house up to 400 migrant workers, who came to work during the onion and cotton seasons. In February 1945, the site became a prisoner-of-war camp for German prisoners captured during the Second World War. The local farmers paid the POWs to work on their farms. This operation continued for eight months. Under a special bill, the German prisoners were contracted to work on the City Park located across from city hall. The park was built as a living memorial and shrine to those who served and died during World War II. The Community Park/WWII P.O.W. Camp is located at 500 West College Street.

Members of the Princeton Independent School District and the Princeton Lions Club have teamed up annually to hold the Princeton Onion Festival. It is a major festival for the town that began in 2005 and is expected to occur on the fourth Saturday of April each year.

==Geography==
Princeton is located just east of the center of Collin County. It is bordered to the west by Lowry Crossing. U.S. Route 380 passes through Princeton, leading west to McKinney, the county seat, and east to Farmersville. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Boundary History===
On June 30, 2011, a Collin County District Court Judge issued a judgment ending a legal dispute over Princeton&#x27;s southern boundary. The judgment ruled against the city, finding that the tract of land in question had not been annexed and was not lawfully within the city limits. 
The case was filed on January 12, 2010 and was titled: The State of Texas Ex Rel. Collin County, Texas vs. The City of Princeton, Texas, Case No. 401-00108-2010. This case is available for public viewing in the Collin County courthouse.
The State of Texas&#x27; Motion for Summary Judgment stated &quot;that Princeton administration had &#x27;unlawfully and improperly attempted to assert jurisdiction over a tract of land which the city never annexed and which is not lawfully within the corporate city limits,&#x27; according to Collin County court records.&quot;&quot; &quot;Tract Five, the property in question, is a strip of land that runs the length of the right of way of Farm to Market Road 982 from about a half mile south of U.S. Highway 380 to its intersection with FM Road 546.&quot; &quot;The southern portion of this tract was incorporated as part of the city of Branch from August of 1971 through April of 1977.&quot; 
&quot;After three months in which no response of any kind was received from the city (of Princeton) in regard to the matter, the (approximately 100) landowners concluded that the city (of Princeton) was ignoring (them) and decided in November (of 2006) to refer the matter to the Collin County District Attorney for possible legal action.&quot; The landowners &quot;provided all of the documentation&quot; (to the D.A.)...

&quot;The state&#x27;s quo warranto motion, filed in November 2010, claimed that Princeton was wrongfully exercising powers not authorized by any law or statute and that a judgment on the case could be made without a trial and instead based solely on Princeton city records.&quot; &quot;Princeton officials first claimed the 5.5-mile strip of land as part of the city limits in 2003, but according to the state&#x27;s motion, the &#x27;contorted history of Tract Five and the City&#x27;s current efforts to effectively annex by stealth began in 1971.&#x27;&quot; &quot;In January 1971, the city enacted Ordinance No. 104, through which Princeton attempted to annex certain right-of-ways surrounding the city by a process commonly referred to as &#x27;strip annexation.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Princeton City Council passed a motion to annex five tracts, but in April of that year, the council passed another motion to eliminate Tract Five from the proposed annexations.&quot; &quot;Texas Legislature subsequently prohibited &#x27;strip annexation&#x27; through procedures mandated by Chapter 43 of the Texas Local Government Code.&quot; &quot;All area maps, including one Princeton filed in 2000 with the U.S. Dept. of Justice, show that Tract Five did not belong to Princeton.&quot; &quot;Included in the state&#x27;s original filing on the case in 2010 is a corporate map of Branch that was legally filed in Collin County records in March 1975, showing that Branch owns (sic) the corner of FM 982 and FM 546 and part of the same land Princeton began claiming as its own in 2003.&quot; &quot;Robert Davis, specially deputized District Attorney representing the state, said in the state&#x27;s motion for summary judgment that &#x27;in 2003, realizing that they were prohibited by law from engaging in the type of strip annexation which was accomplished by Ordinance No. 104, the City passed an ordinance which attempted to refute the fact

Using only Princeton&#x27;s official city records, District Court Judge Ray Wheless ruled: &quot;that Princeton&#x27;s southern most corporate city limit officially extends to approximately 0.6 miles south of the intersection of F.M. Road 982 with U.S. Highway 380 but does NOT include the 5.5-mile stretch to FM 546.&quot; &quot;The order brings Princeton&#x27;s south boundary back to where it stood for nearly 32 years.&quot; Princeton&#x27;s City Council minutes from July 11, 2011 state that &quot;Councilmember Beauchamp made a motion to not appeal the Quo Warranto, Case No. 401-00108-2010. Councilmember Glass seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously.&quot; This decision was reported in The Princeton Herald on July 14, 2011 by Jamie Engle under the title, &quot;City manager terminated, no appeal in 982 case.&quot;

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 17,027 people, 5,294 households, and 4,282 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 5,494 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 52.2% White, 15.3% African American, 1.1% Native American, 3.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 11.6% from some other races and 16.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.04% of the population. 31.4% of residents were under the age of 18, 6.9% were under 5 years of age, and 6.3% were 65 and older.

==Government==
Princeton is Home Rule City.

The city is governed by City Council. The city also has Community Development Corporation and Economic Development Corporation.

===History of Government===
Historically, Princeton was a Type A General Law city, but its council members have tried to get a Home Rule form of government passed four times: in November 2007, May 2008, November 2008, and May 2014. Princeton voters rejected Home Rule each time: 149 to 117 in November 2007, 239 to 165 in May 2008, 979 to 449 in November 2008, and 260 to 151 in May 2014. Home Rule cities can tax property at a higher rate than General Law cities, because the tax rate ceiling of Home Rule cities is $2.50 per $100 valuation, while the tax rate ceiling of General Law cities is $1.50 per $100 valuation. Home Rule cities can assess additional property taxes, while a General Law city has &quot;no inherent power to tax.&quot; Besides additional property taxes, Home Rule cities are allowed to tax almost anything specified in its charter, while General Law cities cannot, because they have no charter.

In January 2015, a year long transparency study of 113 area cities, counties, and school districts was completed by The Dallas Morning News. Seven reporters sent out and tracked 565 open record requests for public information from 113 entities. They asked for public information that was clearly allowed by law. They also tested government websites to see if they were user-friendly for citizen inspection. Grades ranged from A to F. Princeton was among only three cities which earned an F. By contrast, twenty-four neighboring cities earned an A. If a government did poorly on this survey, it is a cause for citizen concern, because responding to open records requests is a basic function of government. Cities were graded according to their responses. The City of &quot;Princeton was among the worst in the Transparency 2015 ratings. It ranked as bad in request best practices, bad in request compliance, good in web customer service and excellent in online meeting notice.&quot;

In 2017 and 2019, the Texas legislature passed two laws which ended forced annexation. The 2017 law applied only to sixteen Texas counties, but the 2019 law applies to all 254 Texas counties. In 2017, Gov. Greg Abbott said, &quot;Residents from across the state that have expressed their concerns about feeling abused by the annexation process have had their voices heard. I’m proud to sign legislation ending forced annexation practices, which is nothing more than a form of taxation without representation, and I thank the legislature for their attention to this important issue during the special session.&quot; A restriction on this law was that it ended forced annexation only in Texas counties with more than 500,000 people.

On May 24, 2019, a new law went into effect extending the 2017 law. This new law ended forced annexation in all 254 Texas counties, not just the sixteen counties with populations over 500,000. At the signing, Gov. Abbott said, &quot;…Forced annexation is when cities annex property without the approval of the people and businesses that are affected. This means that cities can impose new regulations and higher taxes on Texans who purposefully choose to live outside of city limits. It’s a form of taxation without representation and it will not be tolerated in Texas…&quot; 

On November 8, 2022, Princeton brought the Home Rule issue before its voters for the fifth time since 2007. This time, most of the administrators, who had been in favor of a ten square mile land grab that violated Texas law during the years of 2003 to 2011, were no longer in office. More Princeton voters turned out for this election than ever before with a total of 4,065 votes cast. The final tally was put online by the Collin County Elections Office on November 18, 2022. Home Rule passed by a vote of 2,266 FOR (~56%) and 1,799 (~44%) AGAINST. The final tally can be found on the Collin County website under the title, &quot;November 8, 2022 General and Special Election Combined Accumulated Totals.pdf (38 pages).&quot; It is good that so many Princeton voters are paying attention to the decisions of their city government.

==Finances==
Standard and Poor’s updated the City’s bond rating in February 2021 to a &quot;AA−&quot; from a &quot;AA&quot;. Fitch Ratings raised the City&#x27;s 2020, 2021, and 2022 certificates of obligation (COs) and 2021 general obligation bonds to AA+

===History of Finances===
A Fitch business report for Princeton, dated October 9, 2012 is titled: &quot;Fitch Affirms Princeton, Texas GOs and COs at &#x27;A−&#x27;; Outlook Negative.&quot; The key rating drivers for the negative outlook are Princeton&#x27;s diminished reserves, increased tax rates, slowed tax base growth, above average debt, and the city&#x27;s inability to replenish unrestricted general fund balances to levels that provide adequate operating flexibility and financial cushion. The negative outlook reflects the trend of operating deficits in recent years, culminating in a negative general fund balance at the close of fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2011 net deficit was $4.2 million. The fiscal 2013 budget includes an increased ad valorem tax rate to increase funding for maintenance and operations; increased water service rates are also included in the budget. Fitch notes the city&#x27;s ad valorem tax rate is above average for Texas municipalities. Overall debt is above average at 5.2% of market value despite state support for overlapping school district debt and support for direct city debt by the utility system. GO debt amortization remains below average with 36.8% of principal scheduled for repayment within 10 years. A newer Fitch report, dated August 27, 2013, shows Princeton&#x27;s business outlook improved from &quot;Negative&quot; to &quot;Stable.&quot;

==Education==
The city is served by Princeton Independent School District.

Between 1850 and 1902, two settlements existed - Rock Hill was two miles south of the present town and Richland was one mile north. The development of these small communities was expedited in 1876 when county courts ordered small tracts of land to be established for a quick sale. These tracts, each about 160 acres in size, were sold for $3.50 per acre. Dr. A. T. Bryant of McKinney purchased what later became the center of the present town.

The towns merged during the establishment of St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railroad in March 1902. For years, Prosper was the central stop for the railroad between Dallas and Sherman. When community officials applied for a post office with the name &quot;Richland&quot;, they were informed that the city name was already taken. Postmaster B.J. Naugle asked for an alternative name, and J.C. Slaughter suggested the name &quot;Prosper&quot; because crops that year had been very prosperous.

Prosper was incorporated in 1914 with a commission form of government and a population of 500. Uncas Norvell Clary was mayor and served in that position for the next 49 years. Prosper became a growing area with many new homes and communities being developed. The Prosper Community of Windsong Ranch features a man-made crystalline lagoon.

<doc id="135707" wikidata="Q974920" url="?curid=135707" title="Westminster, Texas">
<text>Westminster () is a census-designated place (CDP) in northeastern Collin County, Texas, United States. The population was 861 as of the 2010 census, up from 390 at the 2000 census, at which time it was a city.

Westminster is located at the intersection of FM 3133 and FM 2862, northeast of McKinney, east of Anna, west of Leonard, north of Blue Ridge, and southeast of Van Alstyne.

==History==
The city was first settled in 1860, and named &quot;Seven Points&quot;. It grew quickly, and by 1885 had absorbed the neighbouring communities of Prospect and Graybill. In 1888, a private school was established; the building was later sold to the Methodist Church, establishing Westminster College. The college, a preparatory school for prospective ministers, was named after Westminster, Maryland, a Methodist stronghold in an otherwise predominantly Catholic state.

Within a year, the residents of Seven Points decided to change the name of their community to Westminster. The town received a post office branch in 1899, and Westminster was incorporated after a vote of 38 to 19 against, on June 17, 1916. Around the same time, the Greenville and Whitewright Northern Traction Company built a railway line from Anna to Blue Ridge that passed through Westminster.

Economic and population growth followed afterward, and from the turn of the 20th century into the 1920s, Westminster served as a cotton market and trade center for local farmers. The population grew to a high of 600, with several businesses and a high school In 1920, however, the railroad line was abandoned, and other railroads bypassed the town.

During the Great Depression, the population of Westminster was reduced by over half (to 268), and the town never had the renewed growth of its larger neighbors (such as Van Alstyne, Anna or Melissa); most of the town&#x27;s businesses had closed by World War II.

The population continued to decline until the early 1970s, when it slowly began to recover. By 1990, Westminster&#x27;s population was 388.

Westminster received a volunteer fire department in the 1990s. Fire department establishment started by lifelong resident Sam Geer. S.Geer seen a need in the small town for need in fire department response. Geer was the fire chief since the beginning until 2013 when he was made an Honorary Chief.

During the night of May 9, 2006, at around 10:30 P.M., an F3 tornado swept through the small community of Westminster, leveling many homes, damaging several others, and killing 3. Several others were injured and taken to local hospitals, while the American Red Cross set up shelter at Anna High School in nearby Anna. Sirens sounded in Anna, but due to the small population, sirens are not installed in Westminster, giving no warning to its residents. The storm struck very quickly, allowing little time to prepare.

Westminster High School was one of the last (if not the last) Texas school to field an eight-man football team. During the 1983 season, they beat a Dallas area team 90–0.

==Recent decline and disincorporation==
Westminster began a noticeable decline after 1988, when the Texas Board of Education, citing various deficiencies, removed the accreditation from the Westminster Independent School District. In 1989, voters abolished the district and closed its school. Most of the students in Westminster now attend school in Anna.

With marginal sales tax revenues, and a weak property tax base, Westminster was unable to recover from various mismanagement; embezzlement of state grant money and poor record-keeping led to a massive debt that, since 1997, had left the city seeking bankruptcy. This debt, of unpaid traffic fine revenues and a misappropriated (and unused) sewer grant, totalled over $300,000 USD.

Twice, the city of Westminster sought to declare for bankruptcy; the first effort, in 2001, failed after creditors rejected a payout plan. In early 2004, the state agencies agreed to relinquish their claims, provided that Westminster disincorporate.

Since then, the issue had been a debated topic in Westminster. That summer, the city council started a petition drive to gather enough signatures to place the matter of disincorporation on the ballot for the May 2005 elections. The council then proceeded to fire the city administrator, who opposed disincorporation. Those in favor of the matter, including then-mayor Phil Goplin, stated that disincorporation would keep the city from stagnating; without any cashflow or a sewer system, it is unable to attract the development of its neighboring municipalities.

The residents of Westminster voted to abolish their town charter on May 7, 2005. The disincorporation of the city of Westminster was only the eleventh such occurrence in Texas since 1975. With the loss of its charter, the city retains its name as a community, but is officially an unincorporated part of Collin County. Therefore, maintenance and other services of the former city are now the responsibility of Collin County. Through an agreement with the city&#x27;s creditors, the debts are considered void.

Had Westminster remained incorporated after the election, the city&#x27;s sales tax receipts would have been withheld until half the debt was repaid. A former city mayor was running for election, in case the vote failed. Opponents of the decision worry now of the loss of Westminster&#x27;s history, as well as possible annexation from neighboring Anna.

==History==

The city of Dodsonville was founded on July 1, 1910, by Frank Kell of Wichita Falls. The wealthy entrepreneur Kell was an important figure in promotion of the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, and the city was established as a stop on the Wellington Branch of the railroad. Elmore Dodson, a local pioneer and rancher, donated the town site to ensure the railroad&#x27;s passing through the southeastern part of the county. Other town sites had been proposed, including the community of Arlie located southwest of Dodson, but the grant given by Mr. Dodson sealed the railroad&#x27;s passage through southeastern Collingsworth County. In return, the new city was named for Dodson. A celebration was held on August 29, 1910, to commemorate the town&#x27;s establishment. The gala celebration, complete with a picnic, marked the town&#x27;s formal opening, and was attended by a trainload of people from Oklahoma.

N. L. Jones built the first residence and opened a cotton gin. The first store was operated by William T. McDowell, who was also the first postmaster. R. H. Miller established a hotel, and the town added a bank, a telephone exchange, and two churches. Three newspapers, all called the &quot;Dodsonville News&quot;, were published intermittently by three different men between January 1911 and December 1915. A fourth paper, the &quot;Dodsonville Messenger&quot;, was printed from 1928 until 1930. School was sometimes held in the churches until a permanent schoolhouse was completed in the fall of 1912; the previous school was located northwest of town.

Dodson was incorporated in the 1920s and by 1930 had 25 businesses and a population of 426. Public Works Administration appropriations enabled the town to install a $52,000 water system during the 1930s, and a volunteer fire department was organized. In 1947 a new consolidated high school served neighboring communities in Oklahoma as well as Dodson. The population dropped to 357 in 1940; this decline, attributed to decreased agricultural activity and a renewed interest in cattle raising, continued into the 1990s. In 1984 Dodson remained the county&#x27;s second largest town, with a population of 185, one business, and four churches. In 1990 the population was 113, and in 2000 it was 115.

The city&#x27;s name was officially changed from &quot;Dodsonville&quot; to &quot;Dodson&quot; on July 1, 1937.

Dodson&#x27;s first permanent school building was completed in 1912. This school was used until 1947 when a new school was constructed. Dodson High School continued to educated students until 1969 when the school board voted to consolidate the Dodson School District with that of Wellington. The elementary and junior high schools continued to operate until 1972. The Dodson School was destroyed in the late 1980s or early 1990s.

==Economy==
Dodson serves as an agricultural center for southeastern Collingsworth County, northeastern Childress County, Texas, and western Harmon County, Oklahoma.

Cotton, wheat, sorghum, and peanuts are the primary crops of the region. There are also a large number of small ranching operations in the surrounding area.

Tri-County Co-Op operates a cotton gin located in Dodson that serves the surrounding tri-county area. It is one of the town&#x27;s few businesses.

==Education==
Public education in Dodson is provided by the Wellington Independent School District.

<text>Wellington is a city in and the county seat of Collingsworth County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,896 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Sometime in 1889 or 1890, as smaller ranches and farmlands were being purchased, Ernest Theodore O&#x27;Neil, his brother-in-law John Simon McConnell, and John W. Swearingen, together had purchased the land upon which the town currently sits, for $5.00 per acre. Subsequently, O&#x27;Neil, who originally owned a fourth of the section of the township, purchased the interests of McConnell and Swearingen, and retained sole ownership of the land. The 1890 census showed 357 inhabitants across the county, with 89 ranches and farms and of land in cultivation. In August 1890, a petition was circulated to organize the county, choose a county seat, and elect county officers. Two potential townships were proposed: Wellington and Pearl. The proposed town of Wellington was located on the land owned by Ernest T. O&#x27;Neil who was promoting this location, and had been given its proposed name by his wife, Matilda Anna Elisabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; O&#x27;Neil, who greatly admired the Duke of Wellington, hero of the Battle of Waterloo. The alternate and proposed town of Pearl was located several miles north of Wellington.

In September 1890, the vote was held and Wellington was selected for the seat of the newly organized county of Collingsworth. In 1891 the new city, laid out by Ernest T. O&#x27;Neil, was surveyed and platted, and the first postal service and postmaster, Carrie M. Barton, was established on January 9, 1891. Construction of a courthouse began in 1893, and the contractor, J. A. White, built the courthouse of locally made bricks. With the extra materials left over from the courthouse, J. A. White erected a mercantile store for Ernest T. O&#x27;Neil. This became the first mercantile store and commercial building in Wellington, prior to the opening of a two-story hotel by O&#x27;Neil. Later O&#x27;Neil organized the first bank, was active in all phases of the county&#x27;s growth and development, and served as postmaster from August 22, 1895 to December 11, 1897.

Early in the early 20th century, Wellington was connected through Altus, Oklahoma with Wichita Falls, Texas through the Wichita Falls and Wellington Railway, one of the properties of the industrialist Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls. In 1914, this route was leased by the since-defunct Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. The Wellington-to-Altus segment was abandoned in 1958.

The first time Bonnie and Clyde (Bonnie Park and Clyde Barrow) made &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper was their incident at the Prichard farm. Bonnie is referenced as a &quot;woman companion&quot;, and the perpetrators are Clyde Barrow and his brother whose name is given as Icy. With the location as &quot;Wellington, Texas&quot;, the story tells of their wrecking their car, terrorizing a family and shooting the daughter-in-law (but actually their daughter), kidnapping two law enforcement officers and taking them in their car near Erick, Oklahoma, where the two kidnapped men were tied to a tree with barbed wire cut from a fence. They freed themselves and alerted local law enforcement, but the trail had gone cold.

<text>Columbus is a city in and the county seat of Colorado County in southeastern Texas, United States. The population was 3,699 as of the 2020 census. It is located on the Colorado River. The Colorado County Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A Santa Claus museum is located in Columbus.

==History==

The first American settlers arrived in 1821 on what is known as the legendary site of Montezuma&#x27;s Indian village. In 1822, the Mexican government issued land grants to members of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s Old Three Hundred, who included Benjamin Beason (originally spelled &quot;Beeson&quot;) and Abram Alley. Alley&#x27;s 1830s log cabin has been preserved in Columbus and is used as a tool museum. Beason arrived in 1821, received his land grant in 1822, and settled along the Colorado River with his wife Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; and family. By late December 1821, colonists Robert H. Kuykendall with his brother Joseph, and Daniel Gilleland arrived in the area of present-day Columbus. In 1822, Benjamin Beason began operating a ferry across the Colorado River, and the settlement became known as Beason&#x27;s Ferry or Beason&#x27;s Crossing. Beason also established a gristmill, gin, and a sawmill; his wife operated a boarding house.

Beason&#x27;s Crossing became part of Austin&#x27;s San Felipe colony in 1822, when the colony was divided into two districts by the Mexican governor José F. Trespalacios. The Mexican government granted the rights to establish a town, and the locals elected town officials. John J. Tumlinson Sr., was elected &quot;alcalde&quot;, with Robert Kuykendall captain and Moses Morrison lieutenant. Tumlinson&#x27;s land adjoined Beason&#x27;s; together, they made up much of the site of present-day Columbus. Tumlinson was killed by Native Americans in 1823. In 1834, after the Tumlinson children inherited the estate, they sold land to William Dewees, who was married to Beason&#x27;s daughter, Lydia. Dewees&#x27; land grant was near the site of present-day Glidden, Texas.

By 1836, Beason&#x27;s Ferry Crossing was home to over 25 families. During the fight for Texas independence, Sam Houston and his men camped along the banks of the Colorado River near Beason&#x27;s Crossing. Following the Battle of the Alamo, Santa Anna&#x27;s army headed for San Jacinto, and Houston ordered that Beason&#x27;s Crossing be burned during the Runaway Scrape.

Columbus was established by European Americans in 1837 after Texas achieved independence from Mexico. After the population returned following warfare, residents renamed Beason&#x27;s Crossing &quot;Columbus&quot;. Some speculate that it was named in honor of residents who migrated from Columbus, Ohio, while others believe the town was named after Christopher Columbus, who explored on behalf of Spain in the late 15th century.

The town of Columbus was platted again in 1837. The Dewees family gave land for a new school and possibly a courthouse. By 1837, the town had been re-established with two public houses, two stores, and half a dozen small dwellings.

It was later named the seat of Colorado County, and had developed as a center of business and trade for surrounding areas. Cattle ranching was big business by the late 19th century. Some merchants and ranchers did very well, and built fine houses in the city, such as the house built by Robert E. Stafford. He supported the Stafford Opera House, now serving also as a museum, event, and performance space. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it attracted touring performers and lecturers. Other notable historic homes operated today as museums are the Dilue Rose Harris House Museum, and Tate-Senftenburg-Brandon House Museum. The Tate-Senftenburg-Brandon House, formerly owned by the Columbus Historical Preservation Trust, Inc., was sold to private owners in 2017 and is no longer operated as a museum but is being further restored and maintains its historic character. 

The Colorado County Courthouse was built in 1890, the fourth such structure in the city. It was designed in the Classical Revival and Italianate styles of architecture by noted Houston architect Eugene T. Heiner. He designed at least nine other Texas courthouses. The bell tower was damaged in a 1909 storm. The dome was added before 1939. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2013–2014, the courthouse was being renovated and upgraded for current uses; the project included restoration of historic exterior colors.

<doc id="135716" wikidata="Q677437" url="?curid=135716" title="Weimar, Texas">
<text>Weimar ( or, by many non-locals, ) is a city in Colorado County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,076 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Texas-German belt region and was founded and named by German emigrants after the city of Weimar, Germany.

In 1873, the town was founded in anticipation that the Galveston, Harrisburg, &amp; San Antonio Railroad was going to build through the site. It was originally named &quot;Jackson&quot; after D.W. Jackson, a native Georgian and landowner, but subsequently was called &quot;Weimar&quot; in tribute to the German city of Weimar.

Located on Interstate 10 and US 90 between San Antonio, Austin, and Houston, Weimar is a small community of predominantly Czech and German descendants.

==History==
Weimar was founded in 1873 in anticipation that the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway was going to build through the site. The community was first called &quot;Jackson&quot;, after D. W. Jackson, a native Georgian and area landowner who donated land for the railroad right-of-way and the townsite. The populace subsequently chose the name &quot;Weimar&quot;; an early record states that Thomas W. Pierce, who authorized Jackson to sell lots at the site, had visited Weimar, Germany, and was favorably impressed.

The Weimar post office was established in 1873. The town was incorporated in 1875. After beginning with a few hundred townspeople, Weimar had by its tenth birthday achieved a population over 1,000. As it grew, Weimar established itself as a center of trade for pecans, poultry, and dairy products. By 1877, the town was large enough to make its first city map. In 1888, Weimar witnessed the origin of the first town newspaper, &quot;The Weimar Mercury&quot;, which currently remains in publication.

A strong history of baseball exists in Weimar. Veterans Park (Strickland Field) was ahead of its time when it was built in 1948, and was the first lighted baseball field between San Antonio and Houston. Veterans Park remains a state-of-the-art baseball stadium, having hosted a Babe Ruth League World Series Tournament in 2005.

Weimar is where Norman J. Sirnic and Karen Sirnic were murdered by serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz on May 2, 1999. Their parsonage was adjacent to the train tracks.

Throughout the 20th century, Weimar enjoyed a slow yet steady growth in population, increasing on average by 250 persons every ten years. Business establishments held their numbers steady at around 70. After a high population of 2,400 in 1976, the town declined slightly in the following decade. In 1980, the population was 2,128.

Sometimes called the &quot;Front Porch of the Texas Hill Country&quot;, Bulverde was settled in 1850 and called Pieper Settlement after Anton Pieper. It was mainly settled by German immigrants similar to nearby New Braunfels. For many years, the closest post office was at Smithson Valley, and mail was delivered once a week to the house of Carl Koch in Bulverde. A local post office that operated from 1879 to 1919 was named for Luciano Bulverdo, an early area landowner.

Between 1996 and 1999, five separate municipalities were incorporated and combined in the Bulverde area to form the current City of Bulverde. This process required 22 separate elections. In May 2015, the people of Bulverde voted to adopt a home-rule charter to have more control over development.
