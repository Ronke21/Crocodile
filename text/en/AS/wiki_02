<text>La Cienega is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico, metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,007 at the 2000 census.

La Cienega is located on the site of a Keres pueblo that took part in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The South End of the Rockies Historical Marker, marking the southern terminus of the Rocky Mountains, is about three miles west of La Cienega.

== History ==
The historical Village of La Cienega is surrounded by multiple springs and the spring brooks they feed, where, due to the geology, the aquifer rises to the surface. For many centuries these springs have been used for agriculture and as a source of water for the settlement of a historical pueblo of the Keres people. The former La Cienega Pueblo site contains archaeological evidence of &quot;probable water catchment features&quot; as well as petroglyphs on the basalt cliffs, and ruins of prehistoric room blocks at the site of the historic La Cienega Pithouse Village that are believed, by archaeologists, to be used for both ceremonial and domestic purposes. 

==Wetlands==
The cienega (spring and associated marsh) later supplied water to El Rancho de las Golondrinas and the Santa Fe River Canyon at the foot of the Caja del Rio. The cienega itself is managed by the Santa Fe Botanical Garden as the Leonora Curtin Wetland Preserve. La Cienega is an Area of Critical Environmental Concern and has been a focus of recent efforts to create an open space corridor between Santa Fe and the Rio Grande.

<doc id="126022" wikidata="Q1801743" url="?curid=126022" title="Lamy, New Mexico">
<text>Lamy (pronunciation LAY-mee) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. Its population was 218 at the 2010 census. It is located approximately south of the city of Santa Fe.

The community was named for Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, and lies within the &quot;Bishop John Lamy Spanish Land Grant&quot;, which dates back to the eighteenth century. Jean-Baptiste Lamy&#x27;s influence over this area includes his creation of Santa Fe&#x27;s first English teaching school, as well as establishing other similar institutions.
==History==
=== Pre-Columbian ===
The &quot;Lamy Junction Community&quot; is an archaeological site of 14 Coalition Era (AD 1200-1325) pueblos and other structures, located near the junction of US Highway 285 and Santa Fe County Road 233.

=== Modern Era ===
The former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad was originally planned to run from Atchison, Kansas to Santa Fe, the capital city of New Mexico Territory, and then onward to points west. The first train arrived in the city on February 9, 1880. However, the railroad&#x27;s surveyors had already realized that the hills surrounding Santa Fe made a continuation beyond the city impractical, and created a rail junction where the tracks toward the city turned abruptly north. This was originally named &quot;Galisteo Junction&quot; but later changed to Lamy. 
In 1896 the Fred Harvey Company built the luxurious &quot;El Ortiz Hotel&quot; here, designed by Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter. The &quot;El Ortiz&quot; was demolished after its closing in 1947.

==Infrastructure==
===Rail===

The former Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad (ATSF), now the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), passes through Lamy. Little freight traffic now passes over the line, but it remains the route of the Amtrak Southwest Chief, with one train daily in each direction stopping at Lamy Station.

The significance of Lamy as a railroad junction is related in the Oscar-nominated documentary, &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; (1980), about the building of the first atomic bomb, and is referred to by instrumental group the California Guitar Trio in a five-part suite &quot;Train to Lamy&quot; on their second album &quot;Invitation&quot; (1995). 

====Santa Fe spur line====
From 1992 to 2014, the spur line was taken over by the Santa Fe Southern Railway, which operated a popular excursion train, using vintage passenger railcars and modern freight cars, between Santa Fe and Lamy.

In 2020, several prominent Santa Fe residents, including novelist George R.R. Martin, created &quot;Sky Railway&quot;, an excursion train that runs on Santa Fe Southern Railway&#x27;s route between Lamy and Santa Fe, although the excursions themselves do not run all the way to Lamy. Sky Railway began operations in December, 2021.

===Roads===
The community is served by Santa Fe County Road 33, a short, dead-road connecting to US Highway 285.

===Museum===
The Lamy Railroad and History Museum, located in the historic &quot;Legal Tender&quot; restaurant building, is dedicated to preserving local history and heritage, with emphasis on the railroads and their impact on the area. The museum buildings, formerly the Pflueger General Merchandise Store (built in 1881) and the attached Annex Saloon (built in 1884), are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Legal Tender Saloon and Restaurant re-opened as the Legal Tender at The Lamy Railroad &amp; History Museum in March 2012, after 14 years. The restaurant and museum are run as a non-profit and the waitstaff are volunteers. It is open Thursday through Sunday.

==History==
The first, confirmable human presence on the Galisteo River occurred around 10,500 years ago. Over the centuries, both large and small communities spread throughout the Galisteo Basin. Archeological evidence of pre-Columbian human inhabitants includes pottery, vases, cups, eating and cooking utensils, stone hammers, wedges, mauls, and religious items.

The Ancestral Puebloans began mining Cerrillos turquoise in approximately 700-900 AD. Evidence of established long-term settlements, dating back to the 13th century, includes pit-house villages. In the 14th century, there was increased upheaval and conflict between communities, including the burning of the Burnt Corn Ruin. During the 15th century, an influx of Apache and Navajo in the Galisteo Basin influenced and impacted the Puebloans. By the time Francisco Vázquez de Coronado arrived in the region, circa 1540–42, a number of indigenous settlements were abandoned.

Mining in the Cerrillos Hills continued with the arrival of Spanish colonizers. The Native peoples were used for slave labor to mine these materials out of the hills under Spanish colonial rule. In 1581, the Spanish identified lead-silver deposits in “Sierra de San Mateo,” the modern Cerrillos Hills. At the turn of the 17th century, the Spanish permanently settled in the area. During the 1660s, however, a drought put economic pressure on the Spanish, while Puebloans abandoned settlements and Plains Indians conducted raids.

A Spanish explorer, Antonio de Espejo, wrote about these treasures being mined at a place of “little hills.&quot; This is the source of Cerrillos&#x27; name.

In 1680, a landslide occurred in the hills, causing mines to cave in and bury about 25 miners. When the Spanish attempted to restart mining operations, the Native workers revolted. Around 1695-1696 Diego de Vargas appointed Alonso Rael de Aguilar as alcalde of the mining camp El Real de Los Cerrillos. However, tumultuous events in the late 17th century – drought, small pox, and ongoing raids – effectively ended Native turquoise mining. The Tewa people left the area, though there were efforts in the early 18th century to repopulate with reassembled Tanos.

During the 18th century, the Spanish continued to register land grants and mine claims in the area. The earliest well-documented Spanish mine claim was registered in 1709 by General Don Juan de Ulibarri. After Mexican Independence, restrictions on foreign visitors in New Mexico were lifted in 1821, increasing trade. Following the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, the US Government manipulated land grants to make it easier for Anglo-Americans to purchase land. Between 1846 and 1869, the Cerrillos Hills were claimed by the Baca y Delgado Family Land Grant. In 1870, the US Government rejected the family&#x27;s grant claim and made the land available for public purchase.

In 1871, Stephen B. Elkins purchased 606 acres of US Government land located along the Galisteo River. He planned to build a mining town on the railroad. In the same year, Elkins gained ownership of the Ortiz Mining Grant, which contained coal deposits. Frank Dimmick and Robert Hart registered their Bonanza #3 claim in the Cerrillos Hills on January 15, 1879. The two Colorado miners set up camp and by 1880 there were five camps with a combined population of between 1,200 and 1,500 people. Further discovery of precious metal deposits led to increased immigration and an economic boom. Eventually, there were over 2,000 Territorial mines established in the hills. March 8, 1880 was declared Cerrillos Founder&#x27;s Day. In addition to turquoise, the mines produced gold, copper, silver, galena, manganese, and iron.

Cerrillos Station was connected to the railway on February 15, 1880. The main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ran within only three miles of Los Cerrillos. The rapid growth of Cerrillos gave opportunities to people who moved in. During the 1880s, the rate of development increased around Cerrillos Station and saloons, a school, churches, stores, and hotels were built.

In either 1899 or 1901, electricity was first supplied to the town of Cerillos by the Cochiti Gold Mining Company electric plant in Madrid, New Mexico. Telephone lines arrived in 1905. By 1900, the mines began to shut down. The population of the area dwindled during the Great Depression and World War II. In 1961, the Cerrillos primary school was closed due to shrinking enrollment and financial difficulties.

Today, only a few of the buildings from Cerrillos&#x27; boom remain. Some of the buildings still show evidence of past movies filmed (&quot;Young Guns&quot; and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;) on Main Street. In January 2000, Santa Fe County purchased 1,116 acres of the Cerrillos Hills and created the Santa Fe County Cerrillos Hills Historic Park. In 2009, the park was renamed Cerrillos Hills State Park.

==Education==
It is within Santa Fe Public Schools.

It is zoned to Amy Biehl Elementary School, Milagro Middle School, and Santa Fe High School.

Previously it was zoned to Capital High School. In 2017 the district recommended changing the boundary of the area to Santa Fe High.

<doc id="126024" wikidata="Q1331390" url="?curid=126024" title="Madrid, New Mexico">
<text>Madrid ( , ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 149 at the 2000 census and 204 in 2010. Today, Madrid has become an artists&#x27; community with galleries lining New Mexico State Road 14 (the Turquoise Trail). It retains remnants of its history with the Mineshaft Tavern and the Coal Mine Museum.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Lead mines in the area around Madrid captured the interest of Roque Madrid in the 17th century. It is unclear whether the current name of the community comes from that of earlier residents or the capital of Spain. The dominant English pronunciation of the name differs from that of the Spanish capital, with emphasis on the first syllable: MAD-rid. Coal mining began in the area around 1835.

The coal deposits were called the Cerrillos Coal Bank following the arrival in early 1880 of the New Mexico &amp; Southern Pacific Railroad (as the AT&amp;SF in New Mexico was organized), named after the nearby mining and railroad town of Cerrillos Station. After a dozen years at the Coal Bank of wildcat, unpermitted, and unorganized mining the AT&amp;SF acquired the property on December 10, 1891, and through purposefully-created subsidiaries solidified its control. The Cerrillos Coal &amp; Iron Co. developed the layout for the town, mines, and facilities, and the Cerrillos Coal Railroad Co. built the standard gauge spur from the AT&amp;SF main line at Waldo Junction.

In late August 1892, the spur finally terminated at the relatively new mining camp of Keeseeville (an illegal trespass settlement, however one whose 20-acre plat had been approved by Santa Fe County). At the site of Keeseeville, which the Cerrillos Coal Railroad co-opted, the town of Madrid was built. More accurately the Cerrillos Coal Railroad transported-in, section by section, prefabricated wooden miner&#x27;s cabins from as far away as Topeka, Kansas; there were insufficient carpenters and suppliers in the region to provide the instant infrastructure that was needed for the town.

Madrid celebrated its &quot;founding&quot; in 1895. Since the town was for the next 80 years wholly owned by a series of corporations, the town itself was never incorporated. In the late 1940s, the demand for coal withered: Natural gas gradually replaced coal as the preferred home-heating fuel, and the AT&amp;SF was replacing its coal-fired steam locomotives with diesel-electrics. By 1954 the Albuquerque and Cerrillos Coal Company ceased to operate and most of the residents moved away. The railroad spur was removed shortly thereafter.

===Madrid Miners semi-pro baseball team===
The Miners were started by the Madrid Employees Club and won many pennants. The Oscar Huber Ballpark was the first lighted ballpark west of the Mississippi in the 1920s.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Environmental issues==
Black &quot;gob piles&quot; of accumulated spoil, the waste rock removed during coal mining, cover the hillsides and stain the red earth in the arroyo that runs between rows of Madrid&#x27;s historic miners&#x27; cabins. These visible traces of the past bring money from tourists and filmmakers to the town, but they also create difficulty for many of the residents as rains cause abandoned mine drainage to flow down the hills in rivulets, covering roads and driveways, and flooding backyards, crawlspaces, and basements. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program has worked with residents to create some barricades to redirect the water flowing down the hills without removing or covering the coal piles that are a historic resource to the town. Residents disagree on what else should be done.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were 204 people, 134 households, and 33 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 167 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.1% White, 0% African American, 0% Native American, 0.5% from other races, and 2.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.4% of the population.

There were 134 households, out of which 9.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 13.4% were married couples living together, 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present, 5.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 75.4% were non-families. 64.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.52 and the average family size was 2.33.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 7.4% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 45.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 47.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 102 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 107.7 males.

According to the 2016 American Community Survey, the median income for a household in the CDP was $32,813. The per capita income for the CDP was $28,675. 20.5% of the population was living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 37.1% of those over 65.

==Education==
It is within Santa Fe Public Schools.

It is zoned to Amy Biehl Elementary School, Milagro Middle School, and Santa Fe High School.

Previously it was zoned to Capital High School. In 2017 the district recommended changing the boundary of the area to Santa Fe High.

==In popular culture==

===Film===
The ending of the film &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007) was set and filmed in the town.

===Literature===
Belinda Vasquez Garcia&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Witch Narratives: Reincarnation&quot; (2012), is set in Madrid during the 1920s and 1930s when Madrid was a company-owned coal-mining town.

Madrid and details about the town&#x27;s attractions are mentioned in chapter 15 of A.J. DeWall&#x27;s novel, &quot;Forever Man&quot; (2014).

===Television===
In the opening scene of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; (&quot;Ozymandias&quot;), Walter White takes a break after his first methamphetamine cook to call his wife, Skyler, to suggest the family do something the show&#x27;s creator (Vince Gilligan) says he and his girlfriend did, &quot;head up to Turquoise Trail and stop at Tinkertown, maybe grab some lunch in Madrid&quot;.

In the A&amp;E series Longmire, the interior scenes at the Red Pony Bar were filmed at The Mine Shaft Tavern in Madrid.

<text>Pojoaque (; Tewa: Pʼohsųwæ̨geh Ówîngeh/P&#x27;osuwaege Owingeh [p’òhsũ̀wæ̃̀gè ʔówîŋgè]), Po’su wae geh, which translates to “water gathering place”, is a unincorporated community in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,907 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Pojoaque as a census-designated place (CDP). Pojoaque Pueblo, a neighboring community, is an Indian reservation, and the town of Pojoaque is a collection of communities near the pueblo with people from various ethnic backgrounds. The area of Pojoaque includes the neighborhoods of Cuyamungue, Jacona, Jaconita, Nambé and El Rancho.

==History==

===Pojoaque===
In the early 17th century, the first Spanish mission, San Francisco de Pojoaque was founded. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Pojoaque was abandoned, and was not resettled until &quot;circa&quot; 1706. By 1712, the population had reached 79. During the revolt of 1837, New Mexico native Manuel Armijo defeated the rebels at Puertocito Pojoaque, east of Santa Cruz de la Cañada. In the early 1900s, the Pojoaque Valley School District was established to serve the educational needs of the valley.

===Pojoaque Pueblo===

Pojoaque Pueblo is one of the six Tewa-speaking Rio Grande Pueblos, and a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos. The Pueblo was settled around 500 AD, with the population peaking in the 15th and 16th centuries.

In about 1900, a severe smallpox epidemic caused the pueblo to be abandoned once again by 1912. In 1934, Pojoaque Pueblo was reoccupied, and became a federally recognized Indian reservation in 1936.

Pojoaque Pueblo remains a major employer in the region, owning several business enterprises, including the gaming operations of three casino locations: Buffalo Thunder Resort, Cities of Gold Casino, and Jake&#x27;s Casino. Prior to 2017, the New Mexico state gaming compacts signed by the pueblo expired, but the pueblo has continued gaming operations and resumed negotiations with the state of New Mexico.
==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 2.9 square miles (7.5 km), all land.

Pojoaque Creek runs from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains from Nambé Lake westward. Passing through the pueblo, it joins the Rio Tesuque to form the Pojoaque River, which flows into the Rio Grande.

<text>San Ildefonso Pueblo (Tewa: Pʼohwhogeh Ówîngeh [p’òhxʷógè ʔówîŋgè] &quot;where the water cuts through&quot;), also known as the Turquoise Clan, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States, and a federally recognized tribe, established c. 1300 AD. The Pueblo is self-governing and is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 524 as of the 2010 census, reported by the State of New Mexico as 1,524 in 2012, and there were 628 enrolled tribal members reported as of 2012 according to the Department of the Interior. San Ildefonso Pueblo is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos, and the pueblo people are from the Tewa ethnic group of Native Americans, who speak the Tewa language.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the pueblo has a total area of , of which is land and (5.54%) is water.

San Ildefonso Pueblo is located at the foot of Black Mesa.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 524 people residing in the San Ildefonso CDP. The racial makeup was 62.2% Native American, 11.3% White, 21.2% from other races, and 5.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.9% of the population. There were 212 households, out of which 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them. As of 2010, the population was distributed with 26.3% under the age of 18, 14.3% who were 65 years of age or older, females comprised 51.7%, and males comprised 48.3% of the population.

As of 2000, the median income for a household in San Ildefonso was $30,000, and the median income for a family was $30,972. Males had a median income of $19,792 versus $19,250 for females. The per capita income for the pueblo was $11,039. About 19.1% of families and 14.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 50.0% of those age 65 or over.

== History ==
The Pueblo was established around 1300 AD and founded by people who had migrated from the Mesa Verde complex in Southern Colorado, by way of Bandelier (elevation about 7000 feet), just south of present-day Los Alamos, New Mexico. People thrived at Bandelier due to the rainfall and the ease of constructing living structures from the surrounding soft volcanic rock. But after a prolonged drought, the people moved down into the valleys of the Rio Grande around 1300 AD (Pueblo IV Era). The Rio Grande and other arroyos provided the water for irrigation.

The Spanish conquistadors tried to subdue the native people and force Catholicism on the native people during the early 17th century, which led to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The people withstood the Spaniards by climbing to the top of the Black Mesa. The siege ended with the surrender of the native people, but the Spanish gave the native people some freedom of religion and other self-governing rights.

Both the people and the lands of the Pueblo of San Ildefonso were affected by intrusion of Spanish colonists. Due to these encroachments, by the 1760s some native families reported that they had no agricultural lands to support themselves. Part of their lands were restored to San Ildefonso by a 1786 decision of Governor Juan Bautista de Anza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spanish Missions/Misiones Españolas&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Mexico took control of the area in 1821, and later the United States gained control in 1848 following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Congress created the modern reservation in 1858 confirming a grant of 17,292 acres of land to the pueblo, and the grant was patented in 1864.

By the time the land was patented under the laws of the United States in 1864, there were only 161 pueblo members left. A smallpox outbreak in 1918 took the population below 100. The people of San Ildefonso continued to lead an agricultural based economy until the early 20th century when Maria Martinez and her husband Julian Martinez rediscovered how to make the Black-on-Black pottery for which San Ildefonso Pueblo would soon become famous. From that time the Pueblo has become more tourist-oriented, with numerous tourist shops. Because of close proximity to the state capital, Santa Fe, and the presence of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, many of those employed in the pueblo have state or federal government jobs.

==Politics==
San Ildefonso is governed by a civil government consisting of an executive branch (the governor) and a legislative branch (the tribal council).

The pueblo has experienced political controversy in recent years with significant appeals to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 2011, former pueblo Lt. Governor Paul D. Rainbird was sentenced to 33 months on federal charges of illegal trafficking in contraband cigarettes. In 2012, the Interior Board of Indian Appeals vacated BIA decisions to acknowledge the results of an election for Governor of the Pueblo of San Ildefonso for the 2008/09 term which had resulted in the governorship of Leon Roybal.

In 2012, the Pueblo adopted a new constitution through general election overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. One of the results of the new constitution is that, for the first time, women are allowed to run for tribal council positions. To date, there is no publicly available copy of the newly adopted constitution. The 1996 San Ildefonso Code is the most recent available copy of local laws governing the pueblo.

==Economic development==
The San Ildefonso Pueblo Enterprise Corporation (SIPEC) is a federally chartered Section 17 Corporation which is wholly owned by the Pueblo de San Ildefonso. SIPEC is charged with working with companies and individuals who share a vision of utilizing the Pueblo&#x27;s strategic location for fostering economic and job growth for the Pueblo de San Ildefonso.

==Education==
It is zoned to Pojoaque Valley Public Schools. Pojoaque Valley High School is the zoned comprehensive high school.

The Bureau of Indian Education operates the San Ildefonso Day School, an elementary school, in the pueblo.

==Culture==
The people of San Ildefonso have a strong sense of identity and retain ancient ceremonies and rituals tenaciously, as well as tribal dances. While many of these ceremonies and rituals are closely guarded, San Ildefonso Feast Day is open to the public every January 23. Other dances open to the public include Corn Dance, which occurs in the early to mid-part of September, and dances at Easter.

There was an art movement called the San Ildefonso Self-Taught Group, which included such noted artists as Alfonso Roybal, Tonita Peña, Julian Martinez, Abel Sanchez, Crecencio Martinez, and Jose Encarnacion Peña.

<doc id="126029" wikidata="Q2413662" url="?curid=126029" title="Santa Cruz, New Mexico">
<text>Santa Cruz, historically known as Santa Cruz de la Cañada, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. It is part of the Santa Fe, New Mexico Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 423 at the 2000 census.

==History==

===Overview===
The area that was later to be occupied by the village of Santa Cruz de la Cañada is located 25 miles northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and a half-mile east of Española, New Mexico, at 5,655 feet AMSL, and UTM NAD 83, Z-13S, 404927E, 3983643N in the valley of the Santa Cruz River half-mile from its confluence with the Rio Grande. Upon arrival of Spanish conquistadores in 1540, the Santa Cruz area was inhabited by Tewa speakers (descendants of &quot;Ancestral Puebloans,&quot; formerly referred to as &quot;Anasazi&quot;), and after Vargas&#x27; &quot;reconquests&quot; (of the Pueblo Revolt) of 1692 and 1696, by southern Tewa (or Tano) who had been relocated from the Galisteo Basin, 45 miles south, as a result of Vargas&#x27; Spanish repopulation efforts on behalf of the Spanish Crown. Among the best reference materials for this history is: &quot;The Pueblo Indian Revolt of 1696 and the Franciscan Missions in New Mexico&quot; by J. Manuel Espinosa (1991).

===Colonial period===
The nearby, and unsuccessful, Spanish colony at San Gabriel established by the explorer Juan de Oñate at Ohkay Owingeh in 1598 produced Spanish &quot;haciendas&quot; and &quot;ranchos&quot; in the vicinity. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Hispanic settlers were forced to leave the area. In 1695, following the Reconquest of 1692-1694 and the second Pueblo Revolt in 1696, Governor and Captain General of New Mexico, Don Diego de Vargas reestablished the Hispanic settlement. It was established as a new Spanish &quot;villa&quot; for those that had arrived from Mexico City as settlers and participants in the military campaigns during the reconquest. It was named &quot;Villa Nueva de Santa Cruz de los Españoles Mejicanos del Rey Nuestro Señor Carlos Segundo&quot; (The New Town of the Holy Cross of Mexican Spaniards under the King Our Lord Charles II). It later shortened simply to Santa Cruz de la Cañada (la Cañada translates as &quot;a small river or creek valley&quot;).

The new Hispanic community was the second villa established by the Spanish in New Mexico and was one of only three established during the colonial period, the first being Santa Fe and the last, Albuquerque. The area surrounding Santa Cruz de la Cañada was described during this period as containing many copious fruit orchards irrigated by the Santa Cruz River and its tributaries.

The original population of Tano Pueblo Natives in the area were at first grouped by Diego de Vargas into two pueblos with the same names (San Lazaro and San Cristobal) as previously established in this Galisteo Basin, but were relocated from the area by the end of the 17th century, following the second Pueblo Revolt. Many of the Tewa People left the area to join the Hopi people and became the Hopi-Tewas at First Mesa.

The existing Santa Cruz Catholic Church building in the Holy Cross Parish was originally constructed between 1733 and 1748 to replace a structure that was reported to be in danger of collapsing and beyond repair, although the Archdiocese of Santa Fe archives do not have a record either that Santa Cruz was a parish or that there was a church building existing at that time. The first baptism in the community was recorded on September 15, 1710. Artwork in the church has been contributed by well known local Santeros. The church is currently maintained by the Sons of the Holy Family and is open to tourists and visitors Monday through Friday.

===Mexican period===
Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth century, frontier settlement at Santa Cruz de la Cañada had produced a rustic and self-reliant population. With news of Mexican independence in 1821, the town was hardly affected with the exception of the new government&#x27;s laws and office appointments. Trade with the United States had been forbidden under the former Spanish government, but now enterprising Anglo-Americans began pouring down the Santa Fe Trail, bringing a new prosperity to the region

The Revolt of 1837 was centered in Santa Cruz de la Cañada. In 1835, Mexico&#x27;s new autocratic and unpopular provincial governor, Albino Pérez, was met on his arrival in Santa Fe with suspicion and opposition, on the basis of rumors of aggressive new tax collections. Following his defeat in Texas, President Antonio López de Santa Anna, with his &quot;Siete Leyes,&quot; was moving toward government centralization, an increased ability to tax, and eventually to military dictatorship.

When Pérez had Juan José Esquibel, the &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) of Santa Cruz, jailed in 1837, influential members of the community raised a militia. Pérez led a force in response which was defeated by the rebels at Black Mesa near San Ildefonso Pueblo before he reached Santa Cruz. The rebels beheaded Pérez and killed some of his government officials, then appointed genizaro José González as new governor. Later, utilizing the support of Anglo merchants in Santa Fe, New Mexico native Manuel Armijo defeated of the rebels at Puertocito Pojoaque, east of Santa Cruz de la Cañada.

===Territorial period===

The arrival of the American Army under Stephen W. Kearny in 1846 ended the twenty-five years of Mexican rule in New Mexico. In January 1847, however, rebellious forces murdered the first U.S. assigned Governor, Charles Bent, at his home in Taos, beginning the Taos Revolt. Occupying forces in Santa Fe quickly moved an army north under Colonel Sterling Price to stop the rebellion. Colonel Price&#x27;s troops first met armed resistance at Santa Cruz against a poorly armed and trained force of rebels which they subdued with cannon. The skirmish would become known as the Battle of Cañada.

===Statehood through present===
Santa Cruz has continued to maintain much of its traditions and history especially through the Catholic Church. The mission church, built after the first fell into disrepair in the early eighteenth century, remains active and vibrant with a large and dedicated congregation. The arrival of the railroad in the 1880s brought the growth of a new town named Española. The growth of the new city eventually encompassed the old Spanish community and has largely concealed it. Once considered the second most important settlement in New Mexico, the town is now masked by its popular tourist neighbors Taos and Santa Fe.

<doc id="126033" wikidata="Q431932" url="?curid=126033" title="Truth or Consequences, New Mexico">
<text>Truth or Consequences (often abbreviated as T or C ; founded as Hot Springs) is a city in the U.S. state of New Mexico, and the county seat of Sierra County. In 2020, the population was 6,052. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names for having chosen to rename itself in March 1950 after the &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; radio show. The name is often hyphenated (Truth-or-Consequences, T-or-C) for clarity, though the formal name contains no punctuation.

==History==
The area is noted for its hot springs, and the first public bath in the area was built at John Cross Ranch over Geronimo Springs in the late 19th century. The hot springs are part of the Hot Springs Artesian Basin. However, major settlement did not begin until the construction of Elephant Butte Dam and its reservoir in 1912; the dam was completed in 1916. It was a part of the Rio Grande Project, an early large-scale irrigation effort authorized under the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. In 1916, the town was incorporated as Hot Springs. It became the Sierra County seat in 1937. By the late 1930s, Hot Springs was filled with 40 different natural-hot-spring spas – one per every 75 residents at the time – though primarily catering to visitors.

The city changed its name from Hot Springs to Truth or Consequences as the result of a radio show contest. In March 1950, Ralph Edwards, the host of the NBC Radio quiz show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, announced that he would air the program on its 10th anniversary from the first town that renamed itself after the show; Hot Springs officially changed its name on March 31, 1950, and the program was broadcast from there the following evening. Edwards visited the town during the first weekend of May for the next 50 years. This event became known as Fiesta and eventually included a beauty contest, a parade, and a stage show. The city still celebrates Fiesta each year during the first weekend of May. The parade generally features local dignitaries, last year&#x27;s Miss Fiesta pageant queen, and the winner of Hatch Chile Queen pageant. Fiesta also features a dance in Ralph Edwards Park.

===Hot springs===

Before World War II, there were about 40 hot springs spas in Truth or Consequences. By 2008, the Hot Springs Association in Truth or Consequences had 10 spa facilities as members. Five of those obtained their water from wells, and La Paloma Hot Springs &amp; Spa (formerly Marshall Hot Springs), Riverbend Hot Springs, Indian Springs Bath House, Artesian Bath House, and Hay-Yo-Kay Hot Springs are from free-flowing hot springs.

The New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources created two demonstration projects using geothermal energy in Truth or Consequences in the 1980s. The Carrie Tingley Hospital, for children with physical disabilities, used state funding to create a physical-therapy program in Truth or Consequences, but has since moved to Albuquerque.

<text>Magdalena is a village in Socorro County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 938 at the 2010 census.

&quot;The Lady on the Mountain&quot; is a rock formation on Magdalena Peak overlooking Magdalena. Spanish soldiers saw the profile of a woman on the west face of the peak. A priest with them was reminded of a similar peak in Spain called &quot;La Sierra de Maria Magdalena&quot;, so he called the New Mexico one &quot;La Sierra de Magdalena&quot;. The pass to the south of the peak became known as Magdalena Gap, and when a town grew up it received the same name.

Magdalena continues to be a ranching community while strengthening its art, astronomy and geology venues. The reopening of the Magdalena Hall Hotel (circa 1917) and the renovation of other historical buildings allow visitors to connect to the past. The Magdalena Public Library and Boxcar Museum are housed in the old railroad depot. Several rock and mineral shops have been around since the mining boom days. The ghost town of Kelly and two festivals, the &quot;Open Studio and Gallery Tour&quot; and the &quot;Old Timers Reunion and Rodeo&quot;, bring tourists to the area. The &quot;Enchanted Skies Star Party&quot; in early fall brings astronomers and astro-photographers together under its very dark skies.

The Very Large Array lies due west of the community. The Magdalena Ridge Observatory lies southeast at an elevation of . Magdalena is located west of Socorro.

==History==
In 1884, the village of Magdalena was named after Magdalena Peak when its post office opened. Magdalena was incorporated as a town in 1913, during a mining boom.

Magdalena is known as the &quot;Trails End&quot; for the railroad spur line that was built in 1884 by the New Mexico Railroad company (A local subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) from Socorro to Magdalena to transport the cattle, sheep wool, timber and ore. Thousands of cattle and sheep were driven into town (cowboy style) from the west, using the historic &quot;Magdalena Trail&quot;. This stockyard driveway was used annually, from 1885 through 1916, when the driveway was officially designated by law through the signing of the &quot;Grazing Homestead Act&quot;. It remained continually in use through 1971. The original stockyards are still intact. AT&amp;SF closed the railroad branch on November 20, 1970, and it was removed shortly thereafter.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

About 20.8% of families and 25.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.0% of those under age 18 and 23.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Media==
In the late 19th century there was a newspaper briefly published in Magdalena known as the &quot;Magdalena Mountain Mail&quot;. Shortly after being founded in 1888, it merged with the &quot;Socorro Times&quot;, and the combined paper failed in the following year. It was followed in the early 20th century by Prospectus Printing Company&#x27;s short lived &quot;Magdalena World&quot;, published only in 1918, and the &quot;Magdalena News&quot; published from 1909 to 1940. In the second half of the 20th century, the name &quot;Mountain Mail&quot; was revived in 1979 as a monthly, and starting in 1992 it had a weekly edition called the &quot;High Country Round-Up&quot;. The 21st century saw the end of newspaper publishing in Magdalena when the &quot;Mountain Mail&quot; published its last issue on June 27, 2013. It was also the last remaining &quot;locally owned&quot; newspaper in Socorro Country.

==Education==
Magdalena Municipal Schools is the school district.

==Kelly ghost town==
In 1883, about south of Magdalena, the Kelly Mine opened in the community of Kelly. The Kelly Mine produced lead, silver, zinc and smithsonite until the markets collapsed. Kelly&#x27;s population reached nearly 3,000 during the mining boom. The last residents of Kelly departed in 1947 and it is now a ghost town. The Kelly Church still stands and is the site of periodic festivities.

<text>Socorro (, &quot;&quot;) is a city in Socorro County in the U.S. state of New Mexico. It is in the Rio Grande Valley at an elevation of . At the 2020 census, the population was 8,707. It is the county seat of Socorro County. Socorro is located south of Albuquerque and north of Las Cruces.
The instruments used by the LINEAR program are located at Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site (ETS) on the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) near Socorro, New Mexico.

==History==
===Founding===
In June 1598, Juan de Oñate led a group of Spanish settlers through the Jornada del Muerto, an inhospitable patch of desert that ends just south of the present-day city of Socorro. As the Spaniards emerged from the desert, Piro Indians of the pueblo of Teypana gave them food and water. Therefore, the Spaniards renamed this pueblo Socorro, which means &quot;help&quot; or &quot;aid&quot;. Later, the name &quot;Socorro&quot; would be applied to the nearby Piro pueblo of Pilabó.

Nuestra Señora de Perpetuo Socorro, the first Catholic mission in the area, was probably established c. 1626. Fray Agustín de Vetancurt would later write that around 600 people lived in the area during this period. Mines in the Socorro mountains were opened by 1626.

During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Spanish refugees stopped in the pueblo of Socorro before continuing south, out of the province, to safety. A number of Piro Indians followed them. The withdrawal of Spanish soldiers left Socorro and its Piro inhabitants vulnerable to attack by soldiers from Apache bands and other tribes. By 1692 the settlement was in ruins.

The Spanish did not initially resettle Socorro when they re-conquered New Mexico. Other than El Paso, there were no Spanish settlements south of Sabinal (which is approximately north of Socorro) until the 1800s. In 1800, governor Fernando Chacón gave the order to resettle Socorro and other villages in the area. However, Socorro was not resettled until about 1815. In 1817, 70 Belen residents petitioned the crown for land in Socorro. The 1833 Socorro census lists over 400 residents, with a total of 1,774 people living within the vicinity of the village.

The mission of San Miguel de Socorro was established soon after Socorro was resettled. The church was built on the ruins of the old Nuestra Señora de Socorro.

===Territorial period===

In August 1846, during the Mexican–American War, New Mexico was occupied by the American Army. In Las Vegas, New Mexico, Colonel Stephen W. Kearny proclaimed New Mexico&#x27;s independence from Mexico. On their way to begin their assault on Mexico, American troops stopped in Socorro. A British officer, Lt. George Ruxton, commented that these soldiers were &quot;unwashed and unshaven, were ragged and dirty, without uniforms...&quot; and were lacking in discipline.

In September 1850, New Mexico became a territory of the United States. At the time, New Mexico encompassed what is now the states of New Mexico and Arizona. In 1850, the population of Socorro was only 543 people. This included 100 American soldiers who were soon moved to Valverde.

The first military post built near Socorro was Fort Conrad, south of the town. Built in August 1851, the fort was badly constructed and was abandoned for Fort Craig, located a few miles away. Fort Craig was first occupied on March 31, 1854.

The New Mexico and Southern Pacific Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) arrived in July 1880, as it built south through the Rio Grande valley on its way toward El Paso. Its presence contributed to growth of the community, as it also became a center of mining activity of lead and zinc. 

The New Mexico School of Mines (now the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology) was founded in Socorro in 1889.

On April 24, 1964, Lonnie Zamora, a local policeman, claimed to have observed a flying saucer and two little beings. Zamora&#x27;s claim is known as the Lonnie Zamora incident.

Actress Jodie Foster stayed in Socorro while filming the movie &quot;Contact&quot; (1997) at the Very Large Array fifty miles west of the city. Based on the map that was faxed to Jodie Foster&#x27;s character (Dr. Eleanor Arroway) in the film, the Socorro airport was also the location of meeting between Dr. Arroway and S.R. Hadden.

&quot;12 Strong&quot; (2018) includes several scenes set in Afghanistan that were recorded in the Socorro area, including several days of filming at M Mountain within the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center&#x27;s bomb range. Fifty extras from Socorro and surrounding areas appeared in several scenes in the film. Filming also took place at White Sands National Monument and Fort Bliss. During this time, most of the production crew and actors on the film (made with the working title &quot;Horse Soldiers&quot;) stayed at hotels in Socorro and ate at local restaurants. Chris Hemsworth was spotted at the Socorro Springs restaurant and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology&#x27;s gym.

==History==
The Picuris people previously lived in an earlier, larger village of about 3,000 people now known as Pot Creek, near Taos. They migrated to the present location along the Rio Pueblo about 1250 CE. In the 15th century it was one of the largest Tiwa pueblos, influenced by Apache and other Plains Indian cultures, as was the Taos Pueblo.

In the late 17th century people from the pueblos of New Mexico revolted against the Spanish colonialists, particularly during a revolt between 1680 and 1696 when they fought for autonomy and their land. Following this period the people of the pueblo were dispersed and had abandoned their pueblo until 1706. At that time they joined with the Spanish to fight against attacks by Comanche and Apache tribes. Then, the Picuris pueblo people settled into a peaceful period.
Spanish explorer Don Juan de Oñate named the pueblo &quot;Pikuria&quot; - which means &quot;those who paint.&quot; The pueblo was influenced by the Spanish, particularly adoption of Christian religious practices and letting go of traditional rituals and ceremonies. The San Lorenzo de Picurís church was built of adobe by 1776 and was restored in the 21st century. Having been influenced by the Spanish and then the Americans for centuries, the Picuris adopted telephone and electrical services, paved roads and television. They resumed their traditional customs, which are performed throughout the year, and became self-governing again in the mid-1920s. , the pueblo maintained a growing herd of buffalo. Pueblo is a member of the Intertribal Buffalo Council.

==Government==

The Pueblo&#x27;s headquarters is in Peñasco, New Mexico. Their tribal officers, led by a tribal governor, are elected every two years. In 1991, the tribe opened the four-star Hotel Santa Fe and the Amaya Restaurant, serving Native American cuisine, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

==Education==
The community is in the Peñasco Independent School District.

==Tourism==
Located within the Pueblo are the San Lorenzo de Picurís church and the Picuris Pueblo Museum, which displays and sells the works of local weavers, potters and beadworkers. Picuris is particularly known for its micaceous pottery. Excavated dwellings are located within the pueblo. Self-guided tours and permits for photography within the pueblo are available to visitors. Visitors may fish for trout at Pu-La Lake by contacting the Picurís Pueblo Fish &amp; Game and Parks &amp; Wildlife. There are also picnic and campground facilities.

===Events===
Their major feast day is San Lorenzo&#x27;s Day on August 10, during which people of all ages engage in races and the Sunset Dance held on August 9. There are Corn Dances and Buffalo Dances in June and August, which may be private ceremonies. There are also dances held New Year&#x27;s Day and in late January and early February that are open to the public.

An Arts &amp; Crafts fair of weaving, sculpture, beadwork, and jewelry is held the first weekend in July.

<text>Questa is a village in Taos County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 1,770 at the 2010 census. The village has trails into the Rio Grande Gorge, trout fishing, and mountain lakes with trails that access the Sangre de Cristo Mountains that overlook the area. Questa is on the Enchanted Circle Scenic Byway, near the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Red River. The &quot;Gateway to the Rio Grande del Norte Monument&quot;, its visitors can drive to an overlook of the Red River meeting the Rio Grande in the depth of the gorge. The Carson National Forest parallels Questa to the east. The Columbine Hondo Wilderness and Latir Peak Wildness are in the Carson National Forest close to Questa.

With a large Hispanic population, the village economy was historically largely dependent on agriculture and income from a now-closed Chevron molybdenum mine. Many residents also commute to Taos, Red River, and Angel Fire to work in the hospitality industries there.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The village is a regional hub for the smaller outlying communities of Lama, Cerro, Sunshine Valley, Latir, Costilla, and Amalia. Questa is surrounded by the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument to the west and the Carson National Forest to the East.

Questa lies at the western base of the Taos Mountains, part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Rising above the town to the northeast is the Latir Peak massif, headed by Venado Peak, ; Pinabete Peak, a southwestern outlier of the group, rises closest to Questa. To the southeast lies Flag Mountain, a northwestern spur of the group of mountains that includes Wheeler Peak, the highest peak in New Mexico. To the north and west lie the Rio Grande Gorge, cutting a volcanic plateau dotted with several peaks of volcanic origin in the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument.

==History==
Questa was originally named San Antonio del Rio Colorado. In 1883, a U.S. postmaster changed its name to Questa. The postmaster misspelled the name, as it should have been spelled &quot;Cuesta,&quot; which is Spanish for &quot;ridge&quot; or &quot;slope.&quot; Despite the error, the village has kept the name.

The Oshara tradition dated to about 3000 BCE is the first known archaeological evidence of Native American (Indians) residence near Questa. The Oshara were possibly the ancestors of the present day Pueblo peoples. A later trade route, called the &quot;Kiowa Trail&quot; or the Taos Mountain Trail, ran through Questa and connected the agricultural Pueblo peoples in New Mexico to the bison-hunting Plains Indians on the Great Plains of Colorado. The first Spaniards to visit the area were members of the Coronado expedition who visited Taos Pueblo, south of Questa, in 1540.

The Spanish settlement of Don Fernando de Taos adjacent to Taos Pueblo was founded about 1615. Thereafter, Spanish expeditions and hunters and miners probably visited the Questa area although the first documented visit by the Spanish was not until July 1694. In that year, Governor Diego de Vargas led an expedition northward from Santa Fe in search of food for the destitute Spanish colony. Vargas confiscated grain from several Pueblo villages, but on arriving in Taos, decided to return to Santa Fe via a roundabout route northward to avoid conflict with the Puebloans. Vargas and his expedition of 100 men passed by the future site of Questa along the &quot;Rio Colorado&quot; (Red River of New Mexico). He noted that the area was inhabited by the &quot;Apaches de Acho&quot;. Utes, who were hostile to the Spanish, also lived nearby. Bison were plentiful in the region. The hostility of the Ute and Apache – and later the Comanche – prevented Spanish expansion northward from Taos to Questa.

The site of Questa was first called Rio Colorado. Concerned about encroachments by French and American fur trappers and traders, the Spaniards established a short-lived military post at the Rio Colorado in about 1815. In the same year a land grant from the Governor of New Mexico granted 50 families permission to establish a settlement at Rio Colorado. In 1817, the military in Rio Colorado refused entry into New Mexico and arrested French/American traders Auguste Pierre Chouteau and Jules de Mun and confiscated their goods. By 1822, the settlement was abandoned &quot;for feer of the Indeans now at War With them.&quot; 
Mexican independence from Spain in 1821 resulted in a more tolerant attitude toward Americans by the New Mexican government. By 1829, Rio Colorado had been resettled, mostly by Hispanics but also by a few French/Americans. 
The New Mexican government encouraged settlement on its frontiers by land grants to Mexican citizens (which included many of Anglo and French descent). Large grants of land were made to prospective settlers in 1836 and 1841 and the town of San Antonio del Rio Colorado was legally established in 1842.

New Mexico became part of the United States after the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. Indian raids in the area continued until the 1860s. The location of the village astride ancient trade, raiding, and hunting routes, made resource-based conflict between cultures inevitable. Additionally, the village location blocked access to certain historic clay and pigment quarries of ceremonial importance to the Taos tribe. This continued conflict led to the village being repeatedly abandoned. Spanish, Mexican, and eventually American soldiers detailed to defend the beleaguered settlement frequently expressed great frustration with their posting.

The names of two prominent peaks overlooking the village of Questa, Flag Mountain and Sentinel Peak, refer to the practice during this period of stationing watchmen on these high points to warn the village of approaching war parties.

The village, nearly from the beginning, was of mixed blood; the surnames Lafore or Laforet, Ledoux, and LaCome reflect the names of French or French-Canadian trappers who settled in the area after arriving in search of otter and beaver. New Mexico territory license records list Auguste Lacome as residing in the area as a trader with the surrounding Native Americans. The common surname Rael may also reflect the influence of Jewish immigrants arriving after being expelled from Spain. The village had a reputation for being contentious and requiring disproportionate effort to police; records show that viceregal intervention was frequently required to settle property disputes.

==Arts and culture==

The Historic San Antonio del Rio Colorado Church is in the historic plaza of Questa, present since the mid-1800s. After a collapse of the west wall in Questa&#x27;s historic church, the community is restoring it. Made with adobe and woodwork, it was scheduled to be completed mid-2016.

Questa has Ocho, an art gallery and event space.

===Event series===
Questa has a summer event series that celebrates art, youth, and the environment in special sub-themed events, including Mud Bogg, the Questa Fiesta, and Alumbra de Questa.

==Parks and recreation==
Questa has two local parks: the Municipal Park and the Moly Park. The Moly Park contains public athletic fields.

Surrounding Questa are the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument and the Carson National Forest. Outside Questa&#x27;s Village limits is Eagle Rock Lake. The Red River is currently undergoing restoration to improve trout habitat, with the section parallel to Eagle Rock Lake complete. Cabresto Lake features hiking trails to mountaintop lakes in the Latir Peaks Wilderness. In the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument are two popular locations: the La Junta Overlook, where the Rio Grande and the Red River come together over 800 feet below, and the Big Arsenic Trail containing petroglyphs and a natural spring.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,767 people, 741 households, and 512 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 888 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 50.16% White, 0.11% African American, 0.70% Native American, 0.05% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, 43.40% from other races, and 5.47% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 80.53% of the population.

There were 741 households, out of which 35.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.3% were married couples living together, 13.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.8% were non-families. 26.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 28.0% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 25.4% from 45 to 64, and 12.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.3 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $23,448, and the median income for a family was $30,000. Males had a median income of $26,667 versus $20,000 for females. The per capita income for the village was $13,303. About 20.7% of families and 24.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.8% of those under age 18 and 20.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
The Chevron Questa molybdenum mine, from Questa, was the largest private employer in Taos County. The mine opened in 1916 as the R&amp;S Molybdenum mine. It was purchased by Molycorp Minerals in 1950 and became a subsidiary of Chevron in 2005. Formerly an open pit excavation, the Chevron Questa mine operated as an underground mine from 1982. Economic conditions that affect the mine resulted in a 54 percent cut in personnel in February 2009, which primarily impacted the residents of Questa. On June 2, 2014, Chevron Mining announced the immediate and permanent closure of the mine due to continuing low molybdenum prices and high operating costs. The mine was employing about 300 people at the time of the shutdown. The mine employs about 150 people on work related to reclamation and remediation, either directly or through its contractors.

Agriculture, especially the cultivation of alfalfa, hay, and winter wheat, has experienced renewed interest along with the expansion of agriculture to historic crops and crops of high value. Agriculture in Questa is strongly dependent on irrigation, supplied from the Red River and Cabresto Creek. The system of ditches or acequias that supplies water to the fields is of great community and social importance; the burning of the ditches on the first weekend after the vernal equinox is a major community event. Two major &#x27;ditch associations&#x27; control the distribution of water by controlling the outflow from the Cabresto Lake dam: the Acequia Madre and the Llano ditch.

Historically, sheep were raised in and around Questa, but they have been replaced by cattle. Cattle are grazed on the plains north and west of town during the winter and spring, then moved west to the other side of the Rio Grande in early June, usually driven across the &quot;Sheep Crossing&quot; ford by riders on horseback.

Increasingly, the traditional economy based on agriculture, livestock, handicrafts (particularly wooden religious carvings known as santos), wood gathering, and honey is failing to meet the financial needs of the populace of Questa. Some locals blame the rising cost on the influx of celebrities and affluent Anglos to the Taos area driving up land and home prices, but for whatever cause an increasing number of Questeños commute to work in Red River, Taos, and Angel Fire.

Questa has developed as a tourist destination. With the Historic San Antonio del Rio Colorado Church, Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, Eagle Rock Lake, and the Carson National Forest several avenues for tourism based economic opportunities have taken shape and continue to grow based on the previous and to be expanded tourist activities.

==Education==
Questa Independent School System is the local school district. It operates two schools: Alta Vista Elementary &amp; Intermediate School, and Questa Junior &amp; Senior High School.

Roots and Wings Community school, an Expeditionary Learning School, is near Questa in the Lama area.

==Government==
Questa is a municipal government founded in 1842. The Village of Questa is governed by a mayor, currently John Ortega, and a four-member Village Council who have 4-year staggered terms.

==Infrastructure and transportation==

===Major highways===

Questa&#x27;s village center has the two major New Mexico State Highways: 522 and 38. State Highway 522 heads south to Taos and north to the Colorado border. State Highway 38 connects Questa to Red River and Eagle Nest as part of the Enchanted Circle.

===Transportation=== 
Questa is serviced by the North Central RTD&#x27;s Blue Bus service which provides free service to Red River and Taos during commuting hours. For air travel the Questa Municipal Airport Nr 2, owned by the Village of Questa, is available.

===Utilities===
The Water/Sewer Department of the Village of Questa operates water and sewer for the Questa Area. Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, Inc. supplies electricity and is in the process of implementing a fiber optic project in Taos County.

===Healthcare===
Presbyterian Medical Services&#x27; Questa Health Clinic provides medical, dental, and behavioral health care for Questa and the surrounding area. The Holy Cross Hospital in Taos is the nearest hospital to Questa at roughly from the Village.

<text>Red River is a resort town in Taos County, New Mexico, US in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The population was 542 at the 2020 census. Red River is on the Enchanted Circle Scenic Byway, and is from Taos.
==History==
Prior to the arrival of European-Americans, the area now occupied by Red River was used as a summer hunting ground by the Jicarilla Apache and Utes, who hunted big horn sheep, mule deer, elk, Mountain cottontail, and mallards, amongst other species.

The town of Red River had its beginnings late in the 19th century, when miners from nearby Elizabethtown in the Moreno Valley were drawn in by gold strikes in the area and trappers sought game. It was named after the perennial stream, Red River, that flows through the town, coming from the northern slopes of Wheeler Peak. By 1895, Red River was a booming mining camp, with gold, silver and copper in some abundance, and a population estimated at three thousand. Mining hit its peak in 1897, and by 1905 the mining and the population dwindled but the town survived, gaining a reputation as a great getaway from hot weather and as a trout fishing paradise. The last serious mining efforts extended until 1931. By that time tourism had become the principal economic livelihood.

In 2019, the Christmas tree displayed at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. was harvested in Red River.

The town is serviced by a bus system which provides access into the upper valley.

An annual Red River Memorial Motorcycle Rally has been held in the town for many years, attended by tens of thousands.

==Education==
It is in the Questa Independent Schools school district. In 1983, 12 children in Red River, including two in high school, attended the schools they were zoned to in Questa, while the remaining 68 children attended other schools. 32 of the students were enrolled at Taos Christian Academy. 32 went to Cimarron Municipal Schools, with 22 going to the Eagle Nest elementary school and 10 to the Cimarron secondary school. Some parents speaking to &quot;The Taos News&quot; felt that the Questa schools were not academically strong. John Hanron of &quot;The Taos News&quot; stated that the fact that many Red River parents did not use Questa schools made it less likely that the Questa district would build a school in Red River.

<text>Taos Ski Valley is a village and alpine ski resort in the southwestern United States, located in Taos County, New Mexico. The population was 69 at the 2010 census. Until March 19, 2008, it was one of four ski resorts in America to prohibit snowboarding. The Kachina lift, constructed in 2014, serves one of the highest elevations of any triple chair in North America, to a peak of above sea level.

==History==
In the 1800s, present-day Taos Ski Valley was the site of a small copper mining town called Twining, New Mexico, which was later abandoned. In 1955, Ernie and Rhoda Blake founded the area as a ski mountain.

The first ski lift, a J-bar, was installed in 1956. Until 1957, the ski resort featured only one ski slope, Snakedance. In 1957, the resort installed a second lift—a Poma (platter) lift.

The Blakes lived in an eleven-foot camper in the absence of any buildings in the area except the almost-completed Hondo Lodge (now Snakedance Condominiums). Even after moving into the lodge, they lived without power until 1963. Ernie and Rhoda had been living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Ernie managed the Santa Fe Ski Basin. Ernie was for a time involved in the day-to-day management of the Taos resort, answering the phone and telling prospective visitors whether the skiing was expected to be good in advance of weekend trips. The village was incorporated in 1996.

In 2006, Taos Ski Valley had 110 trails with 24% beginner, 25% intermediate, and 51% advanced/expert. It was home to the Ernie Blake Snowsports School, one of the highest rated ski schools in North America.

In December 2013, the Blake family sold Taos Ski Valley, Inc. to billionaire conservationist Louis Bacon.

In 2018, Taos Ski Valley started Taos Air, a virtual airline which operated scheduled public air charter service at Taos Regional Airport during ski season. Summer flights were added in 2021. Taos Air ceased using its own brand identity in December 2022 when flight operations were transferred to JSX, and it effectively terminated operations permanently in April 2024 when Taos Ski Valley allowed its airline service contract with the town of Taos to expire.

<text>Torreon is a farming community and census-designated place (CDP) in Torrance County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 244 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 8.3 square miles (21.5 km), all land.

==History==
Torreon is built on the site of an old Piro pueblo one of the more northern of the Salinas pueblos. The Piro site was occupied prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, but became part of the Salinas District, a group of mission towns on the east side of the Manzano Mountains. As the Apache moved south along the edge of the Rocky Mountains in the mid-17th century these missions had to become more defensible. However, by 1677 the Torreon site had been abandoned.

Torreon was resettled in the Spring of 1841 by Nino Antonio Montoya and twenty-six other farmers under a grant from the Prefect of the Central District of New Mexico. The Torreon Grant was named after the defensive towers built at Manzano 6.6 miles to the south, and consisted of an area approximately three miles east–west by six miles north–south. Apache raids remained a serious problem until after the Civil War and the appointment of Edward Hatch as New Mexico Military District commander.

<text>Clayton is a town in and the county seat of Union County, New Mexico, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,980.

==History==

===Early history===
Native Americans were present in the area of Clayton for at least 10,000 years, as evidenced by the findings at the Folsom site about 55 miles northwest of Clayton, near the village of Folsom. Later the area was part of Comancheria.

The Cimarron Cutoff of the Santa Fe Trail brought some of the first settlers through the Clayton region. The Santa Fe Trail was first established in 1821 after Spanish rule was evicted from Mexico which opened up trade between Santa Fe and the United States. William Becknell, also known as the Father of the Santa Fe Trail, became the first person to utilize the Santa Fe Trail as a trade route between the state of Missouri and Santa Fe. He established the Cimarron Cutoff, also known as the Cimarron Route, as a faster route between countries as the Cimarron Route shortened the Trail by more than 100 miles. The Cimarron Cutoff went straight through the Clayton region where travelers used the Rabbit Ear Mountain as a guiding landmark. Eventually travelers along the trail began to appreciate the rich soil around Clayton and the rolling green hills which were perfect for raising livestock.

The Goodnight-Loving Trail also passed through the area (bringing cattle north from Texas) starting in the late 1860s, but eventually cattle ranchers and sheepherders established ranches in the Clayton area itself, though they were large and far apart. That changed when the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad came to the area in 1888. Stephen Dorsey, a nearby rancher, received the rights to the area where the railroad ran. His range manager, John C. Hill laid out a town site, and named it in 1887 for Clayton C. Dorsey (1871-1948), son of Senator Stephen W. Dorsey of Arkansas, who had established the nearby Triangle Dot Ranch in Union and Colfax counties.

In 1892, the saloon of what would later become the Hotel Eklund was built, and by 1894 the saloon featured a front and back bar, pool and carom tables, monte game tables, a crap table, and a poker table. By 1898, the building was further expanded to add a hotel.

===Twentieth Century===
US President Theodore Roosevelt visited Clayton on April 14, 1905.

In 1928 the main street of Clayton was paved and street lighting was added.

Clayton and the rest of Northeastern New Mexico was hit hard by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s; however, the era was also a time of renewal and rebuilding in the community, in large part due to the work of the Works Project Administration in the community.

Clayton was hit by a &quot;black roller&quot; (giant dust cloud) that measured 1500 feet high and a mile across on May 28, 1937.

In 1999, the dining room and saloon of the old Eklund Hotel was reopened.

===Twenty-first century===

The Eklund hotel reopened on July 3, 2011.

<text>Folsom is a village in Union County, New Mexico, United States. Its population was 56 at the 2010 census, down from 75 in 2000. The town was named after Frances Folsom, the fiancée of President Grover Cleveland.

==History==
Folsom gives its name to the nearby type site for the Folsom Tradition, a Paleo-Indian cultural sequence dating to between 11000 and 8000 BC. The Folsom site, about 8 miles west of the village, was excavated in 1926, and found to have been a marsh-side kill site or camp where 23 bison had been killed using distinctive tools, known as Folsom points.

In the first half of the 19th century, the region was a hunting ground for Comanche, Ute, and Jicarilla Apache Indians. The first white settlement near Folsom was Madison, settled in 1864 and named for its founder, Madison Emery. In 1877, a post office was established. Madison became a ghost town in 1888 when the Colorado and Southern Railroad was completed and Folsom was established nearby on the railroad line. The train was held up three times near Folsom by Black Jack Ketchum and his gang. The final robbery in 1899 led to the capture and hanging of Ketchum.

Folsom prospered in the early years, with the largest stockyards west of Fort Worth. Homesteaders moved in and attempted to farm, and the town reached a peak population of nearly 1,000. The area proved unsuitable for farming, though, because of drought, and large ranches soon replaced the small farms. The town suffered a blow from which it never recovered on August 27, 1908, when a massive rainstorm caused a devastating flood, which nearly destroyed the town and killed 18 people. (Flash flooding from the same storm also uncovered the bison bones that George McJunkin found in Dead Horse Arroyo, which later became known as the Folsom site.)

A high school operated briefly in Folsom. Its only graduates were three students in 1931. In 1966, the elementary school at Folsom closed and the students transferred to the school in Des Moines, 8 miles away. Folsom has a post office.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Folsom is situated in a wide valley near the headwaters of the Cimarron River, locally known as the Dry Cimarron, as it runs underground during part of its course through eastern New Mexico. The village is ringed by buttes, mesas, and old volcanic cones and lava flows. Most of the valley is rich grassland, with a pinyon pine and juniper forest found on slopes and in rocky areas. Ponderosa pines are found in canyons and at higher elevations. Large ranches and cattle grazing are typical of the area, although some irrigated agriculture is found downstream from Folsom. Hunting for deer, bear, elk, pronghorn, and turkey is popular on local ranches.

Capulin Volcano National Monument is located 7 mi (11 km) south of Folsom. Rising to 8,182 ft (2,494 m) above sea level, Capulin is the highest mountain near Folsom. Folsom Falls is about 3 miles northeast of the town, along New Mexico State Highway 456. The Cimarron River, only a small stream a few feet wide here, is stocked with trout annually. Eight miles (13 km) west of the city below Johnson Mesa is Wild Horse Arroyo, where in 1908, a cowboy named George McJunkin discovered the bones of an extinct bison. This archaeological find later proved ancient man had been in the Americas at least 10,000 years, far longer than earlier believed.

Folsom is commonly called a &quot;ghost town&quot;, as it has hardly any active businesses. Most community life centers around the Folsom Museum, established in 1966 in the Doherty Mercantile building. The museum, with a large collection of local artifacts, sponsors several events each year. It is open seven days a week between Memorial Day and Labor Day.

===Climate===
Folsom&#x27;s elevation moderates summer temperatures. July is the warmest month with an average high temperature of 84 °F (28 °C) and an average low of 56 °F (13 °C). January is the coldest month with an average high temperature of 45 °F (7 °C) and an average low of 17 °F (-8 °C). The highest recorded temperature is 99 °F (37 °C) degrees and the lowest was -28 °F (-33 °C). Folsom receives of precipitation per year, mostly as summer rainfall, but with about of snow annually. July and August are the wettest months and January and February are the driest.

==Demographics==

The per capita income for the village was $9,561. There were 32.0% of families and 35.4% of the population living below the poverty line, including 51.3% of those under 18 and none over 64.

==Notable people==
* Sally J. Rooke (1840–1908); Telephone operator who perished in the 1908 flood &quot;while at her switchboard warning others of their danger&quot;, was designated by the State of New Mexico as a Heroine of New Mexico, and has a monument in her honor adjacent to the Folsom Museum.
* George McJunkin (1856-1922), an African-American man born into slavery in 1856. He educated himself in English and Spanish as well as astronomy, geology, and history. He became a ranch hand in Folsom where he found and identified prehistoric remains. He was knowledgeable enough to interest museums from Colorado to New England, and the site was investigated. In 1926 the culture was named after the town. He did not live to see his find vindicated.

<doc id="126063" wikidata="Q815390" url="?curid=126063" title="Belen, New Mexico">
<text>Belén (; ) is the second most populated city in Valencia County, New Mexico, the United States, after its county seat, Los Lunas. The population was 7,360 as of the 2020 Census.

Belén is Spanish for Bethlehem. It gained the nickname &quot;Hub City&quot; after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway completed a line through it in 1907. The city is geographically near the center of New Mexico, and is a significant transportation hub that includes access to rails, Interstate Highway 25, and air at Valencia County&#x27;s only public airport.

Belén is at the southern end of the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is located 35 miles south of Albuquerque.

==History==

Belén was founded in 1740 as &quot;Nuestra Señora de Belén&quot; (Our Lady of Bethlehem) by a group of colonists led by Diego Torres and Antonio Salazar, who had received permission to settle the tract of land known as the Belén Grant. The early settlers in the Belén grant included several genízaro families. The genízaros, Native Americans with origins as slaves and servants of colonists, were important in the frontier defense of New Mexico. For the genízaros, relocation to Belén and other frontier settlements was a means of acquiring land. Their settlement in Belén was established to protect the southern border of the colony from Apache raiders. Belén was the first of what would be many genízaro settlements, and by 1744, 40 families were in residence. Spanish and mestizo families also settled in Belén.

Recognizing the strategic significance of Belén, Spanish authorities established a fort in Belén to protect the settlements along the Rio Grande in 1760. By the 1790s, Belén had established a city center known as &quot;Plaza Vieja&quot;, or Old Town, and had grown from a &quot;paraje&quot;, or precinct, to a &quot;partido&quot;, or district, with a population of 1,695. By 1793, a Catholic church and parish were founded.

By the middle of the 19th century, Belén had outgrown Old Town and was expanding into what became known as New Town. In 1853, the residents in both parts of town disagreed over the construction of a new Catholic church, with residents of Old Town wanting the new church to remain there, while residents of New Town wanted it built in their part of town. Ultimately, the adobe church in Old Town was abandoned, and a new church was built in New Town. In 1910, the last ruins of the former church were blown up with dynamite, and the crushed adobe was used to pave New Town&#x27;s main avenue, Becker Avenue.

The residents of Valencia County spent nearly 30 years from 1846 to 1875 disputing where the county seat should be located. Valencia, north of Belén, was the county seat in 1846, followed by Peralta in 1847. Valencia reclaimed the county seat in 1849, only to lose it to Tomé in 1852. Belén captured the county seat from Tomé 20 years later but lost it to Tomé two short years later in 1874. Finally, in 1875, Los Lunas claimed the county seat and remains the county seat to this day.

In the late winter of 1862, Belén, an ally of the Union, become entangled in the Civil War when the town briefly fell under Confederate control after 400 Confederate soldiers marched into Belén. By summer, however, the Confederate army had withdrawn from New Mexico.

In 1880, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached Belén during the construction of a rail line to El Paso. In 1884, the United States General Land Office, through the authority of President Ulysses S. Grant, established the Town of Belén. By the turn of the century, local merchant John Becker had designed a commercial and residential plan for the town. Becker&#x27;s plan laid out Belén on a grid, extending from a commercial center with two grand avenues — Becker Avenue and Dalies Avenue. Originally, all of the town&#x27;s streets were to be named after Spanish explorers, such as Coronado, but were quickly changed to the last names of the town&#x27;s founders, such as Becker, Paul Dalies, and Charles Reinken.

In 1907, the Belén Cutoff for the Santa Fe Railway was completed, connecting Amarillo with Belén. Prior to the Belén Cutoff, trains used the steep Raton Pass on the Colorado and New Mexico border. The cutoff made it possible for many more trains to travel east and west across the United States. Facilities at Belén included a large roundhouse and a classification yard, also serving branches southward to El Paso and northward through Albuquerque to Colorado. Today, Belén remains a major refueling station for the BNSF Railway, where an average of 110 trains travel through Belén per day on the Southern Transcon.

Belén was incorporated as a municipality in 1918. It was originally called the &quot;Village of Belén&quot;, later becoming the &quot;City of Belén&quot;.

In 1927, Belén native and movie stunt pilot Arthur C. Goebel took up the challenge by James D. Dole, the Hawaii pineapple magnate, to race with other pilots to be the first to fly nonstop from the mainland United States to the Hawaii territory, in what is known as the Dole Air Race. Goebel flew the &quot;Woolaroc&quot;. Of the 13 planes that qualified, seven were lost in crashes, killing ten. Only two planes made it safely to Hawaii. Goebel landed first in Hawaii after a nonstop 26 hours, 17 minutes, and 33 seconds, receiving the top prize of $25,000.

The world&#x27;s first atomic bomb, in unassembled pieces, traveled through Belén in July 1945 en route to the Trinity site at what is now White Sands Missile Range. The bomb&#x27;s Belén route used old Highway 85, now Highway 314, also known as Main Street. Located in downtown Belén in 1945 was Roy&#x27;s Cafe, a restaurant where military and science personnel would dine since it had the necessary security clearance. Local legend suggests personnel escorting the atomic bomb, and perhaps the bomb itself, stopped at Roy&#x27;s Cafe as they passed through town.

In 1950, William F. Beavers, owner of B&amp;B Cafe on Becker Avenue, filed the first patent for a machine that sliced potatoes into waffle-like slices, vowing to help commercialize the now-famed waffle fry in cafes across the United States. His patent was granted two years later for what he called a &quot;slicing machine with a stationary knife and reciprocating carrier&quot; made &quot;for the slicing of potatoes and like foods into attractive shapes.&quot; The waffle fries could be paired with Belén&#x27;s own Hub City soda pop brewed and bottled locally by the Belén Bottling Co. The soda&#x27;s trademark was &quot;Pop with Personality.&quot;

==Cityscape==
Belén&#x27;s central business district and downtown is located along Becker and Dalies avenues, stretching from the BNSF rail yard to Main Street. Downtown Belen features structures dating back to the early 20th century when the railroad came to town.

The Belen Hotel and Central Hotel, both located on Becker Avenue, are two-story structures built to accommodate railroaders and other rail guests in the early 1900s. Both were constructed of bricks made from the former Belén brickyard. Today, the Belen Hotel has been converted into a private residence and private art gallery, while the Central Hotel has been renovated to include a private residence upstairs with a wine-tasting room, and an event space and ballroom downstairs.

Old City Hall, also located on Becker Avenue, is a 1938 Works Progress Administration project, which housed the former Belén City Hall and fire department. The two-story building was constructed of terron, a material similar to adobe.

The Belén Harvey House is located within feet of the BNSF rail yard. It is a two-story building that opened in 1907, one year before the completion of the Belén Cutoff, to provide room and board to railroaders and others passing through. The original Belén rail depot is adjacent to the Harvey House grounds, owned by BNSF and used as office space for the railroad.

The Scholle building, located at the intersection of Main Street and Becker Avenue, is one of the more architecturally significant buildings in Belén, due to the engineering behind the architecture. Originally designed as a Swiss chalet, the Scholle building has more than eight miles of rail built into its walls.

The Oñate Theater, located on Dalies Avenue, was built in the early 20th century, showing many major marquee films. The theater is situated on the same block as three other historic buildings.

The Hispano Matanza, held annually in Belen on the last Saturday in January, is considered the world&#x27;s largest matanza, a Spanish-style barbecue that can trace its origin back to the conquistadors. This New Mexico matanza tradition, hosted by the Hispano Chamber of Valencia County, involves slaughtering and cooking 45 pigs, then serving the free food, such as chicharrones, to more than 10,000 patrons. All of the proceeds are given as scholarships to local college students.

The Our Lady of Belen Fiestas, held annually in Belen during one weekend in mid-August, is an event that has been around for more than 230 years. The fiestas, or parties, draw thousands of people from across the state and country to Belen for religious observance, and to celebrate with a carnival.

Along the path the Christmas story is told with live characters and music by sponsoring churches.

===Museums===

Belen has the only Harvey House Museum in New Mexico. The Santa Fe railroad arrived in Belen in 1880, when Belen was a small farming community. For the next 25 years, there was little train traffic through Belen, because the main rail line went west from Albuquerque. In 1908, the railroad opened a new line that avoided the steep grades over Raton Pass. This new line was the Belen cut-off, and it routed many more trains through Belen. Shortly after the new development, Belen began to bustle.

Rail passengers who stopped in Belen needed a place to dine, so in 1910 the railroad built a Harvey House restaurant adjacent to the railroad tracks. It was the 86th restaurant in the chain operated by Fred Harvey. It contained a large lunchroom, a more formal dining room, a newsstand, kitchen facilities, a bakery, and sleeping rooms upstairs for the Harvey Girls who served the meals.

That Harvey House is extant today. It houses memorabilia pertaining to the Harvey House and the Santa Fe Railway, as well as exhibits on early local businesses and residents in Belen.

The Belen Harvey House is the official railroad museum of the State of New Mexico and is a branch of the Belen Public Library.

===Parks and outdoor attractions===

Every August, the fairgrounds host the Valencia County Fair, coupled with the fair parade down Main Street.

Eagle Park is located near I-25 and Belen High School. It is Belen&#x27;s multipurpose park, including several soccer fields, baseball fields, tennis courts, and an outdoor basketball court. Eagle Park also has a community center with a weight room, indoor basketball court and several meeting rooms.

Historic Anna Becker Park, located in downtown Belen was named after the wife of Belen&#x27;s most influential businessman, John Becker. It was once a pond where residents ice skated in the winter. The park includes a sand volleyball pit, basketball court, and historic gazebo.

Doodlebug Park features a restored Doodlebug rail car. The Doodlebug is known in Belen for shuttling Belen residents to Albuquerque in the early 20th century. The Doodlebug at Doodlebug Park was restored by the production crew from the movie The Last Stand, which was filmed near the park, at the request of Lions Gate and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred in the film.

Belen also has Sen. Willie M. Chavez State Park, next to the Rio Grande along Highway 309. The park has walking trails and picnic grounds. During special events it is open for camping. It is the site of Belen&#x27;s annual ham radio operator event, as well as a fishing derby that takes place at the acequia, or irrigation canal, that runs through the park.

The land changed hands numerous times before being purchased during the Great Depression by the New Mexico Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, which in turn sold it to the federal Resettlement Administration in 1935. The RA renamed the land Bosque Farms and turned it into an agricultural resettlement project for Dust Bowl refugees. Traditional farming failed due to poor soil conditions, and the families who stayed turned to dairy farming, which became the community&#x27;s main agricultural industry through the 1960s.

Bosque Farms was incorporated in 1974. Today, housing and commercial development are its main sources of revenue.

==History==
Although Casa Colorado may have been a seventeenth-century landmark, it did not begin its existence as a community until early in the nineteenth century.

On May 19, 1760, after coming to Sevilleta, Bishop Tamarón passed the ruins of “the house they called Colorada,” and from that point on they began to see pens of ewes, corrals, and small houses (Adams 1953:201). Casa Colorada is also mentioned in the Kendall Journal. Whereas it may have been in ruins in 1760, by 1841 it was a small community. The area is a well known Land Grant.

The modern settlement for the town of Casa Colorada was born of a petition for a community grant in 1823. The grant may not have been confirmed at that time but the town continued in existence (Bowden 1969:II, 205). Testimony in the adjudication of the grant before the Surveyor General confirmed that the town was built in 1822 or 1823 in the place already known by the name Casa Colorado (Town of Casa Colorado Grant:12). It was included in lists of New Mexico towns in 1833 and 1840 (Bloom 1913:14; Carroll and Haggard 1942:93).

Wislizenus only referred to the nearby sand hills and the location of “Casas Coloradas,” six miles south of Tomé, when he camped there on 22 July 1846 (Wislizenus 1848:35). Later in the same year Abert commented on some large ponds north of town which were filled with water birds. His party had reached the Río Grande near there after descending from Abó Pass (Abert 1962:117-118).

In 1855, W.W.H. Davis observed that at Casa Colorada his party “struck a young desert, an excellent pocket edition of the great African Zahara, over which we journeyed for about four miles.” Through the area north of “La Hoya” the sand made travel difficult and the land barren with the exception of “occasional small patches in some of the valleys close to the river” (Davis 1938:200).

In the 1920s the local Post Office was given the name “Turn” because there was a turn in the road at Casa Colorado and that name has since appeared on many maps but the original name is still in general use (Julyan 1996:67).

The settlement of Los Chávez, on the west bank of the Río Grande, dates to a 1738 grant to Nicolás Durán y Chávez from Atrisco. In 1790, it consisted of six plazas (Julyan 1996:78; Espinosa and Chávez 1967:41- 43). It was included in the 1802 census (Olmsted 1981:139-140). In the autumn of 1847, a unit of the U.S. Army traveled south along the west bank of the Río Grande. Philip Gooch Ferguson reported that “the road most generally traveled” was on the east bank, but the west side of the river was better for water. Ferguson mentioned camping near a small town named “Plaza Chavez” (Bieber 1936:326-328).

<text>Berne is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. The population was 2,689 at the 2020 census. The town is at the western border of Albany County.

==History==

The town of Berne was originally spelled &quot;Bern&quot;, until the Berne Post Office was established in 1825. It was created in 1795 from part of the town of Rensselaerville. In 1822 the northern half of Berne was spun off to form the new town of Knox.

The earliest settlers were Palatine German refugees. Settlement began sometime before 1750. At that time, it was called Beaver Dam (also spelled Beaverdam). The settlers were actually squatters, since in the 18th and most of the 19th centuries, Berne was part of the Rensselaerswyck estate. The head of the Van Rensselaer family was the patroon who owned all the land on which the tenants in the Hudson Valley lived, and used feudal leases to maintain control of the region. Before the Revolutionary War, the patroons acted like feudal lords, with the right to make laws.

During the War, inhabitants fought on both sides of the conflict. Loyalists who supported the British left and went to Canada. Those who stayed and fought the British expected that if they won, they would either be released from their tenancy, or at the least, be allowed to purchase the land at fair market value. Instead, the new government of New York decided to honor the lease contracts of the patroons, who contributed heavily to the politicians.

The first meeting of the Town of Rensselaerville (which then included what are now known as the four &quot;Hilltowns&quot;) was held in 1790 at the home of Johannes Fischer on Stranahan Lane. He may have been the wealthiest man in the town as he owned eight slaves in 1800. When the town of Bern was created in 1795, the first meeting was also held in the home of Johannes Fisher. It is now known as the Thomas Wood House.

The massacre of the Dietz family in 1781 was the only Iroquois incursion in Beaver Dam during the Revolution.

The first mass meeting of tenant farmers leading to the Anti-Rent War was held in Berne on July 4, 1839. In January 1845, one hundred and fifty delegates from eleven counties assembled in St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church to call for political action to redress their grievances.

<text>Bethlehem is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. The town&#x27;s population was 35,034 at the 2020 census. Bethlehem is located immediately to the south of the city of Albany and includes the following hamlets: Delmar, Elsmere, Glenmont, North Bethlehem, Selkirk, Slingerlands, and South Bethlehem. U.S. Route 9W passes through the town. The town is named after the biblical Bethlehem. A notable person from this city is YouTuber James Charles.
== History ==

When Henry Hudson sailed up the river that would eventually bear his name, he is thought to have landed at what is now the town of Bethlehem. The spot where he is presumed to have landed is commemorated at the town&#x27;s Henry Hudson Park. The town was established on March 12, 1793, from the town of Watervliet. In 1832, part of the town was used to form the town of New Scotland. 
The town&#x27;s earliest growth took place in Normansville, named for its location along the Normans Kill, a creek, which forms the town&#x27;s border with Albany. Normansville still exists today, though it is unnoticed by most living in Bethlehem since it is accessible only by one downhill road. In the mid-19th century, the Delaware and Hudson railroad initiated Albany - Binghamton service (Susquehanna Division) through the hamlet then called Adamsville, renaming the hamlet Delmar. Delmar has become the most populous hamlet and its Delaware Avenue is the site of the present day town hall, police station, justice court, and public library, as well as numerous businesses.

The Delaware and Hudson discontinued passenger service in 1963, and its tracks started being removed in the year 2000, with the last of the track removed in 2005. The track right-of-way is now the Albany County Rail trail, a bike and pedestrian path, that runs from downtown Albany to Voorheesville. The town has continued to grow, and is today considered to be an affluent suburb of the city of Albany.

== Local landmarks ==
The town includes several historic buildings and landmarks.

* Four Corners: This Delmar intersection of Delaware and Kenwood avenues has served as the town&#x27;s traditional center. It is the location of several stores, banks, restaurants and the post office. It is within walking distance of most Delmar residents.
* Adams House: In 1838 Nathaniel Adams built a hotel on Delaware Avenue. This stately building later served as the town hall. In 1980, the Town Hall moved to a larger location, and the volunteer fire department took over the building. Until 2016, Adams House was used as the headquarters of the New York State Association of Retarded Citizens, when it was sold to the Bethlehem Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish assembly. The Delmar Fire Department maintains the fire station to the rear of the structure, at the intersection of Nathaniel and Adams streets.
* Beckers Homestead: Albertus Becker built this house in 1800. His grandson, Albertus Becker II, was elected town supervisor in 1863.
* Bethlehem House: listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1973.
* District School No. 1: listed on the NRHP in 1998.
* Memorial Park: A small pocket park along Delaware Avenue to honor the town&#x27;s war veterans. The park provides pedestrian access to the old Delaware and Hudson railway bed. The railway bed is being converted to a bike trail (rails to trails program) as funds become available.
* Elm Avenue Park: The town&#x27;s largest park, it is a popular summertime gathering point. It includes three outdoor swimming pools, a splash zone for toddlers, playground, basketball and tennis courts. Winter activities include ice skating, hockey, cross country skiing, sledding, and snowmobiling. Admission to the pool area is restricted to town residents and their guests under a fee-based system.
* Bethlehem Central Middle School: This was built as the senior high school in the Federal style. Over the years it has had several additions. Its facilities include outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, softball fields, running track, cross country trails, and soccer fields. These facilities are open to the public when the school is not in session. The high school was moved to a new building and this was adapted as a middle school.
* Delaware Plaza: A shopping plaza built in the 1950s, located on Delaware Avenue in Elsmere. Delaware Plaza is home to a large supermarket (Hannaford) as well as some 30 other shops and restaurants.
* Delmar post office: Built in the late 1930s during the Depression, it is the only one of the 13 Colonial Revival-style New York post offices designed by Louis Simon to lack a cupola.
* Albany County Helderberg-Hudson Rail Trail: Made from the preexisting path of the Delaware and Hudson railroad. The tracks have since been removed and is currently paved from Tollgate in New Scotland to the Port of Albany (roughly the Corner of Lexi Lane and S. Pearl Street).

== Politics ==
Town government had been dominated for over 120 years by the Republican Party. That changed in 2003 with the election of Democrat Theresa Egan as town supervisor. On the town board, Democrat Dan Plummer, along with Independence Party member Tim Gordon, created a new working Democratic majority for the first time in recollection. The Democrats further solidified their majority in 2005. On April 11, 2007, Supervisor Egan resigned her position in favor of a high-level appointment to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, and Jack Cunningham was appointed supervisor by the board. Cunningham was elected to the position in the fall of 2007, then ran for reelection in November 2009, when he was defeated by council member Sam Messina. Messina, a member of the Independence Party (and former member of the Democratic Party), ran on the Republican line.

When the Republican Party chose to endorse Democratic town board member Kyle Kotary for town supervisor in May 2011, then-Supervisor Messina announced he would not seek reelection. John Clarkson defeated Kotary in the Democratic primary for the supervisor position in September 2011, and Clarkson subsequently defeated Kotary, running on the Republican line, in the general election in November 2011. Clarkson was sworn in as Bethlehem&#x27;s supervisor on January 2, 2012. He served 3 terms and was succeeded by Democrat David VanLuven, who was first elected in November 2017. He ran unopposed for reelection in 2019.

Following the 2019 elections, Democrats were reelected to the town supervisor position, the town clerk position, the receiver of taxes position, both town justices and three of four seats on the town board. Additionally, a Democrat, Marc Dorsey, was elected superintendent of highways. 

In the 2021 election, Democrats won all town offices: supervisor, clerk, town justice, superintendent of highways, and two town board seats. Following this election, Democrats control every local elected position in the town.

== Education ==
Most town residents live within the Bethlehem Central School District. The town operates five public elementary schools – Eagle, Elsmere, Glenmont, Hamagrael, and Slingerlands. A sixth elementary school, Clarksville, was closed indefinitely at the end of the 2010–2011 school year. The building remains property of the Bethlehem Central School District and is currently leased to the Albany County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. According to the District web site, Clarksville school will remain closed for the indefinite future due to declining enrollment and economic issues.

Bethlehem Central School District Elementary schools include students up to grade 5. The Bethlehem Central Middle School educates children in grades 6, 7 and 8, while the Bethlehem Central High School includes grades 9–12.

The town also includes the School of Saint Thomas the Apostle, a Catholic school for grades K–8 located across from the Catholic Church. Additionally, an independent school known as Bethlehem Children&#x27;s School exists for students in K–8, offering a creative, child centered environmental education approach to learning.

The school district offers Continuing Education classes in a variety of topics for adult learners of all ages. The school district also provides busing and most textbooks for families who choose to educate their children in private schools.

Residents in the hamlet of North Bethlehem are part of the Guilderland Central School District. Residents in the hamlets of Selkirk and South Bethlehem are part of the Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk Central School District. One of the two elementary schools of the district, Albertus W. Becker Elementary School, is in Selkirk.

==Electric power facilities==
===Bethlehem Energy Center===
Pursuant to Article X of the Public Service Law, PSEG Energy Resource &amp; Trade LLC (originally filed by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC) in 1998) was granted a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need for a 750-megawatt (MW) combined cycle natural gas powered plant in 2002. The project went into service in July 2005. There are three combustion turbines whose exhaust creates steam to drive a steam turbine. All of the turbines are manufactured by General Electric. It uses an air-cooled condenser to reduce water draw. It is located on a 186-acre former industrial area that was owned by NMPC and housed the former 376 MW coal-powered Albany Steam Station. NMPC sold the land to PSEG in 2000. In 2017, the Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC), as it is also known, injected 5,303 GWh of electric energy into the electric transmission system. This is equivalent to operating at full capacity for approximately 73.4% of the year. For comparison, the capital region consumed 11,823 GWh of electric energy in 2017. Its power is sold into the electric wholesale market administered by the NYISO.

As a requirement of its certificate, PSEG created an estuary to offset the industrial development of the plant (1.5 acres of new wetland for every acre of newly industrialized area) with fish stocking included.

In 2015, the BEC filed for an amendment of their Article X certificate to increase the certificate power generation amount by around 36 MW. This increase corresponded to an upgrade in turbine components and software from GE. A noise study was commissioned to evaluate any possible noise impact on the local community. The amendment was granted noting that there would not be an increase in air emissions or facility footprint. There was a corresponding 78.1 MW increase in its summer capacity market offering capability between the 2015 NYISO Gold Book and the 2018 NYISO Gold Book. In its 2018 adopted budget, the Town of Bethlehem noted a revenue of $214,941 from payments in lieu of taxes most of which can be assumed to come from the BEC. For comparison, the Town of Bethlehem noted a total budget of about $42 million for 2018.

<doc id="126082" wikidata="Q1380598" url="?curid=126082" title="Cohoes, New York">
<text>Cohoes ( ) is an incorporated city located in the northeast corner of Albany County in the U.S. state of New York. It is called the &quot;Spindle City&quot; because of the importance of textile manufacturing to its growth in the 19th century. The city&#x27;s factories processed cotton from the Deep South.

As of the 2020 census, the city population was 18,174. The name Cohoes is believed to be derived from a Mohawk term, &quot;Ga-ha-oose&quot;, referring to the Cohoes Falls and meaning &quot;Place of the Falling Canoe,&quot; an interpretation noted by Horatio Gates Spafford in his 1823 publication &quot;A Gazetteer of the State of New York&quot;. Later historians posited that the name is derived from the Algonquian &quot;Cohoes,&quot; a place name based on a word meaning &#x27;pine tree&#x27;.

==History==
In the early years of Dutch colonial settlement, the majority of the city&#x27;s territory was once part of the area of Manor of Rensselaerswyck, a feudal-style manor or patroonship. The land north of a line crossing the Cohoes Falls (today Manor Avenue) was outside the Manor and was owned by the Van Olohde family between 1725 and 1750. Rensselaerswyck was established by Killiaen Van Rensselaer, the patroon and a Dutch merchant. In 1632, he had an agent pace off an enormous triangle-shaped area around the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, from the Peebles Island northwest to the Cohoes Falls and south to today&#x27;s Watervliet; this area was the core of the future city of Cohoes. Starting in the 1690s the Patroon began to issue leases for the area of Cohoes, reserving for himself a strip below the Cohoes Falls for the future site of mills powered by water.


Though the area was not much settled for a time, it was known for the Cohoes Falls. One of the earliest descriptions of the falls was in 1642 by Johannes Megapolensis, the first dominie (Dutch Reformed pastor) of Beverwyck. Another early description was in 1656 by Adriaen van der Donck in his &quot;Description of New Netherland&quot;. In the early-to-mid 17th century, a whale swam upriver in the Hudson, becoming stranded in the Mohawk River on an island just below the Cohoes Falls. The Dutch settlers could not easily get to the large carcass to remove it. As it rotted, the river became slick for three weeks. A settler commented that &quot;the air was infected with its stench... perceptible for two miles to leeward.&quot; Beginning about 1646, settlers called this land Whale Island.

During the various French and Indian Wars of the mid-18th century, Van Schaick Island was developed as part of a military road that came from Albany north along the islands at the mouth of the Mohawk River. These islands allowed for easier fords across the various mouths of the Mohawk and access to Waterford and points north. The islands were used for numerous military encampments during both the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolutionary War.
The Van Schaick Mansion on Van Schaick Island was built in the 1730s; it was one of the sites used as a military headquarters during the Revolution by the Americans under Major Generals Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates. Van Schaick Island was the first part of Cohoes to be settled and farmed; it was formerly known as Cohoes Island and Anthony&#x27;s Island.
===Growth===
Until after the Revolutionary War, Cohoes was a small quiet hamlet with isolated farms. After the Mohawk and other Iroquois allies of the British were forced to cede their territory, New York encouraged new settlement. Thousands of Yankee settlers came from New England. Cohoes was linked to the larger settlements of Lansingburg and Albany. In 1795 the first bridge across the Mohawk River was constructed at Cohoes. It was 900 feet long, 24 feet wide, 15 feet high, and was based on 13 stone piers. It cost $12,000 to build and was a toll bridge. This bridge provided access to Cohoes as one of the main routes north. The bridge was rebuilt in 1806 by the Cohoes Bridge Company, which raised the tolls to cover the cost.

Another major transportation improvement, construction of the Erie and Champlain canals were begun in 1817. The section in Cohoes was finished in 1823, stimulating trade for the city. Cohoes was known as Juncta because of being served by the two canals, which improved water traffic north to Lake Champlain and west through the Mohawk Valley. One or both of the canals crossed every farm in Cohoes. Even with the canals and the bridge bringing easier access to larger markets, Cohoes was a sleepy place prior to 1831. The nearest post office was at Waterford; fresh meat and produce were available mostly by residents raising their own. A United States post office was built in Cohoes in 1831.
===Industrial age===
In 1811 the Cohoes Manufacturing Company, owned entirely by men from Lansingburg, was incorporated and began a factory for making screws. This was the first large industry in Cohoes to use the power of the Mohawk River and Cohoes Falls.

In 1831, a new Cohoes Company constructed a dam on the Mohawk River above the city&#x27;s waterfall in order to better regulate water flow for industrial use. It was soon swept away by ice at the break-up in spring, and a new dam was built the following year. Two canals extended from the dam to provide water power for industry. Ironworks were the first main industry in Cohoes, as it was in Troy, Menands, and West Troy. Daniel Simmons&#x27; Simmons Axe Company was famous throughout the United States, and the Cohoes Iron Foundry was a large business enterprise in the 1830s.
===Textile industry===

In the 1820s, the first cotton mill in Albany County was built in Cohoes. Egberts and Bailey was the first factory to use knitting machinery run by power, based on the Cohoes Company&#x27;s power canals.

The community became a center of textile manufacturing; in 1836 the Harmony Manufacturing Company was founded, later famous as Harmony Mills. Cohoes became a mill town, and to an extent a company town. During the 1870s the mills were enormously profitable because of the Erie Canal, which flowed past them at that time. Mill #3, at over long, has been considered the longest continuous textile mill in the country at the time. Cotton textiles were shipped to New York City, England and Europe, where demand was high.

In 1848, Cohoes was incorporated as a village within the town of Watervliet. In 1869, it was chartered as a city.
====Mastodon discovery====

In 1866, during excavation work for construction of Mill #3 of the Harmony Mills, the bones of a mastodon were unearthed over a period of several weeks. This mammal ranged in this territory when humans were first settling here.

The Cohoes Mastodon skeleton was long on display in the lobby of the New York State Museum in Albany, New York. Since the early 21st century, the skeleton has been moved to a new location away from the windows, where temperature and humidity fluctuations risked damaging the skeleton. A replica complete with fur is on display at the Cohoes Public Library.

Upon their completion, in 1872, the Harmony Mills were the largest cotton mill complex in the world. The Harmony Mills are an excellent example of 19th-century mill architecture. During the 19th century, numerous immigrants came to Cohoes to work in the mills, particularly French Canadians from Quebec and Irish, who first arrived as refugees in the 1840s from the Great Famine. The Harmony Mills Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the late 20th century.

Around the start of the 20th century, daredevil Bobby Leach practiced going over the Cohoes Falls in a barrel before he performed the same stunt at Niagara. Cohoes residents watched this feat from the lawn or the porch of The Cataract House, the Victorian hotel at the corner of North Mohawk and School streets. This site was later developed as the present School Street Power Station.
===21st Century===

From 2005 to 2013, the Harmony Mills were redeveloped and restored by real estate developer Uri Kaufman. Kaufman converted the Mills to luxury loft apartments, sparking a revival in the heart of the city.

On November 30, 2017, there was a massive fire that destroyed and damaged 21 buildings that caught the attention of national media. An amateur blacksmith, attempting to mimic the show &quot;Forged in Fire&quot;, started a barrel fire to forge with before losing control of it. High winds stoked the flames which spread over the course of six hours. At one point smoke and fire collectively consumed three blocks of the downtown district, and a plume of smoke rose over the city large enough to be detected by weather radar. Twenty-one buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed, with two businesses and a garage being completely leveled.
===Improvements===
Starting around 2020 to 2023, Cohoes embarked on a citywide revitalization project focused on improving infrastructure, restoring historic buildings, and environmental sustainability. The city invested $35 million in infrastructure improvements, including improving sidewalks, planting street trees, redesigning city parks, installing public charging stations for electric vehicles, and creating a new waterfront park.

In 2017, West End Park was redesigned to become a memorial park honoring veterans. In 2020, historic Canal Square Park in downtown Cohoes was redesigned to host Farmer’s Markets, outdoor concerts, and receptions and other events.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (11.79%) is water.

Cohoes is situated at the confluence of the Mohawk with the Hudson River, where the Mohawk forms several channels and islands. Cohoes is named for its most famous landmark, the Cohoes Falls, a majestic waterfall first seen by the area&#x27;s successive generations of indigenous peoples. In the historic era, these were the Mohawk Nation. The city includes Van Schaick Island, where the historic Van Schaick Mansion is located, and Simmons Island.

Within Albany County, the city has the town of Colonie to its northwest, west, and south; with the town and village of Green Island to the south of Van Schaick Island. To the north across the Mohawk River is Saratoga County and the town of Waterford&#x27;s hamlet of Northside. A bridge connects Cohoes to Waterford. To the east of Van Schaick Island across the Hudson River is Rensselaer County and the city of Troy&#x27;s Lansingburg neighborhood. The 112th Street Bridge connects Van Schaick Island to Troy.

<text>Delmar is a hamlet in the Town of Bethlehem, in Albany County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of the neighboring city of Albany. The community is bisected by NY Route 443 (Delaware Avenue), a major thoroughfare, main street, and route to Albany.

A census-designated place (CDP) has been established since 1980 by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating the population of what the census has defined as the boundaries of the urbanized area in and around Delmar. The population was 8,292 at the 2000 census, but it was not included as a CDP in the 2010 census.

In 2005, CNN/Money Magazine named the Delmar ZIP Code (an area larger than the Delmar hamlet or CDP) as one of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in America, rating it the 22nd best place to live among what it called &quot;Great American Towns.&quot;

==History==

Nathaniel Adams moved to the area in 1836 and, two years later, built a large hotel and made other improvements. When the first post office was built in 1840, he became the first post master. The Adams Hotel was Bethlehem&#x27;s Town Hall from 1950-1980. In 1841, Nathaniel donated an acre of land for a chapel to be built so that those of the Dutch Reformed Church did not have to travel to Unionville to attend worship though this new church continued to be under the Union Reformed Church. In 1847, the members of the Reformed Church at Adams Station petitioned for their own organization separate from Union, and in 1848 this was granted by both the Union Reformed Church and the Classis of Albany. For Nathaniel Adams, Delmar received its early name of Adamsville.
After Adamsville received its post office, mail began to get confused with the town of Adams, New York, which also had an Adams Village. The name of the post office was changed to Adams Station in an attempt to relieve that confusion. The Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, which had a station on Adams Street north of Kenwood Avenue, however, had chosen to change from Adamsville to &quot;Delmar&quot;. In 1892, a petition by area residents to change the post office to match Delmar was accepted.

The Patterson Farmhouse, United States Post Office, and Van Derheyden House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
As a hamlet, the borders of Delmar are indeterminate, though generally the unincorporated village is considered to be centered on the intersection of Kenwood and Delaware avenues. According to the 2000 United States Census, the CDP has a total area of , all land. A CDP&#x27;s borders can, however, change from census to census. As of 2000, the border followed the Normans Kill to the north, and then for the western border it travels south on McCormack Road North to Cherry Ave Extension (New York Route 140) where it turns left and then right on to McCormack Road. At Bridge Avenue, in the neighboring hamlet of Slingerlands, the CDP&#x27;s border turns left, and then right onto Albany County Route 52 (Cherry Ave/Elm Ave). The border then turns east (left) onto the Delmar Bypass (New York Route 32) to Elsmere Avenue (New York Route 335), where it then travels north. At the intersection of Elsmere Ave with Delaware Avenue, the border turns east onto the latter. At Salisbury Road, the Delmar CDP border carves a small enclave by turning left onto said road and then right onto Normanside Avenue, then by turning onto Euclid Avenue it travels back southeast to Delaware Avenue once again. After another small jog on Delaware Ave, the border turns left for Normanskill Boulevard opposite the Delaware Plaza. After turning right onto Bethlehem Court, the border then travels in a straight northeastern line to intersect again at the Normanskill.

Several small creeks and streams flow through Delmar; generally north of Delaware Avenue they flow north to the Normans Kill; south of Delaware Avenue is Dowers Kill which is a south-flowing tributary of the Vloman Kill.

<text>Guilderland is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. In the 2020 census, the town had a population of 36,848. The town is named for the Gelderland province in the Netherlands.
The town of Guilderland is on the central-northwest border of the county. It is just west of Albany, the capital of the U.S. state of New York.

== History ==

Guilderland was originally a part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck that Patroon Kiliaen van Rensselaer began in 1629 as part of the New Netherland colony. By the end of the 17th century, Dutch settlers from Albany and Schenectady began to establish farms in the area, beginning first along the banks of the Normans Kill. In 1712, a group of emigrants from the Rhine Valley in present-day Germany passed through the town on their way to Schoharie. They were the first to record and name the Helderberg Escarpment, originally Hellebergh meaning &quot;bright or clear mountain&quot;. This name would also be used for all the land between the Normans Kill and the escarpment. In 1734, the first known religious service was held by a Lutheran dominie from Athens, New York to the &quot;Normanskill Folk&quot;, and the first religious structure was a Dutch Reformed Church in 1750.

Guilderland was, from its beginning, a location amenable to early industry due to its many streams for waterwheels, large forests for wood fuel, and the fine sand for glass works. In 1795, Jan and Leonard de Neufville (father and son) established a large glass factory mostly for the manufacture of windows but also for bottles of various shapes, sizes, and uses. Around this factory would spring up the hamlet of Hamilton (today called Guilderland). The factory could not compete with cheap British imports after the War of 1812, and with its collapse, the glass industry would never return to Guilderland. A hat factory and a foundry would both occupy the site over the next 200 years. French&#x27;s Mills, another hamlet founded on industry, was home to many textile mills, due to the power harnessed from the falls on the Normans Kill near Guilderland Center.

During the US Revolutionary War, many families in Guilderland were split in their loyalties. In New York, tenant farmers generally opposed their landlords, the Patroons, who sided with the rebellious independentists (Patriots), making New York one of the colonies where the war of Independence became a vicious civil war. The patroon of Rensselaerswyck and the local clergy, however, rallied the support of most of the local settlers in opposing the Loyalists. Those who remained loyal to the established government operated, among other places, from the caves of the Helderbergs, raiding settlements with the help of Native Americans. A battle between Loyalists and rebel Schenectady Militia with help from Rhode Island Continental Troops was fought just east of Guilderland Center. It was later alleged the local Loyalists were about to burn Schenectady and Albany, which is not entirely trustworthy as these would have been their own neighbors. In any case, the victory of the American forces allowed the Rhode Island contingent to travel to Saratoga for the Battle of Saratoga that occurred five weeks later, the turning point of the US Revolution.

From 1799 until its formation in 1803, Guilderland was a part of the town of Watervliet. The name Guilderland (spelled Guilderlandt in the original law) was the suggestion of resident Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, who happened to be Lieutenant-Governor of the state at the time, and as such was President of the Senate. His family (that of the original patroon) and many of the original settlers came from Gelderland, a province of the Netherlands. In 1871 the northwestern part of Albany, west from Magazine Street, was annexed to Guilderland, after the town of Watervliet refused the annexation of the same territory. Parts of this territory would be annexed back to Albany in 1910, setting up more or less the current border.

At the start of the town&#x27;s founding, the Schoolcraft family was prominent. Congressman John L. Schoolcraft was born in Guilderland in September 1806. When his father, Captain John Schoolcraft, died in December of the same year, he was raised by his grandfather, John Schoolcraft. Wealthy grandfather Schoolcraft, who owned much property in Guilderland hamlet and ran an inn and tavern, was the first Justice of the Peace in the hamlet, an elder and trustee of the Hamilton Union Church, and a member of the first Guilderland School Board. He was also the uncle of the famed Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. John L. Schoolcraft started a profitable mercantile business, became president of Albany Commercial Bank (later part of today&#x27;s Key Bank), and was groomed for politics by Thurlow Weed, editor of the Albany Evening Journal, winning his first Congressional election in 1848.

In the 1840s, Schoolcraft built the early Gothic Schoolcraft mansion John Schoolcraft House upon his return from a European journey. He used it mostly as a summer residence. Schoolcraft was a close friend and confidant of Governor William Seward and married Seward&#x27;s niece, Carolyn Canfield, in 1853.

Guilderland was home to the New York Power Pool and its control center after the Power Pool&#x27;s formation in 1966 in response to the 1965 blackout. Most of its operations were transferred over to the NYISO after the NYISO&#x27;s formation in 1999. The NYISO built a new control center in 2014 in Rensselaer, New York.

<text>Menands is a village in Albany County, New York, United States. The population was 4,554 at the 2020 census. The village is named after Louis Menand. The village lies inside the town of Colonie and borders the northern city line of Albany.

==History==
Menands would have been first spotted by Europeans &quot;circa&quot; 1609, when Henry Hudson dropped anchor somewhere near Cuyler or Pleasure Island during his voyage on the river later to be named after him. This would be the furthest north on the river that Hudson would go in the Half Moon. Today, those islands are connected to the mainland, and are the site of Interstate 787 exits 6 and 7, which includes the cloverleaf interchange with NY 378 and the Troy-Menands Bridge.

When the Erie Canal was constructed in the 1820s, it passed through what would become Menands. Bridges spanned the canal to allow access to the land between the canal and the Hudson. From north to south they were Richardson, Mix, Leary, Keyes, Kanes, Lundergans, Island Park, Delaware and Hudson Railroad, and Garbarance. Most of the names of the bridges were those of the neighboring farm owners.

Louis Menand settled in the village in 1842 and established an important horticultural business. He at first rented land that later became the Home for Aged Men, then in 1847 bought 11 acres of land where the Albany-Watervliet Turnpike (today Broadway) met the road going to Ireland&#x27;s Corners (today Loudonville); that road is today called New York State Route 378. When the Albany and Northern Railroad was built in 1856, it established a stop in present-day Menands and named the stop &quot;Menand&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, since Menand was the only landowner in that area at the time. When the Albany and Northern became part of the Delaware and Hudson, a station was built at that stop and called &quot;Menand&#x27;s Station&quot;. In the early 1920s, rumors circulated that the city of Albany was going to annex the area, so on August 23, 1924, a vote was taken and the village of Menands was incorporated by a vote of 167 for and 47 against, the population of the new village at that time being 1,272 people. The boundaries of the new village were those of the 15th School District of the town of Colonie. The original boundaries did not include what are now the Sage Hill Lane, Sky Hollow, and Roost Country Estates; those were annexed later and continue to be in the North Colonie Central School District.

In 1938, the first large scale Federal Housing Administration (FHA) multiple housing project in Upstate New York was conceived by Harry D. Yates on of land in Menands. The land was purchased for $20,000, from the Van Rensselaer family, which had owned it since 1639. Original plans called for 30 buildings, but cost overruns trimmed it to 13. All thirteen were named for historic people and locations in the Capital District; subsequent additions have kept to that tradition with the exception of Tremaine House, named for a former New York State Comptroller and Yates House for a former manager of Dutch Village.

In 1940, the now-defunct &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; declared Dutch Village to be &quot;one of the most interesting scale housing developments in the East&quot;. The steeped roofs and brick construction were designed to reflect early Dutch architecture. Wards Lane at the time was small and unpaved on a steep slope, but by using money from a federal program designed to pave &quot;farm to market&quot; roads, the project was able to improve the road to Dutch Village without any cost to the village of Menands.

One of the largest printing plants in the eastern USA existed in Menands in the forties and fifties. Williams Press (aka: J. B. Lyons Co.) at its prime employed more than 1,000 people. Built on Broadway with rail tracks behind, Williams printed many of today&#x27;s magazines such as Business Week, Sports Illustrated and many others, plus most of the New England telephone directories. They were forced to close because of labor issues, location constraints and outdated equipment.

The village&#x27;s current motto, &quot;Urban-Suburban Village&quot;, and its official seal, came into being as part of the village&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations in 1974. The motto and seal were chosen based on contest entries submitted by local school children at Menands Elementary school. Two boys came up with the design for the seal, and the motto was chosen from an entry by a girl in the school&#x27;s seventh grade class.

==Geography==

==Arts and culture==
===Amusement===
In the mid-late 19th and early 20th centuries, Menands was a popular destination for entertainment and amusement. Pleasure Island and Park Island (constructed in 1866) had trotting tracks and various entertainment venues. In 1884, the Island Park Association leased the race course, Island Park, directly north of Pleasure Island. It was considered one of the fastest and safest in the nation.

Among the festivities and activities at Pleasure Island were a two-mile (3 km) bicycle race, a sack race, barrel race, swimming exhibition, trotter race, and fireworks. In 1907 Al-Tro Island Park renovated Pleasure Island, Al-Tro was named for being halfway between Albany and Troy, and the park&#x27;s manager boasted of surpassing Coney Island. The park had a and boardwalk, with amusements on each side. About halfway down the boardwalk was an amphitheater that could seat 4000, it was one of the largest in the state. At the time Al-Tro Park was considered the finest pleasure resort in northern New York. In the early 1920s Al-Tro closed and the concept was used in the late 1920s by nearby Mid-City Park, an amusement park along Broadway on the other side away from the river, it had a roller coaster, merry-go-round, roller skating rink, and swimming pool; it too would close after a few decades. It was replaced by the current Mid-City Shopping Center.

Baseball was also a popular entertainment venue in Menands bringing in spectators from across the region. Chadwick Park was home to the Albany Senators who played in the New York State League, Eastern League, International League, New York–Pennsylvania League, and the modern Eastern League. On May 30, 1924, the Senators played a double header at home against the Pittsfield Hillies, the first game lasted 9 innings but the second game went for 20, it is still one of the longest double headers by number of innings in professional baseball. In 1928 Chadwick Park was rebuilt, in 1929 it was renamed Hawkins Stadium, and in 1930 General Electric installed lights for night games.

It was at Hawkins Stadium that the New York Yankees played the Albany Senators in 1931 before a crowd of 6,300; Babe Ruth hit two home runs. The Senators folded in 1959. It too was demolished to make way for the Mid-City Shopping Center and a department type store, which would eventually close and be replaced by the New York State Office of Workers Compensation Board. From June 12, 1947, to September 2, 1963, Empire Raceways was a popular entertainment venue. It was a quarter mile paved oval track and was located close enough to the Hudson River that spectators would sit on the Troy-Menands Bridge and watch the races for free. The location would later become the site of a Two Guys Department Store and Interstate 787.

Two Guys was just one of the retail locations in Menands that made Menands a shopping destination for the surrounding area. In addition to Two Guys there was a Woolworth, Montgomery Wards, several grocery stores, and various other shops along Broadway. The Two Guys location on Broadway, located next to the Troy-Menands Bridge, was one of only two in the area, the other being in downtown Schenectady. Another retail landmark in Menands was the Montgomery Ward Retail Store and Warehouse built in 1929, it was one of nine similar buildings built in the 1920s, and one of four that still remain. The building had its own railroad spur that allowed boxcars to be unloaded inside, making delivery of goods to the building easier. Montgomery Wards left the building in the early 1980s. Today the building is office space, mostly geared towards state agencies. Woolworth was located at the Mid-City Shopping Center, it closed in 1997.

==Infrastructure==
===Fire department===
Menands has a local volunteer fire department. Menands Fire Co.#1 was founded March 3, 1923, and was incorporated in February 1931. In 1936, the Hudson Mohawk Volunteer Firefighters Association was founded at the Menands Fire Co. In 1983, Menands Fire Co.#1 moved into the new Fire House, adjacent to old Fire House. The old Fire House was renovated for use as the Menands Police Department and Village Court.

===Police department===
The first constable in Menands served in a part-time position. The first police chief was appointed by the Village Trustees in 1924, when the village was incorporated.

<text>The Lincoln Battalion (), the major component of what came to be known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, was the 17th (later the 58th) battalion of the XV International Brigade that fought in the Spanish Civil War. Named after United States President Abraham Lincoln, the battalion was organized by the Communist International. The XVth Brigade was one of many mixed brigades that comprised the International Brigades.

The Lincoln Battalion was formed by American volunteers who served as soldiers, technicians, medical personnel, and aviators alongside the Spanish Republican forces against the Nazi-supported forces of General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist faction. Unlike the segregated U.S. Army in the 1930s, the Lincoln Battalion integrated white and black soldiers on an equal basis. Of the approximately 3,000 American volunteers who went to Spain, 681 were killed in action or died of wounds or sickness.

==History==
===Creation===
The Spanish Civil War was fought from 17 July 1936 to 28 March 1939. The combatants were the Republicans—a political alliance referred to as the Popular Front, which was loyal to the Spanish Republic (hence, also referred to as the Loyalists)—and the Nationalists, a rebel movement led by General Francisco Franco, which was backed by the fascist countries in Europe. The Spanish Civil War&#x27;s triggering event was the coup of July 1936 in which the Nationalists attempted to overthrow the elected Republican government.

On 26 July, less than ten days after the coup started, an international Communist conference was held in Prague to formulate plans to assist the Republicans. The conference attendees decided to raise a multinational brigade of 5,000 men and a fund of one billion francs. At the same time, Communist parties worldwide launched a full-scale propaganda campaign supporting the Popular Front. The Communist International soon joined the activity, sending to Spain its leader Georgi Dimitrov, as well as Palmiro Togliatti, the chief of the Communist Party of Italy. The Soviet Union began supplying aid to the Republicans in August 1936. Over one ship per day arrived at Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, and trucks. With the cargo came Soviet agents, technicians, instructors, and propagandists.

The Communist International quickly started to organize the International Brigades, taking care to conceal or minimize the Communist character of the enterprise. In keeping with Popular Front culture, the Republican cause was portrayed as a struggle for progressive democracy, and the American soldiers in Spain named their units the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, the George Washington Battalion, and the John Brown Battery. Other countries used similar patriotic names, e.g., the Garibaldi Battalion from Italy. Besides the Americans who volunteered as soldiers, another 125 men and women served with the American Medical Bureau as nurses, doctors, and ambulance drivers.

===1937===
Seeking help to defeat the armed rebellion, the Republicans asked for volunteer fighters worldwide. The American volunteers, many of them Communists, started arriving in Spain in late 1936. Utilizing the name of Abraham Lincoln, they formed the Lincoln Battalion in January 1937 as part of the XV International Brigade. The battalion initially fielded three companies: two infantry and one machine gun. Sections of Latin American and Irish volunteers were also included, organized as the Centuria Guttieras and the Connolly Column, respectively. After less than two months of training, the Lincolns took action in February 1937. Many of the volunteers recalled that training was rudimentary: &quot;They give me a gun, and they give me 100 bullets, and they send me to fight.&quot;

The International Brigades were usually deployed as shock troops, resulting in high casualties. As an example, the Lincoln Battalion lost 22.5% of its strength by war&#x27;s end. The Lincolns were especially depleted by the Battle of Jarama. On 27 February 1937, the unit lost two-thirds of its forces, including commander Robert Hale Merriman (who was badly wounded) in a futile assault on Nationalist positions. Merriman had begged Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Ćopić (described as &quot;rather inept&quot;) not to launch the attack, fearing slaughter. Ćopić insisted it proceed and promised air and armored support, which never came. Merriman was almost immediately wounded, and the Lincolns suffered 136 deaths. The battalion remained in combat and was slowly rebuilt while maintaining its front-line positions. The unit was finally pulled out of the lines for a brief rest before the offensive at Brunete.

Joined by the newly trained George Washington Battalion, the XVth Brigade took action at Villanueva de la Cañada on the second day of the Brunete Offensive and secured the town after hard fighting. The Washingtons attacked the north end of the village, while the British and Dimitrov battalions attacked from the south.

The XVth Brigade then deployed against &quot;Mosquito Ridge&quot;, but despite repeated assaults, they could not dislodge the Nationalist troops holding that critical piece of terrain. The Lincoln Battalion&#x27;s commander Oliver Law—the first black commander of an integrated American army unit—was killed during this action. The XVth Brigade again sustained severe losses. Due to the high rate of casualties, the Lincoln and Washington Battalions were merged. Thereafter, the unit was officially known as the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, though it was more commonly referred to as the Lincoln Battalion.

From August–October 1937, the Lincoln-Washington Battalion fought in a series of battles in the Aragon Offensive. It fought well at both Quinto and Belchite. The engagement at Quinto was a combined arms action as the Lincoln-Washington Battalion was led into their second assault on the town by Soviet tanks, T-26 tanks, and Soviet crews. Belchite was a hard battle with house-to-house fighting that produced heavy casualties.

After Belchite, the XVth Brigade was again reorganized. The newly formed Canadian MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion joined the brigade, and the veteran Dimitrov Battalion departed. A majority of the volunteers in the &quot;Mac-Paps&quot; were Americans. On 13 October 1937, the XVth Brigade fought at Fuentes de Ebro. Men from the brigade&#x27;s 24th (Spanish) Battalion rode Russian tanks into the attack. The remaining battalions were supposed to follow the tanks, but the attack fell apart because they did not coordinate their advance with the infantry. Casualties were especially heavy in the 24th and MacKenzie-Papineau Battalions. After Fuentes, the XVth Brigade was pulled back to a reserve position, receiving its first extended period of rest and relaxation since going into combat at Jarama.

In late December, the Lincoln-Washington Battalion was alerted for service at Teruel. The XVth Brigade was deployed to hold the recently captured city of Teruel against the expected Nationalist counterattack. The winter of 1937/38 was among the coldest on record, and many troops suffered frostbite during the campaign. The Lincoln-Washington&#x27;s initially held positions overlooking Teruel that they called the North Pole. Later, they moved down into the city. During January, the Nationalists launched coordinated attacks against the Republican defenses. The XVth Brigade&#x27;s British Battalion and MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion both lost an entire company attempting to hold the territory. Nationalist superiority in both numbers and materiel eventually pushed the XVth Brigade out of Teruel. The XV BDE, including the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, were pulled out of the line for rest after three weeks in the lines. But before the units could get to the rest areas, their trains and trucks were stopped, and they were redeployed to the front, where they participated in an offensive that was expected to relieve some of the pressure on Teruel. In a dawn attack, the XVth Brigade attacked a series of Nationalist fortifications at Segura de los Baños. While the attack succeeded, the Nationalist forces did not transfer any forces away from Teruel.

===1938-1939===

March found the Lincoln-Washington in reserve positions in Aragon. Their rest proved short-lived as the XVth Brigade was swept up in the disaster known as &quot;The Retreats&quot;. Nationalist forces punched through the Republican lines and drove to the sea, cutting the Republic in two. The Lincoln-Washington Battalion was dispersed, reformed, and dispersed again in a confused series of holding actions and retreats in which it lost most of its personnel killed, captured, or missing. Robert Merriman and Dave Doran, two of the highest-ranking American officers in the XVth Brigade, were presumed captured and executed as Nationalist forces normally executed all international prisoners. The remnants of the Battalion gathered on the far side of the Ebro River, where they were slowly reconstituted with a limited number of international volunteers from the hospitals and rear areas.

Spanish troops, many young conscripts, were drafted into the XVth Brigade&#x27;s battalions to bring them fully up to strength. Spaniards were integrated into the Lincoln Battalion as early as Jarama. Spanish companies were added to the international battalions as the flow of volunteers from North America decreased. After the Retreats, Spanish troops were integrated across all battalions and comprised most of the XVth Brigade&#x27;s strength in its last action.

In July 1938, the rebuilt Lincoln-Washington Battalion participated in the Ebro offensive. The XVth Brigade crossed the Ebro and rapidly advanced across the territory they had retreated through in March and April. However, the Nationalist forces quickly rallied, and the offensive stalled. The Republican troops returned to the defensive, contesting the area captured in the offensive. 

On 21 September 1938, Juan Negrín, the Spanish prime minister, announced to the League of Nations the unilateral withdrawal of the International Brigades from battle. Juan Negrín was trying to negotiate peace as his only hope. He had been informed that the International Brigades were no longer of military value, Although he maintained a vain hope that the Nationalists would withdraw their German and Italian troops, Franco kept his German and Italian forces until the war&#x27;s end.

On 1 November 1938, International Brigadists received a warm farewell from the people in Barcelona, where 250,000 people gathered to say goodbye to the international brigades for freedom. In a famous farewell speech, Dolores Ibárruri, &quot;La Pasionaria&quot;, declared: &quot;You are history. You are legend. You are the heroic example of democracy&#x27;s solidarity and universality in the face of the vile and accommodating spirit of those who interpret democratic principles with their eyes on hoards of wealth or corporate shares which they want to safeguard from all risk.&quot;

Surviving Americans from across Spain were sent to Ripoll, where the International Red Cross and the US government verified their nationality before repatriating them. Many were able to participate in the farewell activities, including a parade in Barcelona where the International Brigades were officially disbanded. Most American volunteers returned to the US between December 1938 and January 1939. American POWs were released after the fall of the Republican government, although the last POWs did not arrive in the United States until September 1939.

==Composition==
3,015 Americans manned the Lincoln Battalion and its successor, the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. While several of these volunteers also held citizenship in other countries, they identified primarily as Americans. Approximately 1,681 also served in the Mackenzie-Papineau (&quot;Mac-Pap&quot;) Battalion once massive losses in both battalions led to mergers and transfers of men.

Many of the volunteers were either first or second-generation immigrants, and the battalion was overwhelmingly white. The average age of Americans who served in Spain was 27. Still, there were volunteers as young as age 16. The volunteers came from 46 out of 48 states in the U.S. New York City provided the single largest number of recruits, with 1/5th to 1/3rd being of or formerly from the city before going to Spain. Of the volunteers who could speak Spanish, most were from either New York City or Ybor City located in Tampa, Florida.

Americans who applied were screened by the Communist Party USA with an in-person interview by a special committee. The committee tried to filter out &quot;adventurers&quot; and those who &quot;lacked a political understanding of the anti-fascist struggle.&quot; In the Communist Party, joining the brigade was never mandatory. Secrecy was a high priority, and volunteers were given minimal information by Party leaders and only obtained information regarding their passports when they had passed their examination. The committee recommended that volunteers supply false information to customs and border officials about where they were travelling.

Americans usually entered Spain by first emigrating to France because the U.S. Government was not issuing visas to Spain as part of a non-intervention policy regarding the Spanish Civil War. Few American volunteers arrived after September 1937.

Battalion members fought for many different reasons. For the 85 African-American members of the battalion, the Nationalist forces represented some of the same injustices they faced back in the U.S. The Nationalist army primarily consisted of colonial troops from Spain&#x27;s African colonies or of conscripted blacks who were desperate to escape poverty. Furthermore, Franco was supported by the Italian army and air force, which had only recently conquered the African nation of Ethiopia. Several leaders characterized the war as a crusade against the &quot;Africanization&quot; of Spain, although it was the Nationalists who relied on African fighters. Langston Hughes, a journalist for the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; at the time, wrote, &quot;Give Franco a hood, and he would be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.&quot; Though the Lincoln Battalion was predominantly white, it was integrated.

Most of the original volunteers in the Lincoln Battalion were communists or Soviet sympathizers. It is difficult to list exactly how many members of the battalion were communists because political ideology was not a litmus test for serving in the war. Historians and veterans of the battalion estimate that between 50 and 80% of the battalion were actively communist. It is certain, though, that the vast majority of the commanding officers were communists. Unlike most of their European counterparts, the Americans in the International Brigade were more likely to be students who had never seen military service before the Spanish Civil War.

Not all combatants were motivated by ideological or political concerns. As Mo Fishman, a veteran of the battalion, recalled in 2006, &quot;Some men were running away from bad marital or love situations, but what united all of us was that we hated fascism.&quot; Anti-fascism, more than any other single factor, is what motivated and united the volunteers of the Lincoln Battalion.

==Other American units==

===20th Battalion, 86th Brigade===
An American company served in the 20th International Battalion that was attached to the 86th Mixed Brigade. This unit fought on the Cordoba Front. Most of the American volunteers were transferred from the unit to the XVth Brigade before the Brunete Offensive.

===George Washington Battalion===
The Washington Battalion was the second American battalion. The unit was merged with the Lincoln Battalion during the Brunete Campaign. It was commanded by Mirko Marković, and its commissar was Dave Mates.

===MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion===
The Mac Paps, as they were known, formed as the number of Canadiens fighting in the Lincoln and Washington battalions grew. Established on July 1, 1937 (Canada Day) at first there were more American soldiers in the ranks than Canadiens, but that 3-1 ratio soon shifted and the Mac Paps ended with a roll call of over 1500 Canadiens. Its first commander was Robert Thompson, an American veteran of the Lincoln Battalion. Joseph Dallet, also American, was the first Commissar.

===2nd Squadron, First Regiment de Tren===
The Regiment de Tren was a transportation unit supporting the Republican forces. The Second Squadron was predominately American. The commander was Durward Clark.

===John Brown Battery===
This unit&#x27;s official title was the 14th Battery, 2nd Group, 11th Regiment. It was a heavy artillery unit operating 155mm guns. The battery commander was Arthur Timpson, with Jack Waters as Commissar.

===4th Group, 35th Battery===
Initially, this unit operated 155mm guns but was later equipped with 45mm anti-tank guns, which were included in the 129th International Brigade. The battery commander was Nathan Budish, and his Commissar was Sid Kaufman.

==American Medical Bureau==
Organized by Dr. Edward K. Barsky, the American Medical Bureau (AMB) recruited doctors, dentists, nurses, administrators, and ambulance drivers to support the Spanish Republic. In its fundraising events, the names &#x27;American Medical Bureau to Save Spanish Democracy&#x27; and &#x27;Medical Bureau &amp; North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy&#x27; were also used.

In the United States, the AMB staged events to shift public opinion away from supporting the aid boycott to the Spanish Republic imposed by the American government following the agreements of the Non-intervention Committee. In Spain, the AMB was assigned to hospitals and medical centers of the Spanish Military Medical Services (&quot;Cuerpo de Sanidad&quot;), such as the Gómez Ulla Military Hospital in Madrid, and also to front-line locations. AMB members, who also included women, treated both international as well as Spanish combatants.

By the end of the war, a majority of both the Spanish aid committees and the leadership councils of the AMB were women. Many women leaders in the aid movement were wives of prominent American leftists or soldiers in the Lincoln Battalion. Katherine Duncan, wife to Governor La Follette&#x27;s secretary, and Peggy Dennis, a communist party leader, were leaders in the active Madison, Wisconsin chapter. Marion Merriman, wife to Abraham Lincoln Battalion commander Robert Merriman (the supposed inspiration of Hemingway&#x27;s hero in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;), was the chairwoman of the extensive San Francisco branch of the organization. She and Fredericka Martin were the only women to receive officer commissions from the Spanish Republic. Evelyn Hutchins, an active member of the AMB, agitated for years to be a hospital driver on the front-lines. Still, Spanish Republican policies prevented women from serving on the front-lines until 1938, when Hutchins won the right to serve as a driver.

==Aftermath==
During and after the Spanish Civil War, members of the brigade were generally viewed as supporters of the Soviet Union. After returning to the United States, many joined the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). However, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact caused a division among the Lincoln Brigade veterans. Some of them, adopting the official Communist line, joined with the American Peace Mobilization in protesting American support for Britain and France against Nazi Germany. Others persisted with the anti-Fascist line which they had followed to Spain. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the VALB changed its stance and fully backed the war. Former Lincoln-Washington commander Milton Wolff volunteered in 1940 for the British Special Operations Executive and arranged the provision of arms for the European resistance organizations.

During the Second World War, the U.S. government considered former members of the brigade to be security risks. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover requested that President Roosevelt ensure that former ALB members fighting in U.S. Forces in World War II not be considered for commissioning as officers or to have any positive distinction conferred upon them. In 1947, the veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were placed on the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations. The veterans would be one of only five groups that would stay intact to at least 1970 after receiving this designation.

Once the United States entered World War II, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recommended that all veterans of the Lincoln Battalion be denied military promotion to prevent communists from rising in the armed forces. After World War II ended, veterans of the Lincoln Battalion were denied military enlistment and government jobs. The House Un-American Activities Committee blacklisted the names of all veterans of the Lincoln Battalion. The Brigade was also included in the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations on April 29, 1953. Veterans were fired, spied upon, harassed, labeled communists to employers, denied housing, and refused passports for decades. The FBI has denied that it maintained any files on the veterans of the Lincoln Battalion, but veterans groups claim that the federal government is merely covering up its crimes.

In 1985, in an interview with Scripps-Howard editors, President Ronald Reagan said that most Americans believed that their fellow Americans who fought with the Loyalist forces were on the wrong side.

The last known surviving member of the Lincoln Battalion, Delmer Berg, died on February 28, 2016, at the age of 100.

==Anthem: &quot;Valley of Jarama&quot;==

Members of the XV International Brigade adapted a song by Alex McDade to reflect the losses at the Battle of Jarama. Sung to the tune of the traditional country song &quot;Red River Valley&quot;, it became their anthem.

In 2007, the exhibit &quot;Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War&quot; at the Museum of the City of New York examined the role that New Yorkers played in the conflict, as well as the political and social ideologies that motivated them to participate in activities ranging from rallying support, fundraising, and relief aid, to fighting—and sometimes dying—on the front lines in Spain.

<text>Countess Elizabeth Báthory of Ecsed (, ; ; 7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614) was a Hungarian noblewoman and alleged serial killer from the powerful House of Báthory, who owned land in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Slovakia). Báthory and four of her servants were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and women from 1590 to 1610. She and her servants were put on trial and convicted. The servants were executed, whereas Báthory was imprisoned within the Castle of Csejte (Čachtice) until she died in her sleep in 1614.

The charges levelled against Báthory have been described by several historians as a witch-hunt. Other writers, such as Michael Farin in 1989, have said that the accusations against Báthory were supported by testimony from more than 300 individuals, some of whom described physical evidence and the presence of mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Recent sources claim that the accusations were a spectacle to destroy her family&#x27;s influence in the region, which was considered a threat to the political interests of her neighbours, including the Habsburg empire.

Stories about Báthory quickly became part of national folklore. Legends describing her vampiric tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were based on rumours and only recorded as supposedly factual over a century after her death. Although these stories were repeated by at least three historians in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they are considered unreliable by modern historians. Some insist that Elizabeth&#x27;s story inspired Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), although Stoker&#x27;s notes on the novel provided no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include &quot;Blood Countess&quot; and &quot;Countess Dracula&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Elizabeth was born in 1560 on a family estate in Nyírbátor, Royal Hungary, and spent her childhood at Ecsed Castle. Her father was Baron George VI Báthory (d. 1570), of the Ecsed branch of the family, brother of Andrew Bonaventura Báthory (d. 1566), who had been ruling Voivode of Transylvania. Her paternal great-grandparents were Konrad the Red, Duke of Masovia and Warsaw, who was a member of the Piast dynasty and Anna Radziwiłł, a member of the influential Polish-Lithuanian House of Radziwiłł. Her mother was Baroness Anna Báthory of Somlyó (1537–1570), member of the other line of the Báthory family, daughter of Stephen Báthory of Somlyó, Palatine of Hungary. Through her mother, Elizabeth was the niece of Stephen Báthory (1533–1586), Prince of Transylvania, who became the ruler of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. She had several siblings; her older brother Stephen (1555–1605) served as a Judge Royal of Hungary.

Báthory was raised a Calvinist Protestant, and learned Latin, German, Hungarian, and Greek as a young woman. Born into a privileged noble family, she was endowed with wealth, education, and a prominent social rank. A proposal made by some sources in order to explain Báthory&#x27;s cruelty later in her life is that she was trained by her family to be cruel.

As a child, Báthory had multiple seizures that may have been caused by epilepsy. At the time, symptoms relating to epilepsy were diagnosed as falling sickness and treatments included rubbing blood of a non-sufferer on the lips of an epileptic or giving the epileptic a mix of a non-sufferer&#x27;s blood and piece of skull as their episode ended.

At the age of 13, before her first marriage, Báthory allegedly gave birth to a child. The child, said to have been fathered by a peasant boy, was supposedly given away to a local woman who was trusted by the Báthory family. The woman was paid for her actions, and the child was taken to Wallachia. Evidence of this pregnancy came up long after Elizabeth&#x27;s death, through rumours spread by peasants; therefore, the validity of the rumour is often disputed.

===Marriage and land ownership===

In 1573, Báthory was engaged to Count Ferenc Nádasdy, a member of the Nadasdy family. It was a political arrangement within the circles of the aristocracy. Nádasdy was the son of Baron Tamás Nádasdy de Nádasd et Fogarasföld (1498–1562) and his wife, Orsolya Kanizsai (1523–1571).

On 8 May 1575, Báthory and Nádasdy were married at the palace of Varannó (today Vranov nad Topľou, Slovakia). The marriage resulted in combined land ownership in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Hungary.

Nádasdy&#x27;s wedding gift to Báthory was his household in the Castle of Csejte (Čachtice), situated in the Little Carpathians near Vág-Ujhely and Trencsén (present-day Nové Mesto nad Váhom and Trenčín, Slovakia). At the time, King Maximilian II owned the castle, but made Ferenc&#x27;s mother, Orsolya Kanizsai, official steward in 1569. Nádasdy finally bought the castle in 1602 from Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, but during his constant military campaign, Elizabeth maintained the castle in his absence, along with the Csejte country house and seventeen adjacent villages.

After the wedding, the couple lived in Nadasdy&#x27;s castle at Sárvár.

In 1578, three years into their marriage, Nádasdy became the chief commander of Hungarian troops, leading them to war against the Ottomans. Báthory managed business affairs and the family&#x27;s multiple estates during the war. This role usually included responsibility for the Hungarian and Slovak people, providing medical care during the Long War (1593–1606), and Báthory was charged with the defence of her husband&#x27;s estates, which lay on the route to Vienna. The threat of attack was significant, for the village of Csejte had previously been plundered by the Ottomans while Sárvár, located near the border that divided Royal Hungary and Ottoman-occupied Hungary, was in even greater danger.

Báthory&#x27;s daughter, Anna Nádasdy, was born in 1585 and was later to become the wife of Nikola VI Zrinski. Báthory&#x27;s other known children include Orsolya (Orsika) Nádasdy (1590–unknown) who would later become the wife of István II Benyó; Katalin (Kata or Katherina) Nádasdy (1594-unknown); András Nádasdy (1596–1603); and Pál (Paul) Nádasdy (1598–1650), father of Franz III Nádasdy, who was one of the leaders of the Magnate conspiracy against Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Some chronicles also indicate that the couple had another son, named Miklós Nádasdy, who married Zsuzsanna Zrinski. However, this cannot be confirmed, and it could be that he was simply a cousin or died young, as he is not named in Báthory&#x27;s will from 1610. György Nádasdy is also supposedly the name of one of the deceased Nádasdy infants, but this cannot be confirmed. All of Elizabeth&#x27;s children were cared for by governesses, as Báthory herself had been.

Ferenc Nádasdy died on 4 January 1604 at the age of 48. Although the exact nature of the illness which led to his death is unknown, it seems to have started in 1601 and initially caused debilitating pain in his legs. From that time, he never fully recovered, and in 1603 became permanently disabled. He had been married to Báthory for 29 years. Before dying, Nádasdy entrusted his heirs and widow to György Thurzó, who would eventually lead the investigation into Báthory&#x27;s crimes.

===Accusations===

Between 1602 and 1604, after rumours of Báthory&#x27;s atrocities had spread throughout the kingdom, Lutheran minister István Magyari made complaints against her, both publicly and at the court in Vienna. In 1610, Matthias II assigned György Thurzó, the Palatine of Hungary, to investigate. Thurzó ordered two notaries, András Keresztúry and Mózes Cziráky, to collect evidence in March 1610. By October 1610 they had collected 52 witness statements; by 1611, that number had risen to over 300.

Bathory is said to have tortured or killed peasants for years; their disappearances were not likely to provoke an investigation. The abuse of lower classes by nobles was frowned on but not actually prohibited by law. However, she eventually began killing daughters of the lesser gentry, some of whom were sent to live with her hoping to learn from her and benefit from a connection to the high-ranking countess.

Some witnesses named relatives who died while at the gynaeceum. Others reported having seen traces of torture on dead bodies, some of which were buried in graveyards, and others in unmarked locations.

====Veracity of accusations====
Beginning in the 1980s, scholars have questioned the truthfulness of the claims against Bathory. Several authors, such as László Nagy and Irma Szádeczky-Kardoss, have argued that Elizabeth Báthory was a victim of a conspiracy. Nagy argued that the proceedings against Báthory were largely politically motivated, possibly due to her extensive wealth and ownership of large areas of land in Hungary, which increased after the death of her husband. At that time, Hungary was embroiled in religious and political conflicts, especially relating to the wars with the Ottoman Empire, the spread of Protestantism and the extension of Habsburg power. The Habsburgs were Catholic and Báthory was a Protestant. Her nephew, Prince Gábor Báthory, ruled in Transylvania, which was influential in the movement for Hungarian independence from Habsburg rule, providing the Habsburgs a motivation to discredit the family. Prince Gábor also desired the throne of Hungary, presenting a threat to King Matthias. Elizabeth Báthory&#x27;s vast land holdings included fortresses that could have aided the Transylvanian army if Gábor had sent it to challenge Matthias. Matthias, who had originally ordered the investigation into Báthory, owed her a large debt, which was cancelled after she was arrested.

The investigation into Báthory&#x27;s crimes was sparked by complaints from a Lutheran minister, István Magyari, which does not align with the notion of a Catholic/Habsburg plot against the Protestant Báthory. However religious tension is still a possible source of conflict, as Báthory was a raised Calvinist rather than Lutheran.

Thurzó, the investigator into the accusations, had political state ambitions that would benefit from disgracing Báthory. An ally of King Matthias, he had been involved in an assassination attempt on Báthory&#x27;s couzin Prince Gábor, and he had ambitions for his son to become Prince of Transylvania, in competition with Elizabeth Báthory&#x27;s son. Thurzó alleged that he found numerous dead and dying girls when he entered the castle, but Szádeczky-Kardoss argues that the physical evidence was exaggerated and Thurzó misrepresented dead and wounded patients as victims of Báthory. Landowners like Báthory were responsible for medical care of tenants, so sick and injured subjects were brought to her castles. Female landowners were charged with care of female patients.

===Arrest===
On 13 December 1612, Nikola VI Zrinski confirmed the agreement with Thurzó about the imprisonment of Báthory and distribution of the estate. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1612, Thurzó went to Csejte Castle and arrested Báthory along with four of her servants, who were accused of being her accomplices: Dorotya Semtész, Ilona Jó, Katarína Benická and János Újváry (&quot;Ibis&quot; or Fickó). According to Thurzó&#x27;s letter to his wife, his unannounced visit found one dead girl and another living &quot;prey&quot; girl in the castle, but there is no evidence that they asked her what had happened to her. She recovered but did not testify in the trials. Although it is commonly believed that Báthory was caught in the act of torture, she was having dinner. Initially, Thurzó made the declaration to Báthory&#x27;s guests and villagers that he had caught her red-handed. However, she was arrested and detained prior to the discovery or presentation of the victims. It seems most likely that the claim of Thurzó&#x27;s discovering Báthory covered in blood has been the embellishment of fictionalised accounts.

Thurzó debated further proceedings with Báthory&#x27;s son Paul and two of her sons-in-law, Nikola VI Zrinski and György Drugeth. Her family, which ruled Transylvania, sought to avoid the loss of Báthory&#x27;s property which was at risk of being seized by the crown following a public scandal. Thurzó, along with Paul and her two sons-in-law, originally planned for Báthory to be sent to a nunnery, but as accounts of her actions spread, they decided to keep her under strict house arrest.

Two trials were held in the wake of Báthory&#x27;s arrest: The first was held on 2 January 1611, and the second on 7 January 1611.
In the first trial, seventeen witnesses testified, including the four servants who were also fellow suspects. These suspects had been tortured before the proceedings. They confessed, and stated that they were acting on Elizabeth&#x27;s orders. After the trial, they were executed as her accomplices. Ilona Jó and Dorottya Szentes had their fingers torn out with a pair of red-hot pincers and were then burned alive. Due to his youth and the belief that he was less culpable, János Újváry was executed by a much less painful method: Beheading. Afterwards, his body was burned on the same pyre as Jó and Szentes. Another servant, Erzsi Majorova, initially escaped capture but was burned alive after being apprehended. Katarína Benická received a life sentence after evidence showed that she had been abused by the others.

The accusations of murder were based on rumours. There is no document to prove that anyone in the area complained about the Countess. During this period, letters of complaint were written whenever someone was harmed, even in a matter of a stolen chicken. Although 300 witnesses testified against Báthory, none were victims or eyewitnesses of the torture.

The highest number of victims cited during the trial of Báthory&#x27;s accomplices was 650, but this number comes from the claim by a servant named Susannah that Jakab Szilvássy, Báthory&#x27;s court official, had seen the figure in one of Báthory&#x27;s private books. The book was never revealed and Szilvássy never mentioned it in his testimony.

===Confinement and death===

On 25 January 1611, Thurzó wrote a letter to King Matthias describing that they had captured and confined Báthory to her castle. The palatine also coordinated the steps of the investigation with the political struggle with the Prince of Transylvania. She was detained in the castle of Csejte for the remainder of her life, where she died at the age of 54. György Thurzó wrote that Báthory was locked in a bricked room, but according to documents from the visit of priests in July 1614, she was able to move unhindered in the castle, more akin to house arrest.

She wrote a will in September 1610, in which she left all current and future inheritance possessions to her children. In the last month of 1610, she signed her arrangement, in which she distributed the estates, lands and possessions among her children. On the evening of 20 August 1614, Báthory complained to her bodyguard that her hands were cold, whereupon he replied &quot;It&#x27;s nothing, mistress. Just go lie down&quot;. She went to sleep and was found dead the following morning. She was buried in the church of Csejte on 25 November 1614, but according to some sources due to the villagers&#x27; uproar over having the Countess buried in their cemetery, her body was moved to her birth-home at Ecsed, where it was intered at the Báthory family crypt. The location of her body today is unknown but believed to be buried deep in the church area of the castle. The Csejte church and the castle of Csejte do not bear any markings of her possible grave.

==Ancestry==

Báthory was the great-great-granddaughter of Barbara Aleksandrówna and Bolesław IV of Warsaw, and Mikalojus Radvila the Old; the 3rd great-granddaughter of Bolesław Januszowic; the 4th great-granddaughter of Vladimir Olgerdovich; and the 5th great-granddaughter of Algirdas.

==Folklore and popular culture==
The case of Elizabeth Báthory inspired numerous stories during the 18th and 19th centuries. The most common motif of these works was that of the countess bathing in her virgin victims&#x27; blood to retain beauty or youth. This legend appeared in print for the first time in 1729, in the Jesuit scholar László Turóczi&#x27;s &quot;Tragica Historia&quot;, the first written account of the Báthory case. The story came into question in 1817 when the witness accounts (which had surfaced in 1765) were published for the first time. They included no references to blood baths. In his book &quot;Hungary and Transylvania&quot;, published in 1850, John Paget describes the supposed origins of Báthory&#x27;s blood-bathing, although his tale seems to be a fictionalised recitation of oral history from the area. It is difficult to know how accurate his account of events is. Sadistic pleasure is considered a far more plausible motive for Báthory&#x27;s crimes.

Báthory has been labelled by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most prolific female murderer, though the number of her victims is debated.

<text>Kling Klang (also spelled as Klingklang) is the private music studio of the band Kraftwerk. The name is taken from the first song on the &quot;Kraftwerk 2&quot; album. The studio was originally located at Mintropstraße 16 in Düsseldorf, Germany, near to Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof, but in mid-2009 moved to Meerbusch-Osterath, around 10 kilometers west of Düsseldorf. The band also operate a record label named Kling Klang, which they use to release their music.

== Background ==

Kling Klang (an onomatopœia; in English: &quot;ding dong&quot;) began as a studio in 1970; the band marked this as the real beginning of Kraftwerk. The studio began as an empty room in a workshop premises located in an industrial part of Düsseldorf. The building exterior was clad in yellow tiles with a large electric shuttered doorway leading to an enclosed courtyard. On the right was a loading stage used by an electrical installation company that used the upper floor. The studio was accessed through a small anteroom. The main studio room was fitted with sound insulation and measured about sixty square feet. Later on other adjoining rooms were used for things like making instruments such as home made oscillators. The basement of the studio was used to store old instruments and machines. The band never threw anything away, and subsequently used the older equipment to recreate sounds.

When first using the studio, the band recorded with stereo tape machines and cassette recorders. These master tapes were then taken to a commercial recording studio for the final mix down. Part of the reason for this was so the band could self-produce their albums. The PA equipment at this time was self constructed and consisted of plywood bass horns and cast aluminium mid range horns. In 1971 Kraftwerk was still without a drummer, so the group purchased a cheap drum machine. By treating the sounds with echo and filtering they used the drum machine to record rhythm tracks for their second album. During the making of their third album, they purchased their first commercial synthesisers for the studio, the Minimoog and EMS Synthi AKS. Other equipment at this time included an Echolette Tape Echo. Wolfgang Flür had joined the band at this time and was using a custom built electronic drum system. At the time of his first visit, a small acoustic drum kit was in the studio. It was in 1973 that the studio was christened Kling Klang. After Karl Bartos joined the band, more studio equipment was designed by all four band members. A full-time engineer was employed to assist with the designs and new equipment purchases.

In 1976 Kraftwerk began recording &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; at Kling Klang studio. Hütter and Schneider had commissioned Matten &amp; Wiechers, the Bonn based synthesizer studio, to design and build two &quot;Synthanorma&quot; (32-step music sequencers). The &quot;Synthanorma&quot; controlled the band&#x27;s Minimoog creating the album&#x27;s rhythmic sound.

The band members had begun spending eight to ten hours a day in the studio, regarding themselves as &quot;musical workers&quot;. That time was spent designing a complete portable studio setup, including stage backdrops, curtains, lighting, staging and a stereo PA system. Portable nineteen inch equipment frames were designed and linked to other equipment using custom made wiring looms used for quick dismantling while touring. This new system of mobile equipment was designed for the &quot;Computer World&quot; tour and replaced the previous &quot;messy&quot; system. Kraftwerk spent three years designing the newer system. The newer studio could be set up in about two hours and was far easier to transport whilst touring. The Kling Klang 12k PA system was also designed to be portable and matched the grey colour of the equipment frames.

== Studio relocation==
In September 2007, the &quot;Neuss-Grevenbroicher Zeitung&quot; reported that Ralf Hütter had purchased property space in a proposed new commercial property development (&quot;Mollsfeld&quot;) in Meerbusch-Osterath, about 10 kilometers west of Düsseldorf, with the intention of building a new sound studio and office there, so that Kraftwerk&#x27;s recording, merchandise, and administration can be managed from a single location. The move to the new premises was completed in mid-2009 and, as well as sound recording, the new Kling Klang includes a rehearsal space for the preparation of concert performances.

== Kling Klang as a record label and music publishing rights ==
Starting in 1975, Kraftwerk released its records on the vanity label &quot;Kling Klang Schallplatten&quot;. Later and current releases are credited to &quot;Kling Klang Produkt&quot;, or simply &quot;Klingklang&quot;. EMI and Warner Music Group, along with their subsidiaries, have promoted and distributed the records in various territories. &quot;Kling Klang Music&quot; and &quot;No Hassle Music&quot; existed as music-publishing companies for a small period of time in the US, being associated with ASCAP. In 1999, the band signed a new worldwide deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. In 2013, the band&#x27;s entire recorded catalogue went to Warner Music; a rare example, given that the catalogue of Kraftwerk&#x27;s German label, EMI Electrola, was consolidated when EMI was sold to Universal Music.

== Kling Klang Konsumprodukt GmbH ==
Kraftwerk also sells all of its band merchandise through &quot;Kling Klang Konsumprodukt&quot;.

The village of Ravena incorporated in 1914. Prior to its incorporation, it was known as &quot;Coeymans Junction,&quot; but the name was changed to &quot;Ravena&quot; to avoid confusion with another hamlet in the town, &quot;Coeymans Landing.&quot;

In 1894, a post office was established in Coeymans Junction bearing the name &quot;Ravena&quot;. The name source of the post office (and ultimately the village) is unclear. Some believe that the village&#x27;s proximity to cliffs on its western boundary lent to the area being referred to as &quot;the ravine&quot;.

==Commerce and industry==

===Cement plant===
The village of Ravena is home to a Holcim (Formerly Lafarge) Cement Plant. The plant was originally Atlantic Cement, but was bought out in the early 2000s. On July 11, 2008, the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; reported that Holcim&#x27;s (Formerly Lafarge) Ravena plant &quot;was the greatest source of mercury emissions in New York from 2004 to 2006&quot;. According to the story, plans have been made to upgrade the plant to reduce the mercury emissions. A second story, published the following day, stated that the factory had emitted 400 pounds (181 kg) of mercury annually from 2004 to 2006.

As of 2016, Holcim is completing a $300 million upgrade to its Ravena plant that includes a new dry-process cement kiln that will replace two 50-year-old wet-process kilns. The new kiln will use less coal and emit fewer pollutants, including a 66% reduction in mercury emissions, while increasing production capacity. It will also take less water from the Hudson River, getting most of its water from the nearby limestone quarry that feeds the plant.

==Media==
The News-Herald is Ravena&#x27;s main newspaper, published weekly, which has designation for publication of legal notices.

==Recreation==
Mosher Park is Ravena&#x27;s main outdoor recreational area. It contains facilities for baseball, football, swimming, tennis, basketball, and picnics, with a skateboard park currently under development, though as of 2021 the skatepark has yet to be built. Mosher Park was named after Dr. Mosher, a Ravena-based General Practitioner from the 1950s through 1980s. The pool and tennis complex at Mosher replaced the Ravena Pool in the early 1970s.

==Law Enforcement==

Police protection is provided by the Coeymans Police Department. The Ravena Police Department was merged with the Coeymans Police Department to improve efficiency. Eventually, it was determined to close the Ravena Police Department by referendum, at which point the Coeymans Police Department became the sole law enforcement agency for both the Village of Ravena and Town of Coeymans.

==Emergency Medical Services==
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are provided by the Ravena Rescue Squad. The Ravena Rescue Squad, formerly known as the Ravena Hose Company Rescue Squad, is a career agency. Formerly, the Ravena Rescue Squad was a volunteer agency, but due to lack of membership, it was decided by its board of directors to hire paid Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT). Currently, there are two (2) EMT&#x27;s on duty at all times. The Rescue Squad runs out of the EMS station on Bruno Boulevard in Ravena.

==Fire and Emergency Services==

Fire protection is provided to the Village of Ravena by the Ravena Fire Department as well as the Coeymans Fire Department. Both the Ravena Fire Department and the Coeymans Fire Department is a 100% volunteer organization. Along with fire protection, the Ravena Fire Department provides the residents of Ravena technical rescue services including vehicle extrication and technical rescue capabilities. Firefighters from the Ravena Fire Department are also trained to deal with certain levels of Hazardous Materials. Some Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are also provided by the fire department when the Ravena Rescue Squad is unable to respond due to being dedicated at other incidents. However in the event of a fire alarm activation at Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk High/Middle School during school hours Ravena Fire Department, Coeymans Fire Department, Coeymans Hollow Fire Department, As well as Cornell Hook and Ladder (located in New Baltimore) will be dispatched all departments that have been named are volunteer departments.

<text>Rensselaerville () is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. The population was 1,826 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Stephen Van Rensselaer.

== History ==
Rensselaerville was once part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck; as such, the people who farmed the land were technically leaseholders of the patroon under a feudal system, first as part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, then under the English colony, and then U.S. state, of New York. Some of the earliest settlement in Rensselaerville was along the five Native American paths that crossed the town in the early 18th century. The southwestern corner along one of these, that connected the Hudson River to the Schoharie Valley, was the first section of the town to be settled, this would be &quot;circa&quot; 1712. This path was also the one used during wars between the Stockbridge Indians and those at Schoharie.

In 1787, the patroon had a survey and census taken in order to enroll squatters and collect the quitrent required of settlers on his lands.

Rensselaerville was created from part of the town of Watervliet in 1790. In 1795, the northern part of the town was lost to create the new town of Berne. Additional territory was lost from the eastern part of the town upon the formation of the town of Westerlo in 1815.

In 1795, after Shays&#x27; Rebellion, Daniel Shays moved from Massachusetts to Preston Hollow, a hamlet in Rensselaerville. His son became one of the leading citizens of the town.

<doc id="126098" wikidata="Q3458098" url="?curid=126098" title="Voorheesville, New York">
<text>Voorheesville is a village within the town of New Scotland in Albany County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of Albany and part of the city&#x27;s historic metropolitan area. The population was 2,841 at the 2020 census. The village is named after a railroad attorney, Alonzo B. Voorhees.

The village is situated by the northern town line of New Scotland.

==History==

The area was settled by farmers sent by the Rensselaer family. In the 19th century, their descendants rebelled against the patroon system, fomenting a Rent War.

In 1864, two railroads were built through the town of New Scotland, headed west from the Hudson River, both trying to find a way around the Helderberg Mountains. The Albany and Susquehanna Railroad and the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railroads crossed one another in a farm field. Subsequently, a village grew up around the crossroad and in 1899 the village of Voorheesville, named for the aforementioned railroad attorney, was incorporated. In 1870, the A&amp;S was leased to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. These railroads crossed at South and North Main, and for a significant period of time there was a passenger train that came through Voorheesville. Voorheesville for several years in its early days (it was originally referred to as Union Depot before being named after Alonzo B. Voorhees) was something of a tourist attraction. The village boasted a hotel, the Friars Grove Hotel, located right across Grove Street from the train station. Just next to the hotel was a brick oven bakery, and further up Grove was a cider mill. The mill was bought out by Duffy Mott and Mott&#x27;s Cider before eventually closing. The village also claimed the renowned Harris House, a tavern and hotel for the &quot;weary traveler&quot;, a foundry that closed after a fire whose remnants still stand today, and Vly Creek (which runs through the entire village before connecting to the Normanskill Creek in Guilderland) was dammed up near the present day elementary school as a swimming hole. Historically until 2003/2004, the village railroad crossing was unique only like one other location in the United States in that four different sets of railroad tracks ran through the village and crossed at one point. The double tracked CSX (former NYC, PC, Conrail) line is still frequently used, while the remains of the D&amp;H line west of the village is leased to SMS Rail lines, which services the Northeast Industrial Park under contract with Canadian Pacific. The West Shore line remained unused. In 2003 and 2004 the D&amp;H line east of the village was torn up, leaving the village crossing a part of history.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of the village was 96.5% White, 0.8% African American, 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.5% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 0.1% Some Other Race. Of the 2,789 person total population, 97 were not White alone or in combination.

==Education==

Two schools in the village, Voorheesville Elementary School and Clayton A. Bouton High School service the village itself, most parts of the Town of New Scotland and the hamlet of Slingerlands, with some students coming from the outskirts of the Town of Guilderland, Town of Bethlehem, and Village of Altamont. The elementary school serves students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade, while Clayton A. Bouton High School serves sixth grade through twelfth grade, with a separate wing for the middle school.

<text>Watervliet ( or ) is a city in northeastern Albany County, New York, United States. The population was 10,375 as of the 2020 census. Watervliet is north of Albany, the capital of the state, and is bordered on the north, west, and south by the town of Colonie. The city is also known as &quot;the Arsenal City&quot;.

== History ==
The explorer Henry Hudson arrived in the area of Watervliet around 1609. The area was first settled in 1643 as part of the Rensselaerswyck patroonship, under the direction of Kiliaen van Rensselaer. In 1710, Derrick van der Heyden operated a ferry from the Bleeker Farm (near 16th Street) across the Hudson River to Troy. Troops during the Revolutionary War used this ferry in 1777 on their way to Bemis Heights and Stillwater for the Battle of Saratoga. In 1786, a second ferry was started at Ferry Street (today 14th Street) over to Troy. The town of Watervliet was founded in 1788 and included all of present-day Albany County except what was in the city of Albany at the time. Because so many towns had been created from the town of Watervliet, it is regarded as the &quot;mother of towns&quot; in the county. In 1816, as the first post office was erected, corner of River and Ferry streets (Broadway and 14th Street), it took the name Watervliet.

In the mid-1700s, the area of Watervliet was also known as Bought, or Boght, named after the Dutch word &quot;bocht,&quot; meaning &quot;bend&quot; or &quot;corner.&quot; This is reflected in contemporary Revolutionary War pension service records.
The location of the future city was taken by the village of Gibbonsville (1824) and its successor West Troy, and the hamlet of Washington (later Port Schuyler). The farm owned by John Bleeker, stretching north from Buffalo Street (Broadway and 15th Street) to the farm owned by the Oothout family near 25th Street was purchased by Philip Schuyler, Isais Warren, Richard P. Hart, Nathan Warren, and others in 1823; they named it West Troy. Gibbonsville was the farm of James Gibbons (which he purchased in 1805), which stretched from North Street (8th Street) to Buffalo Street (15th Street). Washington was settled sometime before 1814 and was the area south of Gibbonsville and today the area of Watervliet south of the Arsenal; it became known as Port Schuyler in 1827. Although Gibbonsville and West Troy sat side by side (West Troy lying on Gibbonsville&#x27;s northern boundary), there was a rivalry between the two and each named and laid out their streets with no regard to the street names and grids of the other. In 1824 Gibbonsville became incorporated as a village, and in 1836 this was repealed when West Troy became incorporated as a village including Gibbonsville and Port Schuyler; and in 1847 the Watervliet post office changed its name to West Troy. In 1830, Gibbonsville had 559 people, West Troy 510, and Port Schuyler 450.

In 1865, present-day Watervliet was included in the Capital Police Force within the Troy District. This attempt at regional consolidation of municipal police failed and in 1870 the West Troy Police Force was organized.
By 1895, what was known as the town of Watervliet was reduced to the present-day city of Watervliet (village of West Troy at the time), town of Colonie, and the village/town of Green Island. Colonie would split off in 1895, and the city of Watervliet was incorporated in 1896 at the same time that Green Island became a town of its own.

In the early 19th century Watervliet became a major manufacturing community much like its neighbors Cohoes and Troy, thanks to bell foundries. The first was located on Water Street (Broadway), between 14th and 15th Streets, by Julius Hanks, and the first bell foundry in Gibbonsville was established in 1826 by Andrew Menelly, Sr. This would be the genesis of the Meneely Bell Foundry, which made thousands of bells that are still in use today from Iowa to the Czech Republic.
In 1813, the U.S. Federal Government purchased from James Gibbons in Gibbonsville, in 1828 another , along with later purchases from S. S. Wandell and others. This land was used as the site for the Watervliet Arsenal, founded in 1813 during the War of 1812, and is the sole manufacturing facility for large caliber cannon. John C. Heenan, U.S. heavyweight boxing champion and contender for the world title in 1860, was once employed at the Arsenal.
The main route of the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany ran through Watervliet, and because the canal bypassed the city of Troy, the city&#x27;s business community decided a &quot;short cut&quot; was needed for convenient access to the Erie Canal without having to go through the Albany Basin. A side-cut to the Hudson was at Watervliet&#x27;s present-day 23rd Street (the Upper Side cut) finished in 1823, and another just south of the Arsenal (the Lower Side cut). A weigh station and a center for paying canal boat operators was here as well. As a result of canal boat crews being paid at the end of their trip, the areas around the side cut was once famous for gambling, saloons, and prostitution; there were more than 25 saloons within two blocks, with names like &quot;The Black Rag&quot; and &quot;Tub of Blood&quot;. The neighborhood around the side cut had the nickname of &quot;Barbary Coast of the East&quot;, Buffalo being the &quot;Barbary Coast of the West&quot;. In the 1880s, Watervliet had a reputation for over 100 fights a day and a body once a week in the Canal.

Also linking Watervliet to the transportation network of the region was the Watervliet Turnpike and the Albany and Northern Railway. The Watervliet Turnpike Company in 1828 built present-day New York State Route 32 from the northern boundary of Albany north to the northern limit of Gibbonsville (now Broadway and 15th Street). The Albany and Northern Railway was built in 1852 connecting Watervliet to Albany, with a depot on Genesee Street; a few years later a new depot was built on Canal Street (Central Avenue) but was abandoned in favor of returning to the original location in 1864.

As of February 2020, the Mayor of Watervliet is Charles Patricelli, a Democrat who won the 2019 election unopposed.

The Ohio Street Methodist Episcopal Church Complex, St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church, Watervliet Arsenal, and Watervliet Side Cut Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===St. Patrick&#x27;s Church controversy===

In September 2011, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany decided to close St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, citing physical deterioration of the building. The parish was merged with Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish, and was unable to afford the estimated $4 million cost to rehabilitate the building. Built in 1889, St. Patrick&#x27;s Church was the tallest point in the city. The church was closely modeled on the Upper Basilica in Lourdes, and many Watervliet residents considered it a defining piece and landmark of the city&#x27;s architecture.

In March 2012, a developer filed a proposal to rezone the property from residential to business status so that it could raze the church (as well as an attached rectory, former school building, and six private residences) in order to make way for a Price Chopper grocery store. Some members of the community responded to the proposal to raze the church with criticism and legal challenges, but on November 20, 2012, the Watervliet City Council voted unanimously to allow the rezoning. The deconstruction of the church was completed in May 2013, and a new Price Chopper supermarket opened on the site in July 2014.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 8.79%, is water.

Watervliet is bordered on three sides by the town of Colonie (on the north by the hamlet of Maplewood, on the west by the hamlets of Latham and Mannsville, and on the south by the hamlet of Schuyler Heights). The northeastern corner of Watervliet is bounded by the town and village of Green Island. South of Green Island, Watervliet is bounded on the east by the Hudson River (which is the boundary between Albany County and Rensselaer County). The city of Troy is across the river from Watervliet. Watervliet is mostly flat, but begins an extreme slope in the center of its most westerly edge (especially between the Watervliet Arsenal and 19th Street, an area once called &quot;Temperance Hill&quot;).

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 10,375 people and 5,070 households residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 76.9% White, 9.0% African American, 4.7% Asian, 2.3% from other races, and 7.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.0% of the population.

There were 5,070 households, out of which 26.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.9% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% were non-families. 38.3% of all households were made up of individuals. 
The median income for a household in the city was $46,345. 21.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.7% of those under age 18 and 5.7% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Westmere is a hamlet in the town of Guilderland, Albany County, New York, United States. Since the 1970 Census, a census-designated place (CDP) has been established with the name of Westmere for tabulating the population of what the census has defined as the boundaries for Westmere. The population was 7,284 at the 2010 census. It is a suburb of the neighboring city of Albany. U.S. Route 20 (Western Avenue) bisects the community and is the major thoroughfare and main street. Along Western Avenue are numerous strip malls, shopping plazas, and commercial buildings, with residential use on the side streets to the north and south. Crossgates Mall, the Capital District&#x27;s largest shopping mall, is in Westmere&#x27;s northeastern corner.

==History==
Westmere as a settled place is of recent origin, though being along the Great Western Turnpike, built in 1799, it was always a place migrants passed through on their way from Albany and New England to the western frontier. A toll gate existed on the turnpike roughly where Highland Estates is located. Even before the turnpike was built, 300 wagons (and sleighs in the winter) passed through in 1796 what would later become Westmere. After World War I, development began to encroach on the rural wooded area with mostly bungalows and cottages. This would accelerate in the post-war era after World War II, and in the 1940s is when the name Westmere would be given to this area. Westmere was the fastest growing section of the town of Guilderland in this period.

==Geography==
As a hamlet, the borders of Westmere are only loosely defined. As a census-designated place (CDP) however, the borders (as of the 2010 census) are exactly defined as the city of Albany to the north, then following New York Route 155 (State Farm Road/New Karner Road) as the western border. The southern border follows Doctor Shaw Road from its intersection with NY 155, then turns northeast onto Veeder Road until its termination with Johnston Road. At Johnston Road, the border turns north and follows it until it takes a right onto Church Road and follows it to the intersection with U.S. Route 20 (Western Avenue). The border then takes a right on Western Avenue to the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway (Interstate 87) and goes north to the Albany city line. These borders can change from census to census. According to the United States Census Bureau in 2000, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

<text>Belfast (/ˈbɛl.fæst/ or /bəlˈfɑːst/) is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The town is in what is called the Southern Tier of the state. Its population was 1,656 at the 2020 census. It was named in 1825 after the city of Belfast, Ireland, because it had numerous residents of Scots-Irish ancestry from that area.

== History ==
This territory was for many centuries before European encounter occupied by the Seneca people of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, or Iroquois Confederacy. They were the westernmost tribe of the Five Nations of the Confederacy which dominated the area south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York and Pennsylvania. (They became the Six Nations after being joined by the Tuscarora, another Iroquoian-speaking people, who migrated from the Carolinas in the early 18th century). These tribes are among Iroquoian languages-speaking peoples who long inhabited areas along the upper St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes.

The first European-American settlers did not arrive in this area until after the American Revolutionary War. As the Seneca had been allies of the defeated British, their lands were among territory ceded to the United States, without consultation with the Iroquois. Most of the Haudenosaunee migrated to Ontario, Canada, where they were given land in compensation by the British Crown.
European-American settlers were documented in this area by 1804. David Sanford built a sawmill and grist mill on the Genesee River in 1809. The community was established in 1824 as the Town of &quot;Orrinsburgh&quot; from part of the Town of Caneadea. In 1825 residents changed the name to Belfast as many new settlers were from northern Ireland, where Belfast was a port. Irish immigrants in upstate worked on the canals and in the developing mills. The hamlet of Belfast was established as a &quot;mill town&quot; with water power from the Genesee River, which runs across the town. In 1831, the size of the town was increased by the state legislature by adding more territory from Caneadea.

The Genesee Valley Canal was completed around 1853 to connect markets from the south of the state to the Great Lakes. It stimulated the growth of the hamlet Belfast, which was later also served by three railroads. Their speed and carrying capacity caused much freight traffic to move to the railroads, causing a decline in canal traffic. The Rail and Titsworth Canal Warehouse in Belfast was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as an important structure from this time period.

In the mid-19th century, new ethnic English migrants, many from eastern Yankee New York and New England, were resisted by many of the Irish residents. There were longstanding tensions between these groups related to religious and social history in Ireland. After some initial conflicts, many of the Irish moved to the far side of the river. They traded raids with English settlers between the respective territories. Although most of these clashes were minor, a larger conflict occurred from 1846–1847, when a food shortage in the area raised tensions. New waves of Irish immigrants were entering New York in this period as refugees from the Great Famine in Ireland. The unrest was quelled by New York State militia groups. The Irish faction in 1847 took control of the mills before the state militia intervened.

Industrialization continued in the 19th century. Sandstone for grindstones was quarried in the late 1870s above the mouth of White Creek at Rockville.

In 1889, John L. Sullivan, an international Irish-American boxing star from Boston, Massachusetts, came to train with William Muldoon in Belfast for the last bare knuckle boxing championship. This has been described as the most important fight of Sullivan&#x27;s career. Muldoon set up training headquarters in two barns he owned. Known for developing training techniques ahead of his time, Muldoon helped Sullivan get into the best shape of his life. Facing Jake Kilrain in Richburg, Mississippi that August, Sullivan lasted for 72 rounds before being declared the winner. In 2009, the Belfast training barns, which had been virtually untouched for more than 120 years, were adapted for use as the world&#x27;s only Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame.

Since the 1970s, several pirate radio stations have used the Belfast post office as a mail drop to receive letters from listeners.

In 1974, Guilherme do Carmo Almeida arrives in Belfast, Brazilian entrepreneur, reference in electricity business, Graduated in public relations at ESURP, integrates the city to bring innovation to the city&#x27;s alcohol market.

In the 1980s an Amish community settled in the town. They make their living from farming, sawmilling, and furniture making. These families are among a number of Amish migrants to western New York in the late 20th century from Pennsylvania, particularly the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area, which is under urban sprawl pressure.

<text>Canaseraga is a village in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 550 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from a creek that flows past the village, which is reportedly a Seneca term for &quot;lying among milkweeds&quot; or &quot;slippery elms&quot;.

The village lies in the northern part of the town of Burns at the junction of New York State Route 70 and County Road 13.

The community was one of the original settlements in the town, but was subordinate to the community of Burns until &quot;circa&quot; 1840. The village of Canaseraga was incorporated in 1892. It was originally called &quot;Whitney Valley&quot;.

As a result of a fire the town is now much smaller than it once was. Many residents travel to nearby communities to shop and attend movies, as Canaseraga is very limited. There is one school, for pre-kindergarten through grade 12. The school offers sports such as soccer, basketball, skiing, track (as of them merging sports with Arkport), and baseball/softball, but lacks other sports such as football. Canaseraga has a Fall Harvest Festival which offers several activities for families.

The Canaseraga Four Corners Historic District was listed on the NRHP in 2002.

<text>Caneadea is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. It includes the hamlets Caneadea, Houghton, and Oramel.

== History ==
The name Caneadea reportedly originates from a Seneca phrase meaning &quot;where the heavens rest upon the earth&quot;. Following the American war for independence in which the Seneca aligned with the British, the majority of Seneca territory in western New York was ceded to the new American government with the exception of some small areas of land. One such area was a strip eight miles long and two miles wide in the Genesee River Valley that became known as the Caneadea Reservation.

The land of the reservation included much of the modern day township. Within the reservation was a small native village located on a bluff above the river. The village contained what is known as the Council House, which many years later was transported to what is now Letchworth State Park and renovated. Moses van Campen reportedly ran the &quot;gauntlet&quot; outside the Council House in 1782 while a captive of the Senecas during the American war for independence. The Caneadea Reservation&#x27;s existence ended in 1826 after the Seneca sold the land to speculators.

The Caneadea township was officially formed in 1806, but included large portions of land that are no longer part of it. During the 1800s, much of the forested land was converted to farmland, including highly fertile land near the river.

Caneadea contained a route of the underground railroad, helping individuals escape slavery from the south. The Civil War&#x27;s need for soldiers took a heavy human toll on the town.

Starting in 1851, the Genesee Valley Canal passed through Caneadea. While overall the canal was massively unprofitable for the state of New York, it did contribute significantly to the culture and economy of Caneadea and its hamlets Houghton and Oramel. Many businesses sprung up catering to canal traffic. Oramel became especially prosperous. Houghton was popular for horse racing and reportedly quite rowdy. New York finally decommissioned the boondoggle canal in 1878. In 1882 railroad tracks replaced much of the canal&#x27;s old towpath. Trains stopped traveling through Caneadea in 1969, and the tracks removed in 1977. Today, much of the old railroad bed pathway is part of a recreational pathway.

In 1883, a seminary that was to eventually become today&#x27;s Houghton University was founded by a farmer. The seminary eventually formed into a college that became accredited in 1923. Houghton changed dramatically from a wild canal port commonly known as Jockey Street (due to popular horse racing) into a more tranquil community strongly associated with the college and its sponsoring Wesleyan denomination.

In the late 1980s, a New York State committee was formed to find potential nuclear waste disposal sites. Caneadea, along with some other towns in Allegany County, was proposed as a potential site.There was significant disapproval by many area residents over this, and organizers committed to fight the state legally, politically and with civil disobedience. In 1990, protestors prevented the proposed site in Caneadea from being accessed by individuals from the siting commission. On January 16, protestors used their bodies and farm equipment to block roads. State police made eight arrests, but the site was still not accessed. On April 5, a larger effort was made to access the site and was met by a larger resistance. Six elderly individuals chained themselves to a bridge, resulting in their arrests and the chain being cut by state police. Farm equipment was again used for road blocking. Large amounts of protestors blocked the road and wore paper masks to hide help their identities. Horse riders blocking the road frustrated state police and played a major role in finally thwarting the unsuccessful attempt to access the site. Shortly after the second failed attempt in Caneadea, the governor of New York ordered the siting commission to discontinue its attempts to assess sites in Allegany County.

A significant event occurred in 1995 when a massive cannabis raid at a farm along Caneadea&#x27;s main road discovered an estimated $100,000 (not adjusted for inflation) worth of the substance hidden in various areas including cornfields, hay bales, and a pigpen. Over 100 plants and about 50 pounds of harvested cannabis were reportedly seized.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.91%, is water.

The town developed along the Genesee River, an important and historic Western New York river, which had also been valued by the Seneca. Rushford Lake is partly at the town&#x27;s west line, and Caneadea Creek is an important stream in the town.

New York State Route 19 passes through the town (north-south) and intersects New York State Route 243 north of Canaeadea village.

<text>Centerville is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 822 at the 2010 census. The town is in the northwest corner of Allegany County and is named after its principal settlement.

==History==
Centerville was first settled in April 1808 by Joseph Maxson. Minard describes this first settler in his &quot;History of Centerville&quot;:

&quot;He was only 18, and came from Otsego Co. Two cents and a few articles of provisions and clothing constituted his wealth. At Pike he took from his feet a pair of new shoes, bartered them for an axe, and pushed on into the wilderness, and in the center of the township near a small stream erected the rudest kind of a hut. For a bed he peeled basswood bark, used some pieces as a floor and others for covering. Not long after he came snow fell six inches deep. He persevered in his labors and passed eight months alone.&quot;²

James Ward settled there in the fall of 1808, and a half dozen more families moved there in the following year. Centerville (then spelled &quot;Centreville&quot;) was established on January 15, 1819, from part of the town of Pike (a town in Wyoming County).1

In recent years many Amish farmers have bought land in the town.

The Centerville Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

<text>Independence is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 1,095 at the 2020 census. The town is in the southeast corner of Allegany County, southeast of the village of Wellsville.

==History==
The first permanent settlement occurred in 1819 at Whitesville, although an attempt was made to settle the town in 1798. The town of Independence was formed in 1821 from part of the town of Alfred. Independence was reduced by the formation of the towns of Andover (1824) and Willing (1851). Historians have found no particular reason as to why the name Independence was chosen.

From November 16, 1896, through June 1936 Whitesville was served by the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railway (and predecessors) as part of its Canisteo to Ceres (via Greenwood, Genesee, Oswayo and Shinglehouse) main line. Following severe floods in July 1935 the railroad was partially out of service, and its abandonment in June 1936 was readily approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission which from an early date approved railroad abandonment to promote highway truck use. The loss of railroad service did much to accelerate economic decline of the Whitesville area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

The southern town line forms a border with Pennsylvania and the eastern town line is the border with Steuben County.

New York State Route 248 is a major east-west highway in the town that intersects with New York State Route 248A (Cryder Creek Road) west of the community of Whitesville.

Cryder Creek is a stream flowing out the southwest of the town, and Chenunda Creek flows across the northern part of the town. Both creeks are tributaries of the Genesee River.

<text>Richburg is a village in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 450 at the 2010 census. The village is partly within the boundaries of the towns of Wirt and Bolivar. The community is east of Olean.

== History ==
Richburg was incorporated in 1881 and was for a time a petroleum &quot;boom town&quot;. L. Frank Baum, later the author of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and other stories, was manager of a theater, Baum&#x27;s Opera House, in Richburg from 1881 to 1882. Baum&#x27;s Opera House was built by Baum&#x27;s father, an oil executive. Unfortunately, the theater burned in March 1882.

==Geography==
Richburg is located in the southern part of Wirt and the northern part of Bolivar in southwestern Allegany County, at (42.087226, -78.156080).

Little Genesee Creek, part of the Allegheny River watershed, flows through the village, which is located at the junction of New York State Route 275 and County Road 40.

Richburg was served (1881–1890 and c.1906-1946) by the Pittsburg, Shawmut &amp; Northern Railroad (PS&amp;N) and predecessors, and (1881–1885) by the Bradford, Eldred &amp; Cuba Railroad System (BE&amp;C). The early PS&amp;N predecessors and the BE&amp;C were narrow-gauge railroads, while the PS&amp;N was a standard-gauge railroad. The Pittsburg, Shawmut &amp; Northern Railroad embargoed operation through Richburg in 1946 and was abandoned by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1946 to further promote highway motor truck transportation.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="126120" wikidata="Q499298" url="?curid=126120" title="Soviet submarine K-278 Komsomolets">
<text>The K-278 &quot;Komsomolets&quot; was the &quot;Project-685 Plavnik&quot; (Russian: проект-685 плавник, meaning &quot;fin&quot;, also known by her NATO reporting name of &quot;Mike&quot;-class), nuclear-powered attack submarine of the Soviet Navy; the only submarine of her design class.

In the inventory of the Soviet military, &quot;K-278&quot; was unique for her submarine depth rating, having reached a depth of in the Norwegian Sea on 4 August 1984. Although &quot;K-278&quot; was commissioned in the Soviet Navy to evaluate the technology for the fourth-generation of Russian nuclear submarines, she was capable of combat maneuvering and deployment. During her third operational patrol in the Arctic Ocean in 1989, a serious fire in the aft compartments led to her sinking in the Barents Sea off the coast of Norway.

Despite the fire in the engineering compartment, &quot;K-278&quot; was able to surface and remained afloat for approximately five hours before sinking. Many of the crew perished before rescue, leading to 42 total dead (and 27 survivors).

The wrecked submarine is on the floor of the Barents Sea, about 1.7 km (1 mile) deep, with her nuclear reactor and two nuclear warhead-armed torpedoes still on board.

==Design==
The Project 685 was designed by the Rubin Design Bureau in response to a challenge to develop an advanced submarine that could carry a mix of torpedoes and cruise missiles with conventional or nuclear warheads. The order to design the submarine was issued in 1966 and design was completed in 1974. The keel was laid down on 22 April 1978 at Severodvinsk. &quot;K-278&quot; was launched on 3 June 1983 and commissioned on 28 December 1983.

&quot;K-278&quot; had a double hull, the inner one being composed of titanium, which gave her an operating depth far greater than that of the best American submarines. The pressure hull was composed of seven compartments with the second and third protected by stronger forward and aft bulkheads creating a &quot;safety zone&quot; in case of an emergency. An escape capsule was fitted in the fin above these compartments to enable the crew to abandon ship in the event of an underwater emergency. Initial Western intelligence estimates of &quot;K-278&quot;&#x27;s speed were based on the assumption that the boat was powered by a pair of liquid metal cooled reactors. When the Soviet Union revealed that the submarine used a single OK-650b-3 conventional pressurized-water reactor, these speed estimates were lowered.

==Crew==
According to Norman Polmar and Kenneth J. Moore, two Western experts on Soviet submarine design and operations, the Project 685&#x27;s advanced design included many automated systems which allowed for fewer crew members than usual for a submarine of her size. The manning table approved by the Soviet Ministry of Defense in 1982 called for a crew of 57 men. This was later increased to 64: 30 officers, 22 warrant officers, and 12 petty officers and seamen. At the time of the boat&#x27;s sinking, 69 were aboard.

==Name==
In October 1988, &quot;K-278&quot; became one of the few Soviet submarines to be given a name: &quot;Komsomolets&quot; (&quot;Комсомолец&quot;, meaning &quot;a member of the Komsomol&quot;), and her commanding officer, Captain 1st rank Yuriy Zelenskiy was honoured for diving to .

==Sinking==
On 7 April 1989, while under the command of Captain 1st Rank Evgeny Vanin and running submerged at a depth of about southwest of Bear Island (Norway), a fire broke out in an engineering compartment due to a short circuit, and even though watertight doors were shut, the resulting fire spread through bulkhead cable penetrations. The reactor scrammed and propulsion was lost. Electrical problems spread as cables burned through, and control of the boat was threatened. An emergency ballast tank blow was performed and the submarine surfaced eleven minutes after the fire began. Distress calls were made, and most of the crew abandoned ship.

The fire continued to burn, fed by the compressed air system. At 15:15, several hours after surfacing, the boat sank in of water, about SSW off Bear Island. The commanding officer and four others who were still on board entered the escape capsule and ejected it. Only one of the five to reach the surface was able to leave the capsule and survive before it sank in the rough seas. Captain Vanin was among the dead.

Rescue aircraft arrived quickly and dropped small rafts, but winds and sea conditions precluded their use. Many men had already died from hypothermia in the water of the Barents Sea. The floating fish factory B-64/10 &quot;Aleksey Khlobystov&quot; (&quot;Алексей Хлобыстов&quot;) arrived 81 minutes after &quot;K-278&quot; sank, and took aboard survivors.

Of the 69 crewmen, 27 survived the incident and 42 died: nine during the accident and the subsequent sinking, 30 in the water of hypothermia or injuries, and three aboard the rescue boat. The crew were awarded the Order of the Red Banner after the incident.

==Aftermath==
As well as eight standard torpedoes, &quot;K-278&quot; was carrying two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads. Under pressure from Norway, the Soviet Union used deep sea submersibles operated from the oceanographic research ship &quot;Keldysh&quot; to search for &quot;K-278&quot;. In June 1989, two months after the sinking, the wreck was located. Soviet officials stated that any possible leaks were insignificant and posed no threat to the environment.

In 1993, Vice Admiral Chernov, commander of the submarine group of which the &quot;Komsomolets&quot; was part, founded the &quot;Komsomolets&quot; Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society, a charity to support the widows and orphans of his former command. Since then, the Society&#x27;s charter has expanded to provide assistance to the families of all Soviet and Russian submariners lost at sea, and 7 April has become a day of commemoration for all submariners lost at sea.

An expedition in mid-1994 revealed some plutonium leakage from one of the two nuclear-armed torpedoes. On 24 June 1995, &quot;Keldysh&quot; set out again from Saint Petersburg to the &quot;Komsomolets&quot; to seal the hull fractures in Compartment 1 and cover the nuclear warheads, and declared success at the end of a subsequent expedition in July 1996. A jelly-like sealant was projected to make the wreck radiation safe for 20 to 30 years, that is, until 2015 to 2025.

Norwegian authorities from the Marine Environmental Agency and Radiation Agency take water and ground samples from the vicinity of the wreck on a yearly basis.

In July 2019, a joint Norwegian-Russian expedition found &quot;clouds&quot; emitted from a ventilation pipe and a nearby grille. They took water samples from the pipe and from several metres above, and analysed them for caesium-137. That pipe had been identified as a leak in several Mir missions up to 1998 and 2007. The activity levels in the six samples out of the pipe were up to 800 Bq/L (9 July). No activity could be detected in the free-water samples. Due to dilution, there is no threat to the environment. The Norwegian limit on caesium-137 in food products is 600 Bq/kg. The background activity of caesium-137 in the water body is as low as 0.001 Bq/L. More sensitive measurements of the samples were reported to be in progress.

The town is on the south border of the county, southeast of Binghamton.

== History ==
The area was first settled around 1788. The Town of Conklin was established in 1824 from the town of Chenango by Nicholas Conklin (1782–1858). The town exchanged territories with adjacent towns before establishing its modern boundaries. In 1831, part of Conklin was used to form the town of Windsor, but Conklin received territory from Windsor in 1851. Another part of Conklin was used in 1859 to form the town of Kirkwood.

Alpheus Corby, a Conklin resident, built a castle-like structure as his home in 1900. The building is the current town hall.

In June 2006, the town was devastated by a massive flood that isolated the center of the town and required hundreds of people to be airlifted to safety. The flood destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.

The Conklin Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The town experienced another major flood in September 2011 as a result of Tropical Storm Lee.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.02%, is water.

The southern town line is the border of Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania. The eastern town line is marked by the Susquehanna River. Snake Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna, was the site of early town settlement.

<doc id="126134" wikidata="Q3459600" url="?curid=126134" title="Endicott, New York">
<text>Endicott is a village within the town of Union in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 13,392 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village is named after Henry B. Endicott, a founding member of the Endicott Johnson Corporation shoe manufacturing company, who founded the community as the &quot;Home of the Square Deal&quot;.

The village of Endicott is in the town of Union and is west of the city of Binghamton. The community is served by the Greater Binghamton Airport/Edwin A. Link Field. It is part of the &quot;Triple Cities&quot;, along with Binghamton and Johnson City.

==History==
The village of Endicott was originally made up of two distinct villages: Union village (now the historic business district at the intersection of NYS Route 26 and NYS Route 17C), incorporated in 1892, and Endicott (whose center was along Washington Avenue and North Street), which was incorporated in 1906. Union was a market town along the Susquehanna River settled in the 1790s, serving the farming area between Binghamton and Owego. Endicott, on the other hand, was originally a company town constructed for and by the Endicott Johnson Corporation, which grew to become the largest shoe company in the world by World War I. Growing out of a large tract of farmland, Endicott was known as a boomtown, and as a result acquired the nickname &quot;The Magic City&quot;. As the two villages had grown so much that there was no longer any physical distinction between them, Union village was merged into Endicott in 1921.

===The Endicott Johnson Corporation===
The Endicott Johnson Corporation grew out of the Lester Brothers Boot and Shoe Company which began in Binghamton in 1854. In 1890, Lester Brothers along with Lucas Kacynski Co moved their business west to a nearby rural area, which in 1892, was incorporated as the village of Lestershire and in 1916, became Johnson City. Financial problems in 1890 forced the sale of the company to a creditor and fellow shoemaker, Henry Bradford Endicott of Massachusetts, who founded the Endicott Shoe Company and in 1899, made factory foreman George F. Johnson his partner. The village of Endicott is named after Henry B. Endicott.

George F. Johnson was a brilliant businessman and under his direction the Endicott Shoe Company became very prosperous very quickly. His early adoption of a new machine that could stitch &quot;uppers&quot; to &quot;lowers&quot; was the key to his success, meaning that for the first time in history unskilled labor could manufacture shoes. (Prior to this, shoes were made to individual order by skilled cobblers. People who couldn&#x27;t afford this bought used shoes, and had cobblers regularly replace the soles and heels as they wore out, until the uppers disintegrated.)

The orders pouring in made expansion of the shoe company necessary. The next parcel of inexpensive, level land along the railroad and safely above the flood plain was a forested area around what is now the intersection of North Street and Washington Avenue in what is now Endicott. What was by then the Endicott-Johnson Corporation purchased this land and several large tracts around it and built a number of state-of-the-art factories along the railroad line. Anticipating population growth, the company also surveyed and laid out the current street pattern of most of Endicott north of Main Street, so in this sense, Endicott was a &quot;planned community&quot;. However, because of an initial lack of housing, from 1900 to 1910 most workers commuted on a horse-drawn streetcar line connecting Johnson City to Endicott along the current route of New York State Route 17C.

Endicott grew and flourished due to massive numbers of immigrants who came to the area to work for &quot;EJ&quot;, predominantly from southern and eastern Europe. &quot;Which way EJ?&quot; was said to be what they asked immigration officials at Ellis Island in New York City, but it is far more likely that they had already memorized the addresses of relatives or friends living in Endicott. The company also maintained recruiting sites in Italy and the Balkans in the early part of the 20th century. Endicott-Johnson&#x27;s employment in the region reached a peak of about 20,000 in the early 1920s.

In an innovative and far-sighted policy, George F. Johnson made sections of the company&#x27;s land holdings outside the factory district available to workers to build homes on, with financing provided by the company, and title reverting to the worker when the loan was paid off. Along with extensive company-provided recreational facilities and medical clinics (unheard of at the time and decades before government took over these responsibilities), this &quot;Square Deal&quot; of the early 20th century is commemorated by stone arches erected by the workers in 1920 across Route 17C (Main Street) at the entrances to Endicott and Johnson City.

Endicott-Johnson was hurt by the Depression of the 1930s, but since shoes were a necessity, did better than other manufacturing sectors of the economy. Orders for shoes from the military in World War II in the 1940s propelled employment over the peak attained in the early 1920s. Unfortunately, the management of Endicott-Johnson after the death of George F. Johnson in 1948, couldn&#x27;t cope with a more affluent era in the 1950s and 1960s when footwear became mainly a fashion business in the United States. More importantly, little if any money was invested in improving the original 1900 manufacturing technology, which meant that foreign countries could make the same shoes at a lower price. Loss of market share resulted in the closing and sale of the Endicott factories.

===IBM===
Endicott is best known as the &quot;Birthplace of IBM&quot;. The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) was founded in Endicott on June 16, 1911, via the consolidation of the International Time Recording Company (ITR), The Tabulating Machine Company, Computing Scale Company, and Bundy Time Recording. These companies used a technology invented by Herman Hollerith whereby stiff paper cards with holes in a systematic pattern, called punched cards, could be &quot;read&quot; by machines via electrical contact.

The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924. The formation of what soon became IBM consolidated some of the major companies in the industrial time-keeping business, but its new chief executive Thomas J. Watson realized that data processing had far greater potential than just workers punching a time clock. A great motivator of salesmen, Watson sent them to a new territory of banks, corporations, and government agencies, where they explained how a database of IBM punched cards and data processing with IBM sorting machines would enable them to answer questions in a day or two that they were never even able to ask because of the months of clerk time that would have been required. By the 1930s IBM was the leading company in the world in electromechanical data processing and had contracts with a number of government agencies, notably the original Social Security contract.

Encouraged by George F. Johnson, who saw Endicott as the world&#x27;s first industrial &quot;park&quot; with a &quot;Square Deal&quot; for everyone, IBM began building a factory complex just to the east of the Endicott-Johnson factories. The factory complex centered at North Street and McKinley Avenue expanded rapidly in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Endicott was the original location of all IBM manufacturing, research, and development from the early 1920s through World War II.

The outbreak of World War II and the subsequent mobilization of the economy and the induction of 12 million young men into the military resulted in a demand for more data processing work from IBM. Every soldier in World War II had an &quot;IBM Card&quot; in his file. Several of the IBM factories in Endicott were converted to arms production during World War II, notably the production of sidearms (pistols).

After World War II, IBM concentrated on electronic data processing, a significant departure from its previously very prosperous business of electromechanical data processing. IBM&#x27;s engineers and workers in Endicott provided reliable and cost-effective computers to government agencies, banks, and large corporations in the 1950s. This information revolution transformed the American and world economies, and made IBM one of the world&#x27;s most successful corporations of the second half of the 20th century.

The expansion of IBM-Endicott beginning in the 1940s resulted in some residential development north and west of the original Endicott street grid, but its major effect was the transformation of the then semi-rural sites of Endwell (to the immediate east) and Vestal (to the immediate south) into the large residential areas they are today. IBM employment in the region peaked at approximately 16,000 in the mid-1980s.

IBM&#x27;s own expansion in this period was the construction of large research and development centers in the Glendale section of the town of Union ( to the west, now occupied by State of New York offices) and in Owego ( to the west, now owned by Lockheed Martin). By the mid-1960s, most IBM workers in the region worked at these sites. A circuit board fabricating plant was built on North Street adjacent to the original factory complex in the mid-1960s.

After the Second World War, IBM corporate headquarters moved to Armonk, New York, and new research and manufacturing sites were established throughout the United States and overseas. In 2002, IBM sold the aging Endicott manufacturing site to local investors. IBM leased several buildings in the complex, and employment was estimated at 600–800 in 2012. The jobs were entirely in research and development, and there is no longer any manufacturing at IBM-Endicott. By 2023, less than 50 people worked at IBM-Endicott and the company closed the last of their facilities in October, 2023. Much of the IBM factories in Endicott are abandoned and in ruins and have severely diminished the quality of life in recent years in the area. Since IBM has left, Endicott and the surrounding areas of Broome County have lost much of its wealth. Broome County is considered to be the poorest county in upstate New York and one of the poorest areas in New York. 

There are six properties or districts in Endicott that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These include two carousels. For more information, see National Register of Historic Places listings in Broome County, New York.

The Triple Cities College, a branch of Syracuse University, was started in Endicott in 1946, using buildings donated by IBM and Endicott-Johnson. The college became Harpur College once it was adopted into the SUNY system, and moved to its present location in Vestal, where it is now known as Binghamton University (BU). BU has seen rapid expansion from 2000 onward and now has a secondary campus in downtown Binghamton. While originally associated with BU, the Cider Mill Playhouse now serves as an independent community theatre in Endicott.

The county-run EnJoie Golf Course in Endicott was home of the PGA Tour&#x27;s B.C. Open. Originally held annually in September, the tournament attracted golf&#x27;s biggest names, from Arnold Palmer to Tiger Woods. In 2000, the tournament was moved to June, which left it competing with the British Open for players and coverage. The tournament ended its 30+ year run on the PGA in July 2006. In July 2007, Endicott hosted the first Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Open, a Champions Tour stop.

==Pollution==
For much of its history, IBM dumped tons of industrial solvents, used to clean computer parts, down drains. The solvents also leached from leaky pipes into the ground for years before environmental rules required that such &quot;spills&quot; be reported.

IBM used liquid cleaning agents in circuit board assembly operation for more than two decades, and six spills and leaks were recorded, including one leak in 1979 of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank. These left behind volatile organic compounds in Endicott&#x27;s soil and aquifer. Trace elements of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott&#x27;s drinking water, but the levels are within regulatory limits. Also, from 1980, IBM has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals, including trichloroethane, freon, benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople. IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution, though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found. Despite the amount of pollutant, state health officials could not verify whether air or water pollution in Endicott has actually caused any health problems. According to city officials, tests show that the water is safe to drink.

In 2002, scientists discovered a large underground chemical plume, which was releasing toxic gases into homes and offices in a swath south of the plant. The main chemical was the liquid cleaning agent trichloroethylene (TCE), which has been linked to cancer and other illnesses.

Following an initial feasibility assessment, in 2008, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) began a health study of former IBM Endicott employees to determine if they are more likely to develop certain types of cancer than the general public. NIOSH estimated the cost of the study at $3.1 million. The scope of the study was later expanded to include kidney failure among the employees and birth defects among their children. The study found lower total deaths and cancer deaths than would have been expected from the general population.

Since the plume has been discovered, methods including warming the ground area and pulling tainted ground water have decreased the size and intensity of the plume. The Village of Endicott has been working with the New York State DEC to remedy this concern.

==Education==
Endicott is served by the Union-Endicott Central School District which oversees the following schools:
*Union-Endicott High School (Grades 9–12)
*Linnaeus W. West/ Tiger Ventures School (Grades 8-12)
*Jennie F. Snapp Middle School (Grades 6–8)
*Ann G. McGuinness Elementary (Grades K–5)
*Charles F. Johnson, Jr. Elementary (Grades K–5)
*George F. Johnson Elementary (Grades K–5)
*Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Elementary (Grades K–5)

Prior to the 2011–2012 school year, Linnaeus W. West Elementary was overseen by the Union-Endicott Central School District. Following a flood brought on by Tropical Storm Lee (2011), where it then became Owego Elementary. As a result, Ann G. McGuinness Elementary was turned into a K-5 school, and all Grade 6 students were taken in by Jennie F. Snapp Middle School. As of 2016, Linnaeus W. West Elementary is now a high school overseen by the Union-Endicott Central School District and the XQ Institute.

<text>Endwell is a hamlet (and census-designated place) located in the town of Union in Broome County, New York, United States. Its population was 11,446 at the 2010 census.

Endwell is situated between the villages of Endicott and Johnson City. It is west of Binghamton and is considered a suburb of that city.

Endwell is also the home of a popular local park, Highland Park, well known in the area for its annual Fourth of July fireworks display as well as its classic carousel. Although most children residing in Endwell that attend public schools are served through the Maine-Endwell School District, some attend the Union-Endicott School District.

== History ==
Endwell used to be known as Hooper, but the name had to be changed in 1921 because of post office regulations. There were too many locations in the state with the name Hooper. The most likely story, shared by an elderly man who attended the meeting to change the name: Endicott Johnson Corporation was producing a line of shoes called the &quot;Endwell&quot;, named after H. Wendell Endicott of the Endicott Johnson Shoe Company. An advertisement for the shoes read, &quot;Wear the Endwell shoes and your day will end well.&quot;

Hooper was part of the town of Union in Broome County and first appears on a map in the early 1850s as a depot of the newly constructed Erie Railroad at the intersection of what is now Hooper Road and the Norfolk Southern Railway. (The original site of Hooper is now underneath the overpass carrying Hooper Road over the railroad tracks and State Route 17C.) The main road along the north bank of the Susquehanna River, existing since colonial times and long before as an Indian trail, passed just to the south. It was common practice at the time to name depots for landowners who donated or leased land to the railroad to construct a depot, and this is where the name &quot;Hooper&quot; came from.

Up until 1890, the only settlements on the north side of the Susquehanna River between Binghamton and Owego were Hooper and Union (at the intersection of what is now Route 26N and Route 17C).

Several businesses were located near this commercial site from 1850 to 1950, including a creamery (dairy plant) reflecting the predominantly dairy-based economy in the immediate surrounding area at the time. A US post office named Hooper was established in one of the general stores near this site in 1853, and &quot;Hooper&quot; was the term commonly used for the unincorporated area of the town of Union between the villages of Johnson City and Endicott until &quot;Endwell&quot; was adopted in 1921. The Town Council of Union has been the local government of what is now Endwell since 1791, although over the years some functions have been taken over by Broome County (poor relief/social services) and by New York State (policing).

Hooper School (now demolished), located a quarter mile west of the depot on the north side of East Main Street, provided primary education (kindergarten-8th grade, K-6 after 1954) for area children from 1923 to 1971. A nationally recognized &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; school when it was built, Hooper School supplanted the railroad depot as the center of the community. Graduates of Hooper School who went on to what was then called &quot;secondary&quot; education attended Union-Endicott High School until the opening of Maine-Endwell Central High School in 1961. Other schools were located on this site dating back to 1876.

What is now Endwell was largely a rural area well into the 20th century. It was in fact a dense forest pierced by Patterson Creek, and the original industry in Endwell dating back to about 1800 was logging. Commercially valuable trees (predominantly oak) were cut down and dragged by oxen down to the Susquehanna. As the snow melted in the spring and the river rose to navigable depth, these logs were lashed together into rafts and floated down the river to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they were broken up and sold as lumber. Permanent settlement began around 1820 along Patterson Creek which flowed into the Susquehanna and was attractive as a water supply and water power source for sawmills. By 1860 economic activity in the area was based on dairy farms along Hooper and Farm-to-Market Roads, second-growth logging, and the railroad depot.

At this time, the only roads in the area were Hooper, Farm-to-Market, Taft, Twist Run, and East Main (current names). The hilly terrain and relatively poor soil quality meant that only a pasture/livestock-based agriculture was viable, and the area was sparsely settled compared to other areas of Broome County. During the 1890s, significant commercial and residential development began along the East Main Street corridor (State Route 17C), including a horse-drawn streetcar line, which connected the growing villages of Johnson City and Endicott. These villages grew very rapidly between 1890 and 1920 because of the success of the Endicott Johnson Corporation, a shoe manufacturer. Wealthy residents of Binghamton in this horse-and-buggy era also maintained numerous weekend/summer homes in what is now Endwell.

The area was best known from the 1850s to the early 1900s for the Carmel Grove Campgrounds located about half a mile north of the depot on the east side of Hooper Road, near the intersection of what is now Country Club Road. Originally created by the Methodist Church close to the depot for the summer church meetings popular at the time, it soon became part of the Chautauqua movement, which appealed to a desire for self-improvement. For a nominal fee, subsidized by Reed Freeman, a wealthy Binghamton clothing manufacturer, the Chautauqua Assembly at Carmel Grove combined what we would call today a week-long &quot;resort&quot; experience with a stimulating series of lectures by nationally known figures of the time, along with popular musical and theater acts. Capable of accommodating a thousand guests in rows of cabins over the hillside, this was a popular summer vacation destination for residents of Binghamton, central New York, and northeastern Pennsylvania for many years.

Endwell appears as it does today because of the rapid growth of nearby Endicott-based International Business Machines (IBM), a computer manufacturer, during the 1940-1970 period. This created a demand for housing which quickly converted Endwell from a hamlet at the intersection of Hooper Road and State Route 17C into the large residential area it is today. The simultaneous increase in car ownership in the 1940s and 1950s made the development of Endwell possible. The area north of Watson Boulevard was developed during the 1940s and 1950s, and the area east of Hooper Road during the 1950s and 1960s. This growth, along with similar growth in the town of Maine to the immediate north, led to the creation of a new Maine-Endwell Central School District and the opening of Maine-Endwell Central High School in 1961. This school is now the center of the community, inheriting its role from Hooper School and the original Hooper railroad depot. The school was the 2008 New York State Class A High School baseball champions. Also is home to the 4-time state football champions, and 6 time ranked number one in New York Swim Team.

A few big names in sports have lived or were born here, including Mike Dunham (longtime NHL goalie, now goalie coach for the New York Islanders) and Isaiah Kacyvenski (starter for the Seattle Seahawks for 5 years-and was Special Teams captain for Seattle during their 2005 Super Bowl appearance). The high school girls field hockey team was ranked as high as 19th in the nation in 2007. Jennifer Radi is a world champion baton twirler, who won gold in Italy in 1996 and the World Open 1-baton championship for 11 consecutive years and the World Open 2-baton championship for nine years. Endwell is home to two well-known local golf courses, Endwell Greens and the Binghamton Country Club. It is also the hometown of the 2007 and 2015 New York State Little League Champions and the winners of the 2016 Little League World Series.

<text>Johnson City is a village in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 15,343 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The village of Johnson City is in the town of Union and is a part of the &quot;Triple Cities&quot; along with Endicott and Binghamton. Johnson City lies to the west of Binghamton on the eastern side of the town of Union.

== History ==
Known as the &quot;Home of the Square Deal&quot;, from the Square Deal given to all employees of Endicott Johnson Corporation, Johnson City was originally incorporated in 1892 as the village of Lestershire. In 1916, the village was renamed Johnson City in honor of George F. Johnson, who led the company that was by then known as Endicott Johnson. Much of Johnson City&#x27;s history is rooted in the prosperity of the Endicott Johnson Corporation, and later in the prosperity brought by IBM in neighboring Endicott. However, the deindustrialization that occurred across the United States impacted Johnson City heavily. The loss of nearly all industry in the span of a couple decades left the economy of Upstate New York, and thus Johnson City, devastated and in recession, explaining in part the village&#x27;s population decline over time. Over the past decade, new revitalization efforts led by the expansion of United Health Services and Binghamton University have rejuvenated the area tremendously.

In January 2007, a group of residents organized a petition supporting dissolution of the village for tax reasons. A vote was held on November 3, 2009. On November 12, 2009, the results came back &quot;no&quot; for dissolution by just 42 votes.

<doc id="126138" wikidata="Q3708350" url="?curid=126138" title="Kirkwood, New York">
<text>Kirkwood is a town in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 5,495 as of the 2020 census. The town is named after James P. Kirkwood, the civil engineer responsible for constructing the local railroad.

The town is located within the Binghamton Metropolitan Area, and lies approximately 10 miles southeast of the city proper. The town itself is also in close proximity to the border with the U.S. State of Pennsylvania, and both Interstate 81 and New York Route 7 run through it. 

== History ==

, Jonathan Fitch built a water-powered gristmill at what is present-day Fivemile Point, becoming the first settler to live in the area. Many others arrived in the years following and settled on the Susquehanna River, enabling the area (which was then a part of the larger town of Conklin) to develop into a location more suitable for an agrarian lifestyle. Evidence of pre-colonial history can be found in the form of Native American artifacts along the river, many of which can still be found today.

Prior to the separation of the two communities, modern day Kirkwood was a part of Conklin, New York. However, the two areas were separated by the Susquehanna River, and this made carrying out government duties very difficult. The onset of inclement weather during a large part of the year only exacerbated the issue (In spite of advances in infrastructure during the 19th century, including the eventual construction of a bridge between both communities), and as a result, it was decided that Kirkwood would be established as an independent community in November of 1859. The town of Conklin, however, would maintain its existence on the southern side of the Susquehanna as a separate entity.

In June 2006 and September 2011, parts of the town, including hundreds of homes, were damaged when the Susquehanna River overflowed its banks.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.27%, is water.
