==Government==

The Villages at Mount Hood is the common government of the unincorporated communities of the Mount Hood Corridor, and includes Brightwood, Welches, Wemme, Zigzag, and Rhododendron. Residents approved its formation in May 2006.

The Villages at Mount Hood was the first established village under Clackamas County&#x27;s &quot;Complete Communities&quot; ordinance, which allows unincorporated communities to form quasi-governments that allow them to have more direct control regarding the issues and activities that affect them.

According to the village&#x27;s official website, the communities united to form the village because the Oregon Department of Transportation required that the towns create a &quot;governmental agency&quot; in order to continue getting grants for the growing Mount Hood Express bus system. The &quot;Complete Communities&quot; ordinance makes villages and hamlets official agencies of the county.

<text>Oak Grove is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. The population was 17,290 as of the 2020 census.

== History==

Oak Grove was named at the suggestion of Edward W. Cornell, a member of the surveying party that platted the townsite in the 1890s. The company that was developing the property had not been able to come up with a good name for the place, and Cornell suggested &quot;Oak Grove&quot; after a crew ate lunch in a stand of oak trees in the northwestern part of the tract.

The area was served first from the Milwaukie post office. In 1904, Creighton post office was established, named for Susan Creighton, on whose donation land claim the office stood. Postal authorities did not name the office &quot;Oak Grove&quot; in order to avoid duplication. There had once been an Oak Grove post office in Josephine County. The first postmaster was noted Oregon botanist Thomas J. Howell.

Oak Grove railroad station was originally named &quot;Center&quot;, and another station, St. Theresa, was originally named &quot;Oak Grove&quot;. In order to prevent confusion, in 1907 the Post Office Department changed the name of the post office to &quot;Oak Grove&quot;, and the Center railroad station was renamed to match. The railroad no longer passes through the community.

Concord School is a historic building and former school (Concord Elementary School) in Oak Grove.

Oak Grove is home to a LINCC library operated by Clackamas County.

<doc id="130698" wikidata="Q2416599" url="?curid=130698" title="Sandy, Oregon">
<text>Sandy is a city located in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, settled 1853 and named after the nearby Sandy River. Located in the foothills of the Cascade Mountain Range, the city serves as the western gateway to the Mount Hood Corridor, and is located approximately east of Portland.

The city of Sandy was originally settled by travelers passing along Barlow Road, one of the final sections of the Oregon Trail, and initially known as Revenue, after settlers Francis and Lydia Revenue. The city subsequently took the name Sandy after the Sandy River, named by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805; the river and previously been named the Barings River, after Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, following a 1792 expedition in the region.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sandy&#x27;s local economy was mainly based on logging and the sawmill industry due to the abundance of timber in the area. The city continued to grow with the arrival of German immigrants in the late 19th century, and the city was formally incorporated in 1911. In the latter half of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s population saw a significant increase in residents, concurrent with the growth of the Portland metropolitan area.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 12,612. It is the home of Sandy High School, founded in 1914, which serves the population of Sandy as well as outlying communities, such as Boring and the Villages of Mount Hood.

==History==
===18th–19th centuries===

Sandy was founded after pioneer Sam Barlow passed through the area in 1845 and formed Barlow Road, the most widely-used final portion of the Oregon Trail. The first people to settle the area were Francis and Lydia Revenue, 1853. The abundance of natural resources in the area, ranging from fish, deer, elk, berries and roots, attracted them to build a homestead and trading post. Around 1873, the Revenues built the city&#x27;s first hotel.

Initially known as Revenue (after the Revenue family), in the late 19th century the settlement took its namesake of Sandy from the nearby Sandy River, which itself had taken its name from Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during their 1805 expedition, who at that time named it the &quot;Quicksand River&quot; due to the abundance of sand on its banks. The river had priorly been named the Barings River after Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, an English merchant banker, by Lieutenant W.R. Broughton of the Fort Vancouver expedition on October 30, 1792.

A second hotel was erected in Sandy in 1890 by Baron Otto Von Scholley, an Austrian immigrant who also served as the city&#x27;s second postmaster and first notary. In 1894, the city completed its first church, St. Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, established by Benedictine monks, which had its first service on December 18 that year. Though the original building was destroyed in a fire two decades later, it was relocated and reopened.

===20th century===

In 1902, a Lutheran church was established in Sandy. On August 11, 1911, the city of was formally incorporated, and on November 14, 1913, city voters approved its charter. Friedrich Meinig, a German immigrant and businessman, came to Sandy in 1876; his son, Paul Meinig, served as the city&#x27;s second mayor from 1912 to 1918. A significant part of Sandy&#x27;s economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was logging and sawmill operations which utilized the abundance of forests surrounding the city.

In October 1913, the city experienced a major fire which destroyed numerous buildings and businesses, including a restaurant, livery stable, and saloon, all located on the south side of the Main Street (contemporarily Proctor Boulevard). A concrete replacement of the restaurant and saloon was subsequently erected, marking the first concrete building in the city. The Clackamas County Bank was established in Sandy in 1916. , the bank remains the oldest community bank in the state of Oregon.

In 1919, a year prior to the 19th Amendment, the city elected two women to its government: Blanche Shelley was elected mayor, along with Edna Esson to city council. Both women were also active business leaders in the city. In 1923, the city completed construction of the Pioneer Building, a brick structure that served as Sandy Union High School, for $30,000. Prior to this, a small two-story schoolhouse served as the city&#x27;s main school for all grades, before a separate high school was established in 1917.

<doc id="130700" wikidata="Q932097" url="?curid=130700" title="West Linn, Oregon">
<text>West Linn is a city in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. A southern suburb within the Portland metropolitan area, West Linn developed on the site of the former Linn City, which was named after U.S. Senator Lewis F. Linn of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, who had advocated the American occupation of the Oregon territory as a counterclaim to the British.

The Sullivan hydroelectric plant opened in 1889, and harvested energy from nearby Willamette Falls. The adjacent Willamette Falls Pulp and Paper Company began operations the same year.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 27,373.

==History==

Prior to settlement by Oregon pioneers, the area which became known as West Linn was the home of ancestors of some of the present-day Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon.

===19th century===
Major Robert Moore was an early settler who arrived in 1839—before the Champoeg Meetings—having been the senior member of the first attempt to create an American state in Oregon, the Peoria Party. After journeying around the Willamette Valley and Columbia Basin, Moore bought title to approx. on the west side of Willamette Falls, across the Willamette River from Oregon City, from Native American Chief Wanaxha of the Wallamut Tribe, on which he platted a town he called &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot; in early 1843. He also filed a provisional claim with the then government of the Oregon Country, not knowing if his transaction would be honored by the eventual governing laws. The Oregon Territorial Legislature voted to rename it Linn City on December 22, 1845, as a memorial to Senator Lewis F. Linn after whom Linn County is also named. Linn was a neighbor and family friend of the Moores from their time as settlers in the early Missouri Territory.

For many years Linn City was a political and commercial rival to the adjacent town of Oregon City, but it suffered a series of natural and man-made setbacks. A major fire and the Great Flood of 1862 put a halt to the pioneer settlement in 1861, dispersing many of the surviving family members throughout the Pacific Northwest.

The Willamette Falls Locks and canal were completed in 1873, making the waterfall passable by river traffic. The locks closed in 2011 with no plans to reopen.

The Willamette Falls Pulp and Paper Company began operation in 1889.

===20th century===
West Linn was incorporated in 1913 and merged with the adjacent town of Willamette in 1916, which had incorporated five years earlier. When the City of West Linn incorporated in 1913, it encompassed West Oregon City, Bolton, Sunset and Willamette Heights. The incorporation allowed the settlements to obtain needed services, utilities, and improvements without annexing to Oregon City. After considerable debate about naming, the city founders decided to honor the pioneer town that Moore had established.

The Oregon City Bridge was built in 1922.

The city&#x27;s population historically grew steadily, but in recent years has leveled off. The 1860 census listed 225 residents. By 1920, the number had grown to 1,628. The 1960 census set the population at 2,923, and by 1970, West Linn had grown to more than 7,000. The city&#x27;s population has continued to grow each year. Currently, the city&#x27;s population is 25,250.

===21st century===
In 2011, the City of West Linn was the Top-Ranked Oregon city on the CNN/Money Magazine &#x27;Best Places to Live 2011&#x27; List. Citing &#x27;breathtaking views of the Cascades and relatively low local taxes,&#x27; the Number 69 listing includes a photo of Central Village, and also mentions the Music in the Park concert series, the historic Willamette area, the farmer&#x27;s market, and the Street Dance. The City of Sherwood is the only other Oregon city to make the 2011 listing, coming in at Number 100. In 2009, the City of West Linn was included on the &#x27;Best Places to Live 2009&#x27; list. Oregonians move to the hilltop homes here for a scenic view of the Cascades and relatively low local taxes. With Portland just 25 minutes away, most residents commute into the city during the week. Weekends are spent enjoying waterfront recreation: West Linn sits at the junction of two rivers. On summer evenings, residents enjoy picnic dinners over concerts in the park. Locals also flock to a revitalized downtown area, Historic Willamette, which offers a farmer&#x27;s market and, occasionally, dancing in the street.

In 2012, the City of West Linn was named a Tree City USA Community by the Arbor Day Foundation for its commitment to urban forestry. It is the 19th year West Linn has earned this national honor from the Arbor Day Foundation, the nation&#x27;s largest nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees. &quot;We all benefit when communities like West Linn place a high priority on planting and caring for trees, one of our nation&#x27;s most beautiful resources,&quot; said John Rosenow, chief executive and founder of the Arbor Day Foundation. &quot;Trees shade our homes and add beauty to our neighborhoods, and they also provide many environmental, economic and social benefits. We applaud West Linn&#x27;s elected officials, volunteers and citizens for providing vital care for its urban forest.&quot;

<doc id="130701" wikidata="Q988747" url="?curid=130701" title="Cannon Beach, Oregon">
<text>Cannon Beach is a city in Clatsop County, Oregon, United States. Its population was 1,690 at the 2010 census. It is a popular coastal Oregon tourist destination, famous for Haystack Rock, a sea stack that juts out along the coast. In 2013, &quot;National Geographic&quot; listed it as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s 100 most beautiful places.&quot;

==History==
Cannon Beach and its surrounding coast was previously settled by the Tillamook people.

William Clark, one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, journeyed to Cannon Beach in early 1805. The expedition was wintering at Fort Clatsop, roughly to the north near the mouth of the Columbia River. In December 1805, two members of the expedition returned to camp with blubber from a whale that had beached several miles south, near the mouth of Ecola Creek. Clark later explored the region himself. From a spot near the western cliffs of the headland he saw &quot;...the grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed, in front of a boundless Ocean...&quot; That viewpoint, later dubbed &quot;Clark&#x27;s Point of View,&quot; can be accessed by a hiking trail from Indian Beach in Ecola State Park.

Clark and several of his companions, including Sacagawea, completed a three-day journey on January 10, 1806, to the site of the beached whale. They encountered a group of Tillamook who were boiling blubber for storage. 
Clark and his party met with them and successfully bartered for of blubber and some whale oil before returning to Fort Clatsop. There is a whale sculpture commemorating the encounter between Clark&#x27;s group and the Tillamooks in a small park at the northern end of Hemlock Street.

Clark applied the name &quot;Ekoli&quot; to what is now Ecola Creek. &quot;Ehkoli&quot; is a Chinook word for &quot;whale&quot;. Early settlers later renamed the creek &quot;Elk Creek&quot;, and a community with the same name formed nearby.

In 1846, a carronade, a short naval cannon, from the US Navy schooner &quot;Shark&quot;, which had sunk earlier that year, washed ashore just north of Arch Cape, a few miles south of the community. The schooner hit land while attempting to cross the Columbia Bar, also known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Pacific.&quot; The cannon, rediscovered in 1898, eventually inspired a name change for the growing community. In 1922, Elk Creek was renamed Cannon Beach (reflecting the beach that extends south of Ecola Creek to Arch Cape) at the insistence of the Post Office Department because the name was frequently confused with Eola. Elk Creek itself was renamed Ecola Creek to honor William Clark&#x27;s original name.

The cannon is now housed in the city&#x27;s museum and a replica of it can be seen alongside U.S. Route 101. Two more cannons, also believed to have been from the &quot;Shark&quot;, were discovered on Arch Cape over the weekend of February 16, 2008.

U.S. Highway 101 formerly ran through Cannon Beach. In 1964, a tsunami generated by the Good Friday earthquake came ashore along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The subsequent flooding inundated parts of Cannon Beach and washed away the highway bridge located on the north side of city. The city, now isolated from the highway, decided to attract visitors by holding a sand castle contest, an event that still continues annually every June.

Chain stores such as Safeway and McDonald&#x27;s have been discouraged from building in Cannon Beach in order to preserve the local economy and small-town feel.

Artisan shops and local restaurants line the streets of the town.

==Arts and culture==
===Annual cultural events===
In June, the city hosts an annual sand castle-building contest.

The city also hosts an annual Fourth of July parade. Parades in recent years have featured a military flyover and a &quot;Lawn Chair Brigade&quot;.

&quot;Spring Unveiling&quot; is an annual arts festival, held on the first Sunday in May, hosted by the city&#x27;s galleries.

There is an annual late-fall festival called the Stormy Weather Arts Festival, held in November, where artists from across the Pacific Northwest showcase their artwork in the local galleries. Artwork is available for purchase in an auction held at the end of the event.

Several galleries in town feature the works of local and Northwest artists.

==Parks and recreation==
Cannon Beach is recognized by the well-known landmark Haystack Rock, located southwest of downtown Cannon Beach. This sea stack has an elevation of and is often accessible at low tide, especially in the summertime. There is a small cave system that penetrates its igneous rock that can be seen from the coastline. The rock is also protected as part of Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge and events are not allowed within of either side of the rock. Near Haystack Rock are the Needles, two tall rocks rising straight out of the water.

Four parks can be found within city limits: Haystack Hill State Park, Les Shirley Park, John Yeon State Natural Site (closed to visitors), and Tolovana Beach State Recreation Site.

==Media and film==

&quot;The Cannon Beach Gazette,&quot; a monthly newspaper that covers area politics, news, sports and community events. The paper is owned and operated by Country Media Inc.

Cannon Beach and Ecola State Park have appeared in several films, including &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985), &quot;Free Willy&quot; (1993), &quot;Twilight&quot; (2008), &quot;Hysterical&quot; (1983), and &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991).

<text>Dumfries ( ; ; from ) is a market town and former royal burgh in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, near the mouth of the River Nith on the Solway Firth, from the Anglo-Scottish border. Dumfries is the county town of the historic county of Dumfriesshire.

Before becoming King of Scots, Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn III of Badenoch at Greyfriars Kirk in the town in 1306. The Young Pretender had his headquarters here towards the end of 1745. In World War II, the Norwegian armed forces in exile in Britain largely consisted of a brigade in Dumfries.

Dumfries is nicknamed &quot;Queen of the South&quot;. This is also the name of the town&#x27;s football club. People from Dumfries are known colloquially in Scots language as &quot;Doonhamers&quot;.

==Toponymy==
There are a number of theories on the etymology of the name, with an ultimately Celtic derivation (either from Brythonic, Gaelic or a mixture of both) considered the most likely.

The first element is derived either from the elements &quot;drum&quot; or &quot;dronn-&quot;, (meaning &quot;ridge&quot; or &quot;hump&quot;, also in Gaelic as &quot;druim&quot;), or from &quot;Dùn&quot; meaning fort. One of the more commonly given etymologies is that the name &quot;Dumfries&quot; originates from the Scottish Gaelic name &quot;Dùn Phris&quot;, meaning &quot;Fort of the Thicket&quot;.

The second element is less obvious, but may be cognate with the Cumbric &quot;prēs&quot;, an element common in the Brythonic areas south of the River Forth. As such, Dumfries has been suggested as a possible location of &quot;Penprys&quot;, the mysterious capital of a land in Medieval Welsh literature, most notably mentioned in the awdl, &quot;Elegy for Gwallawg&quot; by Taliesin.

According to a third theory, the name is a corruption of two Old English or Old Norse words which mean &quot;the Friars&#x27; Hill&quot;; those who favour this idea allege the formation of a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars&#x27; Vennel. If the name were English or Norse, however, the expected form would have the elements in reversed orientation (compare Clarendon). A Celtic derivation is therefore preferred.
== History ==
===Early history===
There is no definite record about the time and manner of Dumfries&#x27;s founding. Some writers hold that Dumfries flourished as a place of distinction during the Roman occupation of North Great Britain. The Selgovae inhabited Nithsdale at the time and may have raised some military works of a defensive nature on or near the site of Dumfries; and it is more than probable that a castle of some kind formed the nucleus of the town. This is inferred from the etymology of the name, which, according to one theory, is resolvable into two Gaelic terms signifying a castle or fort in the copse or brushwood. Dumfries was once within the borders of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The district around Dumfries was for several centuries ruled over and deemed of much importance by the invading Romans. Many traces of Roman presence in Dumfriesshire are still to be found; coins, weapons, sepulchral remains, military earthworks, and roads being among the relics left by their lengthened sojourn in this part of Scotland. The Caledonian tribes in the south of Scotland were invested with the same rights by an edict of Antoninus Pius. The Romanized natives received freedom (the burrows, cairns, and remains of stone temples still to be seen in the district tell of a time when Druidism was the prevailing religion) as well as civilisation from their conquerors. Late in the fourth century, the Romans bade farewell to the country.

According to another theory, the name is a corruption of two words which mean the Friars&#x27; Hill; those who favour this idea allege that St. Ninian, by planting a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars&#x27; Vennel, at the close of the fourth century, became the virtual founder of the Burgh; however Ninian, so far as is known, did not originate any monastic establishments anywhere and was simply a missionary. In the list of British towns given by the ancient historian Nennius, the name &quot;Caer Peris&quot; occurs, which some modern antiquarians suppose to have been transmuted, by a change of dialect, into Dumfries.

Twelve of King Arthur&#x27;s battles were recorded by Nennius in &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. The Battle of Tribruit (the tenth battle), has been suggested as having possibly been near Dumfries or near the mouth of the river Avon near Bo&#x27;ness. After the Roman departure the area around Dumfries had various forms of visit by Picts, Anglo-Saxons, Scots and Norse culminating in a decisive victory for Gregory, King of Scots at what is now Lochmaben over the native Britons in 890.

===Medieval period===

When, in 1069, Malcolm Canmore and William the Conqueror held a conference regarding the claims of Edgar Ætheling to the English Crown, they met at Abernithi – a term which in the old British tongue means a port at the mouth of the Nith. Abernithi may have been Dumfries; and therefore it may have existed as a port in the Kingdom of Strathclyde, if not in the Roman days. However, against this argument is that the town is situated eight to nine miles (14 km) distant from the sea, although the River Nith is tidal and navigable all the way into the town itself.

Although at the time upstream and on the opposite bank of the Nith from Dumfries, Lincluden Abbey was founded circa 1160. The abbey ruins are on the site of the bailey of the very early Lincluden Castle, as are those of the later Lincluden Tower. This religious house was used for various purposes, until its abandonment around 1700. Lincluden Abbey and its grounds are now within the Dumfries urban conurbation boundary.
William the Lion granted the charter to raise Dumfries to the rank of a royal burgh in 1186. Dumfries was very much on the frontier during its first 50 years as a burgh and it grew rapidly as a market town and port.

Alexander III visited Dumfries in 1264 to plan an expedition against the Isle of Man, previously Scots but for 180 years subjected by the crown of Norway. Identified with the conquest of Man, Dumfries shared in the well-being of Scotland for the next 22 years until Alexander&#x27;s accidental death brought an Augustan era in the town&#x27;s history to an abrupt finish. A royal castle, which no longer exists, was built in the 13th century on the site of the present Castledykes Park. In the latter part of the century William Wallace chased a fleeing English force southward through the Nith valley. The force made it to the gates of Dumfries Castle which was closed to them. With a body of the town&#x27;s people joining Wallace and his fellow pursuers when they arrived, the English force was annihilated at Cockpool on the Solway Coast. After resting at Caerlaverock Castle a few miles away from the bloodletting, Wallace again passed through Dumfries the day after as he returned north to Sanquhar Castle.

During the invasion of 1300, Edward I of England lodged for a few days in June with the Minorite Friars of the Vennel, before he laid siege to Caerlaverock Castle at the head of the then greatest invasion force to attack Scotland. After Caerlaverock eventually succumbed, Edward passed through Dumfries again as he crossed the Nith to take his invasion into Galloway. With the Scottish nobility having requested Vatican support for their cause, Edward on his return to Caerlaverock was presented with a missive directed to him by Pope Boniface VIII. Edward held court in Dumfries at which he grudgingly agreed to an armistice. On 30 October, the truce solicited by Pope Boniface was signed by Edward at Dumfries. Letters from Edward, dated at Dumfries, were sent to his subordinates throughout Scotland, ordering them to give effect to the treaty. The peace was to last until Whitsunday in the following year.
Before becoming King of Scots, Robert the Bruce stabbed his rival the Red Comyn at Greyfriars Kirk in the town on 10 February 1306. Bruce&#x27;s uncertainty about the fatality of the stabbing caused one of his followers, Roger de Kirkpatrick, to utter the famous, &quot;I mak siccar&quot; (&quot;I make sure&quot;) and finish the Comyn off. Bruce was subsequently excommunicated as a result, less for the murder than for its location in a church. Regardless, for Bruce the die was cast at the moment in Greyfriars and so began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland. Swords were drawn by supporters of both sides, the burial ground of the monastery becoming the theatre of battle. Bruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle. The English garrison surrendered and for the third time in the day Bruce and his supporters were victorious. He was crowned King of Scots barely seven weeks after. Bruce later triumphed at the Battle of Bannockburn, which confirmed Scotland&#x27;s independence in the conflict.

Once Edward received word of the revolution that had started in Dumfries, he again raised an army and invaded Scotland. Dumfries was again subjected to the control of Bruce&#x27;s enemies. Sir Christopher Seton (Bruce&#x27;s brother in law) had been captured at Loch Doon and was hurried to Dumfries to be tried for treason in general and more specifically for being present at Comyn&#x27;s killing. Still in 1306 and along with two companions, Seton was condemned and executed by hanging and then beheading at the site of what is now St Mary&#x27;s Church.

In 1659 ten women were accused of diverse acts of witchcraft by Dumfries Kirk Session although the Kirk Session minutes itself records nine witches. The Justiciary Court found them guilty of the several articles of witchcraft and on 13 April between 2 pm and 4 pm they were taken to the Whitesands, strangled at stakes and their bodies burnt to ashes.

===Eighteenth century===
The Midsteeple in the centre of the High Street was completed in 1707. Opposite the fountain in the High Street, adjacent to the present Marks &amp; Spencer, was the Commercial and later the County Hotel. Although the latter was demolished in 1984–85, the original facade of the building was retained and incorporated into new retail premises. The building now houses a Waterstones Bookshop. Room No. 6 of the hotel was known as Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s Room and appropriately carpeted in the Royal Stewart tartan. The timber panelling of &quot;Prince Charlie&#x27;s room&quot; was largely reinstated and painted complete with the oil painted landscapes by Robert Norie (1720–1766) in the overmantels at either end of the room and can still be seen as the upstairs showroom of the book shop. The Young Pretender had his headquarters here during a 3-day sojourn in Dumfries towards the end of 1745. £2,000 was demanded by the Prince, together with 1,000 pairs of brogues for his kilted Jacobite rebel army, which was camping in a field not one hundred yards distant. A rumour that the Duke of Cumberland was approaching, made Bonnie Prince Charlie decide to leave with his army, with only £1,000 and 255 pairs of shoes having been handed over.

Robert Burns moved to Dumfriesshire in 1788 and Dumfries itself in 1791, living there until his death on 21 July 1796. Today&#x27;s Greyfriars Church overlooks the location of a statue of Burns, which was designed by Amelia Robertson Hill, sculpted in Carrara, Italy in 1882, and was unveiled by future Prime Minister, Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery on 6 April 1882. Today, it features on the 2007 series of £5 notes issued by the Bank of Scotland, alongside the Brig o&#x27; Doon.

After working with Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, inventor William Symington intended to carry out a trial in order to show than an engine would work on a boat without the boat catching fire. The trial finally took place on Dalswinton Loch near Dumfries on 14 October 1788. The experiment demonstrated that a steam engine would work on a boat. Symington went on to become the builder of the first practical steamboat.

===20th century and beyond===

The first official intimation that RAF Dumfries was to be built was made in late 1938. The site chosen had accommodated light aircraft since about 1914. Work progressed quickly, and on 17 June 1940, the 18 Maintenance Unit was opened at Dumfries. The role of the base during the war also encompassed training. RAF Dumfries had a moment of danger on 25 March 1943, when a German Dornier Do 217 aircraft shot up the airfield beacon, but crashed shortly afterwards. The pilot, Oberleutnant Martin Piscke was later interred in Troqueer Cemetery in Dumfries town, with full military honours. On the night of 3/4 August 1943 a Vickers Wellington bomber with engine problems diverted to but crashed short of the Dumfries runway.

During the Second World War, the bulk of the Norwegian armed forces in exile in Britain consisted of a brigade in Dumfries. When the army High Command took over, there were 70 officers and about 760 privates in the camp. The camp was established in June 1940 and named &quot;Norwegian Reception Camp&quot;, consisting of some 500 men and women, mainly foreign-Norwegian who had volunteered for war duty in Norway during the Nazi occupation in early 1940. Through the summer the number was built up to around 1,500 under the command of General Carl Gustav Fleischer. Within a few miles of Dumfries are the villages of Tinwald, Torthorwald and Mouswald all of which were settled by Vikings.

Dumfries has experienced two Boxing Day earthquakes. These were in 1979 (measuring 4.7 centred near Longtown) and 2006 (centred in the Dumfries locality measuring 3.6 ). There were no serious consequences of either. There was also an earthquake on 16 February 1984 and a further earthquake on 7 June 2010.

==Demography==
===Population===
The National Records for Scotland mid 2012 estimated population of Dumfries was reported as 33,280. 

===Religion===

The 2022 Scottish census revealed that 57% of the towns population identifies as having &#x27;no religion&#x27;, slightly higher than the Scotland wide figure of 51%. 35% identified as Christian (24% Church of Scotland, 8% Catholic and 4% other Christian) while 2% identified with another religion. 5% didn&#x27;t answer question in the census as it was optional.

A number of the local and chapels are notable architectural landmarks. St Michael&#x27;s Church, built between 1761 and 1746, on the site of earlier places of worship dating back to the 12th century. The church has a number of connections to the poet Robert Burns, and he was initially buried in its churchyard. In 1815, his remains were moved to a grand mausoleum in the south-east corner of the churchyard, where his wife Jean Armour and several family members are also interred.

Greyfriars Church constructed between 1866 and 1867 in the Gothic style, stands on a site that was once partly occupied by a Franciscan monastery and partly by the town&#x27;s old castle. St Mary&#x27;s Church, another Gothic edifice built between 1837 and 1839, was erected on the location of a small chapel dedicated by Christina Bruce, to her husband Christopher Seton, who was executed there by Edward I. It was put up for sale in 2024 by the Church of Scotland for £38,000.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church, built from 1811 to 1813 in the Romanesque style, serves as a Roman Catholic church and the pro-cathedral of the Diocese of Galloway. In 1851, Samuel Lewis described additional places of worship, noting the construction of an Episcopal chapel in 1817 at the cost of £2200. He also mentioned the presence of Free Church, United Presbyterian Church, Reformed Presbyterian, Independent, and Wesleyan chapels, as well as a Roman Catholic chapel.

===Education===
Dumfries has several primary schools, approximately one per key district, and four main secondary schools. All of these institutions are governed by Dumfries and Galloway council. The secondary schools are Dumfries Academy, Maxwelltown High School, St Joseph&#x27;s College and Dumfries High School. Dumfries Academy was a grammar school until adopting a comprehensive format in 1983. In 2013 plans for a &#x27;super school&#x27; were announced. These plans were later dismissed in favour of renovating existing schools.

In 1999 Scotland&#x27;s first multi-institutional university campus was established in Dumfries, in the Crichton estate. In order of campus presence it is host to the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) (formerly known as University of Paisley &amp; Bell College), Dumfries &amp; Galloway College, and the University of Glasgow. Still in its infancy, the campus offers a range of degree courses in initial teacher education, business, computing, environmental studies, tourism, heritage, social work, health, social studies, nursing, liberal arts and humanities. Despite the short-lived threat of closure to the University of Glasgow part of the campus in 2006, a campaign by students, academics and local supporters ensured that the University of Glasgow remained open in Dumfries. The University of Glasgow, since maintaining its provision in Dumfries, has launched a new undergraduate programme in primary teaching.

===Healthcare===
Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary is the principal secondary care referral centre for Dumfries and Galloway region. It now includes a maternity wing which replaced the old Cresswell Maternity Hospital.

Midpark Hospital, close to the site of the former Crichton Royal Hospital, is part of the Dumfries and Galloway NHS Board and provides a regional psychiatric, psychological and specialist addictions service within Dumfries and Galloway. In 1838 William A. F. Browne accepted the position of Physician Superintendent at the newly created Crichton. It is at the Crichton where Ursula Fleming gained much of her education and experience.

==Geography and climate==
===Locality===
Like the rest of Dumfries and Galloway, of Scotland&#x27;s three major geographical areas Dumfries lies in the Southern Uplands. The river Nith runs through Dumfries toward the Solway Firth in a southwards direction splitting the town into East and West. At low tide, the sea recedes to such an extent on the shallow sloping sands of the Solway that the length of the Nith is extended by 13 km to . This makes the Nith Scotland&#x27;s seventh longest river. There are several bridges across the river within the town. In between the Devorgilla Bridge (also known as &#x27;The Old Bridge&#x27;) and the suspension bridge is a weir colloquially known as &#x27;The Caul&#x27;. In wetter months of the year the Nith can flood the surrounding streets. The Whitesands has flooded on average once a year since 1827.

Dumfries has numerous suburbs including Summerhill, Summerville, Troqueer, Georgetown, Cresswell, Larchfield, Calside, Lochside, Lincluden, Newbridge Drive, Sandside, Heathhall, Locharbriggs, Noblehill and Marchmount. Maxwelltown to the west of the river Nith, was formerly a burgh in its own right within Kirkcudbrightshire until its incorporation into Dumfries in 1929; Summerhill, Troqueer, Lochside, Lincluden, Sandside are among other suburbs located on the Maxwelltown side of the river. Palmerston Park, home to the town&#x27;s senior football team Queen of the South, is on Terregles Street, also on the Maxwelltown side of the river.

Queensberry Square and High Street are the central focal points of the town and this area hosts many of the historical, social and commercial enterprises and events of Dumfries. During the 1990s, these areas enjoyed various aesthetic recognitions from organisations including Britain in Bloom.

===Weather and climate trends===

As with the rest of the British Isles, Dumfries experiences a maritime climate (Cfb) with cool summers and mild winters. It is one of the less snowy locations in Scotland owing to its sheltered, low lying position in the South West of the country. From 2 July 1908 the town held the record for the highest temperature reading in Scotland, until being surpassed in Greycrook on 9 August 2003. Its southerly latitude makes little difference to the average annual temperatures compared to more northerly coastal parts of Scotland. This is due to strong maritime influence from the Irish Sea cooling down summers due to frequent cloudy weather and cool water temperatures. There are plenty of higher areas to Dumfries&#x27; west, but even so those seldom allow warm air to stay untouched.

==Governance and politics==
===Royal Burgh status (1186)===
Scottish communities granted Royal Burgh status by the monarch guarded the honour jealously and with vigour. Riding the Marches maintains the tradition of an occasion that was, in its day, of great importance. Dumfries has been a Royal Burgh since 1186, its charter being granted by King William the Lion in a move that ensured the loyalty of its citizens to the Monarch. Although far from the centre of power in Scotland, Dumfries had obvious strategic significance sitting as it does on the edge of Galloway and being the centre of control for the south west of Scotland. With the River Nith on two sides and the Lochar Moss on another, Dumfries was a town with good natural defences. Consequently, it was never completely walled. A careful eye still had to be kept on the clearly defined boundaries of the burgh, a task that had to be taken each year by the Provost, Baillies, Burgesses and others within the town. Neighbouring landowners might try to encroach on the town boundaries, or the Marches as they were known, moving them back 100 yards or so to their own benefit. It had to be made clear to anyone thinking of or trying to encroach that they dare not do so.

In return for the Royal status of the town and the favour of the King, the Provost and his council, along with other worthies of the town had to be diligent in ensuring the boundaries were strictly observed. Although steeped in history, Scotland&#x27;s burghs remained the foundation of the country&#x27;s system of local government for centuries. Burgh status conferred on its citizens the right to elect their own town councils, run their own affairs and raise their own local taxes or rates. Dumfries also became the administrative centre for the shire of Dumfries, or Dumfriesshire, which was probably created in the twelfth century and certainly existed by 1305. When elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the burgh of Dumfries was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so was excluded from the jurisdiction of the county council.

===Political expansion===

The burgh of Dumfries was enlarged in 1929 to take in Maxwelltown on the west bank of the Nith, which had previously been a separate burgh in Kirkcudbrightshire. Further local government reform in 1930 brought the burgh of Dumfries within the area controlled by Dumfriesshire County Council, but classed as a large burgh which allowed the town to continue to run many local services itself. The town council was based at Municipal Buildings in Buccleuch Street, built in 1932 on the site of an earlier council building.

In 1975 local government across Scotland was reformed under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The burghs and counties were abolished as administrative areas, replaced with a two-tier system of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Dumfries therefore became part of the Nithsdale district in the region of Dumfries and Galloway. Nithsdale District Council took over the Municipal Buildings. Ancient titles associated with Dumfries&#x27; history as a royal burgh like provost and bailie were discarded or retained only for ceremonial purposes. Robes and chains often found their way into museums as a reminder of the past. Further local government reform in 1996 abolished Nithsdale district, since when Dumfries has been governed by Dumfries and Galloway Council, which has its headquarters in the town at County Buildings, which had been built in 1914 as the headquarters of Dumfriesshire County Council.

Dumfries remains a centre of local government for a much bigger area than just the town itself. But its people, the Doonhamers still retain a pride in their town and distinctive identity. This is never more so than during the week-long Guid Nychburris Festival and its highlight the Riding of the Marches which takes place on the third Saturday in June each year.

===Political representation===

Dumfries is located in the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. It is the seat of the local council, whose headquarters are located on the edge of the town centre. Until 1995 Dumfries was also home to the council for the local district of Nithsdale. Dumfries also lends its name to the lieutenancy area of Dumfries, which is similar in boundaries to the former Dumfriesshire county.

On the Dumfries and Galloway Council, Dumfries is covered by four 4-seat wards: Abbey, Lochar, Nith and North West Dumfries. North West Dumfries is the only ward that solely covers areas within the town itself, with the others incorporating outlying areas. In the 2017 council election, these wards elected 6 Labour, 5 Conservative and 4 SNP councillors.

Dumfries is split into two UK Parliament constituencies: Dumfries and Galloway which is represented by John Cooper and Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale which is represented by David Mundell, both of the Scottish Conservative Party. For Scottish Parliament elections, Dumfries is in the South Scotland electoral region and split between two constituencies. The western wards of Abbey and North West Dumfries are in the constituency of Galloway and West Dumfries, while the eastern wards of Nith and Lochar are in the constituency of Dumfriesshire. The respective MSPs are Finlay Carson and Oliver Mundell, both of the Scottish Conservative Party.

In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Dumfries and Galloway had the country&#x27;s third heaviest &#x27;No&#x27; vote at more than 65% of the ballots cast. That was more than 10 points higher than the national average pro-union vote.

==Economy==
Dumfries has a long history as a county town, and as the market town of a surrounding rural hinterland. 
The North British Rubber Company started manufacturing in 1946 at Heathhall on the former site of the Arrol-Johnston Motor Company which was said to be the most advanced light engineering factory of its day in Scotland. It became Uniroyal Ltd in the 1960s and was where the Hunter Boot and Powergrip engine timing belts were manufactured. In 1987 it changed name to the British subsidiary of the Gates Rubber Company and later was known as Interfloor from 2002 until the factory closed in 2013.

Dumfries is a relatively prosperous community but the town centre has been exposed to the centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town&#x27;s urban fringe. This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of transiting traffic away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.

In a bid to re-stimulate development in Dumfries town centre, both economically and in a social context, several strategies have been proposed by the controlling authorities.

As the largest settlement in Southern Scotland, Dumfries is recognised as a centre for visiting surrounding points of interest. The following are all within easy reach:

* Ae village and forest
* Caerlaverock Castle
* Criffel – a hill on the Solway Coast popular with hill walkers for its views of the Southern Scottish coastline and across the Solway Firth to the Lake District of Cumbria
* Drumlanrig Castle
* Ecclefechan – Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s birthplace &quot;The Arched House&quot; is a tourist attraction and has been maintained by the National Trust for Scotland since 1936. Ecclefechan lies at the foot of the large Roman Fort, Burnswark, which dominates the horizon with its flat top.

==Culture==
Dumfries got its nickname &#x27;Queen of the South&#x27; from David Dunbar, a local poet, who in 1857 stood in the general election. In one of his addresses he called Dumfries &quot;Queen of the South&quot; and this became synonymous with the town.

The term &quot;doonhamer&quot; comes from the way that natives of Dumfries over the years have referred to the area when working away from home. The town is often referred to as &quot;doon hame&quot; in the Scots language (down home). The term doonhamer followed, to describe those that originate from Dumfries. The Doonhamers is also the nickname of Queen of the South who represent Dumfries and the surrounding area in the Scottish Football League. The crest of Dumfries contains the words, &quot;A Lore Burne&quot;. In the history of Dumfries close to the town was the marsh through which ran the Loreburn whose name became the rallying cry of the town in times of attack – A Lore Burne (meaning &#x27;to the muddy stream&#x27;).

In 2017 Dumfries was ranked the happiest place in Scotland by Rightmove.

===Museums, parks and libraries===
Located on top of a small hill, Dumfries Museum is centred on the 18th-century windmill which stands above the town. Included are fossil footprints left by prehistoric reptiles, the wildlife of the Solway marshes, tools and weapons of the earliest peoples of the region and stone carvings of Scotland&#x27;s first Christians. On the top floor of the museum is a camera obscura.

Based in the control tower near Tinwald Downs, the aviation museum has an extensive indoor display of memorabilia, much of which has come via various recovery activities. During the second world war, aerial navigation was taught at Dumfries also at Wigtown and nearby Annan was a fighter training unit. RAF Dumfries doubled as an important maintenance unit and aircraft storage unit. The museum is run by the Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Group and is the only private aviation museum in Scotland. The restored control tower of the former World War II airfield is now a listed building. The museum is run by volunteers and houses a large and ever expanding aircraft collection, aero engines and a display of artefacts and personal histories relating to aviation, past and present. It is also home to the Loch Doon Spitfire. Both civil aviation and military aviation are represented.

The Ewart Library is a Carnegie library, and was opened in 1904. Carnegie donated £10,000 toward the building of the library, and suggested that it was named after William Ewart, former MP for the area, and who was key in the introduction of acts of Parliament in both England and Scotland related to the creation of public libraries.

The most significant of the parks in Dumfries are all within walking distance of the town centre:-
* Dock Park – located on the East bank of the Nith just to the South of St Michael&#x27;s Bridge
* Castledykes Park – as the name suggests on the site of a former castle
* Mill Green (also known as deer park, although the deer formerly accommodated there have since been relocated) – on the West bank of the Nith opposite Whitesands
===Theatre, cinema and media===
The Theatre Royal, Dumfries was built in 1792 and is the oldest working theatre in Scotland.

The theatre is owned by the Guild of Players who bought it in 1959, thereby saving it from demolition, and is run on a voluntary basis by the members of the Guild of Players. It is funded entirely by Guild membership subscriptions, and by box office receipts. It does not currently receive any grant aid towards running costs. In recent years the theatre has been re-roofed and the outside refurbished. It is the venue for the Guild of Players&#x27; own productions and for performances from visiting companies. These include: Scottish Opera, TAG, the Borderline and 7:84. The Robert Burns Centre is an art house cinema in Dumfries. The Odeon Cinema, which showed more mainstream movies, closed its doors in mid-2018 due to the local council refusing to allow Odeon to relocate, forcing them to close.

Dumfries was formerly home to one of the 11 BBC studios in Scotland. &quot;Greatest Hits Radio Dumfries &amp; Galloway&quot;, part of Bauer Media Group, broadcasts from Dumfries, and is also the main radio station for the area. Community radio station &quot;Alive 107.3&quot; broadcasts on 107.3FM in Dumfries and online. In 2018, Dumfries got a new radio station, &quot;Dumfries Community Radio&quot;. Also known as DCR Online, it is not a traditional FM radio station, but an online radio station.

===Concert and event venues===
The Loreburn Hall (sometimes known colloquially as The Drill Hall) has hosted concerts by performers such as Black Sabbath, Big Country, The Proclaimers and Scottish Opera. The hall has hosted sporting events such as wrestling. The new DG One sport, fitness and entertainment centre became the principal indoor event venue in Dumfries in 2007, but in October 2014, it closed due to major defects being discovered in the building. However, the refurbished building reopened to the public in the summer of 2019. The Theatre Royal has also reopened following renovation work.

===Architectural geology===
There are many buildings in Dumfries made from sandstone of the local Locharbriggs quarry. The quarry is situated off the A701 on the north of Dumfries at Locharbriggs close to the nearby aggregates quarry. This dimension stone quarry is a large quarry. Quarry working at Locharbriggs dates from the 18th century, and the quarry has been worked continuously since 1890.

There are good reserves of stone that can be extracted at several locations. On average the stone is available at depths of 1m on bed although some larger blocks are obtainable. The average length of a block is 1.5m but 2.6m blocks can be obtained. Locharbriggs is from the New Red Sandstone of the Permian age. It is a medium-grained stone ranging in colour from dull red to pink. It is the sandstone used in the Queen Alexandra Bridge in Sunderland, the Manchester Central Convention Complex and the base of the Statue of Liberty.

===Visual arts and festivals===
With a collection of over 400 Scottish paintings, Gracefield Arts Centre hosts a changing programme of exhibitions featuring regional, national and international artists and craft-makers. Dumfries Art Trail brings together artists, makers, galleries and craft shops with venues accessible all year round.

There are a number of festivals which take place throughout the year, mostly based on traditional values. Guid Nychburris (Middle Scots, meaning Good Neighbours) is the main festival of the year, a ceremony which is largely based on the theme of a positive community spirit. The ceremony on Guid Nychburris Day, follows a route and sequence of events laid down in the mists of time. Formal proceedings start at 7.30 am with the gathering of up to 250 horses waiting for the courier to arrive and announce that the Pursuivant is on his way, and at 8.00 am leave the Midsteeple and ride out to meet the Pursuivant. They then proceed to Ride the Marches and Stob and Nog (mark the boundary with posts and flags) before returning to the Midsteeple at 12.15 pm to meet the Provost and then the Charter is proclaimed to the towns people of Dumfries. This is then followed by the crowning of the Queen of the South.

Since 2013, Dumfries has seen the annual Nithraid, a small boat race up the Nith from Carsethorn, celebrating the town&#x27;s historical relationship with the river. The region is also home to a number of thriving music festivals such as the Eden Festival (at St Ann&#x27;s near Moffat), Youthbeatz (Scotland&#x27;s largest free youth music festival), the Moniaive Folk Festival, Thornhill Music Festival, Big Burns Supper Festival and previously Electric Fields at Drumlanrig Castle.

The opening stage of the 2011 Tour of Britain started in Peebles and finished later in Dumfries. The stage was won by sprint specialist and reigning Tour de France green jersey champion, Mark Cavendish, with his teammate lead out man, Mark Renshaw finishing second. Cavendish had been scheduled to be racing in the 2011 Vuelta a España. However Cavendish was one a number of riders to withdraw having suffered in the searing Spanish heat. This allowed Cavendish to be a late addition to the Tour of Britain line up in his preparation for what was to be a successful bid two weeks later in the 2011 UCI Road World Championships – Men&#x27;s road race. Cavendish in a smiling post race TV interview in Dumfries described the wet and windy race conditions through the Southern Scottish stage as &#x27;horrible&#x27;. DG One complex includes a national event-sized competition swimming pool. The David Keswick Athletic Centre is the principal facility in Dumfries for athletics.

== History ==
The city is named for Phillip Gearhart, a settler who in 1848 set out from Independence, Missouri, with his family and arrived in Oregon City in October of that year. He rented a log cabin on Clatsop Plains. At that time, other farmers had already settled primarily on the northern Plains. The first farmer to settle there was Solomon Smith. In 1851, Gearhart bought a squatter&#x27;s right in the south Plains for $1,000. He used it to create a donation land claim; the US patent was granted in 1874. Gearhart increased his holdings by in 1859 through a purchase from Obadiah C. Motley, and again in 1863 by purchased from Jefferson J. Louk. The entire parcel encompassed all of what is now called Gearhart, as well as a portion of Seaside across the Necanicum River estuary. Gearhart built a home and farm for his family near a grist mill by Mill Creek, in a sheltered area north and east of the estuary.

In 1889, a railroad was built between Astoria and Seaside. It became a means of transportation to Seaside not only for Astorians but for Portlanders disembarking from the ferry in Astoria. Gearhart began to draw attention as a pleasant landscape for wandering and picnicking. Early settlers were attracted to the Ridge Path through the dune meadows of the Phillip Gearhart land claim.

<text>Seaside is a city in Clatsop County, Oregon, United States, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The name Seaside is derived from &quot;Seaside House&quot;, a historic summer resort built in the 1870s by railroad magnate Ben Holladay. The city&#x27;s population was 6,457 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Clatsop were a historic Native American tribe that had a village named &quot;Ne-co-tat&quot; (in their Chinook language) in this area. Indigenous peoples had long inhabited the coastal area.

About January 1, 1806, a group of men from the Lewis and Clark Expedition built a salt-making cairn at the site later developed as Seaside. The city was not incorporated until February 17, 1899, when coastal resort areas were being settled. It is about by car northwest of Portland, Oregon, a major population center.

In 1912, Alexandre Gilbert (1843–1932) was elected Mayor of Seaside. Gilbert was a French immigrant, a veteran of the Franco Prussian War (1870–1871). After living in San Francisco, California and Astoria, Oregon, Gilbert moved to Seaside where he had a beach cottage (built in 1885). Gilbert was a real estate developer who donated land to the City of Seaside for its one-and-a-half-mile-long Promenade, or &quot;Prom,&quot; along the Pacific beach.

In 1892, he added to his beach cottage. Nearly 100 years later, what was known as the Gilbert House was operated commercially as the Gilbert Inn since the mid-1980s. Both it and Gilbert&#x27;s eponymous &quot;Gilbert Block&quot; office building on Broadway still survive.

Gilbert died at home in Seaside and is interred in Ocean View Abbey Mausoleum in Warrenton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Seaside lies on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, at the southern end of the Clatsop Plains, about south of where the Columbia River empties into the Pacific. The city is developed on both sides of the Necanicum River, which flows to the ocean at the city&#x27;s northern edge. Tillamook Head towers over the southern edge of the city.

The geography associated with the gradual slope of the broad sandy beaches of Clatsop Spit provide excellent conditions for the formation of beds of millions of Pacific razor clams annually. The razor clams attract thousands of visitors to Seaside Beach each year. Waves attract surfers all year round from the challenging point break off the tip of Tillamook Head to the sandy shores at &quot;the cove&quot; parking lot at Ocean Vista Drive.

===Climate===
Seaside has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), typical Pacific Northwest climate, bordering very closely on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;). It receives rainy winters and mild-to-cool summers. Mean high temperature in the warmest month, August, is roughly . The warmest heatwaves, however, occur in September. The hottest day on record was , which occurred on both September 23, 1943 and September 24, 1974. The coldest temperature ever recorded was which occurred on December 8, 1972.

===Tsunami inundation zone===

Part of Seaside is located in a tsunami inundation zone. Among other preparation, the City of Seaside has embarked on a program in which residents above the zone are asked to volunteer to store within their homes barrels of medical supplies, water purification systems, emergency rations, tarps, and radios, with each barrel having enough supplies to last 20 individuals for at least 3 days. As of January 2017, there are 119 barrels within volunteer households and a waiting list of interested households.

Seismologists estimate that there is a one in three chance that Seaside will be hit by an earthquake and tsunami within the next fifty years. On Tues. Nov. 8, 2016, Seaside citizens voted 65% to 35% to issue $99.7 million in bonds to move the remaining three schools out of the tsunami inundation zone.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 6,457 people, 2,969 households, and 1,565 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 4,638 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 88.1% White, 0.6% African American, 0.8% Native American, 1.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 5.8% from other races, and 3.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 12.4% of the population.

There were 2,969 households, of which 24.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.4% were married couples living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.8% had a male householder with no wife present, and 47.3% were non-families. 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 15.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.83.

The median age in the city was 41.5 years. 20% of residents were under the age of 18; 9.3% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 24.7% were from 25 to 44; 28.6% were from 45 to 64; and 17.4% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.3% male and 51.7% female.

==Arts and culture==
Seaside holds an art walk the first Saturday of each month from March through December. Several galleries are located along Broadway street in the historic Gilbert District.

The Seaside Jazz Festival (formerly the Oregon Dixieland Jubilee) was a long-running annual festival that featured some of the most popular Trad Jazz and Swing bands in the US and Canada.

===Annual cultural events===
Seaside hosts an annual 4th of July celebration which includes a parade, outdoor concerts, and one of the largest fireworks displays on the west coast.
Every spring until 2016 (in 2017 and 2018, the conference was moved to Salem, and the Dorchester Conference was moved to Welches, Oregon in 2019), Seaside hosted the Dorchester Conference, a convention of Oregon political activists, typically conservative, independent, or center-right. This convention was founded in 1964 by then-state representative Bob Packwood as a forum for all Republicans statewide.

In the 1990s, it became dominated by members of the conservative branch of the party. Over the years the conference has attracted visits from presidential candidates, debates between Republican primary candidates, and discussions of wider political and social issues. It is run by an independent board and is not formally affiliated with the Oregon Republican Party.

The Miss Oregon Pageant, the official state finals to the Miss America Pageant, takes place annually at the Seaside Civic and Convention Center.

Seaside Beach Volleyball, the 2nd largest Beach Volleyball Tournament in the world takes place annually on the 2nd weekend of August. Started in 1982 the tournament has grown each year. In 2022 Seaside Beach Volleyball had over 1,800 teams and 192 courts for the four days of tournament play.

The annual Salt Maker&#x27;s Return is held in September. The themed event celebrates Seaside history. Five men of the Lewis and Clark expedition needed nearly two months to make the equivalent of of salt; it was critical for them to be able to preserve meat for the winter and their several thousand-mile journey home to the East.

<text>Warrenton is a small, coastal city in Clatsop County, Oregon, United States. Named for D.K. (Daniel Knight) Warren, an early settler, the town is primarily a fishing and logging community. The population was 6,277 according to the 2020 US Census. Warrenton is a less urbanized area close to the Clatsop County seat, Astoria.

== History ==
Prior to the arrival of the first settlers, this land was inhabited by the Clatsop tribe of Native Americans, whose tribe spanned from the south shore of the Columbia River to Tillamook Head. The county in which Warrenton is located was named after these people, as well as the last encampment that the Lewis and Clark Expedition established. Today, a replica of Fort Clatsop still stands just outside of Warrenton city limits.

The first pioneers who settled on the land that would become Warrenton (between 1845 and the early 1850s) were Jeremiah Gerome Tuller, J. W. Wallace, D. E. Pease, Ninian A. Eberman and George Washington Coffenbury. Coffenbury remains a household name in the town, as a local lake in Fort Stevens was named after him.

The first settlement within Warrenton city limits was Lexington, which was laid out in 1848, and served as the first county seat for Clatsop County. The name fell out of use for a time, and the area became known as Skipanon – a name that is now preserved by the Skipanon River, which flows through the town. A Lexington post office operated intermittently between 1850 and 1857; a Skipanon post office operated continuously from 1871 to 1903.

In 1863, the military battery, Fort Stevens, was built in the Warrenton area near the mouth of the Columbia River. Though military activity ceased in 1947, the remains of the fort are preserved as part of Fort Stevens.

Very few improvements were made to the land until the early 1870s, when D. K. Warren bought out some of the first settlers. With the help of Chinese labor, Warren reclaimed a large tract of the land by constructing a dike about in length, which was completed in 1878. Warren laid out the town in about 1891, and in the following year built the first schoolhouse, at a cost of $1,100, and gave it to the school district.

Warrenton was platted in 1889 and incorporated as a city in 1899. Built on tidal flats, it relied on a system of dikes built by Chinese laborers to keep the Columbia River from flooding the town.

==Geography==
Standing at the northwestern extreme of Oregon, Warrenton is about west of Astoria, across the Youngs Bay bridge, which spans over of the Youngs Bay estuary at the mouth of the Columbia River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Warrenton has one charter fishing port in Hammond and a major commercial fishing port in downtown Warrenton.

===Community===
Warrenton is made up of the previously individual communities of Flavel, Fort Stevens, Hammond, Lexington, and Skipanon. The Fort Stevens post office operated at the Fort Stevens military post from 1899 to 1949. Hammond voted to disincorporate in November 1991 and merged with Warrenton on December 5. Hammond was named for lumberman Andrew B. Hammond, who completed the Astoria and Columbia River Railroad. Hammond, originally the site of a Clatsop village called Ne-ahk-stow, has its own ZIP Code of 97121, but is now technically part of Warrenton.

===Climate===
This region experiences mildly warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . It is typically overcast or rainy due to its proximity to the ocean, but it does have some sunshine. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Warrenton has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

Smith, &quot;Tlatskanai&quot; was a point in the Nehalem River that was reached from the Columbia River by way of the Youngs River or by way of the Clatskanie River. The native inhabitants, who were not in the habit of naming streams, did not use the word &quot;Tlatskanai&quot; for the streams they would follow in order to get to that point, but the white men who settled here later did apply the name to the streams.

<text>Rainier ( ) is a city in Columbia County, Oregon, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 1,895 at the 2010 census. Rainier is on the south bank of the Columbia River across from Kelso and Longview, Washington.

==History==

Rainier was founded in 1851 on the south bank of the Columbia River by Charles E. Fox, the town&#x27;s first postman. First called Eminence, its name was later changed to Fox&#x27;s Landing and finally to Rainier. The name Rainier was taken from Mount Rainier in Washington, which can be seen from hills above the city. Rainier was incorporated in 1881.

For much of the last quarter of the twentieth century, Rainier was known to the rest of Oregon as home to Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, the only commercial nuclear reactor in the state, which supplied electricity to Portland and its suburbs starting in March 1976. The reactor was closed periodically due to structural problems, and in January 1993, it was decommissioned after cracks developed in the steam tubes. On May 21, 2006, the cooling tower was demolished.

The closing of the Trojan plant precipitated a decline in the number of businesses in the city. While some retail and services are available in the city, currently the only supermarket in the city is a Grocery Outlet. Services are available in neighboring Clatskanie, St. Helens, and in Longview, Washington. Longview is opposite Rainier, across the Columbia River, and connected to Rainier by the Lewis and Clark Bridge.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Rainier is surrounded by a number of rural communities. In the past, these places acted as separate communities. Today, most businesses and services have left these rural sites, and the communities are part of a large unincorporated area that receive services out of Rainier. These communities include Fern Hill, Hudson, Alston, Apiary, Goble, and Prescott. 
The Lewis and Clark Bridge spans the Columbia River, linking Rainier to Longview, Washington. It is the only bridge, that spans the entire width of the river, between Portland and Astoria, Oregon.

<text>Vernonia is a city in Columbia County, Oregon, United States. It is located on the Nehalem River, in a valley on the eastern side of the Northern Oregon Coast Range that is the heart of one of the most important timber-producing areas of the state. Logging has played a large role in the history of the city. The population was 2,374 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The community was first settled in 1874 by the Parker and Van Blaricom families. Cousins Judson Weed and Ozias Cherrington, both of Ohio, arrived in 1876. Sometime afterwards, the question of a name for the community came up, and Cherrington suggested the name of his daughter (Vernona) in Ohio, which was adopted. Due to a clerical error during the incorporation process, an &quot;i&quot; was inserted into the name. Cherrington died in a farming accident in 1894, never having seen his daughter since his departure from Ohio.

Vernonia started to become more than an isolated farming community on July 10, 1924, when the Oregon-American Lumber Company opened a state-of-the-art lumber mill, which was supported by a railroad line connecting Vernonia to the rest of the country. Oregon-American merged with Long-Bell Lumber Company in May 1953, which itself merged with International Paper in November 1957. International Paper judged the mill antiquated, and closed it on December 20, 1957.

The city has been severely impacted by floods on multiple occasions. The rains that caused the Willamette Valley Flood of 1996 flooded Vernonia as well; some homes in the floodplain were elevated, and some flooring materials were replaced, mitigating some damage from later flooding. In 2007, heavy storms that impacted the Pacific Northwest washed out roads and destroyed homes, cars, and communications infrastructure. Despite preparations in 1996, in some parts of town flood water reached above the 100 year base flood elevation. 
In the wake of the 2007 flood, Vernonia School District voters approved a $13 million bond in 2009 to build a new K-12 school in Vernonia. The new school opened in fall 2012.

== Early life and education ==
Paul Edward Valentine Giamatti was born June 6, 1967, in New Haven, Connecticut, the youngest of three children. His father, Angelo Bartlett Giamatti, was a Yale University professor who later became president of the university and later commissioner of Major League Baseball. His mother, Toni Marilyn Giamatti (&quot;née&quot; Smith), was a homemaker and English teacher who taught at the Hopkins School and had also previously acted.

His paternal grandfather&#x27;s family were Italian emigrants from Telese Terme; the family surname was originally spelled &quot;Giammattei&quot; () before immigrating to the United States. His paternal grandmother had deep roots in New England, dating back to the colonial era. Giamatti&#x27;s brother, Marcus, is also an actor, and his sister, Elena, was a jewelry designer.

Giamatti attended Yale, where he was active in the undergraduate theater scene and worked with fellow actors and Yale students Ron Livingston and Edward Norton. He graduated in 1989 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and went on to earn a master of fine arts degree from the Yale School of Drama, where he studied with Earle R. Gister. He performed in numerous theatrical productions, including on Broadway and a stint from 1989 to 1992 with Seattle&#x27;s Annex Theater, before appearing in some small television and film roles in the early 1990s. 

In 2023, Giamatti was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Yale.

==Career==
=== 1989–2002: Early roles ===
He made his television debut in the ABC made for television film &quot;She&#x27;ll Take Romance&quot; (1990). After minor roles in the neo-noir &quot;Past Midnight&quot; (1991) and the romantic comedy &quot;Singles&quot; (1992) he acted in Woody Allen&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995) and Sydney Pollack&#x27;s romantic comedy remake &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995). That same year in March, he made his Broadway debut in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; portraying Ezra Chater. Vincent Canby describe the role as being &quot;a helplessly funny subsidiary&quot; one. In November he portrayed The Rev. Donald Bacon in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Racing Demon&quot;. Both of these productions took place at the Lincoln Center Theater. 

In 1997, Giamatti landed his first high-profile role as Kenny &quot;Pig Vomit&quot; Rushton in the film adaptation of Howard Stern&#x27;s &quot;Private Parts&quot;. Stern praised Giamatti&#x27;s performance often on his radio program, calling for him to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described Giamatti&#x27;s performance as being &quot;well played&quot;. That same year he reunited with Woody Allen, acting in the comedy &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997). He also took a small but memorable role as Richard the Bellman in the Julia Roberts-led romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997). That same year he returned to Broadway, playing Andrei Prozorov in the revival of Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Greg Evans of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;[Giamatti,] as the sisters’ pensive, dispirited brother Andrei, plays urban neurosis like a Richard Lewis stand-up routine, then slides into shaky-voiced melodrama when the going gets tough&quot;. 

In 1998, Giamatti appeared in Season 6, Episode 15 of “&quot;.&quot;&quot; He played Harry Tjarks, who raised pit bulls and was more concerned about his dogs than the fact that they had mauled his grandfather to death. He also appeared in a number of supporting roles in the big-budget films including Peter Weir&#x27;s drama &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; and the action thriller &quot;The Negotiator&quot;. In 1999, he played Bob Zmuda and Tony Clifton in Miloš Forman&#x27;s Andy Kaufman biopic, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. Giamatti continued working steadily during the early 2000s by appearing in major studio releases including &quot;Duets&quot; (2000), &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; (2000), &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001) and &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002).

=== 2003–2015: Established actor ===
In 2003, Giamatti began to earn critical acclaim after his lead role in the film &quot;American Splendor&quot;. In 2004, Giamatti gained mainstream recognition and fame with the independent romantic comedy &quot;Sideways&quot;. His portrayal of a depressed writer vacationing in the Santa Barbara wine country garnered him a Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award and he was named Best Actor in a Leading Role by several significant film critics groups (New York, Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco, Online Film Critics).

Following the commercial success of &quot;Sideways&quot;, Giamatti appeared in &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, for which he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated for a Golden Globe and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. In 2006, Giamatti was the lead in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, a supernatural thriller, followed by the animated film &quot;The Ant Bully&quot;, and Neil Burger&#x27;s drama &quot;The Illusionist&quot; co-starring Edward Norton.

Giamatti had his first major role in an action movie in the 2007 film &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot;, while starring in &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; and &quot;Fred Claus&quot;. In 2008, Giamatti received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his title performance in the 2008 HBO miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot;, as well as his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Miniseries or Television Film, and also earned a Screen Actors Guild award. Barry Garron of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised his performance, writing &quot;Giamatti is brilliant as Adams. He is fearless in his portrayal, confident that the character’s all-consuming sacrifices for his fledgling nation will more than compensate for his numerous character flaws&quot;. William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; agreed, adding &quot;The acting, especially from Giamatti as the irascible Adams and Laura Linney as his wife Abigail, who steered him clear of vanity...has the tang of authenticity, even when burdened with great gulps of politicking&quot;. That same year, he starred in the independent film &quot;Pretty Bird&quot;, which is a fictionalized retelling about the drama behind the invention of a rocketbelt.

Giamatti received his second Golden Globe win for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for his role in the 2010 film, &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot;. &quot;The Associated Press&quot; praised Giamatti, describing it as &quot;pitch perfect&quot;, adding, &quot;the picture undoubtedly will draw kudos in its home and native land and likely beyond, buoyed by that virtuouso Giamatti performance&quot;. Giamatti starred as the lead in the comedy-drama film &quot;Win Win&quot;, which earned positive reviews from critics. Scott Tobias of &quot;NPR&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;By now, the Giamatti persona has been well-defined — exasperation and despair, tempered by mordant wit—but the actor&#x27;s every performance is like a snowflake, and here McCarthy provides him a role that&#x27;s subtly down-to-earth&quot;. The same year he had small roles in &quot;Ironclad&quot;, &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot; and &quot;The Ides of March&quot;.

In 2012, Giamatti became the voiceover actor for Liberty Mutual insurance commercials. He was the narrator for the PBS &quot;Nature&quot; episode &quot;An Original DUCKumentary&quot;. Giamatti produced and starred in &quot;John Dies at the End&quot;, which is based on the book of the same name. He also had roles in the films &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;.

In 2013, Giamatti returned to his alma mater, Yale University, to perform the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, for which he won rave reviews in a sold-out, modern dress stage production of the play at the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven. He also had supporting roles in several films, including the animated &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;The Congress&quot;, as well as &quot;Parkland&quot;, &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;, and the critically acclaimed &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;. In addition, Giamatti played the role of New Yorker Harold Levinson, the brother of Cora, the Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), in the 2013 Christmas special of the period drama, ITV Studios/Carnival Films television series, &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. For his performance he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series nomination.

In 2014, Giamatti played villain The Rhino in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. Also in 2014, Giamatti portrayed psychologist Eugene Landy in the Brian Wilson biopic &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot;. In 2015, Giamatti portrayed N.W.A manager Jerry Heller in the biographical drama &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. He also played a scientist in the disaster film &quot;San Andreas&quot;.

=== Since 2016 ===
From 2016 to 2023, Giamatti played a lead role in the Showtime series &quot;Billions&quot;, portraying the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The show, debuting in 2016, is loosely based on a real event. For the role he received a nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. In 2016, Giamatti began appearing in commercials for Prism TV, the IPTV service owned by CenturyLink; the spots are the first-ever on-camera TV commercial appearances for Giamatti. In 2022, Giamatti appeared as Scrooge and Einstein in Verizon commercials. He served as an executive producer of the WGN America series &quot;Outsiders&quot; (2016–2017). He also lent his voice to &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; and &quot;Big Mouth&quot;.

In 2018, he starred in the Tamara Jenkins directed film &quot;Private Life&quot;, acting alongside Kathryn Hahn. The film, distributed by Netflix, received positive reviews. Alissa Wilkinson of &quot;Vox&quot; praised the performances of the two leads, writing &quot;Hahn and Giamatti bring their characteristic warmth-with-an-edge to their characters, and as their relationship unpacks itself onscreen, it feels authentic and lived-in&quot;. That same year he acted in Reed Morano&#x27;s post-apocalyptic romance drama &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; and portrayed Samuel Goudsmit in the war film &quot;The Catcher Was a Spy&quot;. He returned to film in 2021, acting in the action thriller &quot;Gunpowder Milkshake&quot; and the family adventure film &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot;.

He reunited with Alexander Payne in the coming-of-age film &quot;The Holdovers&quot; (2023), which premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. The film, distributed by Focus Features, received positive reviews, with critics praising Giamatti&#x27;s performance as a curmudgeonly teacher. Pete Hammond of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; declared, &quot;Giamatti, who so memorably starred in Payne’s 2004 &quot;Sideways&quot;, has never been better&quot;, adding &quot;this is perfect casting for Giamatti.&quot; For his performance in &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, Giamatti received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actor.

In 2024 it was announced that Giamatti would star in a TV series based on the &quot;Hostel&quot; film series.

==Wax Paul Now campaign==
Giamatti is the subject of the viral &quot;Wax Paul Now&quot; campaign, which pushes for the actor to get a Madame Tussauds wax statue in his likeness. The movement first achieved national prominence when Giamatti appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; and discussed the campaign with host Stephen Colbert. After this and subsequent articles in BuzzFeed and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; among others, Madame Tussauds New York announced that they would host a party in Giamatti&#x27;s honor to coincide with the premiere of &quot;Billions&quot; Season 3 on March 25, 2018, at which the founders of the Wax Paul Now movement would speak.

Tussauds announced that if a Change.org petition garnered 500,000 signatures in the nine days leading up to the party, they would agree to create the wax statue of Giamatti. As the petition was unable to garner enough signatures in time, the Wax Paul Now campaign is still ongoing. A short film chronicling the campaign premiered at the Virginia Film Festival in October 2019.

==Personal life==
Giamatti resides in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York and was married to Elizabeth Cohen from 1997 to an undisclosed date in the 2000s. They have a son, Samuel. Though not religious, he stated: &quot;My wife is Jewish. And I&#x27;m fine with my son being raised as a Jew&quot;. Giamatti is an atheist, although for him &quot;religion features more now in my life than it did when I was a kid&quot;.

<text>Bandon () is a city in Coos County, Oregon, United States, on the south side of the mouth of the Coquille River. It was named by George Bennet, an Irish peer, who settled nearby in 1873 and named the town after Bandon in Ireland, his hometown. The population was 3,066 at the 2010 census and by the 2020 census it was 3,321.

==History==
Before 1850, the Coquille Indians lived in the area. Then in 1851, gold was discovered at nearby Whiskey Run Beach by French Canadian trappers, though the gold rush did not have much of an impact on the area. In 1852, Henry Baldwin, from County Cork, Ireland, was shipwrecked on the Coos Bay bar and walked into this area. The first permanent European settlers came in 1853 and established the present town site. In 1856, conflicts in the area arose and Indigenous Americans were sent to the Siletz Reservation. In 1859, the boat &quot;Twin Sisters&quot; sailed into the Coquille River and opened the outlet for all inland produce and resources.

Bandon was founded by the Irish peer George Bennett in 1873. George Bennett, his sons Joseph and George, and George Sealey came from Bandon, Ireland. The following year the town&#x27;s previous name of Averille was changed to Bandon after the town of the same name in Ireland. The next year, Joseph Williams and his three sons arrived, also from Bandon, Ireland. In 1877, the post office was established. In 1880, cheese making began. That same year, Congress appropriated money to build the jetty. In 1883, the first sawmill, school house, and Catholic church were built. In 1884, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on the jetty.

 George Bennett also introduced gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;) into the local area, which in the following decades went wild and became a nuisance in both the town and in the neighboring countryside. Gorse, a spiny plant, grows so thickly a person cannot walk through it. It is also a very oily plant, which easily catches fire.

Cranberries have been grown in Bandon since 1885, when Charles McFarlin planted vines he brought from Massachusetts. McFarlin had originally come to pan for gold in California. He did not make his fortune, or even a living, so he turned to what he knew best. He brought vines from Cape Cod and planted them in the state&#x27;s first cranberry bog near Hauser. This bog produced cranberries for eight decades. His variety adapted to growing conditions on the west coast. The variety was named McFarlin in his honor and was the principal variety grown on the west coast until overtaken by the Stevens variety. Bandon is also the location of the first cranberry bogs to be wet harvested, which is done by building dikes around the bogs then flooding them.

In 2010, Bandon was named one of the &quot;Coolest Small Towns in America&quot; by BudgetTravel.

===Fire===
On September 26, 1936, a fire burned several miles of forest east of town. But a sudden shift in the wind drove the flames swiftly westward. Ignited by the forest fire, the town&#x27;s abundant gorse became engulfed in flames, Bandon resident D.H. Woomer told &quot;The Coos Bay Times&quot;. Bandon&#x27;s entire commercial district was destroyed. The total loss stated at the time was $3 million USD, with 11 fatalities.

Ironically, the gorse was first introduced to the Oregon Coast by the founder of Bandon, Lord George Bennett, from his native Ireland.

Firefighters found that burning gorse reacted to having water squirted on it like a kitchen grease fire—it simply spread burning gobs of gorse everywhere. Stewart Holbrook described this conflagration in his essay &quot;The Gorse of Bandon.&quot;

Part of the commercial district had been erected on wooden pilings jutting out over the Coquille River not far from the South Jetty, accommodating river traffic at the merchants&#x27; doors. After the 1936 fire, when Bandon began to be rebuilt, the new perimeter of the business district did not extend beyond the available land.

There is still gorse in Bandon today, but municipal codes strictly regulate how high and thick it may be allowed to get.

<text>Coos Bay () is a city located in Coos County, Oregon, United States, where the Coos River enters Coos Bay on the Pacific Ocean. The city borders the city of North Bend, and together they are often referred to as one entity called either Coos Bay-North Bend or Oregon&#x27;s Bay Area. Coos Bay&#x27;s population as of the 2020 census was 15,985 residents, making it the most populous city on the Oregon Coast. Oregon&#x27;s Bay Area is estimated to be home to 32,308 (Coos Bay Census County Division).

==History==
Prior to Europeans first visiting the Oregon coast, Native American tribes claimed the Coos Bay region as their homeland for thousands of years. Members of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, Siuslaw and Coquille tribes lived, fished, hunted and gathered along Coos Bay and its estuaries, along rivers, and in meadows and forests. Approximately 400 years ago, British and Spanish explorers first approached the South Coast. In 1579, Sir Francis Drake was purported to have sought shelter for his ship, the &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, around Cape Arago. Trader and explorer Jedediah Smith was in the region seeking furs, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent Alexander Roderick McLeod to search for an inland passage.

===19th century===
The earliest settlement of European Americans in the area was in January 1852 when survivors of the &quot;Captain Lincoln&quot; shipwreck established Camp Castaway until they and their cargo could be fully rescued. There has been a permanent settlement on Coos Bay since 1853, when the town of Marshfield was founded there and named after the Massachusetts hometown of its founder, J. C. Tolman. The first Methodist church in the area was established in 1857. By 1866 the inhabitants, who were reliant on the sea for their income, had built the Cape Arago Light. The setting up of a post office in 1871 and the arrival of the Coos Bay Wagon Road in the town a year later connected Coos County with the Umpqua River valley in neighboring Douglas County, on the other side of the Coast Range of mountains. This wagon road, although long gone in its original form, is still partially in existence since the route of Oregon Route 42 roughly follows the original right of way.

1870 saw Coos Bay set up its first, and the state&#x27;s 48th, chartered Masonic Lodge. Named Blanco Lodge, this brotherhood was set up by several of the town&#x27;s founding fathers. With this development, the incorporation of Marshfield came in 1874. One of the nation&#x27;s oldest still-operating machine shops, the Nelson Machine Works-Coos Bay Iron Works, was founded in 1888.

===20th century===

==== Alonzo Tucker ====
On September 18, 1902, the only lynching ever to be documented in Oregon occurred in Coos Bay, of Alonzo Tucker, an African-American man. He was accused of raping a white woman and escaping from jail. However, there is no record of his escape from jail. According to newspaper accounts, Tucker was discovered by two young boys who began shooting him with airguns. After a brief pursuit, local miners apprehended Tucker who was hiding inside a store. The mob considering hanging him inside the store but decided to return him to the site of the alleged rape at a nearby bridge. Tucker was shot twice and then hanged from the 7th Street bridge, which spanned present-day Golden Field, where high school soccer games are now held. No charges were ever brought against the mob, as officials determined &quot;the deceased came to his death at the hands of parties unknown while resisting arrest for a felony, and that no crime was committed thereby.&quot; Despite this claim that those in the mob were unknown, the participation of multiple people, including the husband of the alleged rape victim, was noted in local newspapers. One newspaper at that time reported the mob was &quot;quiet and orderly&quot; and another paper wrote, &quot;&#x27;Well done&#x27; is the consensus of public opinion.&quot; Alonzo Tucker&#x27;s cause of death was asphyxiation. According to the coroner&#x27;s report, cause of death was blood loss from the gunshot wound in Tucker&#x27;s right thigh, in which case he died before being hanged on the Marshfield bridge.

===== Industry =====
Prior to around 1915, the Coos region was largely isolated from the rest of Oregon due to difficulties in crossing the Coast Range and fording rivers, and the Pacific Ocean was used to link people to other areas, including San Francisco, which was an easier two-day trip compared to traveling inland over rugged terrain. In 1916 a rail line was completed that linked the region to other interior settlements and towns, which increased commercial trade and tourism Significant urban growth occurred in the 1920s, and during the 1930s to 1950s large-scale growth occurred. Per the Oregon Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, during the 1930s to 1950s:
&quot;Shipyards contracted with the U.S. Government to build minesweepers and rescue tugs for World War II defense purposes. Large national lumber companies set up operations and expanded significantly for the next two decades. Jetty improvements, commercial fishing, and crabbing shaped the development of Charleston. The completion of the North Bend Bridge (now McCullough Memorial Bridge) in 1936 and the Roosevelt Highway significantly improved modern transportation connections and provided the final link in opening the Coos region to the outside world. The formerly remote district known as the Coos Bay country had come of age.&quot;
What now makes up the central district of Coos Bay was called Marshfield until November 10, 1944. The name change, long advocated by residents, had been voted for and became effective on November 11, thus matching the name of the Bay itself. The City of Marshfield was named after the Massachusetts hometown of the Cityʼs founder, J.C. Tolman, and incorporated in 1874.

On February 4, 1999, a Japanese ship named the &quot;New Carissa&quot; ran aground on a beach 2.75 miles (4.3 km) north of the entrance to Coos Bay, drawing international attention to the area. The &quot;New Carissa&quot; was empty of cargo at the time, heading for the Port of Coos Bay to pick up wood chips. When the captain was told that the weather was too severe for the ship to enter port, he anchored his ship close by. The crew put out only one anchor, and it appears that this was probably on too short a chain to be effective. The subsequent US Coast Guard investigation found several other aspects of the ship&#x27;s company&#x27;s handling of the situation to have been poor, leading to the conclusion that human error caused the grounding. Seventy thousand US gallons (260 m3) of #6 crude oil were spilled by the vessel, with a further 165,000 to 255,000 gallons (625 to 965 m3) set alight via explosives and liquid napalm, by the Army Corps of Engineers, over the course of weeks. The explosives, the heat from the burning oil and the beating of the Pacific Ocean on the ship are what eventually caused the &quot;New Carissa&quot; to break in two.

The stern of the ship remained on the beach; the bow was towed out to sea and sunk after multiple attempts. They had to get special tow lines shipped in from overseas and had multiple tug boats pulling it out.

In 2008, the stern of the &quot;New Carissa&quot; was cut into pieces and removed from the beach.

====Consolidation====

Several votes to consolidate or merge cities around Coos Bay were held in the 20th century, beginning in 1906. In May 1962 and November 1962, voters in Coos County rejected propositions that would have merged the cities of Coos Bay, North Bend, Empire, and Eastside into a single city. The second vote had been defeated in North Bend by a margin of 98 votes, while the other four cities had approved. The consolidation had been proposed to provide an equal share of services across the Bay Area and retain more tax revenue from major employers in the county. Empire voted to merge with Coos Bay in December 1964 and was approved by the city council the following month. Eastside&#x27;s merger was approved in November 1983 and took effect on December 29, 1983.

===21st century===
The worst loss of life for a fire department in modern Oregon history occurred in Coos Bay on November 25, 2002, when three firefighters were killed by a structural failure of the roof in an auto parts store. The accidental blaze paralyzed the city for several hours, with fire departments from several neighboring towns assisting in the effort to stop the blaze. Captain Randy Carpenter, Firefighter/Engineer Robert &quot;Chuck&quot; Hanners and Firefighter/Engineer Jeff Common, all from Coos Bay, died when an explosion caused the roof of the building to cave in; they were inside the structure when the roof collapsed, killing the three firefighters.

==Geography==
 According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city is quite hilly, with elevations ranging from between sea level to over . Bodies of water within the city limits include Upper Pony Creek Reservoir, Lake Merritt, Empire Lakes and numerous streams.

===Districts===
The City of Coos Bay comprises four districts, two of which (Eastside and Empire) were formerly independent cities.

====Marshfield====
The Marshfield District of Coos Bay is the historic central downtown and business district of the city. Old Marshfield and its surrounding neighborhoods were what comprised the original Coos Bay before the annexations of Empire and Eastside during the 20th century. The Marshfield District contains many buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, such as the Carnegie Library, Chandler Hotel, Egyptian Theatre and Tioga Hotel. The waterfront area of the Marshfield District has a boardwalk with a city dock, bicycling trail and pavilions featuring historical and interpretive displays.

====Milner Crest====
The Milner Crest district is a residential neighborhood developed in the mid-20th century, located at the crest of a hill overlooking the bay, north of Mingus Park and the Marshfield District. The majority of the Coos Bay area&#x27;s medical facilities are located in this district.

====Eastside====
The Eastside district of Coos Bay was originally called East Marshfield for its situation on the east side of the bay. East Marshfield post office was established in 1891 and it operated intermittently until 1908, when the name was changed to Eastside. The community of Eastside merged with the city of Coos Bay in 1983. Eastside is primarily a residential neighborhood and is home to Eastside Elementary, Millicoma Middle School, walking trails at Millicoma Marsh and a public boat launch.

====Empire====
A trail established by Coquille people ran from the original site of Randolph to Empire.

The Empire district (Coos language: Hanisich)) was founded as Empire City in 1853 by members of the Coos Bay Company from Jacksonville, Oregon, and at the time it was assumed that the area would be center of the region. The company was formed after the discovery of gold in northern California and southwestern Oregon. For a time Empire City was the county seat of Coos County. The first post office in the location was called Elkhorn, which ran from 1853 until 1854. It was the first post office in what is now Coos County, though at the time it was part of Umpqua County. Empire City post office was established in 1858 and ran until 1894, when it was renamed Empire. In 1965, the city of Empire voted to consolidate with Coos Bay. Today, Empire is the location of Madison Elementary School, Sunset Intermediate School and a business district along Cape Arago Highway.

===Climate===
This region experiences cool-to-warm summers typical of the Oregon coast, with no average monthly temperatures above which means mild weather usually in the lower 40s to upper 60s Fahrenheit. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Coos Bay has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps, but that borders on an oceanic climate, due to the cool year-round temperatures and sheer volume of annual rainfall, nearly annually. Severe coastal storms (or gales) with hurricane-force winds occur frequently during the winter months, while summers can be foggy. Snowfall is uncommon, with just around an inch (2.54 cm) of snow annually. Air temperatures typically range from 40 °F (4 °C) to 75 °F (24 °C) all year.

The record high temperature of was recorded on September 22, 2009, and the record low of was recorded on December 21, 1990. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport in nearby North Bend was from July 1994 to June 1995 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with ; the greatest monthly rainfall was in November 1973, and the highest 24-hour rainfall on November 18, 1996.

The Coos Bay—North Bend area is in USDA plant hardiness zone 9A, with a frost-free growing season around nine months long.

The greater Coos Bay area has a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, including the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, which brings approximately 1.5 million visitors each year. The ocean beaches near Coos Bay are devoid of the level of development seen on other areas of the Oregon Coast, due to much of the coastline being designated state and county parks. Across the entrance bar to Coos Bay from the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area lie the rugged cliffs and pocket beaches of Bastendorf Beach County Park, Yoakam Point State Park, Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park and Cape Arago State Park. Approximately southwest of Coos Bay is the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and approximately east in the Coast Range is Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area.

<text>North Bend is a city in Coos County, Oregon, United States with a population of 9,695 as of the 2010 census. North Bend is surrounded on three sides by Coos Bay, an S-shaped water inlet and estuary where the Coos River enters Coos Bay and borders the city of Coos Bay to the south. North Bend became an incorporated city in 1903.

==History==
Before Europeans visited the Oregon coast, Native American tribes claimed the Coos Bay region as their homeland for thousands of years. Members of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, Siuslaw and Coquille tribes lived, fished, hunted and gathered along Coos Bay and its estuaries, along rivers, and in meadows and forests.

Approximately 400 years ago, British and Spanish explorers first approached the South Coast. In 1579, Sir Francis Drake is purported to have sought shelter for his ship, the &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, around Cape Arago. Trader and explorer Jedediah Smith was in the region seeking furs and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent Alexander Roderick McLeod to search for an inland passage.

The 1852 stranding of the schooner &quot;Captain Lincoln&quot; on the North Spit and the survivors&#x27; encampment and rescue brought attention to gold prospectors who came to mine placer from area beaches. In 1853, the Coos Bay Commercial Company arrived from the Rogue Valley and created routes for settlers.

Thomas Symons founded Yarrow in 1863. Louis Simpson bought it in 1902. Simpson brought Yarrow and his father&#x27;s sawmill site Old Town together in 1903 under the name North Bend.

Empire City was established and was the county seat of government until 1896. Entrepreneurs were drawn to the area&#x27;s ample natural resources, and sawmills and shipyards at Old Town North Bend and Empire City spurred economic development and attracted workers. Rivers and sloughs provided a means to transport people, forest, agricultural and coal products, and towns provided hubs for inland transportation. Some of the early industries in the area included timber harvesting, shipbuilding, farming, coal mining and salmon canning.

Prior to around 1915, the Coos region was largely isolated from the rest of Oregon due to difficulties in crossing the Coast Range and fording rivers. Instead, the Pacific Ocean was used to link people to other areas, including San Francisco. That was an easier two-day trip compared to traveling inland over rugged terrain. In 1916, trains linked the region to other interior settlements and towns, increasing commercial trade and tourism

Significant urban growth occurred in the 1920s, and during the 1930s to 1950s, large-scale growth occurred. Per the Oregon Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, during the 1930s to 1950s:
Shipyards contracted with the U.S. Government to build minesweepers and rescue tugs for World War II defense purposes. Large national lumber companies set up operations and expanded significantly for the next two decades. Jetty improvements, commercial fishing and crabbing shaped the development of Charleston. The completion of the North Bend Bridge (now Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge) in 1936 and the Roosevelt Highway significantly improved modern transportation connections and provided the final link in opening the Coos region to the outside world. The formerly remote district known as the Coos Bay country had come of age.
During the interregnum of despair between Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s election and his inauguration, the only bank in North Bend, the First National, was forced to temporarily close its doors, precipitating a cash-flow crisis for the City of North Bend. The city solved this problem by minting currency using myrtlewood discs printed on a newspaper press. These coins, in denominations from 25 cents to $10, were used to make payroll and the city promised to redeem them for cash as soon as it became available.

However, when the bank reopened and the city appealed for people to bring their myrtlewood money in to redeem it, many opted to keep their tokens as collector&#x27;s items. After several appeals, the city gave up and announced that the tokens would remain legal tender in the city of North Bend in perpetuity. Until the 1960s, people occasionally did cash in their tokens, but the remaining pieces have become very valuable through scarcity and historical interest. Fewer than 10 full sets are believed to exist.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate in North Bend and surrounds can be described as a very humid version of the Mediterranean climate or a dry-summer version of an oceanic climate. There is very little temperature variation throughout the year, with monthly means ranging from in December to in August, though on the rare occasions continental air masses penetrate they can be much more extreme, with the lowest on record being on December 21, 1990. Conversely, the record high is , set in July 1925. Cool breezes off the Pacific moderate the city&#x27;s climate year round. Rain is abundant in winter, due to moist low pressure troughs from the Pacific Ocean. The city&#x27;s annual rainfall is about , but totals are less than an inch in July and August. Fog often blankets the coastal fringe in summer due to the temperature gradient between the cool Pacific Ocean and the warm inland, which serves to keep temperatures markedly cooler than in Eugene or even Seattle. Snow almost never falls in the city, but can be heavy in the adjacent Oregon Coast Range. Nearby Cape Blanco is one of the windiest places on Earth, with gusts of or more achieved during severe winter storms. Annually, the city sees 25 days that fail to reach and just 12 days with a temperature at or below freezing.

The most recent temperature numbers show North Bend to be the northernmost subtropical climate weather station in North America according to the Trewartha climate classification. This is despite the station being higher in latitude than Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There are now eight months averaging above 50 °F (10 °C.)

<text>Prineville is a city in and the seat of Crook County, Oregon, United States. It was named for the first merchant to establish businesses in the present location, Barney Prine. The population was 10,429 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Prineville was founded in 1877 when Monroe Hodges filed the original plat for the city. The post office for the community had been established with the name of Prine on April 13, 1871, but changed to Prineville on December 23, 1872. The city was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 23, 1880, and obtained its first high school in 1902.

Long the major town in central Oregon, Prineville was snubbed in 1911 when the railroad tycoons James J. Hill and Edward H. Harriman bypassed the city as they laid track south from The Dalles. In a period when the presence of a railroad meant the difference between prosperity and an eventual fate as a ghost town, in a 1917 election, Prineville residents voted 355 to 1 to build their own railway, and raised the money to connect their town to the main line away.

Helped by timber harvests from the nearby Ochoco National Forest, the City of Prineville Railroad prospered for decades. The profits from the railroad were so abundant that between 1964 and 1968, the city levied no property taxes. However, with the decline of the timber industry in Oregon, the railroad reported a loss of nearly $1 million between 2002 and 2004.

Since the late 2000s, Apple and Facebook have each invested over $1 billion in multiple data centers located within Prineville city limits.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Prineville is located on the Crooked River at the mouth of Ochoco Creek, northwest of the Prineville Reservoir.

During the Miocene and Oligocene, great basaltic flows swept through the area. Barnes Butte is a prominent butte of this activity, located partially within the city.

Prineville has a cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system.

The highest temperature recorded in Prineville was 119 °F (48.3 °C), which was recorded on July 29, 1898. Hermiston also recorded the same temperature on the same day, which registered both cities as the record holders of the highest temperature recorded in Oregon. Shortly after, on August 10, 1898, Pendleton and Redmond also recorded 119 °F (48.3 °C). The most recent time Oregon’s highest temperature was recorded was on June 29, 2021 in Pelton Dam, where it also recorded 119 °F (48.3 °C).

The company announced on December 12, 2006, that it would be moving the corporate headquarters to nearby Bend, where a growing number of its executives live, including Dick Borgman who became CEO on the same day. In 2006, journalist Mike Rogoway noted:

A decade ago, Schwab could have devastated Prineville by pulling out. Now, though, the city that suffered through the downturn in the wood products industry is enjoying an economic renaissance. Federal jobs with the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service help anchor the economy [Judge Scott Cooper, Crook County administrator, was quoted], while a housing boom and a growing tourism industry have diversified the area. In December 2006, unemployment was 4.4 percent, the lowest since the 1960s.

In 2010, Prineville was selected as the location for a new data center for Facebook. This center has been met with criticism from environmental groups such as Greenpeace because the power utility company contracted for the center, PacifiCorp, generates 70 percent of its electricity from coal. Since 2010, Facebook has funded multiple projects in Prineville, including water mains and new devices at local schools.

On February 21, 2012, Apple announced that it would open a &quot;Green Data Center&quot; on a tract of land owned by the company.

Since the late 2000s, Apple and Facebook have each invested over $1 billion in multiple data centers located within Prineville city limits.

In 1906, the Brookings Timber Company hired William James Ward, a graduate in civil engineering and forestry, to come to the southern Oregon Coast and survey its lumbering potential. After timber cruising the Chetco and Pistol River areas for several years, he recommended that the Brookings people begin extensive lumbering operations here and secure a townsite for a mill and shipping center.

While John E. Brookings was responsible for the founding of Brookings as a company town, it was his cousin, Robert S. Brookings, who was responsible for its actual design. The latter Brookings hired Bernard Maybeck, an architect based in San Francisco who was later involved in the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, to lay out the plat of the townsite.

=== World War II ===

On September 9, 1942, Mount Emily near Brookings became the only site in the mainland United States and the second in the continental territory after the bombing of Dutch Harbor to suffer aerial bombardment during World War II. A Japanese floatplane piloted by Nobuo Fujita was launched from submarine &quot;I-25&quot;. The plane was armed with two incendiary bombs on a mission intended to start massive fires in the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest.

Fujita was invited to Brookings in 1962 and, as a token of friendship, gifted the city his 400-year-old family katana. Fujita later sponsored a trip to Japan for Brookings high school students and returned to the city three more times in the early 1990s. In 1997, Fujita was made an honorary citizen of Brookings by the city council.

=== 21st century ===
The current marketing &quot;brand&quot; for the community, through the Brookings-Harbor Chamber of Commerce, is &quot;The Pulse of America&#x27;s Wild Rivers Coast&quot;. America&#x27;s Wild Rivers Coast is a regional marketing brand for Curry County, Oregon, and Del Norte County, California.

==== 2011 tsunami ====
The Port of Brookings Harbor was damaged by tidal surges from a tsunami on March 11, 2011. The largest surge was estimated to be nearly . Boats were damaged, sunk, set adrift, and swept out to sea after many docks were torn away and pilings broken. The tsunami was caused by the 9.0 MW Tōhoku earthquake offshore of the east coast of Honshu Island, Japan. The damage was estimated at $25 million to $30 million.

== Geography ==

Brookings is located along the southern Oregon coast at the mouth of the Chetco River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Climate==

Brookings has a mild Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;). According to the Trewartha climate classification, Brookings has a subtropical climate (&quot;Cs&quot;) since eight months are above .

A weather phenomenon known as the &quot;Chetco Effect&quot; or the &quot;Brookings Effect&quot; can cause the temperature in Brookings near the Chetco River mouth to be much higher than the surrounding area. Adiabatic heating increases the temperature and reduces relative humidity as katabatic wind, driven by high pressure on the Great Basin, descend across the west slopes of the Cascade Range and Oregon Coast Range. The heart of Brookings, with its orientation, is protected from sea breezes coming from the northwest and the warm, dry, down-sloping winds that are funneled down the Coastal Range into the deep Chetco River gorge can reach the coast uninfluenced by the effects of the Pacific. This can result in large temperature gradients; when Brookings recorded its all-time record high on July 8, 2008 of , Crescent City, around south of Brookings, recorded a high temperature of just .

<text>Harbor (Tolowa: chit ) is an unincorporated community in Curry County, Oregon, United States. It is located across the Chetco River from the city of Brookings. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Harbor as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The population of the CDP was 2,391 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The original name of the post office in the area was &quot;Chetco&quot;, after the Chetco River. It was established in 1863 and moved several times until it closed in 1910. Meanwhile, a new post office named Harbor was established at the mouth of the Chetco River in 1894. The name of the office may have originated from the Chetco Harbor Land and Townsite Company.

==Geography==
Harbor is located in southwestern Curry County along U.S. Route 101, east of the center of Brookings and north of the California state line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 16.88%, is water.

==Climate==
Harbor, like the Brookings area, has a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;). According to the Trewartha climate classification, it has a subtropical climate (despite being a little farther north than Chicago in latitude) and is one of the northernmost North American locations to have one.

It has cool winters during which intense rainfall is broken by weeks of cool, sunny weather. Mild, dry summers with average rainfall in July and August of less than per month are usual. There are an average of only two afternoons annually with high temperatures of or higher and an average of 1.5 mornings with low temperatures of or lower. The record high temperature was on July 9, 2008. The record low temperature was on December 8, 1972.

The wettest “rain year” in Harbor was from July 1937 to June 1938 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with , although as much as fell during calendar year 1996. The most rainfall in one month was in December 1996. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on October 14, 2016. Snow is rarer, but not unusual in Harbor, averaging only per year.

Because of its location, Harbor is subject to winter (and less frequently summer) temperatures considered unusually warm for the Oregon Coast or for that matter, the North Coast of California. Temperatures can reach throughout the year. This is due mostly to its situation at the foot of the Klamath Mountains, from which winds compress and warm the air flowing onto Harbor. This is called the Brookings effect or Chetco effect, similar to the warm dry Santa Ana winds of coastal Southern California. Daffodils and other bulbs generally bloom in February. In the lowlands, heavy fog is common in the summer while the coastal hills are generally sunny and cool.

<text>Port Orford (Tolowa: tr’ee-ghi~’- ’an’ ) is a city in Curry County on the southern coast of Oregon, United States. The population was 1,133 at the 2010 census.

The city takes its name from George Vancouver&#x27;s original name for nearby Cape Blanco, which he named for George, Earl of Orford, &quot;a much-respected friend.&quot;

Port Orford is the westernmost settlement in the state of Oregon, and the westernmost incorporated place in the 48 contiguous states.

==History==

Before the arrival of European settlers, the Port Orford area was inhabited by the indigenous Tututni peoples. The Tututni languages were a part of the Pacific Coast Athabaskan language family.

Spanish explorer Bartoleme Ferrelo mapped Cape Blanco in 1543. It remained the farthest north point on the coastal map until 1778, when British explorer Captain Cook found land farther west. Captain George Vancouver sighted land and named it Port Orford in 1792. In June 1851, Captain William Tichenor, in command of the U.S.S. &quot;Seagull&quot;, pulled into Port Orford, leaving behind nine men. Fort Orford, a U.S. Army fort, was established 14 Sep 1851 near the town and lasted until 22 Aug 1856.

In October 1941, then-mayor Gilbert Gable, frustrated with the poor condition of the state roads around Port Orford, which hampered both travel and economic development, suggested that a number of counties along the Oregon and California state border should secede and create the State of Jefferson. This movement came to an end with U.S. involvement in World War II.

==Geography==

<text>Bend is a city in central Oregon and the county seat of Deschutes County, Oregon, United States. It is located to the east of the Cascade Range, on the Deschutes River.

The site became known by pioneers as a fordable crossing point of the river, where it ran through a bend. An 1870s ranch popularized the name &quot;Farewell Bend&quot;, with the post office later distinguishing the area as Bend. It was incorporated as a city in 1905, starting off as a logging town. In 1910, Mirror Pond was created as a dammed river reservoir to provide energy. In 1950, the two major logging companies were consolidated due to depleted timber, causing an economic drop. In later decades, it experienced rapid growth as a center of recreation.

Situated in the high desert, Bend is bordered by the Deschutes National Forest to the southwest. Economically, it is a tourist destination, featuring recreational attractions (e.g. breweries, an amphitheater, and the last Blockbuster video-rental store) as well as outdoor sports, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, paragliding, and golf.

Bend is Central Oregon&#x27;s most populous city. In the 2020 census, it had a population of 99,178, with the eponymous metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population totaling 247,493.

==History==

===Early history===
Native Americans hunted and fished in the area. In late 1824, members of a fur-trapping party led by Peter Skene Ogden visited the area. John C. Frémont, John Strong Newberry, and other United States Army survey parties came next. Subsequent pioneers heading further west passed through the area and forded the Deschutes River at a canyonless double bend, which may have actually been referred to as &quot;Farewell Bend&quot;. The area was settled by Euro-Americans in the 1870s. John Young Todd, a Missourian who participated in the Mexican War (and for whom Todd Lake is named), purchased a land claim in the area and named it &quot;Farewell Bend Ranch&quot;. Todd sold this to John Sisemore in 1881, who applied for a post office in 1886. Because the name &quot;Farewell Bend&quot; was already in use, it was shortened to &quot;Bend&quot; by the United States Post Office Department.

===20th century===

Constructed in May 1901, the Pilot Butte Development Company&#x27;s little plant was the first commercial sawmill in Bend, also providing the town&#x27;s first irrigation. The original location was at the rear of the Pilot Butte Inn of later years. Steidl and Reed also set up a small mill in Bend in 1903. This was on the Deschutes River just below the Pioneer Park area. The mill was operated by water power.

A small community developed around the area. In 1904, a city was incorporated by a general vote of the community&#x27;s 300 residents; it was platted by Pilot Butte Development Company on May 28, 1904. On January 4, 1905, the city held its first official meeting as an incorporated municipality, appointing A. H. Goodwillie as its first mayor.

In 1910, Mirror Pond was created by the construction of the Bend Water, Light &amp; Power Company dam on the Deschutes River in Bend. The dam provided the city with its initial source of electricity. The dam has been owned by Pacific Power since 1926 and still produces electricity that supplies approximately 200 Bend households. In 1916, Deschutes County was formed from the western half of Crook County and Bend was designated as the county seat. In 1929, Bend amended the charter and adopted the council–manager form of government.

The 1950 closure of Shevlin-Hixon Lumber Company (which was sold to Brooks-Scanlon), due to a lack of significant timber, caused the largest economic drop in the region since the Great Depression. In later decades, it experienced rapid growth as a center for both recreation and retirement.

===21st century===
On August 28, 2022, a mass shooting occurred at a Safeway grocery store in Bend. Two senior citizens, one of whom was an employee at the store, were killed, and two others were wounded before the gunman committed suicide.

==Geography==
Bend sits on the boundary of the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills, a Level III ecoregion designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and California, and the Deschutes River Valley, a Level IV ecoregion within the Blue Mountains Level III ecoregion.

The Deschutes River runs through Bend, where it is dammed to form Mirror Pond. Bend&#x27;s elevation is above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Inside the city limits is Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint, an old cinder cone. Bend is one of three cities in the continental U.S. (with Portland, Oregon, and Jackson, Mississippi) to have an extinct volcano within its city limits. It is reached by U.S. Route 20. A lesser known characteristic of Bend, the Horse Lava Tube System enters and borders the eastern edge of the city. Just south of Bend is Newberry National Volcanic Monument on U.S. Route 97.

==Economy==
Tourism is one of Bend&#x27;s largest sectors. The Mount Bachelor ski resort brings in tourists from all over Oregon, Washington, and California. The nearby Cascade Lakes are also a large draw for tourists. Recreational activities include downhill and cross country skiing, hiking, biking, rafting, golfing, camping, fishing, picnicking, rock climbing, and general sightseeing. Transient room tax revenues through the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 equaled $2,221,610.

The transient room tax is used in partnership with Visit Bend and the Bend Economic Development Advisory Board to convert visitors to Bend into residents and business owners. In 2011, Visit Bend reported that families are the largest demographic that visit Bend (35%), while couples with no children make up the second largest portion (24%) of visitors to the city. During the same year, tourism generated $570 million and employed 16% of the city&#x27;s workforce. Brauns, L. (November 21, 2021). According to a 2019 economic impact data from Travel Oregon, “the local tourism industry employs 10,000 people and brings in more than $1 billion into the regional economy” 

Room taxes attributed to tourism in Bend is divided up to be given back to the community. Bend, Oregon depends on $7 million in the room tax income that essentially funds services for Streets, Fire, and Police. $3 million are specifically contributed to Tourism Promotion. As of April 2021, the Bend City Council has agreed to spend an undisclosed portion of the $3 million to maintain some of the trails in the city.

Bend is home to the Deschutes Brewery, the eighth-largest craft brewery in the nation and the largest of over a dozen microbreweries in the city. Each year the city hosts many events celebrating its brewing culture, including the Bend Oktoberfest, the Little Woody Barrel Aged Brew and Whiskey Fest, Bend Brewfest, and Central Oregon Beer Week. Beer aficionados can also visit many of the breweries along the Bend Ale Trail. As of 2018, there were 23 breweries in Bend and 4 hard cider companies. Since 2017, Bend&#x27;s Worthy Brewing has hosted an observatory with a 16-inch reflecting Ritchey–Chrétien telescope.

===Top employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

In 2005, Bend&#x27;s economic profile comprised five industry categories: tourism (7,772 jobs); healthcare and social services (6,062 jobs); professional, scientific and technical services (1,893 jobs); wood products manufacturing (1,798 jobs); and recreation and transportation equipment (1,065 jobs).

In 2019, the officially licensed Blockbuster Video in the city became the last remaining one in the world.

Much of Bend&#x27;s rapid growth in recent years is also due to its attraction as a retirement destination.

Bend has also become a commuter town for a number of tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle metropolitan area despite the extreme commute, due to its appeal to the outdoors as well as its relatively cheap cost of living compared to the skyrocketing rent and housing prices of the Bay Area and Seattle.

===Construction and real estate===
In 2005 construction and real estate accounted for 17.3 percent of all jobs in the Bend metropolitan statistical area (MSA), which constitutes all of Deschutes County. This figure is about 70 percent more than the proportion of construction and real estate jobs in the Oregon and national economies. Construction activity in Bend appears to be slowing. The number of building permit applications received by the Bend City Building Division fell from 826 in August 2006 to 533 in August 2007, a 35 percent decrease.

A large influx of new residents drawn by Bend&#x27;s lifestyle amenities, along with the low interest rates and easy lending that fostered a national housing boom in 2001–05, resulted in increased activity in Bend&#x27;s construction and real estate sectors and caused the rate of home price appreciation in Bend to grow substantially during that period. Median home prices in the Bend MSA increased by over 80% in the 2001–05 period.

In June 2006, &quot;Money&quot; magazine named the Bend MSA the fifth most overpriced real estate market in the United States. By September 2006, the Bend metro area ranked second in the list of most overpriced housing markets, and in June 2007 it was named the most overpriced housing market in America.

The 2008−09 housing downturn had a strong effect on Bend&#x27;s housing and economic situation. According to the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, single-family home prices dropped more than 40 percent from a peak of $396,000 in May 2007 to $221,000 in March 2009. Additional signs of the housing downturn include an April 2009 Deschutes county unemployment rate of 12.6 percent and in a tri-county area of Deschutes, Crook and Jefferson counties a 66 percent rise in homelessness from 2006 to 2,237.

In May 2010, the Federal Housing and Finance Agency released a report in which Bend had the largest price drop in the country, 23 percent, from first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010.

==Arts and culture==

The city is becoming known for its burgeoning art scene, and is home to numerous visual and fine art galleries, as well as the independent BendFilm Festival, which launched in 2004.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Air====
The nearest commercial airport is Roberts Field (RDM) in Redmond, north of Bend. Alaska Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Horizon Air and SkyWest Airlines (flying as Alaska Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express) provide direct service to Burbank, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Rosa, and San Francisco. The U.S. Forest Service operates an air base and training center for firefighting.

Bend Municipal Airport (KBDN) is located northeast of the city and serves general aviation. Several significant general aviation companies are based at Bend Airport, including Precise Flight, which develops oxygen systems, speed brakes, landing lights and other modifications for general aviation aircraft, and Epic Aircraft.

====Bus====
The Bend Hawthorne Transit Center is a hub for the Cascades East Transit center with connections to intercity bus services including Pacific Crest Bus Lines, POINT Intercity Bus Service, the People Mover, and the Central Oregon Breeze.

Bend was previously the only metropolitan area west of the Mississippi River without a public bus system. A measure that would have created a transit district was on the November 2004 ballot, but was defeated 53 to 41 percent. As of August 2006, however, funding was acquired and the B.A.T. (Bend Area Transit) bus service began on a limited basis. Buses have been running since September 27, 2006.

During summer 2007, not a single bus purchased was in operation (though several were due to weak A/C systems) and litigation was underway.

There are currently nine fixed bus routes offered by Cascades East Transit in Bend. The city is also started experimenting with a shared-ride van in 2019. The project was initially designed to find a replacement for a cancelled route that had limited riders.

====Roads and highways====
Bend lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 97. The latter runs on an expressway alignment through the city known as the Bend Parkway; a business route for US 97 runs along 3rd Street. The city is also served by the Century Drive Highway No. 372 which provides access to Mount Bachelor.

In an effort to improve the safety of the city&#x27;s non-driving residents, Bend has been implementing roundabouts within the city.

====Rail====
A BNSF main line runs north–south through the city; there are numerous spurs off of the main line which serve industrial rail customers. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway ran passenger service six days a week on a mixed train along that line from Bend to Wishram, Washington until some point between 1968 and 1970. The closest Amtrak station is in Chemult, approximately to the south; it is served by the Seattle–Los Angeles &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;.

====Sustainable practices====
In 2016, Bend adopted the Transportation System Plan, which is a 20-year plan that strives to achieve a healthy, equitable future for the entire community. The city is using community input to help this plan move forward, using experiments and data to drive their decisions on how people move within the city while incorporating land use throughout.

In July 2019, Oregon State University Cascade launched a ride share program as part of a study called Ride Bend, which was active until March 2020. Ride Bend hired the transit company Downtowner to help set up and implement an on demand, app based, electric van service in Bend&#x27;s west side. Part of Ride Bend&#x27;s study was to see whether people prefer sharing rides to get to their destination over fixed bus routes.

Ride Bend noticed that few people were using public transportation within the city, and many bus systems, such as Cascades East Transit, had to cancel their services because not enough people were taking the bus. Ride Bend not only succeeded in getting people to use public transportation again, effectively helping with traffic calming, but they also brought people to broader areas within the city.

An estimated 40,000 people have moved to Bend since the Transportation System Plan was written, and most of them brought cars with them.

While Ride Bend is directly addressing carbon emissions, plenty of other businesses surrounding Bend are reducing the amount of impact a car has on the environment after its use. Tires can be processed and reused, batteries and oil can be treated so no toxic waste gets put into the surface runoff in the streets and landfill.
While the Transportation System Plan just began in 2016, the city looks towards a 20-year investment in creating a brighter future in transportation use and waste management.

<text>La Pine is a city in Deschutes County, Oregon, United States, incorporated on December 7, 2006.

La Pine is part of the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,512 people as of the 2020 Census. La Pine is in an isolated area of Central Oregon, consisting of a loose collection of homes and businesses along U.S. Highway 97 about southwest of Bend. Several peaks of the Cascade Range are prominently visible from the community.

La Pine is in the valley of the Little Deschutes River, a tributary of the Deschutes River. The river provides recreational opportunities such as fishing, swimming, canoeing and other leisure activities.

==History==
The area&#x27;s first European-American settlement was established in the 1800s by French fur trappers. La Pine was founded in the 19th century with Huntington Road as the main street. The original name for the community was Rosland. A post office by that name was started in 1897, followed by a townsite in 1900. Construction on the Oregon Trunk Railroad started in 1908 by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway at the Columbia River. The route was designed to follow the Deschutes River, and the line later became part of BNSF Railway. The line was built to Bend, with the railroad later buying a line owned by the Shevlin-Hixon Lumber Company that continued to La Pine. What became U.S. 97 was completed in 1917, which used the right of way of the Oregon Trunk Line that had not been built south of Bend.

In 2000, a branch of the Deschutes Public Library was built in the community. La Pine had remained an unincorporated community for many years. A measure to incorporate in the 2000 elections was rejected by a 2–1 ratio. In the elections of 2006, another incorporation measure was placed on the ballot (one of two such measures in Oregon that year; the other being for Bull Mountain, Oregon). The measure passed, creating the City of La Pine. The city occupies , and at the time of incorporation in December 2006, had 1,585 residents. Much of the former census-designated area lies outside the city limits.

==Government==
The city operates under a council–mayor form of city government. Voters elect four at-large councilors who serve four-year terms, and a mayor who serves a two-year term. As of 2021, Daniel Richer served as mayor, with the other council members being Karen Morse, Courtney Ignazzitto, Mike Shields, and Cathi Van Damme. Fire services are provided by the La Pine Rural Fire Protection District, and the La Pine Library is a branch of the Deschutes Public Library System.

At the federal level, La Pine lies in Oregon&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Cliff Bentz. In the State Senate, the city is in District 28, represented by Dennis Linthicum, and in the House, it lies in District 55, represented by Vikki Breese-Iverson.

<text>Drain is a city in Douglas County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,151 at the 2010 census. Drain is named after town founder and politician Charles J. Drain, who donated of nearby land to the Oregon and California Railroad in 1871.

==History==
In 1876, a coach road was established between Drain and Scottsburg. Drain was the starting point for the Drain-Coos Bay stage line, which ran to Scottsburg and then by river steamer to Gardiner and the beach on the south side of the mouth of the Umpqua River.

The Drain Normal School was founded in the community in 1883 by the Methodist Church. The state took over the school in 1885 and named it as the Central Oregon State Normal School, before it closed in June 1908.

== Geography and climate==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Drain is at the crossroads of Oregon Route 99 and Oregon Route 38, at a pass in the Coast Range, on the way west to the Pacific Ocean.

Elk Creek and Pass Creek, both tributaries of the Umpqua River, converge in Drain.

Pass Creek Bridge, a covered bridge in a park behind the Drain Civic Center, was formerly a road bridge. In 1987, the city moved the structure to the park and opened it to pedestrian traffic only. In 2014, the city completely closed the bridge, made unsafe by rotting support timbers.

Drain, like most of western Oregon, has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with dry summers featuring cool mornings and hot afternoons, and chilly, if not severe, wet winters. Occasionally during the winter a cold air mass from the interior will cross the Cascades to bring very cold weather and frost, although Drain gets very little snow with a mean of , a monthly maximum of in January 1950, and a season maximum of in 1970/1971. The coldest month was January 1930 with a mean of , whilst January 1949 with is the only other subfreezing month. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Drain is on January 22, 1962. Rainfall in winter is usually heavy: the wettest month on record is December 1955 which totalled , whilst the wettest &quot;rain year&quot; since 1903 has been from July 1973 to June 1974 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with . The most precipitation in a single day has been on January 18, 1951.

During the summer months, days are usually hot and clear, whilst nights are cool: in the summer of 2003 only of rain fell over the three months, and in 1951 no measurable precipitation occurred for ninety-five days between May 24 and August 26. When a continental airflow occurs, the weather can become extremely hot: on July 31, 2015, a record was recorded; however, the cool nights have allowed for frost-level temperatures as low as on June 10 of 1916 and on August 28 of 1905.

After construction of a railroad line south from Roseburg in 1881–83, Solomon Abraham, the local right-of-way agent, platted the community and named it &quot;Julia&quot; after his wife. After a dispute with Abraham, A. F. Morris, the chief engineer for the railroad, changed the name to &quot;Glendale&quot;. A Julia post office was established in February 1883, and its name was changed to Glendale in August of the same year. L. D. Montgomery was the first postmaster. Fire destroyed much of Glendale&#x27;s business district in 1928. Glendale was quickly rebuilt.

In the 1880s, Russian-Jewish immigrants came here trying to escape the anti-Semitic rule of Alexander III. New Odessa, the first Jewish Communitarian Community in America settled near Glendale. By 1888 the New Odessa Community disbanded due to political and religious division.

<text>Reedsport is a coastal town in northwest Douglas County, Oregon, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,310. It is located about 73 miles northwest of Roseburg, the county seat.

== History ==
Reedsport was established on the estuary of the Umpqua River on January 7, 1852. It was named for a local settler, Alfred W. Reed, who founded the city in 1912. The post office was established July 17, 1912.

The building of Southern Pacific Railroad lines extending south to Coos Bay led to the development of Reedsport. Before the post office was established in 1912, Reedsport was a camp for railroad construction workers.

Built on marshy ground, for much of its history Reedsport has struggled with frequent flooding; most of its early buildings were elevated above ground. After a devastating flood in 1964, a dike was constructed to protect the lower town. During this flood, the waters reached the fish hatchery and overflowed the fish troughs allowing hundreds of thousands of smallmouth bass to be introduced into the Umpqua River. According to fishing reports small-mouth bass became the most abundant fish in the river. Every few years, high water induces city employees to close the dikes to prevent low-lying areas of the city from flooding.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, Reedsport struggled with the collapse of the Oregon timber industry. In the last two decades, Reedsport has seen an increase of tourism. Part of this is due to its close proximity to the fishing of the Umpqua River. Another part of the recent surge in tourism is due to the sand dunes that are near Reedsport.

Although the U.S. Forest Service maintains a local office in the town, Reedsport&#x27;s historic connection with the timber industry ended in 1999 with the closing of the International Paper plant in nearby Gardiner.

Recently, Reedsport has seen a rise in tourism due to recreation at the nearby Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area in Winchester Bay. A number of businesses catering to all-terrain vehicles have opened in Reedsport to serve the needs of this growing activity.

==Geography and climate==
Reedsport is at the junction of Oregon Route 38 and U.S. Route 101, north of Winchester Bay and northwest of Roseburg.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Reedsport has a rainy Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), with mild dry summers and mild, very wet winters. Although 26.3 mornings will fall below , only 0.9 afternoons reach , and the hottest temperature recorded is only on August 29, 1944, and September 5, 1973. Only 0.2 afternoons fail to top freezing each year, and the coldest temperature is on December 8, 1972. The wettest month record is November 1973 with , whilst June to September have on occasions been rainless.

==Renewable energy==
Plans for a 100-buoy commercial wave park in the ocean near Reedsport fell through in 2014, when Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a renewable energy company based in New Jersey, abandoned the project. The park, which would have been built in an area known for high-value fishing and crabbing, was opposed by the Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission. OPT listed high costs, technical challenges, and complicated negotiations with governments and stakeholders among its reasons for cancelling the project. As of 2014, OPT still had plans for a much smaller project near Reedsport.

<doc id="130747" wikidata="Q1442482" url="?curid=130747" title="People First Party (Taiwan)">
<text>The People First Party (PFP, ) is a centrist to centre-right political party in Taiwan.

The party was founded by James Soong in March 2000 after his failed independent presidential bid earlier in the January 2000 presidential election; Soong was previously expelled from the Kuomintang after launching an independent bid. In the 2001 legislative election, it became the third-largest party in the Legislative Yuan. In the 2004 presidential election, the KMT-PFP joint ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong narrowly lost to President Chen Shui-bian. In the 2008 legislative election, the party lost all but one of its seats, though it rebounded to three seats in the 2012 legislative election.

Soong ran again in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, gathering 2.77% and 12.84% of the vote respectively. In 2020, Soong announced his last presidential bid; he lost the election with a vote share of 4.26%. In the concurrent 2020 legislative election, the PFP lost all of its seats in the Legislative Yuan.

==History==

The PFP was founded by James Soong and his supporters after his failed independent bid for the presidency in 2000. Soong was previously a member of the Kuomintang but was expelled from the party after he announced an independent presidential bid. Soong himself is the chairman, and dominates much of its politics. The name of the party, &quot;People First&quot; (親民), has Confucian connotations.

The party maintains a close but tense relationship with the Kuomintang (KMT) as part of the pan-blue coalition. However, since PFP had, like the New Party, grown out of the KMT, the two parties had to compete for the same set of voters. This dynamic in which both the KMT and PFP must simultaneously compete and cooperate with each other has led to complex and interesting politics.

In several notable cases, this has led to situations in which both parties have run candidates, but close to the election the party with the less popular candidate unofficially dropped out of the race. This in turn has led to some notable situations when either the PFP or the KMT has campaigned against its own candidate, which has led to intra-party resentment.

To avoid a repeat of this effect, which led to the election of Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian to the presidency in 2000 by a low share of votes, Chairman Soong ran as vice-president on KMT Chairman Lien Chan&#x27;s presidential ticket in the 2004 presidential election.

After his defeat in the Taipei mayoral elections held on 9 December 2006, Soong announced that he would retire from politics. At this point, with no clear goals, the PFP faced an uncertain future, and considered merging with the Kuomintang (KMT). After much negotiation, the PFP and the KMT did not merge.

=== Presidential bids ===

In September 2011, James Soong mounted the PFP&#x27;s first presidential bid and selected academic Ruey-Shiung Lin to be his running mate for the 2012 election, collecting enough signatures to make it on the ballot. While analysts feared that a PFP run would split the Pan-Blue Coalition vote and hand a winnable election to the DPP (as was the case in the 2000 Presidential election), Soong insisted that his campaign was a serious one and that he would complete his run. On election day, the Soong-Lin ticket underperformed and garnered 2.77% of votes, while Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT defeated Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP by a margin of 51.60% to 45.63%. In the concurrent legislative election the PFP won 5.46% of the party-list vote, gaining them two seats in the Legislative Yuan, and in addition won one district seat for a total of three seats.

Soong would launch presidential bids in 2016 and 2020 as well. In 2016, he would garner 12.84% of the vote, compared with 31.04% going to Eric Chu of the KMT and 56.12% going to Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP. In 2020 he would garner 4.26% of the vote, compared with 38.61% going to Han Kuo-yu of the KMT and 57.13% going to Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP. In 2016, they would maintain their seats in the legislature; however, in 2020, the PFP failed to meet the 5% threshold for party-list representation and also did not win any district seats, and was no longer represented in the Legislative Yuan. Prior to the election result in 2020, James Soong announced that his 2020 bid would be his last, throwing the future of the party into question.

== Political positions ==
The People First Party is considered to be to be a centrist or centre-right political party.

The official goals of PFP, as regards to cross-strait relationships and diplomacy, is for the ROC to: participate in more international organizations, promote Chinese culture overseas and seek economic and cultural interaction between Taiwan and the mainland. Its views are seen as generally favorable towards Chinese unification and staunchly against Taiwan independence.

<doc id="130750" wikidata="Q706723" url="?curid=130750" title="James Soong">
<text>Soong Chu-yu (; born 30 April 1942), also known by his English name James Soong, is a Taiwanese political scientist and politician who is the founder and chairman of the People First Party. Soong was the first and only elected governor of Taiwan Province from 1994 and 1998. He was a candidate in the 2000 presidential election, which he lost to Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

Born in Hunan to a Kuomintang military family, Soong graduated from National Chengchi University and was educated in the United States, where he earned his PhD in political science from Georgetown University. He began his political career as a secretary to Premier Chiang Ching-kuo and rose to prominence as director-general of the Government Information Office (GIO) from 1979 to 1984. Upon Chiang&#x27;s death, Soong was instrumental in silencing conservatives in the KMT from blocking the ascendancy of Lee Teng-hui as KMT leader. From 1994 to 1998, he was the only elected governor of Taiwan Province.

After failing to gain the KMT nomination, Soong ran as an independent in the 2000 presidential election. Though he placed second, his candidacy split the pan-Blue vote between himself and the KMT candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, leading to the victory of DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian. In the 2004 presidential election, he ran as vice president on the ticket of Lien Chan; they narrowly lost to Chen Shui-bian. Soong ran again as a candidate in the 2012 presidential race, garnering 2.77% of popular support. Soong&#x27;s third presidential campaign in 2016 formed a split ticket with Minkuotang chairwoman Hsu Hsin-ying and won 12.84% of the vote. His 2020 campaign with running mate Sandra Yu finished last, with 4.2% of the vote. 

== Early life and education ==
Soong was born in China on April 30, 1942, in Xiangtan, Hunan, province. His father, , was a career military officer staunchly loyal to Republic of China (ROC) President Chiang Kai-shek and rose to the rank of major general in the Nationalist Army from an enlisted sailor. After the Kuomintang (KMT) defeat in the Chinese Civil War, the family fled to Taiwan in 1949 during the Retreat of the government of the Republic of China. 

In 1964, Soong graduated from National Chengchi University with his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree specializing in diplomacy. He then went to complete graduate studies in the United States, where he earned a Master of Arts (M.A.) in political science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1967, then a Master of Science (M.S.) in library and information science from the Catholic University of America in 1971. He remained in Washington, D.C., to study for his doctorate and earned his Ph.D. in political science from Georgetown University in 1974. His doctoral dissertation was titled, &quot;An Elite Perspective On Developmental Crisis: China&#x27;s Experiences in Inner Mongolia.&quot;

While at Berkeley, Soong met his future wife Viola Chen (), with whom he had a son and a daughter.

== Early career==
As he was finishing his doctoral studies, Government Information Office (GIO) Director Fredrick Chien recommended Soong to be the English secretary of then-premier Chiang Ching-kuo. Soong served as secretary to the premier from 1974 to 1977 and with Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s accession to the presidency, the personal secretary to the president from 1978 to 1981 and 1984 to 1989. Soong gained his public fame on December 16, 1978, when he addressed the nation following the decision of the administration of U.S. president Jimmy Carter to break ties with the ROC in order to switch ties to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Soon afterwards, President Chiang promoted Soong to become the youngest director-general of the GIO, in which he served from 1979 to 1984.

===Rise of Lee Teng-hui===
Upon Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s death in 1988, Soong was seen as instrumental in consolidating the power of the new president, Lee Teng-hui. Soong was part of the Palace Faction () that included Chiang loyalists such as Hau Pei-tsun and Lee Huan and which sought to limit Lee Teng-hui and his native Taiwanese faction&#x27;s role in the government. During the KMT&#x27;s central standing committee on the day of Chiang&#x27;s funeral, when the Palace Faction sought to delay Lee&#x27;s accession to the party chairmanship, Soong unexpectedly made an impassioned plea in favour of Lee, declaring that &quot;Each day of delay is a day of disrespect to Ching-kuo.&quot; He also made a veiled criticism of Soong Mei-ling (no relation), implying that she had returned to Taiwan after her stepson&#x27;s death to try to reassume power.

Soong established himself as one of the few mainlanders who were also loyal to Lee. In support of Soong, Lee coined the term &quot;New Taiwanese&quot; to describe a person born in mainland China, raised in Taiwan, who calls Taiwan home. Lee moved swiftly to promote Soong to KMT Secretary-General, a position Soong held from 1989 to 1993. In 1993, Lee appointed him Governor of Taiwan Province.

In June 1993, Soong opened a Credit Suisse account, three months after he had stepped down as KMT secretary-general, and it closed in 2010. In 2007 he held over 13 million Swiss francs in it, which is incompatible by his official salary as a public servant. The account is one of a number of things which have led to implications of his involvement in the Taiwan frigate scandal.

== Governor of Taiwan (1994–98) ==
In 1994 Soong was elected and became the only directly elected governor of Taiwan Province. He was widely perceived to be an excellent campaigner and his excellent showing in the governorship ended hopes by the DPP of a &quot;Yeltsin effect&quot;, by which an elected governor would have more legitimacy than the national government, due to the president being still elected by the National Assembly at that time.

Despite his &quot;Waishengren&quot; background, Soong proved to be a popular politician among all ethnic groups on Taiwan, in part because he was one of the first KMT politicians to attempt to speak in Taiwanese Hokkien in political and formal occasions.

After Premier Lien Chan was elected vice-president in 1996, the premiership was vacated in 1997 after the Judicial Yuan ruled out that the person could not serve both vice-president and premier. Soong felt that as Governor of Taiwan, he was the natural successor to Lien, but President Lee believed that Soong should serve out his term. President Lee appointed Vincent Siew, whom Soong considered a subordinate, and this act led to the split between Soong and Lee.

The position of Governor of Taiwan was eliminated in December 1998 following a National Development Council meeting in 1996, when it suggested that the administrative structure of the Taiwanese government be streamlined. Soong and his supporters believe this to have been a political move by President Lee to cut off Soong&#x27;s power base, but proponents of the downsizing called it a pragmatic move to eliminate administrative redundancies. Soong tendered his resignation on December 31 of the same year, but President Lee did not accept it.

== Perennial candidate (2000–present) ==

===2000 presidential election===
After losing the KMT presidential nomination to then-vice president Lien Chan, Soong ran as an independent in the 2000 presidential election. Soong advocated a gradual union between Taiwan and the mainland by first signing a non-aggression pact followed by the formation of a cross-strait union similar to the European Union. His platform called for the characterization of relations between the mainland and Taiwan as neither foreign nor domestic. Although widely seen as the candidate most friendly to mainland China, Soong took particular effort to counter the perception that he would &quot;sell out&quot; Taiwan.

The KMT responded by expelling Soong and his supporters from the party. In the final months leading to the 2000 elections, the KMT, then under Lee Teng-hui&#x27;s leadership, sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party secretary-general, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late president Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Company. In defense he stated that the money in those bank accounts was in fact all from the KMT, and he insisted that the money transfer was authorized by then-KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui. These statements have been substantiated by an internal KMT memo signed by Lee which were published by the court many years later.

The scandal hurt Soong&#x27;s clean image. Initially leading in the polls, Soong narrowly lost the election with 36.84% of the vote to Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party with 39.3%. Lien came in a distant third with only 23.1%. One common belief from the pro-blue camp in Taiwan is that Lee Teng-hui favored the unpopular Vice President Lien Chan over the highly popular Soong in a deliberate effort to sabotage the Kuomintang and was secretly supporting Chen, even though Lee is supposed to favor Kuomintang&#x27;s own nominee Lien. Some believe Lee feared Soong would expose the corruption in his administration and undermine his legacy.

After losing the election, Soong&#x27;s supporters protested in front of the KMT party headquarters and blockaded the building for a few days. They succeeded in pressuring Lee Teng-hui to resign as KMT chairman in favor of Lien Chan. Within weeks, Soong and his supporters formed the People First Party (PFP), considered a spin-off from the KMT.

Prosecutors later dropped all charges against Soong in the Chunghsing scandal. In 2003, the investigation was reopened, with former president Lee (now expelled from the KMT and the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union) testifying against Soong in court. However, with the KMT allied with the PFP for the 2004 presidential election, the KMT aided Soong in his defence, providing documents signed by Lee. KMT chairman Lien Chan claimed the KMT was misled into filing the lawsuit against Soong. The KMT dropped the charges and is still trying to collect the money that had been returned and deposited in the court by Soong.

=== 2004 presidential election ===
Despite the personal rivalries between Lien, the KMT chairman after 2000, and Soong, the KMT and People First Party pledged to cooperate in future elections to prevent splitting the vote. Though losses in the 2001 legislative election made the DPP the largest single party in the Legislative Yuan, the pan-Blue Coalition retained a narrow majority over the pan-Green Coalition.

Soong ran as a vice presidential candidate under Lien Chan in the 2004 election. Some believe that the PFP&#x27;s lack of experienced candidates in the December 2002 mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung (the PFP supported the KMT&#x27;s candidates), and the PFP&#x27;s poor performance the city council elections in those cities at the same time were major setbacks to Soong&#x27;s chances of being the KMT-PFP candidate for president. There were widespread rumours that Soong agreed to take the vice-presidential post in exchange for a pledge by Lien to give him significant power, including the premiership. Many KMT members opposed the linkage, considering Soong an opportunist and traitor. Soong&#x27;s supporters pointed out that he was more popular than Lien, as consistently demonstrated by polls and the results of the 2000 presidential elections. Though both men garnered a combined 60% of the vote in 2000 (compared to Chen&#x27;s 39%), they lost to Chen in 2004 by a mere 0.22% of the vote and never conceded.

=== 2005 ===
After the 2004 presidential election, Soong actively sought the merger of the KMT and People First Party. However, he ceased doing so after the 2004 legislative election. Although the pan-blue coalition did well, the PFP did not, and Soong ended talk of a KMT-PFP merger. In February 2005, he signed a 10-point consensus program with President Chen Shui-bian, which brought heavy criticism to Chen. The possibility of DPP-PFP cooperation ended in May 2005, when Soong visited mainland China to meet with General Secretary Hu Jintao of the Chinese Communist Party. Initially, Chen stated that Soong would deliver a secret message to the PRC leadership, but Soong denied this.

In the 2005 KMT chairmanship election, Soong, who retained a significant following within the KMT, despite initially instructing party officials not to support either Ma Ying-jeou or Wang Jin-pyng, endorsed Wang at the last minute. However, the endorsement appeared to backfire as Ma defeated Wang by a large margin of 72% to 28%. On July 22, 2005, Soong, unopposed, was re-elected chairman of the PFP.

On November 17, 2005, Soong was awarded NT$10 million in a defamation suit against former president Lee Teng-hui, who had alleged that Soong was playing mahjong while his supporters were protesting on the streets in April 2004. A three-judge panel of the Taipei District Court ruled that Lee must apologize and compensate Soong, saying that Lee&#x27;s &quot;groundless&quot; remark had damaged Soong&#x27;s reputation. In addition, the court ordered Lee to publish a half-page apology in major newspapers for three consecutive days.

Soong&#x27;s visit to mainland China followed quickly on the heels of the visit of KMT chairman Lien Chan. Beyond a sentimental visit, the important political aspect of his tour came from his visit to Beijing. There, he shook hands with CCP general secretary Hu Jintao and exchanged presents with him; Soong gave Hu a work of glass art from Liuli Gongfang, and received a piece of Jingdezhen porcelain from Hu. Soong was only the second major political figure from Taiwan ever to do so. The carefully scripted red carpet ceremony was identical to the previous greeting for KMT chairman Lien Chan. The key outcome of the meeting was the publication of a shared political platform between the Communist Party and Soong&#x27;s People&#x27;s First Party. Finally, Soong lectured at Tsinghua University, an echo of Lien&#x27;s lecture at Peking University four weeks prior.

Soong&#x27;s visit was designed to emphasize his belief in the common shared roots of the Chinese people, reflecting his pro-unification sentiment. He specifically chose to honour the historical ancestor of the Chinese people, the contemporary father of the Republic of China, and then his own direct ancestors in that precise order. His public comments also addressed this continuous theme, receiving rapturous support from his mainland audience. The political consensus borne of the visit between the PFP and the CPC called for practical actions towards establishing links between Taiwan and mainland China while firmly resisting Taiwanese independence.

=== 2006 Taipei mayoral election===

====Tax issue====
On August 17, 2006, Taiwan&#x27;s Administrative Supreme Court handed down a ruling against Soong in a tax evasion case. He was charged gift taxes by the National Tax Administration from events in 1994 when he wired NT$42 million from his election campaign account to that of his daughter-in-law in the United States. Soong argued that he had wired the money to his daughter-in-law to pay off remaining campaign debts and to establish a foundation and that he was not simply &quot;gifting&quot; the money to her. The court, however, found that the first money was not given to the foundation until December 2001 and ruled that the money had been used as his private assets and that, therefore, gift tax was payable. He was assessed NT$13 million in gift tax, with a fine of NT$13 million, for a total sum of NT$26 million.

====Taipei campaign====
On October 18, 2006, Soong formally announced and registered his candidacy for the mayoralty of Taipei City, Taiwan&#x27;s capital and largest city, in the local government elections to be held in December 2006. Soong registered as a &quot;non-partisan&quot; candidate without a party affiliation, declaring that he had taken a leave of absence from his post as chairman of the PFP.

After his defeat in the Taipei mayoral election on 9 December 2006, in which he won only 4% of cast ballots, James Soong announced that he would retire from politics, which entailed giving up the chairmanship of his party, the PFP. With this announcement and no clear goal, the PFP face an uncertain future, which could speed up any merger with the Kuomintang.

====Claims made by former president Chen Shui-bian====
Chen Shui-bian claimed in an interview with a cable TV channel in May 2005 that Soong met Chen Yunlin in the United States in February of that year.

Following this claim, on February 15, 2007, Taipei District Court ruled Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian must pay James Soong NT$3 million (US$91,183) in damages and apologize in the top three newspapers for his allegation that Soong met secretly with China&#x27;s State Council Taiwan Affairs Office director Chen Yunlin in 2005. The court said President Chen failed to carry out necessary verification before making his allegation. 

PFP spokesman Lee Hung-Chun said the ruling &quot;gave justice to Soong&quot;, but said that it had come too late. Chen&#x27;s counsel said that he would appeal the ruling.

=== 2012 presidential election===
After a petition, Soong, for the first time as a People First Party presidential candidate, ran the 2012 presidential election together with Lin Ruey-shiung, a National Taiwan University professor in public health. Soong described the &quot;Blue-Green rivalry&quot; in Taiwanese politics as an epidemic and stated that Lin, as a doctor, was his partner to cure this &quot;disease&quot;. He contended that Taiwanese people wanted a third party other than the KMT and the DPP and that the PFP was their choice.

===2016 presidential election ===
Soong announced his intention to join the 2016 presidential election on 6 August 2015 with running mate Hsu Hsin-ying of the Minkuotang. The Soong–Hsu ticket finished third, with 12.8% of the vote.

=== 2020 presidential election ===
Soong contested the 2020 presidential election, beginning his campaign on 13 November 2019. He had promised that this campaign would be his last attempt for the presidency. Soong and Sandra Yu formed the People First Party ticket. The pair registered their candidacy with the Central Election Commission on 18 November 2019. Soong and Yu finished third in the presidential election, with 4.2% of the vote.

<text>The New Kuomintang Alliance was a faction of the political party Kuomintang (KMT) in the Republic of China (Taiwan). The faction became formally formed in 1990 after the electoral success of KMT candidates running on an anti-corruption platform in the previous year. the faction was composed of mainly younger and second-generation mainlanders. It was in favor of intraparty reform. It accused President Lee Teng-hui of autocratic tendencies, and complained that the KMT was too corrupt.

In August 1993, days before the 14th National Congress of Kuomintang, the New KMT Alliance broke away to form the Chinese New Party. This move was propelled by the resignation of Premier Hau Pei-tsun, who had been viewed by members of New KMT Alliance members as a counterbalance to Lee&#x27;s power.

<doc id="130752" wikidata="Q547352" url="?curid=130752" title="Ezra Stiles">
<text>Ezra Stiles ( – May 12, 1795) was an American educator, academic, Congregationalist minister, theologian, and author. He is noted as the seventh president of Yale College (1778–1795) and one of the founders of Brown University. According to religious historian Timothy L. Hall, Stiles&#x27; tenure at Yale distinguishes him as &quot;one of the first great American college presidents.&quot;

==Early life==
Ezra Stiles was born on in North Haven, Connecticut, to Rev. Isaac Stiles and Kezia Taylor Stiles (1702–1727). His maternal grandfather, Edward Taylor had emigrated to Colonial America from Leicestershire, England, in 1668. Kezia Taylor Stiles died four days after giving birth to Ezra.

Stiles received his early education at home and matriculated at Yale College in September 1742, as one of 13 members of the college&#x27;s freshman class. At Yale, he studied a liberal arts curriculum characterized by an uncertain period of transition between moribund Puritan thought and that of newer thinkers like John Locke and Isaac Newton. Stiles also studied works by Thomas Farnaby, Isaac Watts, and John Ward. According to biographer Edmund Morgan, the young Stiles read &quot;a strange conglomeration of the first-rate and the third-rate&quot; authors. He graduated in 1746. Stiles was conferred a perfunctory Master of Arts degree from Yale and became ordained in 1749 after further studies in theology.

From 1749 to 1755, Stiles worked as a tutor at Yale. During this period, he drifted away from Calvinism and preached to Native Americans in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In a 1762 letter, Samuel Johnson notes that the young Stiles at one point nearly became an Anglican, writing that he &quot;was once on the point of conforming to the Church, but was dissuaded by his friends, and is become much of a Latitudinarian.&quot;

In 1753 Stiles resigned from his position as a tutor to pursue a career in law and practice at New Haven. Stiles qualified for the New Haven bar by November 13, 1753, after reading law. After two years, he returned to his service as a Congregationalist minister.

In 1768, Stiles was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1784, he was elected an honorary member of the Society of the Cincinnati of Connecticut, one of the first so honored, for his ardent support of the Patriot cause.

== Newport ==

In 1752, Stiles traveled to Newport, Rhode Island, for his health. During his trip, the city&#x27;s Trinity Church—the largest Anglican congregation in New England—sought Stiles to serve as its minister, offering him a salary of £200 sterling. Stiles rejected the offer and departed from the city, writing &quot;that all his Art and Address and fine offers were ineffectual.&quot;

In 1755, the Second Congregational Church of Newport likewise sought out the young minister. In August, after serving in an interim capacity, he joined the church as for a salary of £65 Sterling. In the later months 1756, a clapboard house was constructed for Stiles on Clark Street, across from the meeting house of his congregation. Since 1972, the residence has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In September of the same year, Stiles was made Librarian of the Redwood Library and Athenaeum, a position that allowed him access to books at his discretion. During his years in Newport, Stiles kept an informative diary of his life and acquaintances, which detailed—among other things—his association with Portuguese merchant Aaron Lopez.

In 1757, Stiles married Elizabeth Hubbard, with whom he had eight children.

=== Slavery ===

From time to time, Stiles invested with the merchants and sea captains of his congregation; in 1756, he sent a hogshead of rum along on a voyage to Africa and was repaid with a 10-year-old male slave, whom he renamed &quot;Newport&quot;. Around the same time, he wrote a joint letter with fellow Newport minister Samuel Hopkins condemning &quot;the great inhumanity and cruelty&quot; of slavery in the United States.

===Foundation of Brown University===
During his residence in Newport, Stiles played a major role in the establishment of Brown University (then Rhode Island College).

According to Edmund Morgan, in Rhode Island&#x27;s religious diversity Stiles &quot;saw an opportunity to join with Christians of other denominations in a project which would exemplify their common faith in free inquiry... a college in which the major religious groups of the colony should unite in the pursuit of knowledge.&quot; In 1761, Stiles, along with William Ellery Jr. and Josias Lyndon, drafted a petition to the Rhode Island General Assembly to establish a &quot;literary institution&quot;. The editor of Stiles&#x27;s papers observes, &quot;This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles&#x27;s project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.&quot;

There is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:

Stiles agreed to write the Charter for the college, submitting a first draft to the General Assembly in August 1763. A revised version of the Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich. In drafting the document, Stiles combined broad-minded public statements defining Rhode Island College as a &quot;liberal and catholic institution&quot; in which &quot;shall never be admitted a religious test&quot; with private partisanship: his draft charter packed the board of trustees and the fellows of the college with his fellow Congregationalists.

Baptist members of the Rhode Island General Assembly, to Stiles&#x27; dismay, amended the charter to allow Baptists control of both branches of the College&#x27;s Corporation. Stiles declined a seat on the College&#x27;s Corporation, writing that Baptists had seized &quot;the whole Power and Government of the College and thus by the Immutability of the numbers establishing it a Party College.&quot; Stiles continued to work towards his vision of a non-sectarian institution after the establishment of Rhode Island College, presenting in 1770 a petition for the establishment of another college in Newport.

===Scholarship===
==== Semitic scholarship ====
Stiles struck up a close friendship with Haim Isaac Carigal of Hebron during the Rabbi&#x27;s 1773 residence in Newport. Stiles&#x27; records note 28 meetings to discuss a wide variety of topics from Kabbalah to the politics of the Holy Land. Stiles improved his rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew, to the point where he and Carigal corresponded by mail in the language. Stiles&#x27; knowledge of Hebrew also enabled him to translate large portions of the Hebrew Old Testament into English. Stiles believed, as did many Christian scholars of the time, that facility with the text in its original language was advantageous for proper interpretation.

==== Native American scholarship ====
Stiles conducted research on the Native Americans of New England. In 1761, he visited a Native American village in Niantic, Connecticut, where he recorded notes on the traditional construction methods of wigwams. Stiles additionally documented information on the languages and petroglyphs of New England&#x27;s native peoples. According to archaeologist Edward J. Lenik, Stiles &quot;produced one of the most important early records of petroglyphs and American Indian life in New England.&quot;

==American Revolution==
Stiles left Newport in 1776 prior to the arrival of British troops and their subsequent occupation of the city. In 1776 and 1777, Stiles served briefly as minister of the Dighton Community Church in Dighton, Massachusetts.

In 1777, Stiles became pastor of North Church in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. As pastor, he defended the monarchy as the best form of government in his sermon, entitled &quot;The United States elevated to Glory and Honor,&quot; to the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut in 1783. He stated that &quot;a monarchy conducted with infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence is the most perfect of all possible governments.&quot;

==Yale presidency==

In 1778, Stiles was appointed president of Yale, a post he held until his death. He freed his slave Newport on June 9, 1778, as he prepared to move to New Haven; he would in 1782 hire his former slave for $20 a year and indentured Newport&#x27;s two-year-old son until age 24. As president of Yale, Stiles became its first professor of Semitics, and required all students to study Hebrew (as Harvard students already did); his first commencement address in September 1781 (no ceremonies having been held during the American Revolutionary War) was delivered in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. By 1790, however, he was forced to face failure in instilling an interest in the language in the student body, writing

From my first accession to the Presidency ... I have obliged all the Freshmen to study Hebrew. This has proved very disagreeable to a Number of the Students. This year I have determined to instruct only those who offer themselves voluntarily.

The valedictorians of 1785 and 1792, however, did deliver their speeches in Hebrew.

Stiles was an amateur scientist who corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin about scientific discoveries. Using equipment donated to the college by Franklin, Stiles conducted the electrical experiments in New England, continuing a practice first begun by his predecessor, President Thomas Clap. He charged a glass tube with static electricity and used it to &quot;excite the wonder and admiration of an audience&quot;. He shocked 52 people at once, fired spirits of wine and rum, and caused counterfeit spiders to move about as if they were alive. These were all experiments that had been performed before, and &quot;Stiles seems to have had little genius for pushing back the frontiers of knowledge&quot; and his observations &quot;disclosed nothing new&quot;. He was more a learner and teacher than an experimenter. Nevertheless, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.

His book &quot;The United States elevated to Glory and Honor&quot; was printed in 1783. The book is a transcript of a sermon given to the Connecticut General Assembly, on May 8, 1783. The sermon draws parallels between the United States and the Biblical nation of Israel. Stiles refers to the US as an &quot;American Israel, high above all nations which He hath made, in numbers, and in praise, and in name, and in honor&quot;, suggesting that the White Americans are like the Chosen People of Israel. He opined that &quot;in God’s good providence&quot; Indians and Africans &quot;may gradually vanish&quot;, thus ensuring that &quot;an unrighteous SLAVERY may at length, in God’s good providence, be abolished and cease in the land of LIBERTY.&quot;

===Death and legacy at Yale===
Stiles died in New Haven in 1795, while serving as president.

It is false that Stiles is responsible for the addition of the Hebrew words &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; () to the Yale seal. Indeed, the Hebrew on the Yale seal appears on Stiles&#x27; own master&#x27;s degree diploma from Yale in 1749, decades before he became president of Yale College.

In 1961, Yale named a new residential college in his honor: Ezra Stiles College. The college is noted for its design by modernist architect Eero Saarinen.

Stiles&#x27; upholstered armchair is currently in the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. The chair was made in Newport, Rhode Island.

==Family==
Stiles married twice (Elizabeth Hubbard and Mary Checkley Cranston) and had eight children. Stiles&#x27; son Ezra Stiles, Esq., was educated first at Yale College, then at Harvard College, where he studied law, graduating in 1778. Ezra Stiles Jr., subsequently settled in Vermont, and served to establish the boundaries between Vermont and New Hampshire. He died prematurely at Chowan County, North Carolina, on August 22, 1784, and his two daughters by his wife Sylvia (Avery) Stiles of Vermont (and formerly of Norwich, Connecticut) had their uncle Jonathan Leavitt appointed their guardian.

Stiles&#x27; daughter Emilia married Judge and State Senator Jonathan Leavitt of Greenfield, Massachusetts. His daughter Mary married, in 1790, Abiel Holmes, a Congregational clergyman and historian and a 1783 graduate of Yale College. By his second marriage to Sarah Wendell, Abiel was the father of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.

<text>Riddle is a city in Douglas County, Oregon, United States. The population was 1,185 at the 2010 census.
==History==

Riddle was founded by John Bouseman Riddle, the son of William H. Riddle, for whom the town was named. William H. Riddle was a native of Springfield, Illinois, who settled in the area in 1851. By 1881, the Southern Pacific Railroad line south of Roseburg had a station here called &quot;Riddlesburg&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Riddles&quot; in 1882 and to &quot;Riddle&quot; in 1889. A post office at this location opened under the name of &quot;Riddles&quot; in 1882 and was changed to &quot;Riddle&quot; in 1910.

J. B. Riddle purchased a land claim from J.Q.C. VanDenbosch at the age of nineteen in the year 1863. In 1869, Riddle sold 140.5 acres of his claim to his brother, Abner. When the railroad came through, it passed between the brothers&#x27; properties. J.B. took advantage of the opportunity afforded by the railroad and changed his profession to business from farming. He and his second wife, Mary Catching, built a hotel in what would become the city of Riddle, where J.B. opened several small eating houses to Medford, Oregon along the tracks.

A community recreation center was added to the town in 2024.

<text>Roseburg is the most populous city in and the county seat of Douglas County, Oregon. It is located in the Umpqua River Valley in southern Oregon. Founded in 1851, the population was 23,683 at the 2020 census, making it the principal city of the Roseburg, Oregon Micropolitan Statistical Area. The community developed along both sides of the South Umpqua River and is traversed by Interstate 5. Traditionally a lumber industry town, Roseburg was the original home of Roseburg Forest Products, which is now based in nearby Springfield.
== Natural resources ==
Waterfalls near Roseburg include Susan Creek Falls and Fall Creek Falls. Roseburg&#x27;s primary industries include timber and tourism, and the region is home to many vineyards and more than 30 wineries.

The Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife lists more than 50 areas for fishing for salmon, steelhead, bass, bluegill and trout in the Roseburg area.

== History ==
Modern-day Roseburg is located on the lands of numerous Indian tribes, including the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe, whose Cow Creek Umpqua Indian Foundation is located in Roseburg. Roseburg was the site of the 1855 Battle of Hungry Hill, part of the Rogue River Wars of 1855–56, fought between several southern Oregon Indian groups and the US Army.

The city was named for settler Aaron Rose, who established a homestead within the current city limits on September 23, 1851. Rose was born in 1813 in Ulster County, New York. In 1851, he came to Oregon from Coldwater, Michigan, where he had lived since 1837.

Rose constructed the first building in what would become Roseburg, a rough structure made of poles and clapboards with a front room about 16 or 18 feet square; it was used as a grocery store, backed by a dining room and kitchen. Originally, guests could use the floor of the front room to spread their beds or were able to sleep out of doors under nearby oak trees. His first structure served as a roadside inn and tavern for many years. Rose built a proper hotel in 1853. He died in 1899.

Roseburg was first known as Deer Creek because it was at the confluence of Deer Creek and the South Umpqua River. In 1854, voters chose Roseburg as the county seat over rival town Winchester. Rose donated of land and $1,000 for the building of the county courthouse, and the important buildings of Winchester were moved to Roseburg before 1860.

Deer Creek post office was established in 1852, and the name changed to &quot;Roseburgh&quot; in 1857. The spelling was changed to &quot;Roseburg&quot; in 1894. Roseburg was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 3, 1872.

===Timber Capital of the Nation===
The fortunes of Roseburg grew with the lumber industry. In 1937, Roseburg Lumber opened. Founded by Kenneth Ford, the company became the major employer in the community. Other major employers, including Weyerhaeuser, Champion and Sun Studs also developed and grew during this time. By the 1970s Roseburg branded itself as the Timber Capital of the Nation.

Country singer Johnny Cash mythologized Roseburg loggers in the 1960 song &quot;Lumberjack”:

&quot;Ride this train to Roseburg, Oregon. Now there&#x27;s a town for you!
You talk about rough...
You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there.
But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy come there.
Every one of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me.” 

===Roseburg Blast===
On August 7, 1959, at approximately 1:00 a.m., the Gerretsen Building Supply Company caught fire. Firefighters soon arrived at the building, near Oak and Pine Streets, to extinguish the fire. Earlier in the evening, a truck driver for the Pacific Powder Company, George Rutherford, had parked his explosives truck in front of the building, which was not noticed. The truck exploded at around 1:14 a.m., destroying buildings in an eight-block radius and severely damaging 30 more blocks.

The truck was loaded with two tons of dynamite and four-and-a-half tons of the blasting agent nitro carbo nitrate. Rutherford had parked the truck after arranging his delivery for the following morning, despite warnings given to the Pacific Powder Company two days earlier not to leave such trucks unattended or park them in &quot;congested areas&quot;. A police officer named Donald De Sues and the Chief of Police were on site and managed to evacuate citizens from the area of the truck before the explosion. Donald De Sues and the town Assistant Fire Chief were recognized as heroes that day and were both killed in the blast. A total of fourteen people died in the blast and fire, and 125 were injured. Damage was estimated at 10 to 12 million dollars; the powder company was eventually made to pay $1.2 million in civil damages, but was acquitted of criminal wrongdoing.

Roseburg&#x27;s downtown was rebuilt, primarily by businesses using money collected from insurance claims. The city built a new bridge over the South Umpqua River on parcels affected by the disaster. Since the incident, it is commonly referred to as the Roseburg Blast or simply &quot;The Blast&quot;. In 2005, SOPTV produced a documentary examining the Blast and the experiences of those who were involved or witnessed it, entitled &quot;The Roseburg Blast: A Catastrophe and Its Heroes&quot;.

===Mass shooting===

On October 1, 2015, students at Umpqua Community College near Roseburg were attacked by a 26-year-old gunman that had recently moved to the area from Southern California, who killed nine people (eight students and an assistant professor) and injured nine others.

== History ==
The account of how the city received its name varies; one tradition claims it was named after the lawyer Nathan Arlington Cornish, while another tradition claims that the Southern inhabitants of the city had enough clout to rename the city after Arlington, Virginia, home of general Robert E. Lee. Originally named Alkali, Arlington came into existence as a place for shipping cattle down the Columbia River. It was incorporated as Arlington by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on November 20, 1885.

The original townsite was demolished beginning in 1965 due to the scheduled inundation of Arlington by the rising waters of the Columbia River to form Lake Umatilla behind the John Day Dam. A new townsite was completed two years earlier.

In 2008, it was discovered that Mayor Carmen Kontur-Gronquist had posted photos of herself in lingerie online, which, along with several other issues, led to her recall from office.

==Economy==
The area around Arlington is largely agricultural farm land with wheat, barley and beef cattle being the principal products.

=== Waste disposal ===

Arlington is home to a sizable Waste Management landfill, notably receiving all of Seattle, Washington&#x27;s trash and some from Portland, Oregon. In March 2010, Waste Management announced their plans to build a waste gasification plant next to their landfill that uses a plasma gasification technology that at the time was considered experimental. The plasma gasification plant was built in conjunction with the company, InEnTec, whose efforts to build such plants in California and elsewhere have met protest. The plant went into pilot operation in November 2011.

=== Wind farms ===
The area around Arlington is the location of several wind farms:
Caithness Energy has the Shepherds Flat Wind Farm, one of the largest land-based wind farms in the world. Approved in 2008 by state regulators, groundbreaking came in 2009. It officially opened in September 2012 and &quot;reached full commercial operations in November 2012.&quot; There have been some controversies around the project that emerged in 2009 and 2010.

In fall 2017, construction was started on the Montague Wind Power Project, a project owned and operated by Avangrid Renewables to provide power to Apple Inc.&#x27;s Prineville Data Center through Oregon&#x27;s Direct Access Program. &quot;Apple says Montague will provide it 560,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually.&quot;

Along with the wind farm there have been several proposed solar farms. On April 20, 2020, Avangrid requested to change the boundary and site layout of its Montague Wind Power Facility. This request was to split &quot;the existing site certificate into three new site certificates for facilities to be named Montague Wind, Montague Solar, and Oregon Trail Solar; and, transfer of site certificates for Montague Solar and Oregon Trail Solar to new limited liability companies, Montague Solar, LLC and Oregon Trail Solar, LLC, wholly owned subsidiaries of the current certificate holder owner, Avangrid Renewables, LLC.&quot;

==Transportation==

Arlington is located at the intersection of Interstate 84 and Oregon Route 19. I-84 travels west towards Portland and east towards Boise, Idaho; OR 19 connects Arlington to Condon and U.S. Route 26 near Dayville.

The Port of Arlington offers access the Columbia River water way and hosts
# a marina with a water depth of 24 feet that features a fuel dock and 8 transient moorage slips, 1 side tie dock, 11-30’ slips, and 7-20’ slips;
# Mid Columbia Producer, LLC River Terminal; and
# a windsurfing and kiteboarding launch.

The city has a small airport named Arlington Municipal Airport, located on a nearby plateau. In 2011, the U.S. Air Force proposed Arlington as the site of a future United States Department of Defense unmanned aerial vehicle base.

<text>Condon is a city in, and the seat of, Gilliam County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The population was 682 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Condon was the southern terminus of the Condon Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1883, a local homesteader named Potter platted the land around a spring on his property. The spring, which emerged from a bed of black basalt, was known to pioneer ranchers in the area as &quot;Summit Springs&quot;. Experiencing financial difficulty, Potter surrendered the site to the legal firm Condon and Cornish from Arlington. Harvey C. Condon, a member of the firm, was a nephew of Oregon geologist Thomas Condon. Condon and Cornish sold lots in the townsite and in 1884, resident David B. Trimble applied for a post office and became its first postmaster. He named the post office Condon after Harvey C. Condon.

Condon Air Force Station was a radar station near the city that operated from 1951 to 1970.

<text>Lonerock is a city in Gilliam County, Oregon, United States, twenty miles east of Condon. The population was 21 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The settlement began in the early 1870s, as a service center for the surrounding ranches. It was platted in 1882 as &quot;Lone Rock&quot;, named for an unusual, -high rock that still stands in the town near the old Methodist church. The U.S. Postal Service had a preference for one-word names, so name of the post office was &quot;Lonerock&quot;, which eventually became the community&#x27;s official name. The city&#x27;s population grew from 68 in 1900 to 70 in 1910, 73 in 1920, to a high of 82 in 1930. By 1940, Lonerock&#x27;s population dwindled to 46, dropped to 38 in 1950, 31 in 1960, and to 12 residents in 1970. The population increased to 26 citizens in 1980, before falling to 11 in the 1990 census.

The first settlers to the area arrived in 1871. The Lonerock area, in a valley cut by a small stream, was lush with grasses, and the surrounding hills abounded with game animals. In 1874, Edward Wineland erected a water-powered sawmill at Lonerock, which allowed construction and settlement to thrive, and, in 1875, a post office was established.

In 1878, the area&#x27;s Native Americans began pushing back on the intruding settlers, causing many to flee to The Dalles. The US Army was called on to protect the remaining inhabitants, and by 1882 the area was secured and the town was incorporated, one of the county&#x27;s first. Postmaster RG Robinson was elected mayor of the new government.

In 1888, a two-room school building was erected, and 1-12 grade education was provided. The school&#x27;s final graduation was in 1932. In 1898, Reverend Deuse joined the community and built a Methodist church that held weekly services for many years. As of 2020, the church still stands, and occasionally holds services. The small white church has become as iconic to the Lonerock community as the rock itself.

In July 1896, the town was almost destroyed by fire. The entire business portion burned and only a few dwellings were left on the outskirts of town. The blaze was reportedly started by a boy playing with matches.

By 1900, the town&#x27;s population stood at 68; new settlers were arriving and several businesses operated within its limits. Many of the surrounding homesteads had become successful ranches and farms that occupied thousands of acres on the surrounding hillsides. A varied economy was arising, including hunting for sport, fishing, and winter sledding. An annual rodeo, held on the middle of Main Street, became a popular event, attracting participants and spectators from the surrounding area. By the 1920s, rodeos in the surrounding areas grew larger and Lonerock&#x27;s annual rodeo was no longer the main attraction; its final year was 1934. The economy also declined as businesses and activities migrated to larger settlements in the area. The town&#x27;s population shrank by nearly half from 1930 to 1940.

Early settlers from Scotland formed much of the sheep-based early economy. This part of the economy gradually evaporated due to a mixture of fluctuating sheep prices and the increased prevalence of cattle raising in the area. The lush grasses on the area&#x27;s hillsides allowed cattle raising, which currently accounts for nearly all the city&#x27;s economy. The other part of the agricultural economy is hay production. Lonerock&#x27;s climate would not support hay farming at first, but the introduction of various irrigation methods in the Lonerock valley allowed alfalfa to thrive.

<text>Canyon City is a city in Grant County, Oregon, United States. It is the county seat of Grant County, and is about south of John Day on U.S. Highway 395. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 703.

== Geography ==
Canyon City is along U.S. Route 395 about south of the city of John Day, the John Day River, and U.S. Route 26. It is east of Bend and southeast of Portland.

The city is at an elevation of about . Between Canyon City and Burns, to the south, Route 395 passes through parts of the Malheur National Forest. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Canyon City has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Canyon City was established in June 1862 as a result of the discovery of gold in Canyon Creek, which flows from the south to meet the John Day River at John Day. As up to 10,000 miners flocked to Whiskey Gulch and other sections of the canyon during the early stages of the rush, land values between Canyon City and John Day rose to about $500 per square yard ($600/m2). Little of this estimated population influx is reflected in U.S. Census Bureau tallies for Canyon City, which have fluctuated between 250 and about 700 since 1870.
Estimates of the total value of Canyon Creek&#x27;s gold varied. Geologist Waldemar Lindgren indicated that between $3 million and $5 million in gold was extracted for each of the first three years, 1862–64. Rossiter Raymond, the U.S. Commissioner of Mining Statistics, reported an average of $1.1 million a year between 1865 and 1870, afterward gradually tapering downwards. The figures given by Lindgren and Raymond were based on the fixed value of gold at $20.67 per ounce. As such, these authoritative sources should be interpreted to estimate the annual gold production of Canyon Creek at 150,000 to 250,000 ounces in 1862, 1863 and 1864, then averaging 55,000 ounces each year between 1865 and 1870. Earlier estimates that $16 million in gold was extracted from Canyon Creek were revised to $26 million after the fixed value of gold increased to $35 per ounce in 1933. These figures indicate that gross gold production from Canyon Creek for the 40 years between 1862 and 1902 was approximately 800,000 ounces. In 2013, at $1,400 per ounce, that gold would be valued at $1.12 billion. Gold production continued for another 40 years, until 1942, when the War Labor Board issued L-208, which prohibited gold mining and effectively killed the gold mining industry in the United States.

Many miners and others entered the area along a wagon road linking The Dalles on the Columbia River, with Canyon City. A few years later, this road was part of the template for what became known as The Dalles Military Road.

The city was platted in 1862 and was chosen as the county seat two years later, when Grant County was created from old Wasco County and old Umatilla County. Canyon City was incorporated in 1891, and voters elected C. W. Parrish as the first mayor.

==Economy==
The biggest employer in Canyon City as of 2002 was the county government, which had employees in the courthouse, the jail, and the road and health departments. The second biggest employer was Grant School District, in the district office and in Humboldt Elementary School. The next three biggest were Grayback Forestry, a reforestation and fire-suppression company; Jackson Oil, a gas station, mini-mart, and office; and an Oregon Department of Transportation maintenance shop.

<text>Granite is a city in Grant County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. The city had a population of 30 in 2020, down from 38 in 2010. As of 2020, it is the fourth-smallest incorporated city by population in Oregon. The smaller cities were Shaniko (pop. 30), Lonerock (pop. 25), and nearby Greenhorn (pop. 3).

==History==
First established by miners after the discovery of gold along Granite Creek on July 4, 1862, the area was originally called Granite Creek Falls. During the following year, a settlement called Granite City was established about downstream of where Granite City is now. It was moved to its current location in 1867 and renamed &quot;Independence&quot; after the date—July 4, or Independence Day—of the earlier gold discovery. However, when the community&#x27;s post office was established in 1878, it could not use the name &quot;Independence&quot; because that name was already used by another Oregon city. Instead, the name &quot;Granite&quot; was chosen. The post office closed in 1957, but the city retained the name. The creek takes its name from the granite rocks that are common to the area.

The Ah Hee Diggings are located about one-mile north of the town.

In 1878, miner and business owner A. G. Tabor became the first postmaster. Grant Thornburg became the first mayor after the city incorporated in 1900.

A 1939 interview &quot;Occupational and Social Life of Granite&quot; recorded by William &quot;Bill&quot; Haight as part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, described the town and surroundings of Granite.

==Economy==
In 1942, during World War II, the War Production Board shut down gold mining in the United States via Order No. L-208. The board deemed gold mining to be non-essential to the war effort, and it wanted gold miners to mine &quot;essential&quot; metals instead. Since Granite depended so heavily on gold mining, its economy collapsed when the mines shut down. Telephone and electric services to Granite ceased after the war. From 86 residents in 1940, the city&#x27;s population dropped to 2 in 1960.

By 1990, the population had grown again to 10. In 2000, the population reached 24, and telephone service was restored. As of 2002, Granite had two employers: The Outback—which sold food, fuel, and supplies—and The Lodge.

 the population remains at 24. As of 2025, the Outback has shut down and the Lodge is shut down and for sale.

== Geography ==
Granite is in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. It is west of Baker City by highway and east-southeast of Portland. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The Elkhorn Drive Scenic Byway, a closed-loop route mainly through forests in the Elkhorn Mountains, passes through Granite. Other communities along the route are Baker City, Haines, and Sumpter, the latter about southeast of Granite.

<text>John Day is a city located approximately north of Canyon City in Grant County, Oregon, United States, at the intersection of U.S. Routes 26 and 395. The city was named for the nearby John Day River, which, along with Dayville, had been named for a Virginia member of the 1811 Astor Expedition, John Day. The city was incorporated in 1901.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 1,664, making it the largest city in the county.

== History ==
The first homestead staked in what is now Grant County (then part of Wasco County), in 1862 by B. C. Trowbridge, was within the limits of the present city of John Day. The Eastern Oregon community was not as quick to grow as neighboring Canyon City, which was the county seat and center of the bustling mining industry in the area. Incrementally, local merchants and residents began relocating to John Day—primarily each time after severe fires in Canyon City: the Grant County Courthouse burned in 1870, Chinatown burned in 1885, and fires in 1898 and 1937 each devastated Canyon City&#x27;s downtown.
The first post office at &quot;John Day City&quot; was established in 1865, but was discontinued in 1871. It was reestablished in 1879 with the name John Day. In April 1900, a local committee was elected, and the Oregon Legislature approved an Act incorporating the city of John Day on February 23, 1901.

The largest part of early John Day was composed of the Chinese community, commonly called Tiger Town. In 1882, the Advent Christian Church in John Day had 547 members, 382 of whom were Chinese (and a number of Chinese residents were interred in the Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery). By 1887, John Day was home to nearly 1,000 Chinese immigrants, who had been attracted to the area by a gold rush 20 years earlier, many of whom were displaced by the 1885 fire in Canyon City.

A trading post built in the area in the 1860s along The Dalles Military Road was purchased in 1887 by two Chinese immigrants, Lung On and Ing Hay. They converted the trading post into a clinic, general store, and social center for the community, which continued to operate until the 1940s. In the 1970s the building, then the property of the city of John Day, was converted into a museum called the Kam Wah Chung &amp; Co. Museum. It is now operated in conjunction with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and is one of the premier surviving examples of a 19th-century Chinese apothecary shop. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

John Day is surrounded by the Strawberry Mountains to the south and the Blue Mountains to the east.

===Geology===

The bedrock geology of the John Day area is a complex assemblage of Permian to Triassic age metamorphic and igneous rocks which were added to the western North American continental margin by tectonic activity in the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Cenozoic age volcanic rocks related to the long-lived Columbia River Basalt emplacement were deposited above these bedrock units.

The area around John Day contains some of the most important paleontological resources known. From about the time the dinosaurs disappeared right up until the Pleistocene, the region was subjected to significant volcanism and other processes that preserved many fossils. Because the matrix in which the fossils are entombed is datable, the fossils themselves can be dated with excellent precision. This gives paleontologists the ability to study how species changed over time and also how the relationship between ecosystems and climate changed.

===Climate===
Despite its dry climate and inland location, John Day has as an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system. However, it nearly qualifies as a steppe climate (Köppen BSk) due to its relative aridity, and as a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) due to its cold winter temperatures.

==Economy==
Historically, industrial and agricultural businesses like gold mining, sheep and cattle ranching, timber harvesting, and lumber milling have been the economic mainstays of the community. However, federal policies that shut down all gold mining in the United States in 1942, the decreasing availability of ponderosa pine due to a lack of timber sales, and relatively high transportation costs have resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of the resource-based economic sector. Other employments, such as in recreation, health care, and government (the headquarters of the Malheur National Forest administration is located in John Day) now account for a majority of jobs in the city.

<doc id="130768" wikidata="Q2217462" url="?curid=130768" title="Long Creek, Oregon">
<text>Long Creek is a city in Grant County, Oregon, United States. The population was 173 at the 2020 census. The city is named after John Long, a prominent miner who came to Grant County in 1862 during the Canyon City rush of that same year. Located in a high valley of the Blue Mountains, ranching has been the principal enterprise for the area. Log harvesting was slowly curtailed in the nearby Malheur National Forest until the local mill was closed in 1998.

==History==
The city was incorporated in 1891. At the 1900 census the city recorded 123 residents. Long Creek fell to 86 people in 1910, and then rebounded to 148 at 1920&#x27;s census. After dipping to 139 people in 1930, the city saw steady population growth for several decades with population numbers of 238 in 1940, 288 in 1950, and topping out at 295 residents in 1960. By 1970 the city had fallen to 196 people, and then grew back to 252 people in 1980, before dropping to 249 citizens at the 1990 census.

==Geography==

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F.

<text>Bromölla Municipality (&quot;Bromölla kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Skåne County in South Sweden in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town Bromölla.

Bromölla was in 1967 reunited with Ivetofta (from which it had been detached as a market town in 1942). In 1974, &quot;Näsum&quot; was added and the municipality&#x27;s present territory was defined.

==History==
The name Bromölla translates to &quot;Bridge Mill&quot;, one or more mills used at least from the 17th to the 19th century, adjacent to a small river. The municipal arms depict a bridge over a river, and a water wheel symbolizing the mill.

==Urban areas==
There are 5 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Bromölla Municipality.

In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of 31 December 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

A small part of Valje is situated in Sölvesborg Municipality.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Bromölla Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 12,634 residents, including 9,567 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 35.8% voted for the left coalition and 63.1% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Industry==
IFÖ Sanitär was founded by William Abelgaard Nielsen in 1887 as a limestone and kaolin mining at the nearby Ivö island.

<doc id="130772" wikidata="Q186662" url="?curid=130772" title="Burlöv Municipality">
<text>Burlöv Municipality (; &quot;Burlövs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Skåne County in South Sweden in southern Sweden, just north of Malmö. Its seat is located in Arlöv, a community which for geographical and statistical purposes is seen as a part of Malmö (&quot;Malmö tätort&quot;).

The municipality is one of only a few in Sweden, and the only one in Scania, which still contains only the original municipal entity created from the old parish in 1863 (cf history of municipalities in Sweden) and has not been amalgamated. It is the second smallest municipality by area in the whole country (after Sundbyberg Municipality).

==Geography==
The municipality has no forests, lakes, or streams, but has an abundance of high-voltage power grids, highways and railroads, as it is on the main line from Malmö to northern Sweden. Like the rest of Scania, much land is used for agriculture and there are several old farms, mills and other sights from the last centuries in the vicinity.

===Urban areas===
There are three urban areas (also called a &quot;tätort&quot; or locality) in Burlöv Municipality, including Arlöv, which statistically is a part of Malmö (*). Malmö is mostly located in Malmö Municipality but a part of it sprawls into Burlöv Municipality.

In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

Arlöv is an early industrialized town dominated by multi-storey apartment buildings, with a working class character. Its largest industry is Arlöv Sugar Factory, to which large amounts of sugar beets are transported from all around Scania.

Burlöv Center is located in Arlöv. It is a large shopping mall in the region.

Åkarp and Burlövs egnahem consist of detached house districts. They have a suburban character from where people commute to commercial centres and work within the metropolitan area of southwestern Scania.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Burlöv Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 19,713 residents, including 13,481 Swedish citizens of voting age. 48.5% voted for the left coalition and 48.8% for the right coalition.

==Politics==

Municipal politics has historically been dominated by the Social Democratic Party, but since the 2018 election a right-wing coalition led by the Moderate Party and supported by the Sweden Democrats has controlled the municipal government.

==Transport==

The E6 and E22 highways meet in Burlöv, and share a route south towards Malmö. Burlöv is also located along the Southern Main Line, and is served by the Pågatågen commuter train system.

==Demography==

The population of Burlöv Municipality increased with almost 1,000 people between 1986 and 2003. The largest part of the population increase has been due to high birth rates. Moving rates have played a small part, and is rather equalled, where – as is normal in smaller communities – young people move out and families with children move in.

==Culture and history==
Arlöv is located in the vicinity of agricultural fields, where the &quot;Old Church of Burlöv&quot; can be found, in the Burlöv Village. One of the oldest churches in Scania, it has mostly remained the way it was built in the 12th century, with its oldest parts concreted out of sandstone.

The coat of arms depict a sugar beet which was the chief industry for a while (e.g. the large &quot;Arlöv&#x27;s Sugar Factory&quot;), and a star that symbolizes the Hvilan folk high school which was among the first group of folk high schools that were established in 1868.

==International relations==
The municipality is twinned with:

<text>Båstad Municipality (&quot;Båstads kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Skåne County in South Sweden, located in Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Båstad.

The present municipality was established in 1971 when the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) &quot;Båstad&quot; was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities. One parish was transferred from Halland County.

==Localities==
There are 6 localities in Båstad Municipality.

In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Båstad Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 15,624 residents, including 12,600 Swedish citizens of voting age. 35.3% voted for the left coalition and 63.6% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
Below are the results since the 1973 municipal reform listed. Between 1988 and 1998 the Sweden Democrats&#x27; results were not published by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size nationwide. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of the electorate casting a ballot, but &quot;Votes&quot; only applies to valid ballots cast.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

==Hallandian ridge==

Extending through the municipality, marking the border to the province Halland, is the ridge of Hallandia, or &quot;Hallandsåsen&quot;. It is one of the highest points in the otherwise flat-terrained Scania, with a height of 226 meters.

The ridge reached the public eye in 1997, when the construction of the Hallandsås Tunnel through the ridge caused fishes in the streams to die and cows grazing on the ridge to become paralyzed due to the poisonous substance acrylamide used by the digging company to counteract the high level of groundwater in the ridge.

<text>Prairie City is a city in Grant County, Oregon, United States. The population was 909 at the 2010 census. The community was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 23, 1891.

==History==
Prairie City grew out of the former mining camp of Dixie, established in 1862 about up Dixie Creek from the John Day River. Prairie City, at the mouth of the creek, was chosen after placer mining rendered Dixie unsuitable for a townsite. The new city&#x27;s post office was established in 1870 with Jules Le Bret as postmaster.

A narrow gauge line, the Sumpter Valley Railway (SVR), ran from Baker City west to Sumpter and on to its western terminus at Prairie City, which it reached in 1907. It carried passengers as well as freight shipped by ranchers, mining interests, and timber companies until its piecemeal abandonment in the 1930s. In the 21st century, a heritage railway operates on a segment of the original line between Sumpter and McEwen.

==Geography==
Prairie City is in eastern Oregon at the upper end of the John Day River valley. It is about southwest of Baker City by highway and east of John Day along U.S. Route 26 in Grant County.

Architectural features in Prairie City include historic stone buildings and the former railway depot. The ground floor of the depot consists of a waiting room, railway station agent&#x27;s office, baggage room, and freight office. The second floor, once the home of the station agent and his family, houses the Dewitt Museum, with pioneer artifacts, tools, furniture, and memorabilia, as well as rocks and minerals from the surrounding area. The depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
