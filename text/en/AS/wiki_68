<text>McHenry Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 121 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
McHenry Township was formed from parts of Cummings and Brown townships on August 21, 1861. It was named in honor of a Jersey Shore surveyor, Alexander H. McHenry.

The first warrant for land in what is now McHenry Township was issued to John Nixon on May 17, 1785. John English and his wife, Fanny Boatman, settled on the largest island in the area as early as 1784. They left hurriedly after a warning from a friendly Indian, Shawnee John, returning about a year later. Claudius Boatman and his son-in-law, Comfort Wanzer, married to Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Boatman, settled in the area in 1785. Boatman, a Frenchman by birth, formerly lived in the Buffalo Valley area of Union County, Pennsylvania, near Winfield, then in Mahoning Township in Montour County, before moving further up the West Branch Susquehanna River to Pine Creek. Boatman, at that time married to his second wife, Esther, had a rather large family. A daughter, Rebecca, married and lived a long life despite being partially scalped when she was 15 in 1782; her mother, Boatman&#x27;s first wife, was killed in the same incident. Esther Boatman served as a nurse and rural physician for the pioneers along Pine Creek. The descendants of Claudius Boatman remain in fairly large numbers in western Lycoming County.

The first white settlers in the vicinity of what became Jersey Mills arrived in the late 18th and very early 19th centuries. For the next 100 years, lumbering and farming were the main drivers of the local economy. The first lumber mill in the area began operations in 1809. Farm crops included cereal grasses and potatoes. The village of Jersey Mills was officially established in 1855, when its post office opened.

Flagstone quarries in the area provided income in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as lumbering income steeply declined. The village had a one-room school through 1946 and a general store and boarding house through 1965. A smaller general store, the last commercial business in Jersey Mills, operated from 1980 though 2007.

Lumbering was the primary industry in McHenry Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were cleared to meet the demands for lumber during the lumber era that swept throughout Pennsylvania. Williamsport, which is southeast of McHenry Township, was known at the &quot;Lumber Capital of the World&quot;. Logs were floated down Pine Creek and into the West Branch Susquehanna River to various sawmills along both streams and in Williamsport.

McHenry Township is a very rural and remote section of Lycoming County. The hills and valleys are now covered with a thriving second growth forest. The population as of the 2010 census was just 143.

==Geography==
McHenry Township is in northwestern Lycoming County, bordered by Brown Township to the north, Pine Township to the northeast, Cummings Township to the southeast, and three townships in Clinton County to the southwest. Pennsylvania Route 414 follows Pine Creek through the middle of the township, passing through the small communities of Jersey Mills, Bluestone, Cammal, and Ross Siding (listed from south to north). From Cammal, PA-414 leads northeastward to Morris and south to Pennsylvania Route 44 near Waterville. PA 44 forms the southwestern border of the township (and the county line); the highway leads southeastward to Jersey Shore and northwest to Coudersport. Pennsylvania Route 664 leaves PA-44 in Haneyville in the southern part of the township, leading south to Lock Haven.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.62%, are water. Pine Creek runs through the center of the township at the bottom of Pine Creek Gorge, with creek elevation ranging from above sea level, and the tops of the canyon walls from .

<text>McIntyre Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 460 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
McIntyre Township was formed from territory taken from Lewis Township in 1848. It is named for Archibald McIntyre, one of the founders of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad.

The first pioneers arrived in the McIntyre Township area in 1794 near what is now the village of Ralston. John Smithkontz cleared a parcel of land along Lycoming Creek near the mouth of Pleasant Stream on 1805.

The New York Iron and Coal Company created the first business venture in what was to become McIntyre Township when they constructed a sawmill on Lycoming Creek. The New York Iron and Coal Company also built an iron furnace near the mouth of Frozen Run in 1831. They began to make iron using iron ore that was mined nearby. The company also established a charcoal-making operation for the fuel that was needed to keep the furnaces fired. The iron industry had little success in McIntyre. The ore was difficult to clean; it could only be separated from the dirt that was mixed in when it was frozen. And the ore that they did manage to extract produced iron that proved to be very brittle. The reason that several companies attempted to succeed in what proved to be a failing enterprise was the fact that the furnace was within easy distance of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad, which connected the industrial centers of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and Elmira, New York.

The McIntyre Coal company was founded by Jervis Langdon in 1870. He set up a coal mining operation in the mountains in the northeastern section of McIntyre Township. Coal mining had taken place on a small scale in the earlier years of the township, but Langdon was the first to open a large-scale operation. The coal company constructed a steep (45 degrees) and inclined plane to get the coal from the mine to the waiting railroad cars. The village of McIntyre sprang up around the coal mines. At one time it was home to 300 households, had a church, school, store, sawmill, a boot and shoe shop, and a public hall. The McIntyre Coal Company ceased operation in 1886. The mine was abandoned, and the town was abandoned shortly after the mine.

<text>Mifflin Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,088 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Mifflin Township was formed in 1803 by dividing Lycoming Township. It is named in honor of Thomas Mifflin, the first governor of Pennsylvania.

=== Early settlers ===
When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Mifflin Township, they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the &quot;Fair Play System&quot;, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the &quot;Tiadaghton Elm&quot; on the banks of Pine Creek.

Mifflin Township is located within the Larrys Creek watershed. This area was densely covered with trees and brush until about 1790, when the first settlers attempted to clear some of the land that surrounds Larrys Creek. John Murphy was the first settler to establish a permanent homestead. He cleared some land along the creek and built a home. His daughter, Sarah, is thought to have been the first white child to have been born in Mifflin Township. Murphy was soon followed by other settlers who also built cabins, cleared some land for farming and built sawmills. Lumber was soon to become the dominant industry in Mifflin Township.

=== Lumber industry ===
As timber and lumber became a major industry in the mid-19th century, Larrys Creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport.

This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. By 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.

Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. Presently there are large tracts of second-growth forest, and small lumber companies still operate in the township.

== Geography ==
Mifflin Township is in western Lycoming County and is bordered by Cogan House Township to the north, Anthony Township to the east, Woodward Township at one point to the southeast, Piatt Township to the south, Porter Township to the southwest, and Watson and Cummings townships to the west. Mifflin Township surrounds the borough of Salladasburg, a separate municipality.

Pennsylvania Route 287 passes through the township and Salladasburg, leading north to Hoytville and south to U.S. Route 220 at the West Branch Susquehanna River. Pennsylvania Route 973 crosses PA-287 in Salladasburg and leads east to Hepburnville and southwest to Pennsylvania Route 44 in the valley of Pine Creek. Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat, is to the southeast via Routes 287 and 220.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Mifflin Township has a total area of , of which are land , or 0.36%, are water. Larrys Creek is the main waterway through the township, flowing southward to the West Branch Susquehanna River in Piatt Township.

<text>Slippery When Wet is the third studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on August 18, 1986, by Mercury Records in North America and Vertigo Records internationally. It was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, with recording sessions taking place between January and July 1986 at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver. The album features many of Bon Jovi&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.

&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was an instant commercial success, spending eight weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was named by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the top-selling album of 1987. &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; is Bon Jovi&#x27;s best-selling album to date, with a Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certification of 15× Platinum, making it one of the top 100 best-selling albums in the United States. The album has been called the album that turned &quot;heavy metal into a radio-friendly pop format&quot;, and is also commonly seen as &quot;a breakthrough for hair metal&quot;.

==Background==
Upon its 1985 release, &quot;&quot; achieved moderate success, but Bon Jovi had not yet become superstars. The band changed its approach for the next album, with a more mainstream sound than the heavier first two albums. Hiring Desmond Child as a collaborator, the band wrote 30 songs and auditioned them for local New Jersey and New York teenagers, basing the album&#x27;s running order on their opinions. Bruce Fairbairn was chosen as the producer for the album, with Bob Rock as the mixer. The 1985 album &quot;Without Love&quot; which Fairbairn produced for the heavy metal band Black &#x27;n Blue, attracted Jon Bon Jovi with its sound quality, and he immediately sought out the producer.

==Writing and composition==
Much of the album was written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, whereas &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Without Love&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;d Die For You&quot; were co-written with Desmond Child, and &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; was by Bon Jovi alone. This was the first time Child worked with Jon and Richie. He came to New Jersey, where they worked on the four songs in Sambora&#x27;s mother&#x27;s basement.

Jon Bon Jovi explained, &quot;I liked what Bryan Adams had done with Tina Turner so I suggested we do something similar: I write a song for someone like her, and then we do the song together. But that got changed, and our A&amp;R guy came up with Desmond&#x27;s name ... He hasn&#x27;t tried to change what we are, but to refine it slightly; to suggest extra ways that we could wring a bit more out of what we had.&quot;

Bon Jovi was initially reluctant to include &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, believing it was not good enough. Sambora convinced him it was a hit in the making, and so the band rerecorded it, releasing the second version on the album. It is Bon Jovi&#x27;s signature song. The first version of &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot; that was recorded was included as a hidden track at the end of one of the CDs in the box set &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;.

One of the songs written during the making of the album, &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot;, is not on the final release. Bon Jovi has since said it should have been included. In the booklet that came with &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, Jon Bon Jovi said, &quot;It was absolutely appropriate for the &quot;Slippery&quot; record—coulda, shoulda, woulda been on &quot;Slippery&quot; had cooler minds prevailed. Here&#x27;s my formal apology.&quot; Featured on the soundtrack to the 1987 movie &quot;Disorderlies&quot;, it has since been released as the B-side for the &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot; single album, on the 2-CD edition of &quot;Cross Road&quot;, and on &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;. The song has never been performed live by the band, though a fan favorite.

In 1986, Bon Jovi said &quot;There&#x27;s a song called &#x27;Love Is A Social Disease&#x27; that Aerosmith were keen to get hold of. It would be ideal for them, but they&#x27;re not having it, because it&#x27;s even better for us.&quot;

==Title and artwork==
The album&#x27;s name was changed during its inception, including &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;. A proposed cover with the band dressed as cowboys was later used for the single release of the track of the same name.

According to Bon Jovi, the band named the album &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; after visiting The No.5 Orange strip club in Vancouver, British Columbia. According to Sambora, &quot;This woman descended from the ceiling on a pole and proceeded to take all her clothes off. When she got in a shower and soaped herself up, we just about lost our tongues. We just sat there and said, &#x27;We will be here every day.&#x27; That energized us through the whole project. Our testosterone was at a very high level back then.&quot;

The cover consists of a wet black garbage bag with the words &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; traced in the water. &quot;So simple, and not very impressive&quot;, said Sambora. The album originally was to feature a busty woman in a wet yellow T-shirt with the album name on the front of the shirt. This was swapped for the plastic bag cover just prior to release. The reasons given for the switch were record executives&#x27; fears that dominant record store chains at the time would have refused to carry the album with a sexist cover, and Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s dislike of the bright pink border around the photograph the band submitted. Sambora said, &quot;Our label freaked out a bit when they saw what we&#x27;d done. They thought it would be banned by American stores, so we had to come up with something else – fast.&quot; In Japan, most releases of the album included the original cover art.

==Reception==
The album was a massive commercial success. Between 1986 and 1987, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; produced a string of hit songs, including three Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits, two of which (&quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;) reached No. 1. The third single &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; peaked at No. 7. The album peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Bon Jovi&#x27;s first number-one album in the United States. The album spent 38 weeks inside the Top 5 of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, including 8 weeks at No. 1. It is the best-selling album of 1987 in the United States, and eventually reached Diamond certification by the RIAA and current sales stand at 15 million copies, making it one of the best-selling album in the United States. In the UK, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; received a 3× Platinum certification by the BPI. The album also achieved Diamond status in Canada, and 6× Platinum status in Australia.

&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was met with generally positive reviews. Writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in September 1987, Robert Christgau said, &quot;Sure seven million teenagers can be wrong, but their assent is not without a certain documentary satisfaction. Yes, it proves that youth rebellion is toothless enough to simulate and market. But who the hell thought youth was dangerous in the current vacuum? Would you have preferred the band market patriotism? And are you really immune to &#x27;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&#x27;?&quot; In 1990 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jimmy Guterman thoroughly berated the band and the album. &quot;Jon Bon Jovi and his band serve up condescending sentiment, reducing every emotional statement to a barefaced cliché – either because they think that&#x27;s all their audience can comprehend or because that&#x27;s all they can comprehend. On &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, Bon Jovi sounds like bad fourth-generation metal, a smudgy Xerox of Quiet Riot.&quot; The album is ranked 44th in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of the Definitive 200 Albums of all time.

==2005 re-release==
In 2005, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was re-issued as a DualDisc. The CD side contains a newly remastered version. The DVD side contains the same album in its original stereo mix, a slightly expanded 5.1 surround sound version, and all 5 music videos. The expanded album includes additional elements within many of the songs, in some cases increasing their runtime. The DualDisc was released on September 20, 2005, the same release date as &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;.

<text>Montgomery is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,570 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Montgomery was incorporated as a borough by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania on March 21, 1887, from part of Clinton Township. The history of the settlement of Montgomery begins in 1783 when John Lawson established a homestead there. Nicholas Shaffer built a gristmill in Montgomery in 1795. A sawmill and a wool carding mill were other early industries found on Black Hole Creek which flows through Montgomery.

P. M. Barber opened a distillery in 1859 and later a planing mill in 1869 on the site of the distillery which maintained sustained success. Barber with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops which started in 1873, under the supervision of Levi Houston, and built woodworking machinery sold to clients throughout the United States, Canada and Australia.

Montgomery was previously known as Black Hole for the creek that flows through it and the post office established in 1836 bearing that name. It was also known as Clinton Mills, again named for the post office. The name Montgomery stems from another name for the same post office, Montgomery Station.

The trophy was created in 1961 from an old athletic shoe found in the Muncy High School locker room; the shoe has been bronzed and mounted on a wooden box. It was intended in 1961 that should one of the teams win the trophy five years in a row that team would keep the shoe permanently. However, when Montgomery achieved this goal in 1974, the team voted to continue the tradition. Muncy currently leads the series with 28 wins to Montgomery&#x27;s 18.

In 2007, the Montgomery Lady Raiders won the District IV Championship in Class A Girls Basketball.

Montgomery is also the home of the Montgomery Little League, a chartered member of Little League Baseball, and is billed as &quot;The Second Oldest Little League In The World&quot; until they merged with Muncy Little league in 2011, which ended the streak of 64 continuous years. They were represented in the 1947 Little League World Series, losing to the Lincoln Little League 7-2 and the Brandon Little League 14-2. Montgomery has not made it back to the World Series since.

<text>Montoursville is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. The 2020 census reported its population as 4,745. It forms part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Williamsport Regional Airport is in Montoursville.

Developed on the east bank of Loyalsock Creek near the former native village of Otstonwakin, the borough is named for Andrew Montour, the French/Native American and son of Madame Montour, a Native American interpreter and negotiator who served the British colonial government in New York and Pennsylvania during the early eighteenth century. She led the native village. Her son also became influential as an interpreter and negotiator, serving colonial governments in Pennsylvania and Virginia, including during the French and Indian War.

==History==
Otstawonkin was a native village located at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The Great Shamokin Path ran along the west bank of the river, where late 20th century archeology has shown the village was mostly located. During the 1730s and 1740s, it became an important stopping point for Moravian missionaries who preached in frontier Pennsylvania. For example, Count Zinzendorf, a missionary guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Oneida chief Shikellamy, came to Otstonwakin in 1742.

Madame Montour is believed to have been of Algonkin-French ancestry, born in Quebec. In one account, she told a colonist in the 1740s that she had been taken captive in an Iroquois raid and adopted into an Iroquois family. (Her given name may have been Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, or Madeleine.) Speaking French and English, as well as Algonquian and Iroquoian languages, she became highly influential in New York, and acted as Governor Robert Hunter&#x27;s personal interpreter.

She and her Oneida husband Carondawana settled in Pennsylvania by 1727, moving south from New York; he had been appointed by the Shawnee in this part of Pennsylvania as their representative to the provincial council. A war chief, Carondawana was killed in 1729 in a southern raid against the Catawba people. Madame Montour continued to have influence as a friend of the British, representing the Iroquois and other native peoples of the area. She was hospitable to the white men who were beginning to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. She had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes in the area, who were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion.

Believed to have been born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Madame Montour grew up in the province of New York, where she served as an interpreter to the British. Because of her numerous native ties, she was very influential. The British colonial government was known to be sometimes laggardly in paying her for her services, making her wait one time a year for payment. 

Madame Montour is believed to have had three children, but different kinship terms has caused confusion among historians as to the status of some. Louis (Lewis), may have been a son or nephew, named for her brother, Louis Couc Montour. He served as an interpreter during the French and Indian War, when he was killed. Her daughter (or niece), Margaret, later to be known as &quot;French Margaret,&quot; became a leader of &quot;French Margaret&#x27;s Town&quot; at the mouth of Lycoming Creek, a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Montoursville.

Her surviving son Andrew, took over leadership of Otstonwakin in the 1740s. Growing up in a polyglot world, he displayed his mother&#x27;s gift for languages, speaking French, English, Lenape, Shawnee and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as an interpreter for local tribes and settlers. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour, he described him as looking &quot;decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would have thought he was one.&quot;

Montour also served as an interpreter with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He later was appointed as a captain in George Washington&#x27;s Army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. Andrew Montour left Montoursville at some point and moved to Juniata County with his mother before finally settling on Mountour&#x27;s Island in the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. She died in that area in 1753.

===Federal period and later===
Permanent European-American settlement of this site did not take place until after the American Revolutionary War. John Burrows gained credit as the founder of Montoursville because he sold lots to other settlers, as well as achieving political power and wealth. He was born near Rahway, New Jersey. In his youth Burrows carried mail by horseback between New York and Philadelphia. He also served as a courier for General George Washington during the American Revolution for fourteen months. Following the war, Burrows migrated to Muncy, Pennsylvania and worked in the distilling business for several years.

He built up capital to make an invest in land near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek, which was developed as Montoursville. He bought in 1812. Burrows divided his land into lots in 1820 and sold them for $50.00 each. In Lycoming County government, Burrows served as a justice of the peace before being elected county commissioner in 1802, and to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1808.

The first buyers of lots in Montoursville settled according to ethnicity. The Germans settled in the eastern end in a neighborhood called Coffeetown, while the English settled in a western neighborhood known as Teatown. In addition to selling the lots in Montoursville, Burrows operated a highly successful farm. He sent his produce by raft down the Susquehanna River to Baltimore, where he was able to turn a profit. Burrows built the first gristmill in the town. He continued to sell lots up until his death in 1837.

His son Nathaniel Burrows was also a businessman. He opened the first general store in the town. He received the contract for construction of the West Branch Canal in this section of Lycoming County. Nathaniel Burrows influenced the routing of the canal so that it ran closer to the town and his businesses. Montoursville was incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1850.

John Else came as a child with his family to the Montoursville area in 1807 from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His family farmed along Mill Creek in what is now Mill Creek Township. As a young man, John Else worked to build the first permanent bridge over Loyalsock Creek in 1815. He made numerous improvements in the community. Else built many structures in Montoursville, working with his father on the first permanent house.

===Indian Park===
Indian Park is located on the north-western side of Montoursville; Interstate 180/U.S. Route 220 run parallel to it. In the 21st century, the large recreational park has several miles of hiking and biking trails, numerous softball fields, picnic areas and pavilions, and fishing ponds.

Indian Park was a developed as an amusement park in the late 19th century. Known as a trolley park, it could be reached by public transportation. Visitors from Williamsport would board the trolley in downtown and ride to Indian Park to spend a day of recreation along the banks of Loyalsock Creek. The park had one of the largest and longest roller coasters on the East Coast. The park also featured more than of ponds, a theater, and a merry-go-round. The amusement park was closed in 1924 due in large part to the seasonal costs of reconstruction of infrastructure following the annual floods on Loyalsock Creek. In addition, people&#x27;s increasing use of automobiles meant they traveled to other destinations for pleasure.

===TWA Flight 800===
Montoursville was disproportionately affected by the explosion of TWA Flight 800 on July 17, 1996, off East Moriches, New York, as 21 of the 230 passengers were Montoursville-area residents. The sixteen Montoursville High School students and their five chaperones were on a school-sponsored trip to France as part of a student exchange program.

Montoursville received condolences from around the world, including Japan, Australia, and Belgium. Governor Tom Ridge attended a vigil at the school with his wife. Ridge also attended a memorial service, which was also attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. Condolences were also sent by President Bill Clinton, the U.S. softball team at the Atlanta Olympics, and François Bujon de l&#x27;Estang, French ambassador to the United States (1995–2002).

A memorial was erected on the grounds of Montoursville High School composed of a statue of an angel sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief recounting of events. The memorial stands in a circular grove of 21 trees, one for each person lost. The angel was chosen because onlookers thought a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, resembled an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet. Randolph Hudson of State College was chosen as the memorial designer and Beth Hershberger served as landscape designer.

The five chaperones were Debbie Dickey, a French teacher of the Montoursville Area High School; Doug Dickey, her husband; Carol Fry, former school board member; Judith Rupert, high school secretary; and Eleanor Wolfson (mother of student Wendy Wolfson).
The 16 students were Jessica Aikey, Daniel Baszczewski, Michelle Bohlin, Jordan Bower, Monica Cox, Claire Gallagher, Julia Grimm, Rance Hettler, Amanda Karschner, Jody Loudenslager, Cheryl Nibert, Kimberly Rogers, Larissa Uzupis, Jacqueline Watson, Monica Weaver, and Wendy Wolfson.

<text>Moreland Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,021 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Moreland Township originally covered the entire southeast corner of Lycoming County but was divided into three townships in 1822. One part kept the name Moreland, while the other two parts were Penn and Franklin Township.

The Lairdsville Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Houseknecht Farm was added in 2007.

===The name===
There are several stories about how Moreland Township was named. One story states that an early pioneer to the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley was climbing up and down the hills and upon reaching the top of a hill exclaimed, &quot;more land!&quot; Another story relates to the &quot;sloppiness&quot; of the earliest land surveys. An acre was not necessarily measured accurately. These particular acres were larger than they were supposed to be. The early settlers liked to say that they got &quot;more land&quot; to the acre here than they could have elsewhere. The most likely reason relates to an definition of moreland, meaning &quot;a hilly country&quot;.

===Early settlers===
A veteran of the American Revolutionary War was the first settler in Moreland Township. Colonel George Smith migrated to Moreland Township from Montgomery County in 1790. He built a gristmill there in 1796. Smith and his wife were the parents of six children, three boys and three girls. The marriage of his daughter Annie to a Quaker named William Farr caused some controversy in the early history of Moreland Township. William Farr came from a strict Quaker family who did not look kindly upon his choice of bride. The local Quaker congregation insisted that Farr confess that he had done wrong in marrying outside his faith. Farr refused to do so and insisted that his Baptist wife, Annie, was a good Christian woman. Farr was forced to choose between his Quaker faith and his Baptist wife. He chose his wife and converted to the Baptist faith. Colonel Smith&#x27;s son, Jonathan, also had a marriage that proved to be interesting. He married Annie Simpson, the sister of John Simpson of Ohio. John Simpson was the grandfather of Ulysses S. Grant who became president of the United States. This family bond meant that many of the residents of Moreland Township in the mid-19th century were second cousins to the man who served as their president.

==Geography==
Moreland Township is in southeastern Lycoming County and is bordered by Columbia and Montour counties to the south, Muncy Creek Township to the west, Wolf Township to the northwest, Penn Township to the north, and Franklin Township to the east. Pennsylvania Route 442 crosses the southern part of the township, leading northwest to Muncy and southeast to Millville. Pennsylvania Route 118 crosses the northern part of the township, leading west to Hughesville and east-northeast to Dallas. Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat, is west of the township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Moreland Township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.55%, are water. Little Muncy Creek is the main stream through the township, flowing west to join Muncy Creek and then the West Branch Susquehanna River near Muncy. A small part of the southern edge of the township flows via the West Branch of Chillisquaque Creek, another tributary of the West Branch of the Susquehanna. The northernmost part of the township drains westward via Sugar Run and Little Sugar Run to Muncy Creek near Hughesville.

== Economy and environment ==
The Harman Lewis 1H well, a Marcellus Formation shale gas well in Moreland Township, has had a methane leak since 2011. In January 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued an order to the well operator, Range Resources, to address the leakage problems &quot;for once and for all&quot;. Combustible gas has been found &quot;in groundwater, in soil surveys in nearby farm fields and surfacing on Greg&#x27;s Run and Sugar Run.&quot;

<text>Muncy is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The name Muncy comes from the Munsee Indians who once lived in the area. The population was 2,442 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Muncy is located on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just south of the confluence of Muncy Creek with the river. Currently the borough president is Bill Scott and the mayor is Jon Ort.

==History==
===Early settlement===


===18th century===
About 1787, four brothers Silas, William, Benjamin, and Isaac McCarty, came here from Bucks County. They were of Quaker extraction. William and Benjamin bought known as the &quot;John Brady farm.&quot;

John Brady was one of the earliest settlers in the area. He received a land grant which was awarded to the officers who served in the Bouquet Expedition. He chose land west of present-day Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. He built a private stockade on this land in the Spring of 1776, close to present day Muncy, Pennsylvania, which he called &quot;Fort Brady.&quot; John Brady&#x27;s Muncy house was large for its day. He dug a trench around it and emplaced upright logs in that trench side by side all the way around. He filled the trench with dirt and packed the dirt against the logs to hold the log wall solidly in place. This log wall ran about twelve feet high from the ground. He then held this wall in place upright by pinning smaller logs across its top, to keep the wall face steady and solid. The John Brady homestead was perilously close to the leading edge of the frontier of that time, the Susquehanna River. The other side of the Susquehanna was fiercely dominated by the Indians. The Indians resisted settler encroachment on their territory by routinely crossing the Susquehanna to raid the settlers. The settlers just as routinely crossed the Susquehanna to pursue the raiding war parties to retaliate and sometimes to rescue captives taken by the Indians during these raids. In this ongoing skirmishing, both sides committed unspeakable atrocities on the other, which drove a long-lasting cycle of revenge for revenge brutalities between the settlers and Indians. It was in the midst of this extreme danger and violence that Major John Brady chose to settle his family, which set the stage for what happened to him and for what so greatly impacted and influenced his family—especially, his sons, Continental Army Captain Samuel Brady of Brady&#x27;s Leap fame and Hugh Brady, who became a Major General in the United States Army.

The McCarty brothers divided up the former Brady land, with William taking the portion between what is now West Water Street and Muncy Creek, and Benjamin that portion between West Water Street and the southern boundary. Main Street now represents what was then the boundary between the Brady farm and Isaac Walton&#x27;s.

In 1797, ten years after coming to Muncy, Benjamin McCarty conceived the idea of starting a town, and began laying out lots on what is now Main Street, and sold them to different parties. His example was followed by his brother William, north of Water street, and by Isaac Walton. The town was named Pennsborough in honor of the William Penn.

===19th century===

The town grew slowly and was nothing but a village for many years. More than a quarter of a century passed before an act of incorporation was applied for. Finally, by act approved March 15, 1826, it was incorporated as a borough.

On January 19, 1827, with a population of less than 600, the name was changed from Pennsborough to Muncy. This was done because many persons thought it was &quot;too flat and long,&quot; and the new name would be more in accordance with the historical associations of the place, and serve to perpetuate the name of the tribe that first dwelt there, a tribe of Lenape, named Monseys.

One of the common misconceptions about United States history prior to the Civil War is that all the citizens of the northern states were against slavery. In fact many of the &quot;Yankees&quot;, were all for slavery, especially in states closer to the Confederacy like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware. There were more than a few abolitionists in Pennsylvania, and Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, was one of the most prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was, like most Quakers, a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery. Hawley invited a now unknown speaker to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker arrived in April 1842. His arrival and resultant speech set off a tremendous riot that led to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter.

The anti-slavery speaker gave his speech at a one-room school in Muncy in April 1842. During the course of the speech, eighteen men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows. Enos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley&#x27;s home at the corner of High and Main Streets. They continued the assault on Hawley&#x27;s home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters. The rioters were indicted in September and went to trial in October, when thirteen of the eighteen rioters were found guilty as charged. The jury&#x27;s deliberation was quite a long process.

Abraham Updegraff was a member of the jury who was the driving force that led to the conviction of the rioters. Updegraff, an ardent abolitionist who was a vital member of the Underground Railroad in Lycoming County, was able to convince his peers that the rioters deserved to be punished. The first jury vote was 11 to 1 in favor of acquittal, with Updegraff being the lone dissenter. Updegraff argued that &quot;we have been sworn to try this case according to the law and the evidence presented and that if no contradictory evidence [is] offered by the defendants than we could do nothing more than to convict them.&quot; He was able to make his argument in German which was the native tongue of three other jurors. The second vote was 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal. A third vote brought about the conviction of 13 of the 18 men charged in the Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842. This conviction was essentially overturned by Governor David R. Porter when he pardoned the rioters several days later. Governor Porter&#x27;s statement of pardon said, &quot;It is represented to me by highly respected citizens of Lycoming County, that this prosecution was instituted more with a view to the accomplishment of political ends than to serve the cause of law and order.&quot;

Porter&#x27;s pardon message placed the blame for the riot on the abolitionist speaker. Porter stated that the speech was &quot;notoriously offensive to the minds of those to whom they were addressed and were calculated to bring about a breach of the peace.&quot; This pardon led to Governor Porter being given the less than flattering nickname of the &quot;Previous Pardonin Porter.&quot; Historians believe that Porter pardoned the rioters under political pressure that was rampant, in the years prior to the Civil War, regarding the issue of slavery.

===21st century===
Muncy has nearly 2,700 residents. Its high school football team and the Montgomery high school team play annually for The Shoe, a trophy created in 1961 from an old athletic shoe found in the Muncy High School locker room; the shoe has since been bronzed and mounted on a wooden box. Muncy currently leads the series with 28 wins to Montgomery&#x27;s 18. Hughesville&#x27;s high school team and Muncy are also rivals. In the first game of the season, September 4, 2010, Muncy kept The Shoe by shutting out Montgomery 52–0. As of December 2017, Muncy still is in possession of The Shoe.

<doc id="133149" wikidata="Q779923" url="?curid=133149" title="New Jersey (album)">
<text>New Jersey is the fourth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on September 19, 1988, by Mercury Records. The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn and recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The album was the follow-up to the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in its second week of release after debuting at number eight. It remained at the top for four consecutive weeks. The album was named after the band&#x27;s home state of New Jersey.

It produced five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top ten hits, the most top ten hits to date for any hard rock album, including &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;, which both reached number one. The album was certified 7× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also debuted at number one in the UK and was the band&#x27;s first UK No. 1 album. &quot;New Jersey&quot; was released by the Soviet state-owned record label Melodiya, being the first American album to be officially released in the USSR. To celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2014, the album was repackaged with bonus tracks.

==Background==
The album was recorded very shortly after the Slippery When Wet Tour, because the band wanted to prove that they were not just going to be a one hit wonder. The album was initially planned to be a double album; however, this idea was rejected by the record label because they were skeptical about the higher price point and decided they would only release a single album. One working title for the album was &quot;Sons of Beaches&quot;, which alluded to the title of &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;.

==Recording and production==
The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn like its predecessor and recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Bruce Fairbairn.

When the Slippery When Wet Tour ended in October 1987, the band were inactive for about three to four weeks. Then Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora began making demos for 17 songs which would make up the first batch of songs written for the album. However, they began to feel a high level of pressure because they did not feel as though they had &quot;the amazing song&quot;. Jon Bon Jovi said that &quot;I really wanted to do it again, not for monetary reasons—I have plenty of money—but it was such an amazing feeling to have done what we&#x27;ve done. There was a real fear of not being able to write &#x27;You Give Love a Bad Name&#x27; again.&quot; Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora sat together and wrote the song &quot;Love Is War&quot; but Jon Bon Jovi wanted to write a song that would prove to be just as successful as &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; so desperately that it came out with exactly the same chord progression. They later started on the second batch of songs and they wrote &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot; with Desmond Child. &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot; was originally recorded acoustically, however the producer Bruce Fairbairn persuaded them to re-record it with electric instruments in a much more metal style. Jon Bon Jovi has since said that he believed the song would have made number one on the charts if it had been released in its original form. This song has a similar theme to &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, as it is about a young working class couple struggling to make ends meet.

Although the glossy production and anthems from &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; remained, the band wished to show a level of diversity on the album. The album is much more experimental with a long, atmosphere-building intro on &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, harmonica and organ duels on &quot;Homebound Train&quot; and a flamenco guitar intro on &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;. &quot;Ride Cowboy Ride&quot; is a short song functioning as an introduction to &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; and was recorded in mono. The song is credited to &quot;Captain Kidd and King of Swing&quot;, the nicknames of Bon Jovi and Sambora.

&quot;Love for Sale&quot; was recorded and engineered by John P. Allen and Chris Cavallaro at Chalet Sound in Allenwood, New Jersey. All pre-production songs were recorded and engineered at Chalet Sound by Allen additional engineering by Cavallaro and Nejat Bekan.

==Release and reception==
&quot;New Jersey&quot; debuted at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, but climbed to No. 1 the following week and spent four weeks at the top spot. It eventually sold 7 million copies in the United States. The album debuted at No. 1 in Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia. &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and the ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; both hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, and &quot;Living in Sin&quot; reached the Top 10.

&quot;New Jersey&quot; was released on July 1, 2014, as a 2CD &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, which included the original album remastered along with B-sides and previously unreleased demos from the &quot;New Jersey/Sons of Beaches&quot; sessions. The &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; includes both discs plus a DVD containing the documentary &quot;Access All Areas: A Rock &amp; Roll Odyssey&quot; and &quot;New Jersey: The Videos&quot;. Both titles were previously available on VHS.

<doc id="133150" wikidata="Q9042699" url="?curid=133150" title="Muncy Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Muncy Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,177 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The unincorporated village of Pennsdale is located here. There is a Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) Meeting House in Pennsdale that was built in 1799, and is one of the oldest buildings and perhaps the oldest house of worship in the county.

==History==
Muncy Township, named for the Munsee tribe, was the first township in the county north of the West Branch Susquehanna River to be formed (predating even Lycoming County itself). It was originally formed as a part of Northumberland County on April 9, 1772. Muncy Township, as one of the seven original townships of Northumberland County, was once an immense township. It had an indefinite northern border. The southern border of the township was the West Branch Susquehanna River. The eastern boundary may have been Muncy Creek, and the western boundary was, like the northern boundary, indefinite. Loyalsock Township was the first township to be formed from Muncy Township, in 1786. This division encompassed the land between Loyalsock and Lycoming creeks. The township was divided several more times. Muncy Creek Township was formed in 1797, Shrewsbury Township in 1804, Penn Township in 1828, Wolf Township in 1834, and lastly Mill Creek Township in 1878.

Samuel Wallis was one of the first permanent settlers in Muncy Township. Known as the &quot;Land King&quot;, Wallis operated Muncy Farms which was for its time a large and very successful farm. Wallis first came to the West Branch Susquehanna Valley in 1768 as a surveyor. He was born in Harford County, Maryland, in 1730 to a wealthy Quaker family. Wallis received a good education and inherited a large fortune. He sought to expand his fortune in various ways. He worked for a while as a shipping merchant in Philadelphia and became a surveyor. While working as a surveyor, Wallis was introduced to what would become his home in 1768. He gave up his job as a surveyor and began acquiring land up and down the West Branch Valley. His holdings are said to have extended as far west as Pine Creek from his base of operations in Muncy Township. Wallis held title to the land that has since become Muncy borough, Muncy Creek Township, Muncy Township, Montoursville, Loyalsock Township, Williamsport, Woodward Township, Piatt Township, Porter Township and the borough of Jersey Shore. Wallis&#x27; home was one of, if not the, first houses to be built in what is now Lycoming County. Samuel Wallis was such an important figure in the early history of Muncy Township that Fort Muncy was built on his land. This fort served as an outpost for the colonial army of Pennsylvania, providing a safe haven for settlers from various Indian attacks.
Samuel Wallis married Lydia Hollingsworth in Philadelphia on March 1, 1770. They settled at Muncy Farms soon after the marriage and continued to farm while Wallis continued to expand his land holdings. Wallis was forced to flee Muncy Farms during the &quot;Big Runaway&quot;. During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the Big Runaway occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Wallis returned as soon as it was safe and continued to farm. He also built a gristmill along Carpenter&#x27;s Run. The construction of this mill was entrusted to Colonel Henry Antes of Nippenose Township. Antes was the operator of the most successful mill in the area, along Antes Creek.

Samuel Wallis and James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Supreme Court appointee of George Washington, became involved with Theophilus Cazenove and the Holland Land Company. This company bought up much of the land that is now northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York near the Great Lakes. Wallis worked as a surveyor and assessor for the land company, and Wilson was heavily invested in the operation. Wilson owed a tremendous debt to Wallis and others. He fled to Edenton, North Carolina, to escape his debts. Wallis followed him there in an effort to reach a settlement. They reached a preliminary agreement and agreed to meet again. Both men died before the debts could be settled. Wallis contracted yellow fever on his return from North Carolina and died in Philadelphia on October 14, 1798. Wilson died in Edenton on August 21, 1798. Wallis&#x27; heirs were unable to collect Wilson&#x27;s debt. Wallis himself left a large debt behind. The heirs were forced to sell Samuel Wallis&#x27; land for a fraction of his value to Henry Drinker, who gave the land to his daughter and son-in-law, Elizabeth and Charles Hall. Muncy Farms became known as Hall&#x27;s Farms.

Pennsdale is a village in Muncy Township. It was founded by a group of Quakers in 1799, who built a meetinghouse there. The first meetings were held in Samuel Wallis&#x27;s home as early as 1791. The Quakers continue to hold meetings in Pennsdale.

The Reading-Halls Station Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The township also played an important role in the development and regular use of the Pennsylvania Canal along the West Branch. The hamlet of Port Penn rose up along the section of the canal that passed through Muncy Creek Township. This hamlet, greatly reduced in population, was a very busy and sometimes dangerous place.

Muncy Dam was built across the river at Muncy Creek Township. This dam provided the water that was needed to fill the canal along a stretch that began at Port Penn and ended at Sunbury. The dam, canal and towpath were all constructed for a considerable amount of money. Around these construction projects, the hamlet of Port Penn was built. Upon completion of the canal in 1834, it was a thriving community featuring a manufacturer of canal boats. Other businesses in Port Penn included hotels and taverns that provided housing and food for the men working on the canal, and a blacksmith and a saddle maker. There was a butcher who also operated a grocery business, a weaver, a wagon builder, a shoemaker, and an ice business, as well as several teachers, masons and general merchants.

Port Penn quickly gained a reputation as being a dangerous place that attracted &quot;unsavory&quot; characters. Gambling and prize fighting were two popular pastimes. Large amounts of alcohol were consumed by the participants, furthering the danger. An organized group of counterfeiters had an operation in a cabin in Muncy Creek Township that passed fake coins onto the boatmen and others who passed by Port Penn on the canal. A riot took place during the construction of the canal that resulted in several deaths. A man named Barney McCue was responsible for at least two murders at Port Penn, one in 1870 and another in 1874. Many children drowned in the canal and river. The railroad that largely replaced the canal was not less dangerous, as several lives were claimed on the rails. Even the so-called &quot;Last Raft&quot; to be floated down the West Branch took several lives at Port Penn. The raft hit the railroad bridge and sent 45 passengers into the river, seven of whom died.

The canal in Muncy Creek Township brought vast amounts of goods that were stored in warehouses in Port Penn and Muncy. The farmers and industrialists of Lycoming County used these warehouses to store their goods before they were sent south on the canal. The chief exports of the county were hogs, wheat, flour, lumber, dried and salted meats, leather, and whiskey. Whiskey was a very big business. At least 13 distilleries in the area produced a total of of whiskey a day. Muncy Creek Township also was home to a thriving commercial fishing industry. The dam was an ideal point to catch fish. The bottleneck in the river created by the dam and canal locks caused the fish to be forced into one easy to reach location. Baskets were placed along the dam and locks, and tremendous amounts of fish and eels were easily caught. The dams and locks at Port Penn were destroyed by numerous floods in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley during the late 1800s. This caused the canal to be abandoned as it was replaced by the railroads. Port Penn was since faded away. There are several homes in the area, but as a hamlet it no longer exists. Parts of Port Penn have been annexed by the borough of Muncy and others are in Muncy Creek Township. Lycoming College and the Muncy Historical Society have spearheaded an effort to uncover the history of Port Penn.

<text>Nippenose Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 662 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Nippenose Township was formed as part of Northumberland County in 1786 by a session of the Northumberland County court that was held in Sunbury. It became part of Lycoming County when that county was formed from Northumberland County in 1795. Nippenose Township was originally much larger than it is today, spreading over parts of what are now Clinton, Centre and Lycoming counties. The population of Nippenose Township was 588 in 1890, compared to the slightly higher population of 709 as of the 2010 census.

===Etymology===
The story behind the name of Nippenose Township is unclear. There are three competing stories. One states that it is named for the Indian phrase &quot;Nippeno-wi&quot;, meaning a warm and genial summerlike place. The second story behind the name claims that there was an old Indian named Nippenose who lingered in the valley after it was settled by whites. Apparently this man&#x27;s nose had been &quot;nipped&quot; by exposure to the frost, hence the name &quot;Nippenose&quot;. A third explanation of the name is that there is only one way into and out of the valley without going over a mountain. This gap is bordered on the west by a mountain with nip in the end of it, like a nipped nose.

===John Henry Antes===
The first colonial settlers arrived in the Nippenose area in 1769. Henry Clark was the first to arrive with a &quot;warrant&quot; to the land from the colonial Pennsylvania government. One of the most prominent early settlers was Colonel John Henry Antes. He is thought to have arrived as early as 1772. His last name is featured prominently in place names in Nippenose Township. Antes Creek, the main creek in the valley, and Antes Fort, a small village, bear his name. Antes built a stockade around his home, and his neighbors came to call it &quot;Antes Fort&quot;. Colonel Antes also built a grist mill at the mouth of Antes Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1777. This mill was burned during the Revolutionary War.

During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

When things finally calmed down in 1792, Colonel Antes returned to Nippenose Township and rebuilt his mill. This second mill was a vital link in the economy of Nippenose Township until 1873 when a new mill was built in its place. Antes furthered his enterprises by building a carding and fulling mill on the banks of Antes Creek in 1810. Antes died in 1820. Ownership of the mills was passed onto his son-in-law Elias P. Youngman. Youngman and his sons expanded the business yet again in 1835 by adding machinery that was able to clean clover seed. Clover seed was very expensive at the time: a bushel of the seed sold for as much as $24.00. Clover was very important to farmers for providing ground cover and as a food supply for their grazing dairy cows.

===Antes Fort===
The village of Antes Fort rose up around the train station that was built in Nippenose Township to serve the borough of Jersey Shore, to the north across the West Branch Susquehanna River from Nippenose Township. Antes Fort went through several name changes. The surveyor who drew up the town plans called it &quot;Granville&quot;. This name was seldom uses as the locals preferred to call it &quot;Jersey Shore Station&quot;. The name &quot;Antes Fort&quot; was not bestowed on the village until 1861 when the United States Post Office established a branch there and named it in honor of Colonel Antes&#x27; stockade.

==Geography==
Nippenose Township is on the south side of the West Branch Susquehanna River in southwestern Lycoming County. It is bordered by Susquehanna and Bastress townships to the east, Limestone Township to the south, and Clinton County to the west. To the northwest, across the West Branch, are Porter Township and the borough of Jersey Shore, and to the north, also across the West Branch, is Piatt Township.

<text>Old Lycoming Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,973 at the 2020 census down from 4,938 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Old Lycoming Township is a township in Lycoming County that is actually older than the county. It was formed as part of Northumberland County on August 22, 1785, ten years before the formation of Lycoming County. The original boundaries of the township encompassed much of the territory that was previously governed by the Fair Play Men. The land between Lycoming and Pine creeks was outside of the legal boundaries of Pennsylvania until 1784 and the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix. The Fair Play Men operated a system of self-government from 1773 to 1785. Their claims to the land had no legal bearing in the state of Pennsylvania when it was finally legally part of the state. These men had some troubles gaining the title to the land that they had cleared and so long defended; ultimately, some obtained title to their lands, while others removed westward.

In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna Valley, including what is now Old Lycoming Township, were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. In the early summer of 1778 news came of a group of Native American warriors, perhaps accompanied by Loyalist and British soldiers, heading for the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley to destroy settlements. There were many smaller incidents of violence against settlers, but on June 10, 1778, a party of sixteen settlers was attacked in what is now Williamsport. In what became known as the &quot;Plum Tree Massacre&quot;, twelve of the sixteen were killed and scalped, including two women and six children. The Wyoming Valley Massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley.

Most of the settlers did not return to their farms until after Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition had driven off the Indian and Loyalist threat. John McMeens, a native of South Carolina, was one of the first to return to the area. He had settled along the river in 1776. He fled during the Big Runaway and returned in 1791. McMeens rose to a position of prominence in Lycoming County. He was a county commissioner, state commissioner, and member of the initial committee that explored to possibility of building the Pennsylvania Canal that improved navigation on the Susquehanna River. McMeens also represented the area in the Pennsylvania General Assembly from 1814 to 1818.

Derick Updegraff arrived in Old Lycoming Township from York County, Pennsylvania, in 1787. He settled on land that had previously been improved during the Fair Play Men era. He was not able to claim legal control of his until 1793 as the result of a lawsuit over the land filed by the man who had previously claimed it. Updegraff and his sons improved the land by clearing many more acres and building what was one of the largest barns in Lycoming County.

Today Old Lycoming Township includes the census designated area of Garden View, a suburb to Williamsport with many family homes and an extensive stretch of commercial and light industrial development along Lycoming Creek Road.

==Geography==
Old Lycoming Township is in central Lycoming County and is bordered by Lycoming Township to the north, Loyalsock Township to the east, the Newberry section of Williamsport to the south, and Woodward Township to the west. The eastern border of Old Lycoming Township is formed by Lycoming Creek. U.S. Route 15, the Appalachian Thruway, crosses the east side of the township in the Lycoming Creek valley, with access from Exit 137 at the southern border of the township, serving Garden View, and from Exit 140 at the northern border, serving the neighborhood of Woodlawn Park.

<text>Penn Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 892 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Penn Township was formed in 1828 when Muncy Township was divided for the fourth time. It is named for Penn Township in Berks County, which in turn is named for William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. Tobias and Isaac Kepner had migrated to eastern Lycoming County from Berks County and wanted their new home to have the same name as their old home. Much of the history of Penn Township can be found in the history of the Big Runaway and Muncy Township. Lumbering was the dominant industry in Penn Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. A man-made lake, Beaver Lake, was built to supply water power for a sawmill. The sawmill has long since disappeared but the lake remains.

==Geography==

Penn Township is in southeastern Lycoming County and is bordered by Sullivan County to the northeast, Franklin Township to the southeast, Moreland Township to the south, Wolf Township and the borough of Picture Rocks to the west, and Shrewsbury Township to the northwest, across Muncy Creek. U.S. Route 220 crosses the northernmost part of the township in the Muncy Creek valley, leading northeast to Towanda and southwest to Hughesville and Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat. The unincorporated community of Strawbridge is in the northern part of the township along US-220, and the community of Beaver Lake is in the east, next to the lake of the same name.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Penn Township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.16%, are water. The northern and western parts of the township drain to Muncy Creek, which forms the northern border of the township and flows southwestward to the West Branch Susquehanna River near Muncy. The southern and eastern parts of the township, including Beaver Lake, drain south into Franklin Township to Little Muncy Creek, a tributary of Muncy Creek.

==Demographics==

<doc id="133157" wikidata="Q7190388" url="?curid=133157" title="Piatt Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Piatt Township ( ) is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,045 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Piatt Township was formed from part of Mifflin Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County on April 30, 1857. The new township encompassed what was the southernmost part of Mifflin Township. Piatt Township is named for William Piatt, an associate judge in Lycoming County when the township was created.

When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Piatt Township they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the &quot;Fair Play System&quot;, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the &quot;Tiadaghton Elm&quot; on the banks of Pine Creek.

In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley, including Piatt Township, were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

Larrys Creek, which bisects Piatt Township, is named for Larry Burt, the first settler in the area, who lived near the mouth of the creek near what is now the hamlet of Larrys Creek. He traded with the indigenous peoples and according to tradition had a Native American wife. Burt was already there when surveyors came through in 1769 (after the land was purchased in the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix), but disappeared sometime soon after, perhaps moving west with the Native Americans who left the area.

Other settlers soon followed Burt to what is now Piatt Township. They settled along the banks of Larrys Creek near where the creek flows into the West Branch Susquehanna River. Peter Duffy was one of the most prominent of the early settlers. He settled with his family at the mouth of Larrys Creek in August 1784. Duffy&#x27;s journey from County Kildare, Ireland, was a long and difficult struggle. He left from Dublin in July 1775 during the early years of the American Revolution. Duffy was an acquaintance of Major John Pitcairn. Pitcairn was with the Royal Marines and was part of the British force that was occupying Boston at the outset of the Revolution. Pitcairn was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. This left Duffy without a point of contact in the Thirteen Colonies.

Duffy and his family landed in Philadelphia in August 1775. After a short stay in the Philadelphia area, he and his family moved further inland to Lancaster County. The family spent seven years in the Lancaster area before moving to Coxestown, now known as Susquehanna Township, just north of Harrisburg in Dauphin County. The Duffys owned a home along the banks of the Susquehanna River for about a year before it was flooded and accidentally burned in the winter of 1784. Duffy did not lot this stop him. He gathered his family and migrated further still into the Pennsylvania frontier. The Duffy family was joined by the Stewart family on their trip from Dauphin County to Lycoming County. Both families settled down to the east of what is now Jersey Shore. The Stewarts settled on the southern side of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Nippenose Township and the Duffys settled on the opposite shore in Piatt Township.

Duffy built his home near where the Great Shamokin Path crossed Larrys Creek. This path became an important road in the settlement of the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. Early pioneers trekked up the road as they continued to move ever westward. Duffy opened an inn that soon became an important stopping point for the pioneers. Duffy was unable to enjoy his prominence for very long. Late one evening, a pack of wolves attacked him along the Great Shamokin Path, and while he fended them off and returned home, he was weakened by the cold and the effort of defending himself. He came down with a severe and fatal cold.

Duffy&#x27;s widow Martha was left to manage the inn with the help of her children, whose numbers were soon reduced by the February 1807 death of their firstborn son James in an accident at a wedding party at Culbertson&#x27;s Mill in Duboistown. Martha Duffy was left with her four remaining children. Her second daughter, Catharine, had married and moved with her husband to Meadville in Crawford County. The oldest daughter, Mary Ann, took over management of the inn. Bernard operated the family owned sawmill on Pine Creek, Margaret managed the Duffy family home, and Peter, the son, managed the family farm. These four Duffy children never married and spent the rest of their lives living together in the family home in Piatt Township.

The area of land along the West Branch and Larrys Creek was previously known as &quot;Level Corner&quot;. Many of the early settlers were attracted to this area of fertile farmland. Isaac Smith migrated to Piatt Township from Chester County. Smith was a millwright and farmer. Robert Covenhoven was another prominent early settler. He was a veteran of the American Revolution, having fought at the battles of Trenton and Princeton. Covenhoven had returned to the West Branch Valley just before the Big Runaway. Upon hearing of the approaching raiding Indians and Loyalist, Covenhoven rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers at Fort Antes (opposite what is now Jersey Shore) and the western part of the valley. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Following the Great Runaway, Covenhoven continued to serve as a scout for the Patriot forces on the Pennsylvania frontier. At the conclusion of the war he settled with his wife at Level Corner.

<text>Picture Rocks is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The 2020 census measured the population at 640. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Notable person==

Picture Rocks is the birthplace of Warren Sprout, who won a shooting gold medal at the 1912 Olympics.

==History==
Picture Rocks was incorporated as a borough on September 27, 1875 from land formerly included in Wolf Township. However, its recorded history began a century earlier. The earliest settlers arrived in 1773 and observed Indian pictographs (no longer extant) in the Muncy Creek valley. The borough occupies the site of a Munsee Indian village, evidenced by arrowheads and other relics found in the vicinity of the creek.
The Province of Pennsylvania issued the first warrant for property in the Picture Rocks area to Henry Rody on June 3, 1773. The land remained largely undeveloped passing through several hands until it was sold in 1848 to A. R. Sprout and Amos Burrows. The two founded Picture Rocks. Sprout and Burrows cleared the land of the rocks, logs and brush. They also rebuilt an abandoned sawmill and established a factory that manufactured sashes, doors, and window blinds. This factory, the first of its kind in the area, caused a stir among local carpenters who believed that the ready made building materials would curtail their craft. The factory was later used by the Burrows Brothers Furniture Company before becoming the Handle and Excelsior Company. Another factory, located at the present intersection of U.S. Route 220 and Factory Street, manufactured ladders. Picture Rocks continues as a wood processing center.

The town grew as other manufacturers arrived to harness water power provided by Muncy Creek. The prohibitionist organizers of the town required persons purchasing lots in Picture Rocks to sign an agreement stating that they would not open a saloon or engage in the trafficking of liquor. The borough remains a dry municipality.

The Baptists of Picture Rocks organized an 1840 meeting at the school house. A traveling minister arrived in Picture Rocks one Saturday evening and found the school to be unfit for Sunday gatherings. After preaching the following morning, he rallied the members of the congregation to the cause of building a proper house of worship. Under the guidance of their new pastor, the members of the Baptist Church built a log church. Twenty-five years later the congregation replaced it with a larger facility.

At the time of the borough&#x27;s creation, Center Street was the primary thoroughfare. The stately homes built by the Burrows and Sprout families remained along Center Street and were identified by their square shape with low pitched roofs some with a widow&#x27;s watch.

Borough resident John Wesley Little achieved international fame for his watercolor landscapes and images of rural farms and animals. His former studio and home is located along Water Street. His paintings remain highly sought after in the regional market.

The borough boasts two churches, a Baptist Church on Elm Street and a United Methodist Church on Laurel Street.

Located within the East Lycoming School District, Picture Rocks is home to George A. Ferrell Elementary School. This K-6 elementary school is recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was originally a fully inclusive school for students in first through twelfth grades with its own sports program. In 1946 the school joined with others in neighboring Hughesville and nearby Lairdsville to form the East Lycoming School District.

<text>Pine Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 260 at the 2020 census, down from 294 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Pine Township was formed from parts of Brown, Cummings and Cogan House townships on January 27, 1857. It was originally going to be called &quot;Kingston Township&quot;, for the Kingston House that was in English Center, but the name was changed to &quot;Pine&quot; in recognition of the vast stands of pine trees that covered much of the township.

The geography and geology of Pine Township have played an important role in its history. Pine Township lies within the southern limits of the most recent ice age. This land was once covered with glaciers. As the glaciers receded they scoured the land creating a moraine, knob-like hills, and kettle holes. Some of these kettles are at the top of the hill. This has caused the unusual formation of a swamp at the top of a hill. The effects of glaciation created soil characteristics that limited successful farming, and the steep hillsides in the township also cut down on the amount of farmable land. Instead, trees have thrived in Pine Township. The old-growth forests were harvested in the mid-to-late 19th century during the lumber era that swept throughout the hills and valleys of Pennsylvania. Massive stands of hemlock and pine were chopped down and floated down Little Pine and Pine creeks to the sawmills of Williamsport. Since the end of the lumbering era, a thriving second growth forest has grown throughout Pine Township.

John Norris and his wife were among the first to settle in Pine Township. They opened a &quot;seminary&quot; or school for girls in the wilderness. During the years it was opened it was one of very few schools in such a remote part of the country to focus on educating teenaged girls.

A failed colony known as &quot;English Settlement&quot; plays a role in the history of northern Lycoming County. The Reverend John Hey, who claimed to be part of the &quot;Independent Church of England&quot;, dreamt of acquiring a vast amount of land in the wilderness and establishing a utopia. Hey and some investing partners acquired of land for $21,757 in 1805. Hey next travelled to England to convince his countrymen, mostly from Chard, Somerset, to settle his new colony. Fifteen families agreed to move to Pine Township. When they arrived they did not find the paradise that was described to them by John Hey. What they found was a wilderness of massive trees, rocks and rocky soil. The Englishmen were not prepared for this. They had no experience with clearing any land for farming, and the land that they managed to clear was too rocky for farming. The English Settlement was abandoned ten years after its founding. Those who managed to survive moved to more fertile land in the nearby area.

The villages of Oregon Hill and English Center were founded by survivors of the failed English Settlement. Oregon Hill, at an elevation of in the northern part of the township, was the location of two churches, a blacksmith shop, and two stores along with several homes. The settlers of Oregon Hill were surprised to find that the land in the area was fertile unlike much of the surrounding land. English Center on Little Pine Creek was a milling town.

The English Center Suspension Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<text>Plunketts Creek Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. It includes the villages of Barbours and Proctor. The population was 595 at the 2020 census, down from 684 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Colonial and Revolutionary era===
Plunketts Creek Township was formed from parts of Franklin Township, Lycoming County, and what is now Davidson Township, Sullivan County, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County in 1838. The township was once much larger in size, but several townships in both Lycoming and Sullivan counties have been carved from its original boundaries. The township is named for Plunketts Creek, a tributary of Loyalsock Creek. The creek is in turn named for Colonel William Plunkett, a frontier doctor and militia officer during the pre-Revolution years in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was noted for his skill in dressing the wounds of pioneers who had been scalped during the French and Indian War. Plunkett was also a veteran of the Pennamite–Yankee War, which had pitted settlers from Connecticut to the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania against those who had been established in Pennsylvania prior to the Connecticut settlers&#x27; arrival. He received title to land at the mouth of the creek that is now named for him.

The township was originally to be called Plunkett Township. Some residents of the township did not approve of this name. They questioned William Plunkett&#x27;s loyalty, for he had remained largely &quot;passive&quot; regarding the American Revolution. Some believed that he had sympathized with the cause of the Tories during the Revolution, but others wanted to honor one of the first and most important settlers to the area. A compromise was reached by naming it &quot;Plunketts Creek Township&quot;.
The first white man to live in Plunketts Creek Township had the surname of Paulhamus. Tradition states that he was a deserter during the Revolutionary War. He fled from the Redcoats and cleared a small piece of land in the wilderness along Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Bear Creek. Paulhamus was a squatter on the land from 1770 until 1776, when it is thought that he was forced to rejoin the British Army. Permanent settlers did not arrive in Plunketts Creek Township until 1818. Three men, Donelly, Smith and Payne, found the cabin that had been abandoned by Paulhamus. They expanded Paulhamus&#x27; improvements and began farming, fishing and hunting in the area.

===Logging and tanning era===
Logging was the principal industry in Plunketts Creek Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were harvested and floated down Loyalsock Creek and its tributaries to one of the many sawmills that had sprung up throughout Lycoming County. There were several sawmills in Barbours, a village along Loyalsock Creek in the township.

In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek, and the village of Barbours Mills (today Barbours) developed at the site. In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, a post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker. In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times. This is the earliest possible date for construction of the bridge, but the surviving county road docket on the construction does not mention either bridges or fords for crossing the creek.
The bridge is at the mouth of Coal Mine Hollow, and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal industries, which were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th century and early 20th century. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and in 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a woolen factory, and a tannery there. These industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township by the latter half of the 19th century.

In 1868 the village of Proctorville was built as a company town for Thomas E. Proctor&#x27;s tannery. Proctor, as it is now known, is north of Barbours along Plunketts Creek. The bark from Eastern hemlock trees was used in the tanning process, and the village originally sat in the midst of vast forests of hemlock. The tannery employed &quot;several hundred&quot; at wages between 50 cents and US$1.75 a day. These employees lived in 120 company houses, which each rented for $2 a month. In 1892, Proctor had a barbershop, two blacksmiths, cigar stand, I.O.O.F hall, leather shop, news stand, a post office (established in 1885), a two-room school, two stores, and a wagon shop.

Hemlock bark, used in the tanning process, was hauled to the tannery from up to away in both summer and winter, using wagons and sleds. The hides which were tanned to make leather came from the United States and as far away as Mexico, Argentina, and China. Finished sole leather was hauled by horse-drawn wagon south about to Little Bear Creek, where it was exchanged for &quot;green&quot; hides and other supplies brought north from Montoursville. The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old-growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled.

===20th century===
Without timber and the tannery, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s, and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses. Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its 39th annual &quot;Proctor Homecoming&quot; reunion called it a &quot;near-deserted old tannery town&quot;. In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel (which had become a hunting club) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek.

Plunketts Creek Township has been a place for both lumber and tourism since its villages were founded, and as industry declined, nature recovered. Second-growth forests have since covered most of the clear-cut land. Pennsylvania&#x27;s state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned and clear-cut land for Pennsylvania State Game Lands in 1919, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) acquired property along Plunketts Creek for State Game Lands Number 134 between 1937 and 1945. The main entrance to State Game Lands 134 is just north of the bridge site, on the east side of the creek.

The PGC established the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 on part of State Game Lands 134 to raise wild turkey. The farm was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981, and, , it was one of four Pennsylvania state game farms producing about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is chiefly in the Plunketts Creek valley, just south of Proctor and north of the bridge. The opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village of Barbours at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.

The Bridge in Plunketts Creek Township was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, but delisted in 2002, after being washed out by a flood in 1996.

==Geography==
Plunketts Creek Township is on the eastern edge of Lycoming County. It is bordered by Sullivan County to the northeast, Shrewsbury Township to the southeast, Wolf, Mill Creek and Upper Fairfield townships to the south, Eldred Township to the southwest, Gamble Township to the west, and Cascade Township to the northwest. Pennsylvania Route 87 crosses the center of the township, following Loyalsock Creek and passing through the village of Barbours. PA-87 leads northeastward to Forksville and southwestward the same distance to Montoursville in the valley of the West Branch Susquehanna River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.97%, are water. All of the township is in the watershed of Loyalsock Creek except for the southeastern corner, where a small area drains to tributaries of Muncy Creek, like Loyalsock Creek a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna. Allegheny Ridge, with summit elevations from , runs from west to east just north of the southern border of the township.

<text>Porter Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,535 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Porter Township, named for David R. Porter, governor of Pennsylvania (1839–1845), was formed from part of Mifflin Township on May 6, 1840.

When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Porter Township, they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the &quot;Fair Play System&quot;, with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the &quot;Tiadaghton Elm&quot; on the banks of Pine Creek.

During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war.

Dr. James Davidson, a veteran of the American Revolution, serving as a doctor for General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s army, was one of the first and most successful settlers in the Porter Township area. He settled in the Sunbury area just after the Revolution. After several years in that vicinity he bought a farm along the West Branch Susquehanna River in what is now western Lycoming County. Here he farmed and also served as the only doctor in the area for many years. Dr. Davidson built one of the first brick houses in the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. He also served as a judge for Lycoming County after it was formed in 1795.

The Bridge in Porter Township was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

<text>Shrewsbury Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 419 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Shrewsbury Township was formed from part of Muncy Township in 1804. It was originally much larger in size and included a large part of what is now Sullivan County until 1847. It is named for Shrewsbury Township, New Jersey. Some of the first settlers, the Little and Bennett families, migrated to Lycoming County from New Jersey and wanted their new home to have the same name as their old home. Peter Corson, also from New Jersey, was one of the first settlers to establish a home in the area, and he was quite successful. Corson and his wife had five sons and three daughters, and within less than 100 years they had descendants that were numbered by the hundred.

In the late 1800s, Highland Lake, in the northern part of Shrewsbury Township, was a popular summer vacation destination. There were three large hotels on the lake as well as several summer cottages. The cottage holders included Pennsylvanians from as far away as Philadelphia.

Industry and farming are and always have been very limited in Shrewsbury Township, due to its mountainous terrain. The population as of the 2010 census had declined to 409 residents from 570 at the census of 1890.

==Geography==

<text>South Williamsport is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is famous for hosting the Little League World Series. The population was 6,259 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
South Williamsport celebrated the centennial of its incorporation as a borough in 1986. On November 29, 1886, the Lycoming County court incorporated the villages of Rocktown, Billman, and vicinities as the borough of South Williamsport. The land had previously been part of Armstrong Township.

The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant &quot;people of the muddy river&quot; in Algonquian. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee clan or phratry of the Lenape, and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the Iroquois.

The British purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. After the American Revolutionary War, Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County, on April 13, 1795. The county&#x27;s area was originally over and several other counties were subsequently formed from it.

Williamsport, across the river from South Williamsport, was also founded in 1795 and chosen as the county seat. The first settler in what is now South Williamsport is believed to have been Aaron Hagerman, a transplanted Hollander, who is thought to have arrived shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War. Hagermans Run, which flows through the borough, bears his name.

One of the predecessor communities was &quot;Rocktown&quot;. And another was Bootstown. One of the first businesses was a tavern established near the mouth of Hagermans Run by Michael McDonough. Another early entrepreneur, Jacob Weiss, gave the village a push toward borough status by purchasing a tract of 40 acres and laying out town lots. Weiss also established a brickyard near McDonough’s tavern and for many years operated an oil mill and a gristmill.

From those early times to the present, South Williamsport’s fortunes have been linked to those of Williamsport. Sawmills and furniture factories were among the most prosperous industries in both communities. Planing mills and woodworking factories of all types reached a peak of activity during the logging boom of the post-Civil War years of the last century. The industry gradually declined in the 1890s when the surrounding hills were finally stripped of saleable lumber and the logging crews moved west.

Today, manufacturing diversity is the rule. The area is reforested with second-growth timber, providing scenic beauty as well as woodland recreational opportunities. In South Williamsport, prime employers include: Little League Baseball, Inc., Keystone Friction Hinge, South Williamsport Area School District and the New Lycoming Bakery. Although Bald Eagle Mountain to the south and the river on the north have restricted development in South Williamsport, growth has been steady.

In 1890, there were 2,900 residents. About 600 young scholars attended 10 borough schools. The 2000 census counted 6,412 residents and today, 1,534 students are enrolled in three South Williamsport Area Schools Central Elementary (K-4) is on West Mountain Ave. Rommelt Elementary (5-6) is on West Central Ave. South Williamsport Area Jr./Sr. High School, Home of the Mountaineers, is on Percy Street. The School District is also home to one of the oldest high school football stadiums in the state, Rodney K. Morgans Stadium, which is built into the hillside directly between Central and Rommelt Elementary Schools.

==Geography==
South Williamsport is located at (41.229179, -77.000464), and is surrounded by the West Branch Susquehanna River to the north (with Williamsport north of the river), Armstrong Township to the east and south, and Duboistown to the west. As the crow flies, Lycoming County is approximately northwest of Philadelphia and east-northeast of Pittsburgh.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.1 square miles (5.5 km2), of which 1.9 square miles (4.9 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km2) (11.37%) is water.

The South Williamsport flood-control levees are in the Baltimore District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and have been cited as &quot;levees of maintenance concern&quot;. Failure to repair them will result in loss of federal assistance in a flood.

<text>Susquehanna Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 972 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Susquehanna Township was established during the December 1838 sessions of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. It was formed from parts of Nippenose and Armstrong townships.

Susquehanna Township was first surveyed in 1769. The surveyors named it &quot;Upper Bottom&quot; to distinguish it from a piece of land further to the east that was named &quot;Lower Bottom&quot;, present-day Duboistown and South Williamsport. The first settlers arrived in 1801 and cleared the alluvial plain near the West Branch Susquehanna River and began farming. The village of Nisbet, a collection of about a dozen homes, rose up around the railroad station of the same name. Two grist mills and a small textile mill were built on Mill Run during the early days of Susquehanna Township.

Susquehanna Township has grown somewhat since it was founded. The village of Nisbet underwent an expansion during the 1950s and 1960s and now serves as a bedroom community for Williamsport and Jersey Shore. Much of the land on the alluvial plain is still farmed. Farmers rent out small portions of their property for the docking of recreational boats on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The township is protected by Station 7, the Nisbet Volunteer Fire Company.

==Geography==
Susquehanna Township is in southwestern Lycoming County and is bordered by the West Branch Susquehanna River to the north, Armstrong Township to the east, Bastress Township to the south and Nippenose Township to the west. Across the West Branch, Woodward Township is to the north and the city of Williamsport is to the northeast. There is no road crossing the river from Susquehanna Township, however; the nearest crossings are in Duboistown to the east and at Jersey Shore to the west.

The ridgecrest of Bald Eagle Mountain forms the southern border of the township. The mountain is cut by two water gaps along the township border: Big Run cuts through the mountain near the western end of the border, and Bender Run cuts through to the east, flowing north through Nisbet. Both streams run north to the West Branch of the Susquehanna.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 8.53%, are water.

<text>Upper Fairfield Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,807 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The history of Upper Fairfield Township begins in 1851 when some dissatisfied citizens of the southern portion of Fairfield Township asked to be separated from the neighbors to the north. The citizens of the northern portion were strongly opposed to division, but the township was divided against their wishes on September 12, 1851.

Upper Fairfield Township was called Pollock Township during its first two years. It was named for Judge James Pollock, president of the district court that ordered the township to be divided, and a controversial figure at the time. Since the citizens of Upper Fairfield Township opposed division, they were disturbed by its name. Following a petition to the court that the township&#x27;s name be changed, an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly changed the name to Upper Fairfield Township on January 29, 1853.

<text>Washington Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,769 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washington Township was formed as part of Northumberland County in 1786. It originally extended from White Deer Hole Creek north to the West Branch Susquehanna River, with its eastern boundary also formed by the West Branch. The western limit was ambiguous, but most historians assumed that the western boundary followed a line that extended to the south opposite the mouth of Pine Creek in what is now eastern Clinton County. Washington Township is older than Lycoming County. Therefore, it was one of the original townships in Lycoming County. Seven additional townships were created from land that was originally part of Washington Township. They are Armstrong, Bastress, Brady, Clinton, Limestone, Nippenose, and Susquehanna townships. The township is named for the hero of the American Revolution and the first President of the United States, George Washington.

Historically, two trails of the native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek in Washington Township. Settlers arrived by 1760, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War during the Big Runaway. They returned, and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County and Washington Township when it was formed in 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues.

The Great Island Path was a major trail that ran north along the Susquehanna River from the Saponi village of Shamokin at modern Sunbury, fording the West Branch of the Susquehanna there and following the west bank of the river north until the White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport in Washington Township. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the Nippenose Valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the West Branch to the Great Island (near the present day city of Lock Haven).

In the Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the Big Runaway occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;.

Beginning with the first settlers, much of the land along White Deer Hole Creek in Washington Township was slowly cleared of timber. Small sawmills were built in the 19th century, and a much larger lumber operation was run by the Vincent Lumber Company from 1901 to 1904. They built a narrow-gauge railroad from Elimsport west into timber, and a line east to Allenwood in Union County and the Reading Railroad there. The lumber railroad ran parallel to the creek, with the end of the track near Fourth Gap. It was incorporated on June 24, 1901 (around the time of construction) as the &quot;Allenwood and Western Railroad&quot;. The lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when the forests were gone. The railroad was torn up, and its one second-hand Shay locomotive was moved to the Vincent Lumber Company operation at Denholm in Juniata County.

From 1900 to 1935, much of what is now Tiadaghton State Forest was purchased by Pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for the clear-cut land. In the 1930s there were seven Civilian Conservation Corps camps to construct roads and trails in the forest.

On May 31, 1985, around 10:30 pm, a tornado tore through the eastern part of the township, went through the State Gamelands (Old Alvira), and continued into Union County with no warning. Twelve people were injured and one was killed.

Small-scale lumbering continues in the Washington Township, but the forest is certified as well-managed &quot;in an environmentally sensitive manner&quot;, and lumber from it qualifies for a &quot;green label&quot;. An Amish-owned and operated sawmill is on Pennsylvania Route 44 in Elimsport. It burned down on May 10, 2006 (causing $500,000 in damages) but was expected to be back in operation in a month. Despite this small-scale lumbering, as of 2006 the forests have grown back and are mixed oak, with blueberry and mountain laurel bushes. White Deer Hole Creek and its tributaries also have stands of hemlock and thickets of rhododendron along them.

<text>Watson Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 534 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Watson Township was formed in January 1848 from parts of Porter and Cummings townships. It is named for Oliver Watson, the president of a bank in nearby Williamsport at the time.

Watson Township is and always has been a largely unpopulated area. It is mountainous and covered with a thriving second-growth forest. During the late 1800s much of the land was stripped of its old-growth forests. At the time central Pennsylvania and the city of Williamsport were at the center of the lumber industry in the United States. Trees were cut down and floated down Pine Creek, which flows through Watson Township. There were several sawmills along Pine Creek in the township. Other early attempts at industry included an iron forge along Furnace Run. There were several deposits of iron ore in Watson Township, but the ore proved to be of low quality and the investors in the iron furnaces struggled to turn a profit. The furnaces were abandoned and little evidence of their existence remains.

==Geography==
Watson Township is in western Lycoming County and is bordered by Clinton County to the west, Cummings Township to the north, Mifflin Township to the east, and Porter Township to the south. The township is north of the borough of Jersey Shore, west of Williamsport, the Lycoming county seat, and north-northwest of Harrisburg, the state capital.

Pennsylvania Route 44 crosses the center of the township, following Pine Creek and passing through the unincorporated communities of Torbert and Tombs Run. PA-44 leads south to Jersey Shore and northwest to Coudersport.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.33%, are water. Pine Creek crosses the center of the township, flowing south to the West Branch Susquehanna River south of Jersey Shore.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 550 people, 220 households, and 168 families residing in the township. The population density was 23.7 people per square mile (9.2/km2).

<text>Keep the Faith is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on November 3, 1992, by Mercury Records. It is Bon Jovi&#x27;s last studio album to feature all five original band members as bass guitarist Alec John Such was dismissed from the band in 1994, though it was not his last release with the band. It is Bon Jovi&#x27;s first album to not be produced by either Lance Quinn or Bruce Fairbairn. The album was produced by Bob Rock and was recorded at the Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; marked a change to a &quot;more serious interpretation of the band&#x27;s pop-metal groove&quot;. It is also Bon Jovi&#x27;s longest album to date, clocking in at 66 minutes.

&quot;Keep the Faith&quot; peaked at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album produced several hits for the band, including &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; and &quot;In These Arms&quot;.

==Background==
Following the completion of the New Jersey tour, the band went on hiatus. During their time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, which was released in 1990 as the &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; album and Richie Sambora released his first solo album called &quot;Stranger in This Town&quot;. By this time, Jon Bon Jovi fired his longtime manager, Doc McGhee and created Bon Jovi Management. Jon Bon Jovi decided to take on a larger role, and more responsibilities within the band. In October 1991 the band went to the Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future; the band&#x27;s internal problems were solved and they were ready to have a go at a comeback.

==Recording and production==
In January 1992, the band headed to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia. They spent seven months making the album with Bob Rock producing. Originally, the band had approached Bruce Fairbairn, who produced &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, but he was working on Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Get a Grip&quot; at the time. Most of the recording was done in Vancouver, although a couple of tracks and overdubs were laid down in Los Angeles.

&quot;When we got back together in a room in Vancouver,&quot; noted Jon Bon Jovi in 2007, &quot;we closed the door and ignored what had happened to our genre of music. We&#x27;d been kicked in the teeth by Nirvana, but we didn&#x27;t pay attention to that. We got rid of the clichés, wrote some socially conscious lyrics and got a haircut. I didn&#x27;t do a grunge thing and I didn&#x27;t do a rap thing. But I knew I couldn&#x27;t re-write &#x27;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&#x27; again, so I didn&#x27;t try. And it paid off.&quot;

Of the thirty songs written for the album, a couple were co-written by David Bryan and a couple by Desmond Child; the rest being by Jon Bon Jovi/Richie Sambora compositions and by Bon Jovi alone. Fourteen songs made it to the final album. Jon Bon Jovi wrote half of the album&#x27;s songs alone.

Before the band reunited in the studio, Bon Jovi spent the summer of 1991 in anonymity, riding his motorbike in places like Arizona, gaining experiences that inspired him to write &quot;Dry County&quot; and &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;. He later commented &quot;It would never have been possible [for me] to write songs like &#x27;Bed of Roses&#x27; or &#x27;Dry County&#x27; five years ago.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Keep the Faith&quot; was released on November 3, 1992. To promote the album, Bon Jovi returned to their roots playing a few dates at the small New Jersey clubs where they had started their career. The band appeared on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, a different show from the other episodes of the MTV Unplugged series, capturing Bon Jovi in an intimate, &quot;in the round&quot; experience, performing acoustic and electric renditions of classic hits (Bon Jovi and non-Bon Jovi tracks) and new material from &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;. The concert was released commercially in 1993 as &quot;Keep the Faith: An Evening with Bon Jovi&quot;.

The album was released on high-definition SACD in August 2017.

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums in November 1992 while peaking at number one in the UK and Australia. Six singles were released from the album between November 1992 and April 1994, with four singles issued in the United States, and two others released only outside the US.

==Promotion==
===Singles===
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, was released on October 7, 1992, a month before the album. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart while reaching number twenty nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; elsewhere, it reached top ten on the singles charts in UK, Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Australia.

&quot;Bed of Roses&quot; was released as the second single on January 11, 1993. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the song reached number ten on the Hot 100. Elsewhere, it reached number two in Canada and number ten in Australia and Germany. Three more commercial singles were released in 1993. &quot;In These Arms&quot;, released on May 3, reached number six in Canada, number nine in the UK, and number ten in Australia and Ireland. It also hit the Top 40 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot;, released on July 26, reached number seventeen in the UK. &quot;I Believe&quot; was released on September 20, reaching number eleven on the UK Singles Chart in October. On March 7, 1994, the album&#x27;s last single, &quot;Dry County&quot;, was released; it reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart. In October 1994, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

&quot;Keep the Faith&quot; is the third most-represented album in Bon Jovi&#x27;s concert setlists behind &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. This representation is due entirely to the singles, of which &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; and the title track have been live staples. Of the pure album tracks, &quot;Blame It on the Love of Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot; were each only played once during 1993, whilst &quot;If I Was Your Mother&quot; was performed live only twice during the Keep the Faith Tour and not subsequently. &quot;Little Bit of Soul&quot; has appeared live only twice during special radio sessions and Bon Jovi have performed &quot;Fear&quot; live only six times, all during the French and Spanish legs of the album&#x27;s supporting tour in April 1993.

==Accolades==

==Track listing==



Some Latin American releases feature &quot;Cama de Rosas&quot; (Spanish version of &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;) as bonus track.

Some releases misspell &quot;Dry County&quot; as &quot;Dry Country&quot;. Other releases misspell &quot;Blame It on the Love of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; as &quot;Blame in on ohe Love of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

A 1998 edition contains an enhanced CD-ROM video of &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (Live).

==History==
===Early history===

In 1763, the Battle of Muncy Hills took place during the French and Indian War. It was a clash between the Native Americans and colonists seeking homestead sites in Native American territory. In 1768, at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the British purchased the land that became Lycoming County from the Iroquois Nation who controlled the lands.

In March 1796 the first house was built in Williamsport. James Russell built his inn on what is now the northeastern corner of East Third and Mulberry Streets in downtown. On April 13, 1795 Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County. It encompassed all the lands of Northumberland County situated west of Muncy Hills and was a domain of , comprising most of north central Pennsylvania. In 1796 the first recorded childbirth in Williamsport was James Russell, the son of Mr. and Mrs. William Russell and grandson of James Russell of the Russell Inn, and the first school was built as a one-room log addition to the building that would eventually become the first Lycoming County Courthouse. In 1798 the first brick house in Williamsport was erected on Front Street, between Market and Mulberry, by Andrew Tulloh, a lawyer. The bricks were made on the banks of Grafius Run where that stream crossed Hepburn Street.

In 1799, a post office opened at the corner of Third and State Streets in what is now downtown, and the following year, a jail was constructed at the northeast corner of William and Third Streets. The post office was later converted to a saloon.

In 1801, the town&#x27;s first store was opened by William Winter on Third Street. In 1831 Jacob L. Mussina established the Repasz Band, the oldest brass band in America still in existence. On Oct. 15 1834 The West Branch Canal opened and the first boat to pass through the canal en route to Jersey Shore was that of George Aughenbaugh. The first freight carried into town was iron for the foundry of John B. Hall. The same year the enactment of the common school law by Pennsylvania Legislature led to public education here. In May 1835, the first public schools opened in Williamsport and also the town&#x27;s first bank, the West Branch National Bank.

The Underground Railroad, used by enslaved African-Americans to obtain their freedom in the 30 years before the Civil War (1860–1865) included routes from states in the South, which supported slavery, to &quot;free&quot; states in the North and Canada. From 1830 until 1865, the underground railroad, a system of safe houses and routes for slaves escaping to freedom, operated in Lycoming County; many local abolitionists, including Daniel Hughes, served as conductors and agents.

Based on the oral history of Mamie Sweeting Diggs (1933–2011), fourth generation descent and great-granddaughter, Hughes, was a river raftsman on the Susquehanna river who had migrated from Oswego, New York. He lived on the Muncy Indian Reservation until he acquired land off Freedom Road. During his trips transporting logs to Maryland, he brought escaped slaves back on foot from Baltimore, over Bald Eagle Mountain and hid them at his home and in the caves on Freedom Road.

Mamie&#x27;s grandfather, Robert, helped his father, Daniel Hughes, hide escaped slaves in the caves behind their home on Freedom Road. They fed them, nursed the sick back to health and delivered them safely to the next &quot;station&quot;, The Apker House in Trout Run. The Apker House was the home of Robert Fairies, abolitionist and president of the Williamsport-Elmira Railroad. The railroad ran through his property where escaped slaves were hidden in the barn and house and then loaded into railway baggage cars for the trip to Elmira, NY, the next &quot;station.&quot;

Mamie&#x27;s grandfather, Robert passed the stories to his children, including Mamie&#x27;s mother, Marion. Marion tended the family homestead, maintained Freedom Road Cemetery (where nine black Civil War vets are buried) and passed Daniel&#x27;s stories down to her children.

In 1849, the Market Street Bridge was built over the West Branch Susquehanna River. It was opened as a toll bridge to cover the state&#x27;s costs of $23,797. In 1854, a brewery opened. The brewery was sold to Henry Flock in 1865. This brewery was run by the Flock family until the 1940s. The Flocks&#x27; business survived Prohibition by converting to a dairy.

In 1875, the first tower clock in the United States to sound the Cambridge Quarters (Westminster Chime) was installed at Trinity Episcopal Church, a gift of Peter Herdic with bells given by judge J. W. Maynard. The following year, the Williamsport Hospital opened its first facility April 1 at Elmira and Edwin Streets.

In 1881, a state law ended racial segregation in Pennsylvania schools. By 1948, all schools in this area were integrated. In 1895, Harry Houdini appeared in one of his earliest performances, at the Old Fair Grounds with The Welch Brothers Circus.

Williamsport was the birthplace of the national newspaper &quot;Grit&quot; in 1882. Williamsport purportedly once had more millionaires per-capita than anywhere else in the world. For this reason, the area&#x27;s local high school, the Williamsport Area High School, uses &quot;Millionaires&quot; as its team mascot.

=== Modern history ===

The Flood of March 17–18, 1936 caused the river to crest at 33.9&#x27;. Flood waters reached High Street. It was known locally as the Hello, Al flood because Al Glaes, operating a short-wave radio station from his home on High Street, kept the city in touch with the rest of the world after the flood disrupted electricity and telephone service.

On June 6, 1939 the first Little League Baseball game was played on a sandlot outside Bowman Field in Williamsport. Carl Stotz conceived the idea of a Little League, and he and Bert and George Bebble managed the first three teams. In 1941 the U.S. entered World War II after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Williamsport native Joe Lockard, stationed on Oahu, gave warning of the impending attack based on radar readings. His readings were dismissed as American B17 bombers coming in from the mainland. Also in 1941 the Williamsport School Board created the Williamsport Technical Institute for high school and post-high school students. It grew into the Williamsport Area Community College, and later became Pennsylvania College of Technology.

<text>Wolf Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,109 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Wolf Township was formed from part of Muncy Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County in 1834. The township is named for George Wolf, governor of Pennsylvania from 1829 to 1835. The boroughs of Hughesville and Picture Rocks are on land that was taken from Wolf Township.

Wolf Township has grown to a population of 2,907 residents as of the 2010 census, up from 734 residents at the census of 1890.

===Quarries===
The geology of Wolf Township played a role in its history. Limestone was quarried west of Hughesville for use as lime, used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including limestone products, concrete and mortar) and as chemical feedstocks, among other uses. Wolf Township was also the home to several Pennsylvania bluestone quarries. Pennsylvania bluestone has many uses, from cut dimensional stone used in patios, walkways and stair treads to architectural stone used in buildings. It is also used for wallstone, decorative boulders, natural steps and other landscape features.

===Early settlers and industry===
David Aspen was the first white settler to live within the borders of what is now Wolf Township. He was scalped during the Revolutionary War, when his and other settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Abraham Webster was another of the early settlers to be attacked, only he survived and returned to Wolf Township twelve years after the Big Runaway. His entire family had been killed, but he returned with a new wife and re-established his home.

The earliest industrial venture in Wolf Township was a gristmill constructed in 1816. A wool carding mill was built in 1842. There were also several sawmills in the township that were part of the lumber industry that covered much of Pennsylvania during the late 1800s.

<doc id="133175" wikidata="Q7999175" url="?curid=133175" title="Woodward Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Woodward Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,043 at the 2020 census, down from 2,200 in 2010. It is part of the Williamsport Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Woodward Township was formed on November 23, 1855, by dividing Anthony Township. It is named for Apollos Woodward, an associate judge in Williamsport at the time. The population of Woodward Township was 817 at the 1890 census, and had grown to 2,200 as of the 2010 census. The township, which is bisected by Quenshukeny Run, is semi-rural in nature. The northern parts of the township are less heavily populated than the southern sections, which lie on U.S. Route 220 and serve as a suburb for Williamsport and Jersey Shore.

When Woodward Township was first settled by migrants from Europe it was outside the boundaries of the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the rule or protection of the colonial government in Philadelphia. Together they formed their own form of government that was administered by a group of pioneers known as the Fair Play Men. These early settlers banded together to provide law and order to a land that was wild and dangerous.

Brattan Caldwell, a native of County Kildare, Ireland, migrated to the Thirteen Colonies in 1770. He arrived in Philadelphia and from there moved to Lancaster County. He joined with other pioneers and followed the Susquehanna River and its West Branch into the frontier. Caldwell and the other settlers arrived in what is now Woodward Township in 1772. They cleared land along the river and its tributaries. Caldwell married Elcy Hughes in the winter of 1775 on the south side of the river in Nippenose Township. This part of the West Branch Susquehanna Valley was under the jurisdiction and protection of the colonial government of Pennsylvania. The Hughes were married by a Northumberland County justice of the peace. It was the first marriage to take place in the settlements west of Lycoming Creek.

In the Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the &quot;Big Runaway&quot; occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the &quot;Little Runaway&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Brattan Caldwell and his family fled to Lancaster County and did not return to their land until after Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition. Caldwell obtained legal rights to the land he had settled in 1784 following the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix.

Linden is the only village in Woodward Township. It sprung up as a shanty town during the construction of the Pennsylvania Canal. The contractors building the canal built the shanty town for the laborers who were building the canal.

==Geography==
Woodward Township is southwest of the center of Lycoming County and is bordered by Anthony Township to the north, Lycoming Township at the northeast corner, Old Lycoming Township and the city of Williamsport to the east, the West Branch Susquehanna River to the south (with Susquehanna Township south of the river), and Piatt Township to the west. The township contains the unincorporated communities of Glosser View, Linden, and Pine Run. The township offices are in Linden.

U.S. Route 220 crosses the southern part of the township as it travels the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. The highway leads east to Williamsport and west to Jersey Shore. Harrisburg, the state capital, is to the south.

<text>Surfactants are chemical compounds that decrease the surface tension or interfacial tension between two liquids, a liquid and a gas, or a liquid and a solid. The word &quot;surfactant&quot; is a blend of surface-activeagent, coined in 1950. As they consist of a water-repellent and a water-attracting part, they enable water and oil to mix; they can form foam and facilitate the detachment of dirt. 

Surfactants are among the most widespread and commercially important chemicals. Private households as well as many industries use them in large quantities as detergents and cleaning agents, but also for example as emulsifiers, wetting agents, foaming agents, antistatic additives, or dispersants. 

Surfactants occur naturally in traditional plant-based detergents, e.g. horse chestnuts or soap nuts; they can also be found in the secretions of some caterpillars. Today one of the most commonly used anionic surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfates (LAS), are produced from petroleum products. However, surfactants are increasingly produced in whole or in part from renewable biomass, like sugar, fatty alcohol from vegetable oils, by-products of biofuel production, or other biogenic material.
==Classification==
Most surfactants are organic compounds with hydrophilic &quot;heads&quot; and hydrophobic &quot;tails.&quot; The &quot;heads&quot; of surfactants are polar and may or may not carry an electrical charge. The &quot;tails&quot; of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a hydrocarbon chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. Fluorosurfactants have fluorocarbon chains. Siloxane surfactants have siloxane chains.

Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly polar anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated (polyethylene oxide-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. Polypropylene oxides conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.

Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be &quot;double-chained&quot;.

Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A &quot;non-ionic&quot; surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative, charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called &quot;anionic&quot;; if the charge is positive, it is called &quot;cationic&quot;. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed &quot;zwitterionic&quot;, or &quot;amphoteric&quot;. Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:

===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives===
Anionic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, and carboxylates.
Prominent alkyl sulfates include ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates sodium laureth sulfate (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and sodium myreth sulfate.

Others include:
* Alkylbenzene sulfonates
* Docusate (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate)
* Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)
* Perfluorobutanesulfonate
* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates
* Alkyl ether phosphates

Carboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as sodium stearate. More specialized species include sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as perfluorononanoate, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA or PFO).

===Cationic head groups===
pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary amines; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH &lt; 10: octenidine dihydrochloride.

Permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts: cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BZT), dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB).

===Zwitterionic surfactants===
Zwitterionic (ampholytic) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule. The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium cations. The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the sultaines CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine. Betaines such as cocamidopropyl betaine have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelins.

Lauryldimethylamine oxide and myristamine oxide are two commonly used zwitterionic surfactants of the tertiary amine oxides structural type.

=== Non-ionic ===

Non-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.

Non-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, biodegradability) or permission for use in food.

=== Other classifications ===

* Amino acid-based surfactants are surfactants derived from an amino acid. Their properties vary and can be either anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic, depending on the amino acid used and which part of the amino acid is condensed with the alkyl/aryl chain.
* Gemini surfactants consist of two surfactant molecules linked together at or near their head groups. Compared to monomeric surfactants, they have much lower critical micelle concentrations.

==Composition and structure==

Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are akin to amphiphilic, which means that this molecule, being as double-agent, each contains a hydrophilic &quot;water-seeking&quot; group (the &quot;head&quot;), and a hydrophobic &quot;water-avoiding&quot; group (the &quot;tail&quot;). As a result, a surfactant contains both a water-soluble component and a water-insoluble component. Surfactants diffuse in water and get adsorbed at interfaces between air and water, or at the interface between oil and water in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase into a non-water phase such as air or oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains bound in the water phase.

The hydrophobic tail may be either lipophilic (&quot;oil-seeking&quot;) or lipophobic (&quot;oil-avoiding&quot;) depending on its chemistry. Hydrocarbon groups are usually lipophilic, for use in soaps and detergents, while fluorocarbon groups are lipophobic, for use in repelling stains or reducing surface tension.

World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 million tons per year, of which about half are soaps. Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (1.7 million tons/y), lignin sulfonates (600,000 tons/y), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (700,000 tons/y), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (500,000 tons/y).

===Structure of surfactant phases in water===

In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as micelles, where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or lipid bilayers. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the Gibbs isotherm.

===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===
The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of absorption depend on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited&#x27;. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.
The surface rheology of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.

===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===
Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the
-pendant or spinning drop method.
Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the maximum bubble pressure apparatus

The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by ellipsometry or X-ray reflectivity.

Surface rheology can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.

==Applications==
Surfactants play an important role as cleaning, wetting, dispersing, emulsifying, foaming and anti-foaming agents in many practical applications and products, including detergents, fabric softeners, motor oils, emulsions, soaps, paints, adhesives, inks, anti-fogs, ski waxes, snowboard wax, deinking of recycled papers, in flotation, washing and enzymatic processes, and laxatives. Also agrochemical formulations such as herbicides (some), insecticides, biocides (sanitizers), and spermicides (nonoxynol-9). Personal care products such as cosmetics, shampoos, shower gel, hair conditioners, and toothpastes. Surfactants are used in firefighting (to make &quot;wet water&quot; that more quickly soaks into flammable materials) and pipelines (liquid drag reducing agents). Alkali surfactant polymers are used to mobilize oil in oil wells.

Surfactants act to cause the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas. They also act to displace dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds and via the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes. Surfactants enhance remediation via soil washing, bioremediation, and phytoremediation.

===Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology===
In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins. Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: they disorganize the membrane&#x27;s lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as octyl thioglucoside, octyl glucoside or dodecyl maltoside are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as enzymes and receptors without denaturing them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For electrophoresis, for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native tertiary and quaternary structures, allowing the separation of proteins according to their molecular weight.

Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats. Pulmonary surfactants are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung alveoli in mammals.

===Quantum dot preparation===
Surfactants are used with quantum dots in order to manipulate their growth, assembly, and electrical properties, in addition to mediating reactions on their surfaces. Research is ongoing in how surfactants arrange themselves on the surface of the quantum dots.

=== Surfactants in droplet-based microfluidics ===
Surfactants play an important role in droplet-based microfluidics in the stabilization of the droplets, and the prevention of the fusion of droplets during incubation.

=== Heterogeneous catalysis ===
Janus-type material is used as a surfactant-like heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of adipic acid.

=== Increased surface tension ===

Agents that increase surface tension are &quot;surface active&quot; in the literal sense but are not called surfactants as their effect is opposite to the common meaning. A common example of surface tension increase is salting out: adding an inorganic salt to an aqueous solution of a weakly polar substance will cause the substance to precipitate. The substance may itself be a surfactant, which is one of the reasons why many surfactants are ineffective in sea water.

==In biology==

The human body produces diverse surfactants. Pulmonary surfactant is produced in the lungs in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS, surfactant replacement therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of a pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactant is Survanta (beractant) or its generic form Beraksurf, produced by Abbvie and Tekzima respectively. Bile salts, a surfactant produced in the liver, play an important role in digestion.

== Safety and environmental risks ==
Most anionic and non-ionic surfactants are non-toxic, having LD50 comparable to table salt. The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds, which are antibacterial and antifungal, varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDAC, DSDMAC) used as fabric softeners have high LD50 (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the disinfectant alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the lipid membrane that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.

Surfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste.

Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of sewage sludge application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can represent an environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on trace metal mobility.

In the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, unprecedented amounts of Corexit were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water&#x27;s surface. The apparent theory was that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil. The active ingredient in Corexit is dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate (Tween-80).

===Biodegradation===
Because of the volume of surfactants released into the environment, for example laundry detergents in waters, their biodegradation is of great interest. Attracting much attention is the non-biodegradability and extreme persistence of fluorosurfactant, e.g. perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Strategies to enhance degradation include ozone treatment and biodegradation. Two major surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and the alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APE) break down under conditions found in sewage treatment plants and in soil to nonylphenol, which is thought to be an endocrine disruptor. Interest in biodegradable surfactants has led to much interest in &quot;biosurfactants&quot; such as those derived from amino acids. Biobased surfactants can offer improved biodegradation. However, whether surfactants damage the cells of fish or cause foam mountains on bodies of water depends primarily on their chemical structure and not on whether the carbon originally used came from fossil sources, carbon dioxide or biomass.

<text>Bradford is a city in McKean County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located close to the border with New York state and approximately south of Buffalo, New York. Home to an oil refinery, Zippo headquarters and a University of Pittsburgh branch campus, Bradford is the principal city in the Bradford, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 7,825 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
Settled in 1823, Bradford was chartered as a city in 1837 and emerged as a wild oil boomtown in the Pennsylvania oil rush in the late 19th century. The area&#x27;s Pennsylvania Grade crude oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The Bradford &amp; Foster Brook Railway was built in 1876 as one of, if not the first, monorails in America, when Bradford was a booming oil town. World-famous Kendall racing oils were produced in Bradford.

Bradford was the site of an important step in the development of personal aviation. In the 1930s, the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation produced an airplane called the Taylor Cub in Bradford. After a fire at the factory, the company was bought by William T. Piper. After relocating his factory to Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, Piper resumed production of a revised design of the airplane first produced in Bradford, which became the world-famous Piper Cub.

The population peaked at 19,306 in 1930, but at the 2010 census had dropped to 8,770. Two adjoining townships, home to approximately 9,000 people, make the population of Greater Bradford about 18,000. Famous Bradfordians include the opera singer Marilyn Horne, the Hall of Fame baseball player Rube Waddell and the five-time All-Star football player Stew Barber. A famous perpetual motion machine hoax was created in Bradford in 1897 by J.M. Aldrich. The hoax was exposed in the July 1, 1899, issue of the &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine. Ultimately, Aldrich was sentenced to four months in the county jail.

The Bradford Armory, Bradford Downtown Historic District, Bradford Old City Hall, and Rufus Barrett Stone House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

BLT also operates Togi&#x27;s Playhouse for smaller productions. An annual community talent show, Kiwanis Kapers, occurs in the fall.

In May 2017, the Marilyn Horne Museum and Exhibit Center opened in downtown Bradford. Part of the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, the 3,400 square-foot exhibition space celebrates the life and career of American mezzo-soprano, Marilyn Horne. The museum highlights objects from Horne&#x27;s personal archive, which is housed at the University of Pittsburgh.

Annual festivals include Stinkfest (a festival promoting leek cuisine), Summer Daze (formerly known as Summerfest), Autumn Daze, the Italian Festival, the Zippo/Case International Swap Meet (biennial, with Zippo Days held in off years) and the Crook Farm Country Fair. In early August, the annual Big 30 Charity high school all star football game takes place at Parkway Field, where a million-dollar artificial playing surface was installed in 2008.

The museum opened on Memorial Day 1996 and is dedicated to the U.S. fighting forces and the 40 million people on the homefront who provided the materials needed to win the war.

==Fire Apparatus Museum==

The Andy Leider Fire Truck Collection is moving from Middletown, NY to Eldred. They bought the old Ethan Allen property to greatly expand the current facility. “We will now have the largest vintage motorized fire truck museum, restoration plant, and storage facility in the country, located at the former Ethan Allen property in Eldred,” Leider said. “We look forward to opening our new facility in McKean County, Pennsylvania.”

== Media ==

* The &quot;Kane Republican&quot; — One of two daily newspapers containing both local and national news in McKean County (the other being the Bradford Era). The Republican is an afternoon newspaper, published by the same company as Elk County&#x27;s newspapers, the &quot;St. Marys Daily Press&quot; and the &quot;Ridgway Record&quot;.
* WXZY-LP (FM 101.7) — Established in 2014 as a non-profit community station, 101. 7 WXZY broadcasts a wide variety of musical genres as well as coverage of local events, news, and sports.
* WPSX (FM 90.1) — A repeater of WPSU-FM, the Penn State University-owned NPR affiliate, is licensed to Kane.

For the purpose of designated market areas, Kane is at the southwestern corner of the Buffalo television market but is geographically closer to the Central Pennsylvania market. Both markets&#x27; stations (as well as, occasionally, those of the Erie market, whose DMA ends in neighboring Warren County) are seen on local cable and satellite providers.

== History ==

Kane was founded by Brigadier General Thomas L. Kane and his wife Elizabeth Denniston Wood Kane, M.D. Thomas L. Kane was the second son of Judge John Kintzing Kane of Philadelphia, a prominent associate of Presidents Jackson and Polk. In 1846, then Colonel Kane aided the Mormons on their flight west from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the Great Salt Lake; he arranged for them to winter on Indian lands near Council Bluffs, Iowa. In 1858, Colonel Kane prevented the &quot;Utah War&quot; between 2500 US Army soldiers, under A.S. Johnston, and the Mormons, under Kane&#x27;s personal friend, Brigham Young.

Thomas L. Kane was offered the Utah Territorial Governorship, but insisted that the position go to Brigham Young. Although never a religious convert to the Latter-day Saints, General Kane remained a personal, political, and legal adviser to Brigham Young until Young&#x27;s death. General Kane&#x27;s older brother was Elisha Kent Kane, America&#x27;s most prominent Arctic explorer before the Civil War. The General&#x27;s wife and three of their four children became physicians in Kane. Their oldest son, Evan O&#x27;Neill Kane, M.D., demonstrated the efficacy of local anesthesia on two occasions by performing surgery on himself—once repairing an inguinal hernia, and once removing his own appendix.

The Kane mansion, Anoatok, Kane Armory, Thomas L. Kane Memorial Chapel, and the New Thomson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Due to its elevation, Kane had many summer vacationers in the 1950s and 1960s who stayed there for various periods during the late summer and fall months to avoid the effects of hay fever and allergies present at lower elevations in the days before air conditioning was prevalent.

=== Kane Tornado of 1985 ===

On May 31, 1985, a tornado destroyed many homes in Kane and neighboring East Kane. The F4 tornado passed through the town at approximately 8:15 PM. There were 3 deaths as a result of this tornado. This is the worst natural disaster in Kane&#x27;s history.

== Industry ==

The Holgate Toy Company was for many years based in Kane. One of the more famous toys they manufactured was a wooden replica of the Mister Rogers Trolley car, seen in every single episode of Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood. The company has since relocated to Bradford.

==Kane Area School District==
The Kane Area School District has two schools that house the district&#x27;s 1,220 students (as of the 2013–14 school year). The Kane Area High School, which opened in 1972, is located just outside Kane in Wetmore Township. The high school sits on the former site of General Thomas Kane&#x27;s homestead, which burned to the ground in 1896. The high school auditorium stage is roughly where Gen. Kane&#x27;s front porch would have sat, looking out over the valley where the present-day football field and track sit. The high school houses grades nine through twelve.

The Kane Area Elementary-Middle School is located on West Hemlock Avenue and opened in 2010. The existing middle school was renovated in a multimillion-dollar project by the district, and a new elementary wing was added on the east side of the former junior high. The elementary-middle school houses students from kindergarten through eighth grade.

The construction of the new addition at the middle school was in response to KASD&#x27;s board of directors voting to close the Mount Jewett Elementary School and the Chestnut St. Elementary School. Mount Jewett closed after the 2006–07 school year, while Chestnut St. closed after the 2009–10 school year. The Mount Jewett school has since been sold to a private businessman. The Chestnut St. Complex is currently owned by Kane Innovations and used as office space for Kane Innovations, the KASD, Head Start and the Intermediate Unit 9.

==Local Interests==

:The Kinzua Bridge State Park is located just a few miles north of Mount Jewett&#x27;s borough line. It was used to carry trains across the Kinzua valley overlooking the town of Kushequa, Pennsylvania. Originally constructed in 1882, the structure was the highest iron bridge in the world. In 1900 it was turned into a steel structure. Upon becoming a state park an independent company used the bridge to carry sight seers and tourists across the valley in an old steam locomotive. On July 21, 2003 a tornado destroyed a large portion of the bridge. Now all that remains is a portion of the bridge and a small section of railroad track at each end of the valley. In another devastating blow, on early Sunday March 16, 2008 the locomotives used to carry sightseers across the Kinzua Bridge were severely damaged by a fire set by arsonists. The fire, which burned the Biddle Street building used to house the trains in Kane, Pennsylvania caused $1 million in damage. The residents of Mount Jewett would watch the train daily as it passed through town—directly to the north of the borough building. This further dampened the dream of rebuilding the bridge.

:The state decided not to rebuild the Kinzua Bridge, which would have cost an estimated $45 million. Instead, the ruins were to become a visitor attraction used to show the forces of nature at work. Kinzua Bridge State Park had attracted 215,000 visitors annually before the bridge collapsed, and was one of twenty state parks chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of &quot;Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot;. The viaduct and its collapse were featured in the History Channel&#x27;s Life After People as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to the collapse of any steel structure.
:The Knox and Kane Railroad was forced to suspend operations in October 2004 after a 75 percent decline in the number of passengers, brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane&#x27;s tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963.
:Pennsylvania released $700,000 to design repairs on the remaining towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8 million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors&#x27; center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor at the end of bridge that allows views of bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3 million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5 million in tourism revenue for the region.

* Mount Jewett made world news in February 2001 when an explosion at the Temple Inland particle board plant killed 3 workers and injured at least five others
* The population of Mount Jewett includes a significant number of people with Swedish ancestry. Every August the town celebrates this history with their well-known &quot;Swedish Festival.&quot; The August 2010 celebration was the 40th annual Swedish Festival in Mount Jewett and the 2021 celebration will be the 50th because the 2020 event was cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="133199" wikidata="Q1181412" url="?curid=133199" title="Port Allegany, Pennsylvania">
<text>Port Allegany is a borough in McKean County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,116 at the 2020 census.

The town&#x27;s tree-lined streets lie in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, 30 miles west of the Allegheny River&#x27;s headwaters.

==History==
Originally known as Canoe Place, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Port Allegany in 1838. It is unusual among places in Pennsylvania that make reference to the Allegheny River; it used the spelling &quot;Allegany,&quot; more commonly encountered in place names in neighboring New York.

The town developed as a port on the Allegheny River, and provided a place where travelers coming overland from the Susquehanna River could continue by boat.

==Economy==

In the 1800s natural gas was discovered in the area, which led to the expansion of industries including glass firms, chemical plants, cheese factories, machine shops, brick plants, sawmills, planing mills and tanneries. The area also produces crude oil and it is not unusual to see small gas or oil wells and storage tanks in fields, forests or back yards in the region. The introduction of hydraulic fracturing produced an increase in local production of gas and oil, and a boost to the local economy, in the 2000s and 2010s.

Port Allegany has long been associated with glass manufacturing. Saint-Gobain, a glass container producer, is located there, in a facility that has been owned at different stages by Pierce Glass and Ball-Incon. A concrete tower that is part of the manufacturing plant is the tallest structure in Port Allegany and is visible from most of the small downtown area. From 1937 to 2016, Port Allegany was also home to a factory of the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation. The &quot;PC&quot;, as the factory was known locally, was the only producer of architectural glass building blocks in the United States, and also produced foamglas insulation.

In the middle of the 20th century, the town was home to a factory that manufactured Kewpie dolls.

==Geography==
Port Allegany is located at (41.814919, -78.279218).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Port Allegany is located in McKean County, which is generally considered to be part of the Northern Pennsylvania region (and sometimes part of the Northern Tier region). This part of the state is rural and heavily forested.

Before the arrival of the first European settlers, the area was densely forested with Eastern Hemlock. Many of these sometimes massive trees were cut for lumber or sometimes only for their bark, which was used in the tanning industry. The rough and ready lifestyles and skills of the men who did this work are commemorated each year at the &quot;Barkpeelers&#x27; Festival&quot; at the Pennsylvania Lumber Museum in nearby Ulysses, Pennsylvania. Many older homes, barns and other buildings in the region were at least partly built with hemlock lumber.

The contemporary forests in the region produce high quality black cherry lumber, valued in the furniture and cabinetry industries. While there are currently no working furniture factories in the region, the trade in black cherry continues.

Smethport is situated in the Pennsylvania Wilds region, in a hilly area a short distance from the Allegheny National Forest and Kinzua Bridge State Park. Smethport is about two hours from Erie and Buffalo. The highest point on U.S. Route 6 east of the Mississippi River is near Smethport at Bush Hill.

Smethport was founded in 1807 by Dutch land investors who were surveying a large tract of land they purchased from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and was named in honor of a Dutch banking family, the De Smeths, who financed the land investments. The town&#x27;s first business was a water-powered sawmill built by John Applebee in 1822. Smethport became the McKean County seat in 1826 and was incorporated as a Borough in 1853.

<text>Farrell is a city in western Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Shenango River. The population was 4,258 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hermitage micropolitan area.

==History==
Once dubbed &quot;The Magic City,&quot; Farrell sprang up practically overnight when a steel mill was constructed in 1901 on a plain bordering the Shenango River, near Sharon, in what was then part of Hickory Township (now Hermitage).

The community name was at the beginning South Sharon. In 1912, the population reached 10,000. At that time, the residents of the new city elected to take the name of Farrell, after industrialist James A. Farrell.

The community was incorporated as the Borough of South Sharon in 1916; its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1920 and its status was elevated to a third-class city in 1932. In 1939, artist Virginia Wood Riggs was commissioned to paint the mural &quot;Myths of Vulcan and Juno&quot; in the towns post office. The mural was painted over in 1966.

The mill, which eventually became known as the Roemer Works of Sharon Steel Corporation, would serve as the community&#x27;s lifeblood until 1992, when it was liquidated after filing bankruptcy. Many of the assets were sold at auction to Britain-based Caparo Corporation and later to Swiss steelmaker Duferco, which operates the plant today. Farrell was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1987 by the state of Pennsylvania.

In 2004 local politicians proposed the creation of Shenango Valley City, consisting of Farrell as well as Hermitage, Sharpsville, Sharon, and Wheatland with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum. Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion. The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and it&#x27;s nine-member city council. The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact. The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.

Despite years of population and industrial decline, Farrell has made progress in rebuilding itself due to new industrial investments on tax abated land and several new housing starts. 

==Demographics==

<text>Fredonia is a borough in central Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 435 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hermitage micropolitan area.

== History ==
The first resident of the area that became Fredonia was Levi Arnold. Arnold build a grist mill there between 1837 and 1838 and was, over time, joined by several other businesses and residences. William Simmons built the first store in the small village. Based upon the success of his business and the further gains that could be made after the construction of a proposed railroad, Simmons purchased the land that became the borough of Fredonia and had it surveyed and divided into lots. The land came was purchased from two “Donation tracts,” which were tracts of land given to Revolutionary War soldiers in an attempt to encourage them to continue to serve. The name “Fredonia” came from Simmon’s “free” donation of the land for the town square and as a nod to the “Donation” tracts from which the land was purchased. The first post office was established in 1870 and Fredonia was officially incorporated in August 1876. Fredonia was serviced by Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad passenger trains between 1869 and 1955. The Fredonia Volunteer Fire Department was established in 1934 and has continued to host their “Old Home Week” festival each summer since 1935.

Fredonia was home to the Fredonia Institute, also known as a “normal academy” or “select school.” This higher education institution trained individuals who went on to become physicians, attorneys, teachers, ministers, and enter into other professions. It was incorporated in 1874 and boasted a library established by Andrew Carnegie.

During the Depression, the borough applied for and received Works Progress Administration funds. The funds were used to pave streets and construct a water system to provide water service to the town that had previously relied on streams, individual wells, and cisterns. The WPA also provided workers who helped construct Fredonia-Delaware High School. This stone building was built in 1942 on Delaware Road and served first as a high school until 1960 when it began to be used as an elementary school within Reynolds School District. The elementary school was closed by the district in the mid-1990s, and the building was subsequently purchased and converted into a personal care and independent living facility.

Since the 1940s, Fredonia has also been home to a diner created from a trolley car. The trolley car came from the Harmony Line of the interurban trolley line that ran from New Castle, PA to Pittsburgh, PA. Ownership has changed several times, but the diner is still currently open at its original location.

Fredonia is also home to Pennsylvania’s largest Swiss cheese manufacturer. Fairview Swiss Cheese, which opened in 1955, is operated by John Koller and Son Inc. The company produces over 7 million pounds of Swiss cheese each year.

<doc id="133221" wikidata="Q302340" url="?curid=133221" title="These Days (Bon Jovi album)">
<text>These Days (stylized as (these Days)) is the sixth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on June 27, 1995, by Mercury Records. This was the first album Bon Jovi released after the dismissal of original bass guitarist Alec John Such, and their first album to be recorded officially as four-piece band (without an official bassist, but featured Hugh McDonald as a session/touring member on bass guitar). The album, produced by Peter Collins, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, is praised by many critics and fans as their best album. &quot;These Days&quot; is overall a darker album in contrast to the band&#x27;s usual brand of feel-good, inspiring rock songs and love ballads.

At the time of release, the album was a huge commercial success, especially in the European and Asian markets. It became the band&#x27;s fifth and fourth consecutive number one album in Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, &quot;These Days&quot; replaced Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;HIStory&quot; at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spent four consecutive weeks at . The album spawned four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart, the band&#x27;s highest number of Top 10 singles from one album in the UK. The high sales of the album in Europe warranted a re-issue of the album under the name of &quot;These Days Special Edition&quot; a year after its original release. The album was ranked number two on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 50 albums of 1995&quot;. The album was also voted the album of the year in British magazine Kerrang!&#x27;s readers poll in 1995. In 2006, the album featured in the &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; &#x27;s The &quot;200 Greatest Albums of the 90s&quot;. In the U.S., despite selling 1 million copies and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the album was not as successful as it was overseas and the album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== Background ==
When the Keep the Faith Tour ended in December 1993, Jon Bon Jovi went on a vacation in January 1994 where he wrote &quot;Something to Believe In&quot;, the first song written for the album. Over the next nine months, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora wrote and demoed forty songs. The album was originally slated to be released in the fourth quarter of 1994, but they asked for more time to write additional material. Because of that, they released &quot;Cross Road&quot;, their first greatest hits album, with two new songs in October 1994.

== Recording and production ==
Jon Bon Jovi hired Peter Collins to produce the album, based on his prior work with several acts such as Rush, Queensrÿche and Alice Cooper. Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were co-producers of the album. They made a start recording the album in Nashville in the fall of 1994. After a week to ten days of recording, during October 1994, Jon Bon Jovi erased it all. Recording continued over the next four months and it shifted between Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s home studio Sanctuary I in Woodstock, NY, and three separate studios in Los Angeles: One On One Studios, Ocean Way Recording, and A&amp;M Studios. There were various reasons why so many different studios were used.

One reason for studio changes, while recording in Woodstock, NY, was industrial metal band Fear Factory were recording their album &quot;Demanufacture&quot; in a neighboring studio. Bon Jovi&#x27;s engineers repeatedly complained about the volume Fear Factory were recording at as it was bleeding into their drum mics.

Regardless, all the basic tracks except for &quot;Diamond Ring&quot; and &quot;(It&#x27;s Hard) Letting You Go&quot; were recorded in Woodstock, NY. All the rhythm guitar parts were recorded in Los Angeles and all the keyboards were recorded in New Jersey. Most vocals were done in New Jersey. Very little was done in Nashville: one vocal and one or two keyboard parts. &quot;Diamond Ring&quot; and &quot;(It&#x27;s Hard) Letting You Go&quot; were recut in Los Angeles. The album was mixed by Bob Clearmountain in Los Angeles.

Then the band embarked on a mini Christmas tour of clubs in December 1994 and they continued to promote Cross Road. On December 17, 1994, Richie Sambora married Heather Locklear.

== Composition ==
=== Music ===
Jon Bon Jovi is credited with composing the music for all of the album&#x27;s tracks. Richie Sambora is also credited with composing the music for all of the album&#x27;s tracks, except &quot;(It&#x27;s Hard) Letting You Go&quot; and &quot;Something To Believe In&quot;; both were written and composed by Jon Bon Jovi. He is also not credited on &quot;Hearts Breaking Even&quot;, which was written and composed by Jon Bon Jovi and Desmond Child. Desmond is also credited with composing &quot;Something For The Pain&quot;, &quot;This Ain&#x27;t A Love Song&quot; and &quot;Diamond Ring&quot;. All of the other tracks were written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora. According to Jon Bon Jovi, the album was influenced by alternative rock and metal bands such as Pearl Jam, Tool, and Nine Inch Nails.

=== Lyrics ===
Jon Bon Jovi stated that even though the album was their darkest, the band was in a very happy place at the time. &quot;Hey God&quot; was written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora in Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s basement. Richie Sambora said that his inspiration for the song came when he was sitting in his limo and made eye contact with a derelict huddling in a cardboard box on the pavement. His sense of guilt at this was immense and discussed the incident with Jon Bon Jovi, who was inspired by the view out of the window from 57th St. and Broadway in New York, where a man wearing an Armani suit was next to a man who&#x27;s sleeping on the street. &quot;Something For The Pain&quot; was the most difficult to write, says Jon Bon Jovi. They kept rewriting until the chorus made sense. &quot;My Guitar Lies Bleeding In My Arms&quot; was written from a writing session where they were hit with writer&#x27;s block. Taking a cue from the opening line of &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (&quot;Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano, Trying hard to capture the moment&quot;), Jon Bon Jovi instead of putting the pen down, wrote about his experience. &quot;Damned&quot; is about a guy who is involved with a married woman. &quot;(It&#x27;s Hard) Letting You Go&quot; was written by Jon Bon Jovi for the movie called Moonlight and Valentino in which he appeared. &quot;Something To Believe In&quot; is an introspective song about a man questioning everything around him. Richie Sambora&#x27;s &quot;Hey, hey, hey&quot; chant on the song is lifted from the demo. It worked so well, they kept it and used it on the album. &quot;Diamond Ring&quot; was originally written for the album &quot;New Jersey&quot; in 1988 and was played live six times during the New Jersey Syndicate Tour, but never made it onto any previous Bon Jovi album.

== Release and reception ==
Two titles that were considered were &quot;&quot;Open All Night&quot; and &quot;Strip&quot;&quot; but ultimately, the band wanted to make a statement about the themes of the record. Mark Selliger shot the album cover in Mexico.

The two extra songs &quot;All I Want Is Everything&quot; and &quot;Bitter Wine&quot; appear as bonus tracks on the international versions. Released June 12 in Japan, June 19 in Europe and June 27 in the rest of the world, the album was an immediate success. It even replaced Michael Jackson&#x27;s HIStory in the UK, debuting at number one, spending four weeks at number one. &quot;These Days&quot; also topped the charts in several other European countries, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, and Portugal and spending seven weeks on Billboard European Albums Chart. It was certified triple platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for selling 3 million copies across Europe.

In Australia, it debuted at number one and spent two weeks at number one on the ARIA Charts. The album became Bon Jovi&#x27;s second number one album in Japan, where it debuted at number one on the Oricon chart, selling over 379,000, becoming the fastest selling album by a non-Japanese act in history of the country&#x27;s chart. The album has sold more than 1 million copies and certified five times platinum and became the band&#x27;s best selling studio album in Japan.

&quot;These Days&quot; received favorable reviews from critics. &quot;Q&quot; magazine, in a perfect score, said that &quot;Cross Road&quot; and &quot;Always&quot; confirmed that Bon Jovi would survive grunge and &quot;These Days&quot; consolidated their status by keeping Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;HIStory&quot; album off the UK number 1 album slot. The review said that &quot;Hey God&quot;, &quot;Lie to Me&quot; and &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; were singled out as the album&#x27;s highlights and the album was arguably the band&#x27;s finest musical hour to date. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic concluded that &quot;as the years go by, Bon Jovi gets musically stronger. Not only are their best songs stronger now, their playing is more accomplished. Keeping these improvements in mind, it&#x27;s no surprise that the group was one of the few pop-metal bands to sustain a career in the mid-&#x27;90s&quot;. The album was ranked number two on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 50 albums of 1995&quot;, beat out by &quot;The Great Escape&quot; of the British band Blur. The album was mentioned as the second best album of 1995, after &quot;(What&#x27;s The Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Oasis according to some critics.

In the United Kingdom, the album was particularly notable for producing four Top 10 hit singles, and the UK Rock &amp; Metal had 4 singles in the #1 top singles with &quot;This Ain&#x27;t A Love Song,&quot; &quot;Something For The Pain,&quot; &quot;These Days,&quot; and &quot;Hey God,&quot; but failed to impress the audience and the critics in the United States. The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1798, Valentine Cunningham and his family from Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania settled along Wolf Creek, building a gristmill with fellow American Revolutionary War veteran and settler Robert Glenn on the creek in 1799 and naming the area Pine Grove. About a mile north, another community was drafted surrounding a gristmill, named Slabtown. In the early years of the 19th century, Cunningham built a sawmill and schoolhouse in Pine Grove, while Robert Moore built up the area around Slabtown with a sawmill and small businesses. By 1837, Cunningham&#x27;s sons J.G. and Charles returned to Pine Grove to continue its expansion, formally laying it out around this time.

By the 1850s, a Wolf Creek post office had been formed to serve both communities as they became increasingly merged. Pine Grove Academy, the precursor to Grove City College, was established in 1858.

<text>Hermitage is a city in western Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 16,230 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Mercer County. It is located about northeast of Youngstown and about northwest of Pittsburgh. It is the principal city of the Hermitage micropolitan area, which includes all of Mercer County.

==History==
Hermitage was first settled in 1796 and incorporated in 1832 as Hickory Township from portions of the Shenango and Pymatuning townships. Following the incorporation of the cities of Sharon and Farrell and the boroughs of Sharpsville and Wheatland, the remainder of the Township was incorporated into a first class township.

The Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law was passed in 1972, allowing for municipalities to establish their own home rule charters. A home rule charter in Hickory Township was approved on May 21, 1974, by a vote of 1,375 to 546, and was to become effective on January 1, 1976. A resolution of April 9, 1975, stated the Board of Commissioners&#x27; intent to start an informal campaign to consider the possibility of a name change for the Township. After conducting a survey, the names &quot;Hermitage&quot;, &quot;Mount Hickory&quot;, and &quot;Hickory Hills&quot; were to be placed on a ballot. Hermitage was selected in the November 1975 election, effective from January 2, 1976.

On November 8, 1983, voters approved by a margin of 1971 to 1846 to reclassify the Township of Hermitage to a city. Hermitage became a third class city on January 1, 1984.

On May 31, 1985, Hermitage was struck by an F5 tornado that killed 18 people and injured 310. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Pennsylvania. On May 31, 2015, the 30th anniversary of the F5, an EF0 tornado touched down in the southern part of town. It flipped two cars, damaged the canopy at a Sheetz gas station and downed a few trees and branches.

===Municipal consolidation===

In 2004 local politicians proposed the creation of Shenango Valley City, of Hermitage as well as Farrell, Sharpsville, Sharon, and Wheatland with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum. Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion. The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and it&#x27;s nine-member city council. The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact. The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.

The neighboring borough of Wheatland merged into Hermitage on January 1, 2024.

<doc id="133238" wikidata="Q313105" url="?curid=133238" title="Crush (Bon Jovi album)">
<text>Crush is the seventh studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi. It was released on May 29, 2000, by Mercury Records in the UK and on June 13, 2000, by Island Records in the US. It was produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Luke Ebbin. The album marks the longest timespan between studio albums for the band, with five years between the release of &quot;These Days&quot; (1995) and this album. After the initial plan to team up with producer Bruce Fairbairn fell through because of his death a year earlier, Bon Jovi and Sambora hired Luke Ebbin to update their sound.

Despite the long break, the album was just as successful as their previous releases and helped introduce the band to a new generation of fans. The success of the album was largely due to the lead single &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while the album itself was nominated for Best Rock Album. &quot;Crush&quot; was certified double platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Background==
After a five-year hiatus, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released solo albums. In 1999, Jon Bon Jovi was planning to release a third solo album but the band started work on their new album in mid-1999. Its working title was &quot;Sex Sells&quot;. Posters using this title are seen in and around New York in the video for &quot;Real Life&quot; – the band&#x27;s then most recent single. Another working title was &quot;One Wild Night&quot;. The latter was resurrected for a live compilation the following year.

An initial plan to team up with producers Bob Rock and Bruce Fairbairn fell through because of the latter&#x27;s death. An audition process was set up, but the band was uninterested by the producers interviewed. Eventually Bon Jovi asked A&amp;R executive John Kalodner if he knew up-and-coming producers, and he recommended Luke Ebbin. He was brought to Bon Jovi&#x27;s home studio in New Jersey, and took a demo with only vocals and acoustic guitar to add programming, string and background vocal arrangements. On his return, Ebbin was hired.

An interesting fact is that the song &quot;Next 100 Years&quot; is a self cover. Jon Bon Jovi (with B&#x27;z&#x27;s Koshi Inaba, who wrote the Japanese lyrics) sent a demo version to now extinct Japanese talent agency Johnny &amp; Associates. A special unit formed in 1997, to raise funds for schools affected by the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, with the members of Tokio, V6 and KinKi Kids, called J-Friends, recorded the song in 1999. &quot;J-FRIENDS Never Ending Spirit 1997-2003&quot;, a DVD with recordings of a year-end concert given in 2002 with several of the agency&#x27;s groups, as well as past concerts by the special unit, released in April 2003, includes a live version of the song.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Crush&quot; debuted at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the issue dated July 1, 2000, with 115,000 copies sold in contrast to their last set, &quot;These Days&quot; (1995), which debuted with 73,000 units, it stayed at number nine for a week before dropping to number 29 and spent 51 weeks on the chart. It was certified two times platinum by the RIAA, denoting shipments of two millions in the US. As of March 2009 the album has sold 2,071,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Crush&quot; debuted at No. 1 in the UK on June 10, 2000, and became the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive UK No. 1 album, it stayed at the top of the chart for a week before dropping to number four, it remained on the chart for thirty nine weeks. It was certified platinum by the BPI on September 1, 2000, for shipments of 300,000 units. The album also topped the European Top 100 Albums chart for seven weeks, spent fifteen weeks in the Top 10, and received double platinum certification by the IFPI Europe. The album was No. 6 on the 2000 Europe Year-End albums chart and No. 7 on the 2000 worldwide year end albums chart. The first single also featuring a music video, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; was the No. 3 best-selling single worldwide in 2000 and topped the European singles chart for 4 weeks. &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; and &quot;Thank You for Loving Me&quot; were also released as singles for the album featuring music videos.

&quot;Crush&quot; was mostly well received by critics. It was the first Bon Jovi album ever to be nominated for a Grammy. In a review for AllMusic, Steve Huey expressed the opinion that &quot;Crush&quot; was a &quot;solidly crafted mainstream rock record that&#x27;s much better than most might expect.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot; gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and described &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; as &quot;a Britney track shot through the heart with Richie Sambora&#x27;s voice-box guitar.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B and said that &quot;if the Jersey rockers haven&#x27;t matured much, it hardly matters. &quot;Crush&quot; — for all its sappy ballads and suburban pop fairy tales — is classic Bon Jovi. And that&#x27;s not an oxymoron.&quot;

== Track listing ==



*At the end of the album, the band can be heard discussing what would happen if James Brown were there, which then follows 30 seconds of silence before a bonus track, &quot;I Could Make a Living Out of Loving You&quot;.

<doc id="133240" wikidata="Q312424" url="?curid=133240" title="Mandamus">
<text>A writ of (; ) is a judicial remedy in the English and American common law system consisting of a court order that commands a government official or entity to perform an act it is legally required to perform as part of its official duties, or to refrain from performing an act the law forbids it from doing. Writs of mandamus are usually used in situations where a government official has failed to act as legally required or has taken a legally prohibited action. Decisions that fall within the discretionary power of public officials can not be controlled by the writ. For example, mandamus can not force a lower court to take a specific action on applications that have been made. If the court refuses to rule one way or the other, then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications.

Mandamus may be a command to do an administrative action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by legal rights. In the American legal system it must be a judicially enforceable and legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when they are denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to do something and abstains from doing it.

==Legal requirements==
The party requesting a writ of mandamus to be enforced should be able to show that they have a legal right to compel the respondent to do or refrain from doing the specific act. The duty sought to be enforced must have two qualities: It must be a duty of public nature and the duty must be imperative and should not be . Furthermore, mandamus will typically not be granted if adequate relief can be obtained by some other means, such as appeal.

==Purpose==
The purpose of mandamus is to remedy defects of justice. It lies in the cases where there is a specific right but no specific legal remedy for enforcing that right. Generally, it is not available in anticipation of any injury except when the petitioner is likely to be affected by an official act in contravention of a statutory duty or where an illegal or unconstitutional order is made. The grant of mandamus is therefore an equitable remedy, and a matter for the discretion of the court, the exercise of which is governed by well-settled principles.

Mandamus being a discretionary remedy, the application for it must be made in good faith and not for indirect purposes. Acquiescence cannot, however, bar the issue of mandamus. The petitioner must satisfy the Court that they have the legal right to the performance of the legal duty as distinct from mere discretion of authority. A mandamus is normally issued when an officer or an authority by compulsion of statute is required to perform a duty and that duty, despite a demand in writing, has not been performed. In no other case will a writ of mandamus issue unless it be to quash an illegal order.

==Types==
There are three kinds of mandamus:

#Alternative mandamus: A mandamus issued upon the first application for relief, commanding the defendant either to perform the act demanded or to appear before the court at a specified time to show cause for not performing it.
#Peremptory mandamus: An absolute and unqualified command to the defendant to do the act in question. It is issued when the defendant defaults on, or fails to show sufficient cause in answer to, an alternative mandamus.
#Continuing mandamus: A mandamus issued to a lower authority in general public interest asking the officer or the authority to perform its tasks expeditiously for an unstipulated period of time for preventing miscarriage of justice.

==In various countries==
===Parliamentary democracies===
====Australia====
Under the Australian legal system, mandamus is available through section 75(v) of the Constitution of Australia.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, mandamus was originally known as a writ of mandamus. Historically, direct orders from the monarch to subjects commanding the performance of particular acts were common, and to this class of orders mandamus originally belonged. It became customary for the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, in cases where a legal duty was established but no sufficient means existed for enforcing it, to order performance by this writ. Mandamus more recently became known as an order of mandamus. This procedure was renamed by the Civil Procedure (Modification of Supreme Court Act 1981) Order 2004 to become a mandatory order.

====India====
In India, the &quot;sine qua non&quot; for mandamus is the existence of a statutory public duty incumbent upon the person or body against whom the mandamus is sought. There must equally co-exist a corresponding right in the petitioner entitling him to claim the enforcement of such public duty. These two preconditions form the foundation for the issue of mandamus. The primary scope and function of mandamus is to &quot;command&quot; and &quot;execute&quot; rather than to &quot;enquire&quot; and &quot;adjudicate&quot;. It cannot be issued to change the decision of a body so as to suit the petitioner. Obligations which are not of a statutory nature cannot be enforced by mandamus. The writ petition is not maintainable when a remedy provided for under the Code of Civil Procedure is available. For example, the High Court cannot entertain writ petitions for mandamus to the Government who fails to deposit and pay in the requisite time an enhanced compensation account as ordered by a lower Court. The petitioners in this case would be directed to approach the executing Court for appropriate relief.

Only the Supreme Court and High Courts are empowered to exercise writ jurisdiction, under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. No other courts are empowered to issue the writ.

===United States===
In the administrative law context in the United States, the requirement that mandamus can be used only to compel a ministerial act has largely been abandoned. In most states acts of administrative agencies are now subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion. Judicial review of agencies of the United States federal government, for abuse of discretion, is authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act.

====Federal courts====
The authority of the United States district courts (trial courts) to issue mandamus has been expressly abrogated by Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but relief in the nature of mandamus can be had by other remedies provided for in the Rules, where provided by statute, or by use of the district courts&#x27; equitable powers.

In the context of &quot;mandamus&quot; from a United States court of appeals to a district court, the Supreme Court has ruled that the appellate courts have discretion to issue &quot;mandamus&quot; to control an abuse of discretion by the lower court in unusual circumstances, where there is a compelling reason not to wait for an appeal from a final judgment. This discretion is exercised very sparingly. It is exercised with somewhat greater frequency, although still sparingly, in the context of discovery disputes involving privileged materials, since a district court order erroneously forcing the disclosure of privileged material may never be remediable through a later appeal. In the case &quot;In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center&quot; (2013), privacy advocates sought a writ of mandamus directly from the Supreme Court to halt the National Security Agency&#x27;s bulk phone record collection program. The Supreme Court denied the petition.

====State courts====
In some state court systems, &quot;mandamus&quot; has evolved into a general procedure for discretionary appeals from non-final trial court decisions, or a procedure of obtaining review of decisions by administrative agencies. In many of the states that have adopted the Field Code, the writ is now called &quot;mandate&quot; instead of &quot;mandamus&quot;. These states are Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and California, as well as the unincorporated U.S. territory of Guam.

===== California =====

In the state of California, the writ may be issued by &quot;any&quot; level of the state court system to any lower court or to any government official. The writ of mandate is used in California for interlocutory appeals. In this context, the party seeking the writ is treated on appeal like a plaintiff, the trial court becomes the defendant, and the opponent is designated as the &quot;real party in interest&quot;.

===== North Carolina =====
In North Carolina state courts, &quot;mandamus&quot; is authorized as one of the Extraordinary Writs, under Rule 22 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure . The writ of mandamus may be issued in instances where, for instance, the lower court fails to timely issue a written order after rendition (thus precluding both the possibility of an appeal or enforcement of the rendition and leaving the litigants in limbo). The North Carolina Court of Appeals has spoken on the possible course of action in such situations, and confirmed that petitioning for a writ of mandamus is the only available route. In McKyer, the lawyer who was unable to persuade the trial court judge to enter an order for about a year, tried to remedy the problem by asking the trial court judge to hold another hearing. Disapproving of the attempted resolution via a new hearing, the Court of Appeals, citing the Supreme Court case &quot;In re T.H.T.&quot;, explained that a party seeking recourse where the trial court has not entered its orders timely should petition for writ of mandamus. 

Similarly, the writ may issue where the trial court fails or refuses to timely dispose with the litigants&#x27; business (for instance, if the judge refuses to hear a case). In North Carolina, as elsewhere, the writ is an action against the official, meaning that the petition must be styled &quot;In re Public Figure X&quot; or &quot;In re Judge Y&quot;. Thus, a mandamus petition not only brings the strife of optically making the officer or judge the defendant, but also in theory requires the official / judge to respond &quot;within ten days&quot; &quot;with supporting affidavits&quot;. Rule 22(c) provides that &quot;any party&quot; may respond to the petition for writ. The North Carolina Court of Appeals has interpreted this to mean that where, for instance, one litigant demands that the judge enter a previously rendered order, the other litigant in the same case is free to respond instead of (or in addition to) the judge that presides over both of the litigants.

===== Other states =====
In Virginia, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction under the state constitution for mandamus involving the Virginia courts.

Elsewhere, including the Courts of New York, have replaced &quot;mandamus&quot; (as well as the other prerogative writs) with statutory procedures. In New York, this is known as an &quot;Article 78&quot; review after the civil procedure law provision that created the relevant procedure. In still other states, such as Illinois, the state court of last resort has original jurisdiction in mandamus actions.

<doc id="133242" wikidata="Q845707" url="?curid=133242" title="One Wild Night Live 1985–2001">
<text>One Wild Night Live 1985–2001 is the first live album by the American rock band Bon Jovi, released on May 22, 2001. The album includes live covers of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; and performance of the Boomtown Rats&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;, with a guest appearance by their lead singer Bob Geldof. The album charted at number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

==Versions of songs==
The duet of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; with Bob Geldof was performed at Wembley Stadium just two weeks short of the tenth anniversary of Live Aid, where Geldof performed the same song at the same stadium as part of the Boomtown Rats. He would later perform the same song almost exactly ten years later in London again at Live 8. This 1995 rendition of the song was previously released on a rare special edition 2-CD version of &quot;These Days&quot;. Several copies of the album misprint the year of the recording as 2000 however the actual year is 1995 when Bon Jovi performed at Wembley Stadium as part of the These Days tour. During the intro to the song, Jon Bon Bovi mistakenly welcomes Bob Geldof by saying to the crowd, &quot;You should be proud to call him your own&quot; despite Geldof being Irish, not English.

&quot;One Wild Night 2001&quot; is a new remix version rather than a live version. The difference between this version and the original &quot;Crush&quot; version is the length; the intro and other sections were cut out. This was released as a single for this album and featured a music video. The new version also features on the compilation album &quot;Tokyo Road: Best of Bon Jovi&quot;.

The live version of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; was also released as a single and had a promotional video produced for it, this depicted live performances of the song and some backstage footage.

The three Zürich songs were recorded at the Letzigrund Stadium, and were also released on &quot;The Crush Tour DVD&quot;.

<text>The Spanish conquest of Yucatán was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the Yucatán Peninsula, a vast limestone plain covering south-eastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and all of Belize. The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks, and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations.

The first encounter with the Yucatec Maya may have occurred in 1502, when the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus came across a large trading canoe off Honduras. In 1511, Spanish survivors of the shipwrecked caravel called &quot;Santa María de la Barca&quot; sought refuge among native groups along the eastern coast of the peninsula. Hernán Cortés made contact with two survivors, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, eight years later. In 1517, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba made landfall on the tip of the peninsula. His expedition continued along the coast and suffered heavy losses in a pitched battle at Champotón, forcing a retreat to Cuba. Juan de Grijalva explored the coast in 1518, and heard tales of the wealthy Aztec Empire further west. As a result of these rumours, Hernán Cortés set sail with another fleet. From Cozumel he continued around the peninsula to Tabasco where he fought a battle at Potonchán; from there Cortés continued onward to conquer the Aztec Empire. In 1524, Cortés led a sizeable expedition to Honduras, cutting across southern Campeche, and through Petén in what is now northern Guatemala. In 1527 Francisco de Montejo set sail from Spain with a small fleet. He left garrisons on the east coast, and subjugated the northeast of the peninsula. Montejo then returned to the east to find his garrisons had almost been eliminated; he used a supply ship to explore southwards before looping back around the entire peninsula to central Mexico. Montejo pacified Tabasco with the aid of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo.

In 1531 the Spanish moved their base of operations to Campeche, where they repulsed a significant Maya attack. After this battle, the Spanish founded a town at Chichen Itza in the north. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers. In mid-1533 the local Maya rebelled and laid siege to the small Spanish garrison, which was forced to flee. Towards the end of 1534, or the beginning of 1535, the Spanish retreated from Campeche to Veracruz. In 1535, peaceful attempts by the Franciscan Order to incorporate Yucatán into the Spanish Empire failed after a renewed Spanish military presence at Champotón forced the friars out. Champotón was by now the last Spanish outpost in Yucatán, isolated among a hostile population. In 1541–42 the first permanent Spanish town councils in the entire peninsula were founded at Campeche and Mérida. When the powerful lord of Tutul-Xiu Maya in Maní converted to the Roman Catholic religion, his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity encouraged the lords of the western provinces to accept Spanish rule. In late 1546 an alliance of eastern provinces launched an unsuccessful uprising against the Spanish. The eastern Maya were defeated in a single battle, which marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula.

The polities of Petén in the south remained independent and received many refugees fleeing from Spanish jurisdiction. In 1618 and in 1619 two unsuccessful Franciscan missions attempted the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza. In 1622 the Itza slaughtered two Spanish parties trying to reach their capital Nojpetén. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. Over the course of 1695 and 1696 a number of Spanish expeditions attempted to reach Nojpetén from the mutually independent Spanish colonies in Yucatán and Guatemala. In early 1695 the Spanish began to build a road from Campeche south towards Petén and activity intensified, sometimes with significant losses on the part of the Spanish. Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi, governor of Yucatán, launched an assault upon Nojpetén in March 1697; the city fell after a brief battle. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the Spanish.

==Geography==

The Yucatán Peninsula is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It can be delimited by a line running from the Laguna de Términos on the Gulf coast through to the Gulf of Honduras on the Caribbean coast. It incorporates the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Petén, and all of Belize. Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. A stretch of high, rocky coast runs south from the city of Campeche on the Gulf Coast. A number of bays are situated along the east coast of the peninsula, from north to south they are Ascensión Bay, Espíritu Santo Bay, Chetumal Bay and Amatique Bay. The north coast features a wide, sandy littoral zone. The extreme north of the peninsula, roughly corresponding to Yucatán State, has underlying bedrock consisting of flat Cenozoic limestone. To the south of this the limestone rises to form the low chain of Puuc Hills, with a steep initial scarp running east from the Gulf coast near Champotón, terminating some from the Caribbean coast near the border of Quintana Roo. The hills reach a maximum altitude of .

The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall than the rest of the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave roofs are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed.

In contrast, the northeastern portion of the peninsula is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers are located in the south. The Sibun River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the Río Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The Río Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest of the peninsula, the San Pedro, Candelaría, and Mamantel Rivers, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.

The Petén region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain featuring karstic topography. The area is crossed by low east–west oriented ridges of Cenozoic limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as &quot;bajos&quot;. A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén; during the rainy season some of these lakes become interconnected. This drainage area measures approximately east–west by north–south. The largest lake is Lake Petén Itza, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes. To the north of the lakes region &quot;bajos&quot; become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of Petén the Mirador Basin forms another interior drainage region. To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands. The canopy height of the forest gradually decreases from Petén northwards, averaging from . This dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize, most of Quintana Roo, southern Campeche and a portion of the south of Yucatán State. Further north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.

===Climate===
The climate becomes progressively drier towards the north of the peninsula. In the north, the annual mean temperature is in Mérida. Average temperature in the peninsula varies from in January to in July. The lowest temperature on record is . For the peninsula as a whole, the mean annual precipitation is . The rainy season lasts from June to September, while the dry season runs from October to May. During the dry season, rainfall averages ; in the wet season this increases to an average . The prevailing winds are easterly and have created an east–west precipitation gradient with average rainfall in the east exceeding and the north and northwestern portions of the peninsula receiving a maximum of . The southeastern portion of the peninsula has a tropical rainy climate with a short dry season in winter.

Petén has a hot climate and receives the highest rainfall in all Mesoamerica. The climate is divided into wet and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from June to December, although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south; with rain occurring through most of the year. The climate of Petén varies from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north; temperature varies between , although it does not usually drop beneath . Mean temperature varies from in the southeast to in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June, while January is the coldest month; all Petén experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of in the northeast to in central Petén.

==Yucatán before the conquest==
The first large Maya cities developed in the Petén Basin in the far south of the Yucatán Peninsula as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 600–350 BC), and Petén formed the heartland of the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c. AD 250–900). The 16th century Maya provinces of northern Yucatán are likely to have evolved out of polities of the Maya Classic period. From the mid-13th century AD through to the mid-15th century, the League of Mayapán united several of the northern provinces; for a time they shared a joint form of government. The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse. A significant Maya presence remained in Petén into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.

In the early 16th century, when the Spanish discovered the Yucatán Peninsula, the region was still dominated by the Maya civilization. It was divided into a number of independent provinces referred to as &quot;kuchkabal&quot; (plural &quot;kuchkabaloob&quot;) in the Yucatec Maya language. The various provinces shared a common culture but the internal sociopolitical organisation varied from one province to the next, as did access to important resources. These differences in political and economic makeup often led to hostilities between the provinces. The politically fragmented state of the Yucatán Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion, since there was no central political authority to be overthrown. However, the Spanish were also able to exploit this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre-existing rivalries between polities. Estimates of the number of &quot;kuchkabal&quot; in the northern Yucatán vary from sixteen to twenty-four. The boundaries between polities were not stable, being subject to the effects of alliances and wars; those &quot;kuchkabaloob&quot; with more centralised forms of government were likely to have had more stable boundaries than those of loose confederations of provinces. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Maní and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Maní allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.

At the time of conquest, polities in the north included Maní, Chakan, and Cehpech. Chakan was largely landlocked with a small stretch of coast on the north of the peninsula. Cehpech was a coastal province to its east; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. The modern city of Valladolid is situated upon the site of the former capital of Cupul. Cupul and Chinkinchel are known to have been mutually hostile, and to have engaged in wars to control the salt beds of the north coast. Tazes was a small landlocked province south of Chikinchel. Ecab was a large province in the east. Uaymil was in the southeast, and Chetumal was to the south of it; all three bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula; it was southwest of Ecab and northwest of Uaymil. Its borders are poorly understood and it may have been landlocked, or have extended to occupy a portion of the Caribbean coast between the latter two &quot;kuchkabaloob&quot;. The capital of Cochuah was Tihosuco. Hocabá and Sotuta were landlocked provinces north of Maní and southwest of Ah Kin Chel and Cupul. Ah Canul was the northernmost province on the Gulf of Mexico coast of the peninsula. Canpech (modern Campeche) was to the south of it, followed by Chanputun (modern Champotón). South of Chanputun, and extending west along the Gulf coast was Acalan. This Chontal Maya-speaking province extended east of the Usumacinta River in Tabasco, as far as what is now the southern portion of Campeche state, where their capital was located. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza and east of Acalan, between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche, and to the west of Chetumal. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.

Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern Petén lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake Macanché. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups. In the late 17th century, Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including Zacpeten on Lake Macanché and Ixlu on Lake Salpetén. Other groups in Petén are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Chʼol, the Manche Chʼol, and the Mopan.

==Impact of Old World diseases==

A soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and caused the plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of the entire Yucatán Peninsula. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. The terrible plagues that swept the peninsula were recorded in Yucatec Maya written histories, which combined with those of neighbouring Maya peoples in the Guatemalan Highlands, suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area the same year that it arrived in central Mexico with the forces under the command of Pánfilo Narváez. Old World diseases are often mentioned only briefly in indigenous accounts, making it difficult to identify the culprit. Among the most deadly were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis; the latter disease was attributed to the arrival of the Spanish by the Maya inhabitants of Yucatán.

These diseases swept through Yucatán in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century. By the late 16th century, the reports of high fevers suggest the arrival of malaria in the region and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century, with a terse mention in the &quot;Chilam Balam of Chumayel&quot; for 1648. That particular outbreak was traced back to the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, from whence it was introduced to the port city of Campeche, and from there was transmitted to Mérida. Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out. Sixteen Franciscan friars are reported to have died in Mérida, probably the majority of the based there and who had probably numbered not much more than twenty before the outbreak. Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions, particularly those possessing swamplands, became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites. An example was the one-time well-populated province of Ecab occupying the northeastern portion of the peninsula. In 1528, when Francisco de Montejo occupied the town of Conil for two months, the Spanish recorded approximately 5,000 houses in the town; the adult male population at the time has been conservatively estimated as 3,000. By 1549, Spanish records show that only 80 tributaries were registered to be taxed, indicating a population drop in Conil of more than 90% in 21 years. The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost eliminated within fifty years of the conquest.

In the south, conditions conducive to the spread of malaria existed throughout Petén and Belize. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. In Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits.

==Weaponry, strategies and tactics==
The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in new colonial towns, or &quot;reducciones&quot; (also known as &quot;congregaciones&quot;). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the &quot;reducciones&quot; often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf of Mexico coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish &quot;reducción&quot;. Coastal &quot;reducciones&quot;, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the &quot;reducción&quot; town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.

===Spanish weaponry and armour===
The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors were armed with broadswords, rapiers, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Mounted conquistadors were armed with a lance, that also served as a pike for infantrymen. A variety of halberds and bills were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a long two-handed version was also used. Crossbows had arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley. Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.

===Native weaponry and armour===
Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members of the Maya aristocracy wore quilted cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.

== First encounters: 1502 and 1511 ==

On 30 July 1502, during his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.

In 1511, the Spanish caravel &quot;Santa María de la Barca&quot; set sail along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia. The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Darién to inform the colonial authorities there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de Nicuesa and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa in Darién. The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las Víboras (&quot;The Vipers&quot;) or, alternatively, Los Alacranes (&quot;The Scorpions&quot;), somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship&#x27;s boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucatán. There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Valdivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik; he took them prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan&#x27;s daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children. By 1514, Guerrero had achieved the rank of &quot;nacom&quot;, a war leader who served against Nachan Chan&#x27;s enemies.

==Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, 1517==
In 1517, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba set sail from Cuba with a small fleet, consisting of two caravels and a brigantine, with the dual intention of exploration and of rounding up slaves. The experienced Antón de Alaminos served as pilot; he had previously served as pilot under Christopher Columbus on his final voyage. Also among the approximately 100-strong expedition members was Bernal Díaz del Castillo. The expedition sailed west from Cuba for three weeks, and weathered a two-day storm a week before sighting the coast of the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. The ships could not put in close to the shore due to the shallowness of the coastal waters. However, they could see a Maya city some two leagues inland, upon a low hill. The Spanish called it Gran Cairo (literally &quot;Great Cairo&quot;) due to its size and its pyramids. Although the location is not now known with certainty, it is believed that this first sighting of Yucatán was at Isla Mujeres.

The following morning, the Spanish sent the two ships with a shallower draught to find a safe approach through the shallows. The caravels anchored about one league from the shore. Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships. Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day.

The Maya leader returned the following day with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships&#x27; boats; a few of the more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like &quot;cones catoche&quot;. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.
Over the next fifteen days the fleet slowly followed the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; the hunt for more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships&#x27; boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, where many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.

The small fleet continued for six more days in fine weather, followed by four stormy days. By this time water was once again dangerously short. The ships spotted an inlet close to another city, Champotón, and a landing party discovered fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city while the water casks were being filled. Communication was once again attempted with signs. Night fell by the time the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. In the darkness the Spaniards could hear the movements of large numbers of Maya warriors. They decided that a night-time retreat would be too risky; instead, they posted guards and waited for dawn. At sunrise, the Spanish saw that they had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault with missiles, including arrows, darts and stones; they then charged into hand-to-hand combat with spears and clubs. Eighty of the defenders were wounded in the initial barrage of missiles, and two Spaniards were captured in the frantic mêlée that followed. All of the Spanish party received wounds, including Hernández de Córdoba. The Spanish regrouped in a defensive formation and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. Most of the precious water casks were abandoned on the beach. When the surviving Spanish reached the safety of the ships, they realised that they had lost over fifty men, more than half their number. Five men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour, and the Spanish named the locale as the Coast of the Disastrous Battle. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba. They decided to abandon their smallest ship, the brigantine, although it was purchased on credit from Governor Velásquez of Cuba.
The few men who had not been wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were reinforced with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.

Based upon Hernández de Córdoba&#x27;s report and the testimony of the interrogated Indian prisoners, Governor Velázquez wrote to the Council of the Indies notifying it of &quot;his&quot; discovery.

==Juan de Grijalva, 1518==
Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba&#x27;s report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 240 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command. Francisco de Montejo, who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula, was captain of one of the ships; Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d&#x27;Avila captained the other ships. Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from the governor, who was his kinsman. Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot. Governor Velázquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread. Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition.
The fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva&#x27;s friendly overtures. The fleet sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, one of which was probably Tulum. On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bahía de la Ascensión. Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north from Ascensión Bay. He looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula to sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest. The Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.

At Champotón, where the inhabitants had routed Hernández and his men, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships&#x27; cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champotón to avenge the previous year&#x27;s defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hernández. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into the port of Havana five months after he had left.

==Hernán Cortés, 1519==

Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s return aroused great interest in Cuba, and Yucatán was believed to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hernán Cortés was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Cristóbal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal Díaz del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition.

The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and Cortés remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. At Cozumel, Cortés heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucatán mainland, who he presumed were Europeans. Cortés sent out messengers to them and was able to rescue the shipwrecked Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés&#x27; interpreter.

From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River, which Cortés renamed as the Grijalva River in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it. In Tabasco, Cortés anchored his ships at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cortés was able to communicate with the Aztecs. Marina became Cortés&#x27; consort and eventually bore him a son. From Tabasco, Cortés continued to Cempoala in Veracruz, a subject city of the Aztec Empire, and from there on to conquer the Aztecs.

In 1519, Cortés sent the veteran Francisco de Montejo back to Spain with treasure for the king. While he was in Spain, Montejo pleaded Cortés&#x27; cause against the supporters of Diego de Velásquez. Montejo remained in Spain for seven years, and eventually succeeded in acquiring the hereditary military title of &quot;adelantado&quot;.

==Hernán Cortés in the Maya lowlands, 1524–25==
In 1524, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across Acalan in southern Campeche and the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Cristóbal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras; Olid had, however, set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory. Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him the captured Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc, and Cohuanacox and Tetlepanquetzal, the captive Aztec lords of Texcoco and Tlacopan. Cortés marched into Maya territory in Tabasco; the army crossed the Usumacinta River near Tenosique and crossed into the Chontal Maya province of Acalan, where he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. In Acalan, Cortés believed that the captive Aztec lords were plotting against him and he ordered Cuauhtemoc and Tetlepanquetzal to be hanged. Cortés and his army left Acalan on 5 March 1525.

The expedition passed onwards through Kejache territory and reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified. One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and was surrounded by a moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.

They arrived at the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of Aj Kan Ekʼ, the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ekʼ to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés&#x27; cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén.

From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.

On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid&#x27;s own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.

== Francisco de Montejo, 1527–1528 ==

The richer lands of Mexico engaged the main attention of the conquistadors for some years, then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for the right to conquer Yucatán. On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of &quot;adelantado&quot; and permission to colonise the Yucatán Peninsula. In 1527, he left Spain with 400 men in four ships, with horses, small arms, cannon and provisions. He set sail for Santo Domingo, where more supplies and horses were collected, allowing Montejo to increase his cavalry to fifty. One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel in the second half of September 1527. Montejo was received in peace by the lord of Cozumel, Aj Naum Pat, but the ships only stopped briefly before making for the Yucatán coast. The expedition made landfall somewhere near Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab, in what is now Mexico&#x27;s Quintana Roo state.

Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 soldiers under his second-in-command, Alonso d&#x27;Avila, and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha and became the first Spanish settlement on the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was seized from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucatán. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat, when the latter made a visit to the mainland. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucatán peninsula. His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha, Mochis and Belma, none of which survives today. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab that was described as having 5,000 houses, where the Spanish party halted for two months.

In the spring of 1528, Montejo left Conil for the city of Chauaca, which was abandoned by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning, the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, some north of Tizimín, where they engaged in a major battle against the Maya, killing more than 1,200 of them. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo&#x27;s party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-man garrison survived, while the garrison at Pole had been entirely wiped out.

The support ship eventually arrived from Santo Domingo, and Montejo used it to sail south along the coast, while he sent Ávila over land. Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal (capital of the Chetumal Province). At Chaktumal, Montejo learnt that shipwrecked Spanish sailor Gonzalo Guerrero was in the region, and Montejo sent messages to him, inviting him to return to join his compatriots, but the Mayanised Guerrero declined.

The Maya at Chaktumal fed false information to the Spanish, and Montejo was unable to find Ávila and link up with him. Ávila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for Ávila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left Ávila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.

== Francisco de Montejo and Alonso d&#x27; Ávila, 1531–1535 ==
Montejo was appointed &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province with the aid of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. Alonso d&#x27; Ávila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 Ávila established Salamanca de Acalan as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. Salamanca de Acalan proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. Ávila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they then both rejoined Ávila at Champotón.

In 1531, Montejo moved his base of operations to Campeche. Alonso d&#x27; Ávila was sent overland to Chauaca in the east of the peninsula, passing through Maní, where he was well received by the Xiu Maya. Ávila continued southeast to Chetumal where he founded the Spanish town of Villa Real (&quot;Royal Town&quot;). The local Maya fiercely resisted the placement of the new Spanish colony and Ávila and his men were forced to abandon Villa Real and make for Honduras in canoes.

At Campeche, the Maya amassed a strong force and attacked the city; the Spanish were able to fight them off, a battle in which the elder Montejo was almost killed. Aj Canul, the lord of the attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichén Itzá. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers and gave each of his men two to three thousand Maya in &quot;encomienda&quot;. After six months of Spanish rule, Cupul dissatisfaction could no longer be contained and Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichén Itzá. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night after arranging a distraction for their attackers, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by Namux Chel, the lord of the Chel province, at Dzilam. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, near Tʼho (the modern city of Mérida).

While his son had been attempting to consolidate the Spanish control of Cupul, Francisco de Montejo the Elder had met the Xiu ruler at Maní. The Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucatán in large part due to Xiu support. The Montejos, after reuniting at Dzikabal, founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam, although the Spanish suffered hardships there. Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche, where he was received with friendship by the local Maya. He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel, who travelled on horseback, and two of the lord&#x27;s cousins, who were taken in chains. Francisco de Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region but, finding the situation too difficult, he soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d&#x27; Ávila, who had returned to Campeche shortly before Montejo the Younger. Around this time, the news began to arrive of Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s conquests in Peru and the rich plunder that his soldiers were taking there, undermining the morale of Montejo&#x27;s already disenchanted band of followers. Montejo&#x27;s soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucatán Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated from Campeche to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them.

Montejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras, a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction. Alvarado&#x27;s claim ultimately turned out successful. In Montejo the Elder&#x27;s absence, first in central Mexico, and then in Honduras, Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco.

=== Conflict at Champotón ===
The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera arrived in Champotón in 1535 to attempt the peaceful incorporation of Yucatán into the Spanish Empire. Testera had been assured by the Spanish authorities that no military activity would be undertaken in Yucatán, while he was attempting its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, and that no soldiers would be permitted to enter the peninsula. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champotón at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champotón and return to central Mexico.

Godoy&#x27;s attempt to subdue the Maya around Champotón was unsuccessful and the local Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region. This resistance was sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champotón to take command. His diplomatic overtures to the Champotón Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champotón was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult.

== Conquest and settlement in northern Yucatán, 1540–1546 ==

In 1540, Francisco de Montejo the Elder, who was now in his late 60s, turned his royal rights to colonise Yucatán over to his son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger. In early 1541, Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champoton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there, Montejo the Younger, commanding between 300 and 400 Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly after establishing the Spanish presence in Campeche, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them to submit to the Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them; Montejo himself remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.

Montejo the Younger&#x27;s cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan, not far from Tʼho. On 6 January 1542, he founded the second permanent town council, calling the new colonial town Mérida. On 23 January, Tutul-Xiu, the lord of Maní, approached the Spanish encampment at Mérida in peace, bearing sorely needed food supplies. He expressed interest in the Spanish religion and witnessed a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit. Tutul-Xiu was greatly impressed and converted to the new religion; he was baptised as Melchor and stayed with the Spanish at Mérida for two months, receiving instruction in the Catholic faith. Tutul-Xiu was the ruler of the most powerful province of northern Yucatán and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula, and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule. The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures.

Montejo the Younger next sent his cousin to Chauaca where most of the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya resisted fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish domination, and also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes.

On 8 November 1546, an alliance of eastern provinces launched a coordinated uprising against the Spanish. The provinces of Cupul, Cochua, Sotuta, Tazes, Uaymil, Chetumal and Chikinchel united in a concerted effort to drive the invaders from the peninsula; the uprising lasted four months. Eighteen Spaniards were surprised in the eastern towns, and were sacrificed. A contemporary account described the slaughter of over 400 allied Maya, as well as livestock. Mérida and Campeche were forewarned of the impending attack; Montejo the Younger and his cousin were in Campeche. Montejo the Elder arrived in Mérida from Chiapas in December 1546, with reinforcements gathered from Champotón and Campeche. The rebellious eastern Maya were finally defeated in a single battle, in which twenty Spaniards and several hundred allied Maya were killed. This battle marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. As a result of the uprising and the Spanish response, many of the Maya inhabitants of the eastern and southern territories fled to the still unconquered Petén Basin, in the extreme south of the peninsula. The Spanish only achieved dominance in the north and the polities of Petén remained independent and continued to receive many refugees from the north.

==Petén Basin, 1618–1697==

The Petén Basin covers an area that is now part of Guatemala; in colonial times it originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Yucatán, before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala in 1703. The Itza kingdom centred upon Lake Petén Itzá had been visited by Hernán Cortés on his march to Honduras in 1525.

===Early 17th century===

Following Cortés&#x27; visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still-pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received at Nojpetén by the current Kan Ekʼ. They stayed for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ekʼ refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ekʼ. The friars returned in October 1619, and again Kan Ekʼ welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water, but survived the journey back to Mérida.

In March 1622, the governor of Yucatán, Diego de Cárdenas, ordered Captain Francisco de Mirones y Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. In May the expedition advanced to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers&#x27; treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado&#x27;s departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ekʼ, asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods. After their sacrifice, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fortune of the leader of Delgado&#x27;s Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado&#x27;s escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with a Maya scout to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. Bernardino Ek, the scout, escaped and returned to Mirones with the news. Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjKʼin Pʼol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum, and killed them all. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya men and women were killed by Spanish attackers, who also burned the town.

Following these killings, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucatán, and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjKʼin Pʼol. The Maya governor of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial &quot;Partido de la Sierra&quot; in what is now Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán state. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.

===Late 17th century===

In 1692 Basque nobleman Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from Mérida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process &quot;reducing&quot; any independent native populations into colonial &quot;congregaciones&quot;; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon Chʼol and Manche Chʼol of southern Petén and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River. The original plan was for the province of Yucatán to build the northern section and for Guatemala to build the southern portion, with both meeting somewhere in Chʼol territory; the plan was later modified to pass further east, through the kingdom of the Itza.

As governor of Yucatán (1695-1696) now, Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi, began to build the road from Campeche south towards Petén. At the beginning of March 1695, Captain Alonso García de Paredes led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers. The expedition advanced south into Kejache territory, which began at Chunpich, about north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala. He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements, but met with armed Kejache resistance. García de Paredes decided to retreat around the middle of April.

In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set out from Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, within sight of Nojpetén, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.

In mid-May 1695 García de Paredes again marched southwards from Campeche, with 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucatán province. Ursúa also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from Tekʼax and Oxkʼutzkabʼ to join the expedition at Bʼolonchʼen Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche. At the end of May three friars were assigned to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother. A second group of Franciscans would continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas; it was led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. García de Paredes ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá, which would serve as the main military base for the &quot;Camino Real&quot; (&quot;Royal Road&quot;) project.

A company of native musketeers from the town of Sajkabʼchen (or Sahcabchén) in Campeche, pushed ahead with the road builders from Tzuktzokʼ to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled. The company&#x27;s officers sent for reinforcements from García de Paredes at Tzuktokʼ but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkabʼchen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury. The Sajkabʼchen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.
Around 3 August García de Paredes moved his entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the San Pedro River. By November Tzuktokʼ was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki. In December 1695 the main force was reinforced with 250 soldiers, of which 150 were Spanish and pardo (descendants of Southern Europeans, Amerindians, and West Africans) and 100 were Maya, together with labourers and muleteers.

====Avendaño&#x27;s expedition, June 1695====
In May 1695, friar Antonio de Silva, the provincial superior of the Franciscan Order in Yucatán, had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Petén; the first group was to join up with García de Parede&#x27;s military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake Petén Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar Andrés de Avendaño. Avendaño was accompanied by another friar, a lay brother, and six Christian Maya. This latter group left Mérida on 2 June 1695. Avendaño continued south along the course of the new road, finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity. The Franciscans overtook García de Paredes at Bʼukʼte, about before Tzuktokʼ. On 3 August García de Paredes advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avendaño to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from Bʼukʼte. Avendaño instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions, seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of García de Parede&#x27;s advance companies and had now retreated into the forest. He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom. Avendaño returned to Tzuktokʼ and reconsidered his plans; the Franciscans were short of supplies, and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily. Antonio de Silva ordered Avendaño to return to Mérida, and he arrived there on 17 September 1695. Meanwhile, the other group of Franciscans, led by Juan de San Buenaventura Chávez, continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory, through IxBʼam, Bʼatkabʼ and Chuntuki (modern Chuntunqui near Carmelita, Petén).

====San Buenaventura among the Kejache, September – November 1695====
Juan de San Buenaventura&#x27;s small group of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues (approximately 44.2 miles or 71.1 km), almost to Lake Petén Itzá, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains. San Buenaventura was accompanied by two friars and a lay brother. With Avendaño&#x27;s return to Mérida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura&#x27;s group. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktokʼ, and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki. On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship. On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pakʼekʼem, where another 300 Kejache resided. In early November 1695, friar Tomás de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pakʼekʼem, where they were well received by the &quot;cacique&quot; (native chief) and his pagan priest. Pakʼekʼem was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at Bʼatkabʼ to attend to over 100 Kejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of a Spanish friar; a further church was established at Tzuktokʼ, overseen by another friar.

====Avendaño&#x27;s expedition, December 1695 – January 1696====
Franciscan friar Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696, accompanied by four companions. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins. From there they followed the small Acté River to a Chakʼan Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ekʼ travelled across the lake with 80 canoes to greet the visitors at the Chakʼan Itza (a subgroup of the Itza) port town of Chʼichʼ, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ekʼ and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ekʼ to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right.
On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño, arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule. The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ekʼ and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza. Kan Ekʼ learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño&#x27;s companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki, and from there returned to Mérida.

====Battle at Chʼichʼ, 2 February 1696====
By mid-January, Captain García de Paredes had arrived at the advance portion of the &quot;Camino Real&quot; at Chuntuki. By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, García&#x27;s senior officer, arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.
Martín de Ursúa was now convinced that Kan Ekʼ would not surrender peacefully, and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Chʼichʼ the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.

====Expedition from Verapaz, February – March 1696====
&quot;Oidor&quot; Bartolomé de Amésqueta led the next Guatemalan expedition against the Itza. He marched his men from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696. On 7 March, Captain Díaz de Velasco led a party ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by two Dominican friars and by AjKʼixaw, an Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz&#x27;s previous expedition. When they drew close to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjKʼixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. Díaz&#x27;s party was lured into an Itza trap and the expedition members were killed to a man. The two friars were captured and sacrificed. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers.
Amésqueta left Mopán three days after Díaz and followed Díaz&#x27;s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.

====Assault on Nojpetén====
The Itzas&#x27; continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all. Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed &quot;galeota&quot; attack boat. The &quot;galeota&quot; carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. The &quot;piragua&quot; longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital.

On 10 March a number of Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Chʼichʼ to negotiate with Ursúa. Kan Ekʼ then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ekʼ to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ekʼ failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.

A waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek&#x27;s capital on the morning of 13 March. Ursúa boarded the &quot;galeota&quot; with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpetén. The attack boat was rowed east towards the Itza capital; across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpetén – Ursúa simply gave the order to row through them. A large number of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpetén and on the roofs of the city. Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders from the canoes. Ursúa ordered his men not to return fire but arrows wounded a number of his soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.

The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as &quot;Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza&quot;). The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties. Kan Ekʼ was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.

<text>The Sinclair Scientific was a 12-function, pocket-sized scientific calculator introduced in 1974, dramatically undercutting in price other calculators available at the time. The Sinclair Scientific Programmable, released a year later, was advertised as the first budget programmable calculator.

Significant modifications to the algorithms used meant that a chipset intended for a four-function calculator was able to process scientific functions, but at the cost of reduced speed and accuracy. Compared to contemporary scientific calculators, some functions were slow to execute, and others had limited accuracy or gave the wrong answer, but the cost of the Sinclair was a fraction of the cost of competing calculators.

==History==
In 1972, Hewlett-Packard launched the HP-35, the world&#x27;s first handheld scientific calculator. Despite market research suggesting that it was too expensive for there to be any real demand, production went ahead. It cost (about ), but despite the price, over 300,000 were sold in the three and a half years for which it was produced.

From 1971, Texas Instruments had been making available the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared in a number of Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.

The Sinclair Scientific first appeared in a case derived from that of the Sinclair Cambridge, but it was not part of the same range. The initial retail price was in the UK (), and in the US for as a kit or fully assembled. By July 1976, however, it was possible to purchase one for ().

The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was introduced in August 1975, and was larger than the Sinclair Scientific, at . It was advertised as &quot;the first ... calculator to offer a ... programming facility ... at a price within the reach of the general public,&quot; but was limited by having only 24 program steps.

Both the Sinclair Scientific and the Sinclair Scientific Programmable were manufactured in England, like all other Sinclair calculators except the Sinclair President.

==Design==

===Sinclair Scientific===
The HP-35 used five chips, and had been developed by twenty engineers at a cost of a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair&#x27;s aim to build a scientific calculator around the TMS0805 chip, which could barely handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used clever algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the calculator, were printed on the case below the screen.

It displays only in scientific notation, with a five digit mantissa and a two digit exponent, although a sixth digit of the mantissa was stored internally. Because of the way the processor was designed, it uses Reverse Polish notation (RPN) to input calculations. RPN meant that the difficult implementation of brackets, and the associated recursive logic, was not necessary to implement in the hardware, but the effort was instead offloaded to the user. Instead of an &quot;equals&quot; button, the or keys are used to enter the initial value of a calculation, followed by subsequent operand(s) each followed by their appropriate operator(s).

To fit the program into the 320 words available on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using ordinary floating point numbers, which require many instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions took almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log taking about 20 more. The code to normalize and display the computed values is roughly the same in the TI and Sinclair programs.

The design of the algorithms meant that some calculations, such as arccos0.2, could take up to 15 seconds, whereas the HP-35 was designed to complete calculations in under a second. Accuracy in scientific functions was also limited to around three digits at best, and there were a number of bugs and limitations.

Ken Shirriff, an employee of Google, reverse engineered a Sinclair Scientific in 2013 and built a simulator using the original algorithms.

====Assembly kit====
The assembly kit consisted of eight groups of components, plus a carry case. The build time was advertised as being around three hours, and required a soldering iron and a pair of cutters. In January 1975, the kit was available for , half the price at the time of introduction a year earlier, and in December 1975 it was available for , less than a quarter of the introductory price.

===Sinclair Scientific Programmable===
The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was introduced in 1975, with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford. It was larger than the Scientific, at , and used a larger PP3 battery, but could also be powered by mains electricity.

It had 24-step programming abilities, which meant it was highly limited for many purposes. It also lacked functions for the natural logarithm and exponential function. Constants used in programs were required to be integers, and the programming was wasteful, with start and end quotes needed to use a constant in a program.

However, included with the calculator was a library of over 120 programs that performed common operations in mathematics, geometry, statistics, finance, physics, electronics, engineering, as well as fluid mechanics and materials science. There were over 400 programs in the full Sinclair Program Library.

===Calculations using the Sinclair Scientific===

The Sinclair used a slightly altered Reverse Polish Notation method; lacking an enter key, the operation keys enter a number into the appropriate register and the calculation is performed. For example, (1+2) × 3 could be calculated as: to give the result of (, or 9). The key performs a clear; pressing it sets the calculator to a state with zero in the internal registers. Pressing &quot;C&quot; followed by number keys then effectively adds the number entered to the zero and stores it internally to be worked on in subsequent calculations. If the key is pressed instead, the number is subtracted from zero, effectively entering a negative number.

All numbers are entered in scientific notation. After entering the mantissa part of the number, the &quot;E&quot; exponent key is pressed prior to entering the integer exponent of the number. The task of ordering the operations is placed on the user, and there are no bracket keys. The display shows only five digits, but six digits can be entered. As an example 12.3×(−123.4+123.456) could be entered as for a displayed result of (representing , or 0.68880).

Four constants are printed on the calculator case for easy reference. For converting to and from base 10 logarithms and natural logarithms, the natural logarithm of 10 (2.30259) and e (2.71828) are printed on the case. (3.14159) and 57.2958 (180 / ) are also on the case for trigonometry calculations. There was not enough internal memory to store these constants internally. Angles are computed using radians; degree values must be converted to radians by dividing by 57.2958. As an example, to calculate 25 sin (600×0.05°) one would enter to get a result of (representing 12.5 which is equal to 25 sin(30°) ). Sine is selected with the combination of the key followed by the key. The (down) and (up) arrow keys are function select keys. The four operation keys (, , and ) all have two other functions, activated by using one of the arrow keys. The functions available are sine, arcsine, cosine, arccosine, tangent, arctangent, logarithm and antilogarithm.

<doc id="133249" wikidata="Q174438" url="?curid=133249" title="Madeleine Albright">
<text>Madeleine Jana Korbel Albright (born Marie Jana Körbelová, later Korbelová; May 15, 1937 – March 23, 2022) was an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the 64th United States secretary of state under President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001. She was the first woman to hold the position.

Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Albright immigrated to the United States after the 1948 communist coup d&#x27;état when she was eleven years old. Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957. Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring. She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie from 1976 to 1978, before serving as a staff member on the National Security Council under Zbigniew Brzezinski. She served in that position until 1981 when President Jimmy Carter left office.

After leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of Georgetown University in 1982 and advised Democratic candidates regarding foreign policy. Following the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble President Bill Clinton&#x27;s National Security Council. She was appointed United States ambassador to the United Nations from 1993 to 1997, a position she held until her elevation as secretary of state. Secretary Albright served in that capacity until President Clinton left office in 2001.

Albright served as chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm, and was the Michael and Virginia Mortara Endowed Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in May 2012. Albright served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations.

== Early life and career ==
Albright was born Marie Jana Körbelová in 1937 in the Smíchov district of Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her parents were Josef Korbel, a Czech diplomat, and Anna Korbel (née Spieglová). At the time of Albright&#x27;s birth, Czechoslovakia had been independent for less than 20 years, having gained independence from Austria-Hungary after World War I. Her father was a supporter of Tomáš Masaryk and Edvard Beneš. Marie Jana had a younger sister Katherine and a younger brother John (these versions of their names are Anglicized).

When Marie Jana was born, her father was serving as a press-attaché at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgrade. The signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938—and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s troops—forced the family into exile because of their links with Beneš.

Josef and Anna converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941. Marie Jana and her siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith. In 1997, Albright said her parents never told her or her two siblings about their Jewish ancestry and heritage.

The family moved to Britain in May 1939. Here her father worked for Beneš&#x27;s Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Her family first lived on Kensington Park Road in Notting Hill, London—where they lived throughout the Blitz—but later moved to Beaconsfield, then Walton-on-Thames, on the outskirts of London. They kept a large metal table in the house, which was intended to shelter the family from the recurring threat of German air raids. While in England, Marie Jana was one of the children shown in a documentary film designed to promote sympathy for war refugees in London.

After the defeat of the Nazis in the European theatre of World War II and the collapse of Nazi Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Korbel family returned to Prague. Korbel was appointed as press attaché at the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Yugoslavia, and the family moved to Belgrade—then part of Yugoslavia—which was governed by the Communist Party. Korbel was concerned his daughter would be exposed to Marxism in a Yugoslav school, and so she was taught privately by a governess before being sent to the Prealpina Institut pour Jeunes Filles finishing school in Chexbres, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland. She learned to speak French while in Switzerland and changed her name from Marie Jana to Madeleine.

The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took over the government in 1948, with support from the Soviet Union. As an opponent of communism, Korbel was forced to resign from his position. He later obtained a position on a United Nations delegation to Kashmir. He sent his family to the United States, by way of London, to wait for him when he arrived to deliver his report to the UN Headquarters, then located in Lake Success, New York.

=== Youth and young adulthood in the United States ===
Korbel&#x27;s family emigrated from the United Kingdom on the SS &quot;America&quot;, departing Southampton on November 5, 1948, and arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor on November 11, 1948. The family initially settled in Great Neck on the North Shore of Long Island. Korbel applied for political asylum, arguing that as an opponent of Communism, he was under threat in Prague. Korbel stated &quot;I cannot, of course, return to the Communist Czechoslovakia as I would be arrested for my faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy. I would be most obliged to you if you could kindly convey to his Excellency the Secretary of State that I beg of him to be granted the right to stay in the United States, the same right to be given to my wife and three children.&quot;

With the help of Philip Moseley, a Russian language professor at Columbia University in New York City, Korbel obtained a position on the staff of the political science department at the University of Denver in Colorado. He became dean of the university&#x27;s school of international relations, and later taught future U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The school was named the Josef Korbel School of International Studies in 2008 in his honor.

Madeleine Korbel spent her teen years in Denver and in 1955 graduated from the Kent Denver School in Cherry Hills Village, a suburb of Denver. She founded the school&#x27;s international relations club and was its first president. She attended Wellesley College, in Wellesley, Massachusetts, on a full scholarship, majoring in political science, and graduated in 1959. The topic of her senior thesis was Zdeněk Fierlinger, a former Czechoslovakian prime minister. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1957, and joined the College Democrats of America.

While home in Denver from Wellesley, Korbel worked as an intern for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;. There she met Joseph Albright. He was the nephew of Alicia Patterson, owner of &quot;Newsday&quot; and wife of philanthropist Harry Frank Guggenheim. Korbel converted to the Episcopal Church at the time of her marriage. The couple were married in Wellesley in 1959, shortly after her graduation. They lived in Rolla, Missouri, while Joseph completed his military service at nearby Fort Leonard Wood. During this time, Albright worked at &quot;The Rolla Daily News&quot;.

The couple moved to Joseph&#x27;s hometown of Chicago, Illinois, in January 1960. Joseph worked at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; as a journalist, and Albright worked as a picture editor for &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The following year, Joseph Albright began work at &quot;Newsday&quot; in New York City, and the couple moved to Garden City on Long Island. That year, she gave birth to twin daughters, Alice Patterson Albright and Anne Korbel Albright. The twins were born six weeks premature and required a long hospital stay. As a distraction, Albright began Russian language classes at Hofstra University in the Village of Hempstead nearby.

In 1962, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where they lived in Georgetown. Albright studied international relations and continued in Russian at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, a division of Johns Hopkins University in the capital.

Joseph&#x27;s aunt Alicia Patterson died in 1963, and the Albrights returned to Long Island with the notion of Joseph taking over the family newspaper business. Albright gave birth to another daughter, Katharine Medill Albright, in 1967. She continued her studies at Columbia University&#x27;s Department of Public Law and Government. (It was later renamed as the political science department, and is located within the School of International and Public Affairs.) She earned a certificate in Russian from the Russian Institute (now Harriman Institute), an M.A. and a PhD, writing her master&#x27;s thesis on the Soviet diplomatic corps and her doctoral dissertation on the role of journalists in the Prague Spring of 1968. She also took a graduate course given by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later became her boss at the U.S. National Security Council.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Albright returned to Washington, D.C., in 1968, and commuted to Columbia for her doctor of philosophy, which she earned in 1975. She began fund-raising for her daughters&#x27; school, involvement which led to several positions on education boards. She was eventually invited to organize a fund-raising dinner for the 1972 presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ed Muskie of Maine. This association with Muskie led to a position as his chief legislative assistant in 1976. However, after the 1976 U.S. presidential election of Jimmy Carter, Albright&#x27;s former professor Brzezinski was named National Security Advisor, and recruited Albright from Muskie in 1978 to work in the West Wing as the National Security Council&#x27;s congressional liaison. Following Carter&#x27;s loss in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, Albright moved on to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where she was given a grant for a research project. She chose to write on the dissident journalists involved in Poland&#x27;s Solidarity movement, then in its infancy but gaining international attention. She traveled to Poland for her research, interviewing dissidents in Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Kraków. Upon her return to Washington, her husband announced his intention to divorce her so that he could pursue a relationship with another woman; the divorce was finalized in 1983.

Albright joined the academic staff at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1982, specializing in Eastern European studies. She also directed the university&#x27;s program on women in global politics. She served as a major Democratic Party foreign policy advisor, briefing vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 (both campaigns ended in defeat). In 1992, Bill Clinton returned the White House to the Democratic Party, and Albright was employed to handle the transition to a new administration at the National Security Council. In January 1993, Clinton nominated her to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, her first diplomatic posting.

=== U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations ===
Albright was appointed ambassador to the United Nations, a Cabinet-level position, shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993. During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the U.N. secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized as &quot;disengaged&quot; and &quot;neglect[ful]&quot; of genocide in Rwanda. Albright wrote: &quot;My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes.&quot;

In &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, Roméo Dallaire writes that in 1994, in Albright&#x27;s role as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N., she avoided describing the killings in Rwanda as &quot;genocide&quot; until overwhelmed by the evidence for it; this is now how she described these massacres in her memoirs. She was instructed to support a reduction or withdrawal (something which never happened) of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda but was later given more flexibility. Albright later remarked in PBS documentary &quot;Ghosts of Rwanda&quot; that &quot;it was a very, very difficult time, and the situation was unclear. You know, in retrospect, it all looks very clear. But when you were [there] at the time, it was unclear about what was happening in Rwanda.&quot;

Also in 1996, after Cuban military pilots shot down two small civilian aircraft flown by the Cuban-American exile group Brothers to the Rescue over international waters, she announced at a UN Security Council meeting debating a resolution condemning Cuba: &quot;Frankly, this is not cojones. This is cowardice.&quot; The line endeared her to President Clinton, who said it was &quot;probably the most effective one-liner in the whole administration&#x27;s foreign policy&quot;. When Albright appeared at a memorial service for the deceased in Miami on March 2, 1996, she was greeted with chants of &quot;libertad&quot;.

In 1996, Albright entered into a secret pact with Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and James Rubin to overthrow U.N. secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was running unopposed for a second term in the 1996 selection. After 15 U.S. peacekeepers died in a failed raid in Somalia in 1993, Boutros-Ghali became a political scapegoat in the United States. They dubbed the pact &quot;Operation Orient Express&quot; to reflect their hope that other nations would join the United States. Although every other member of the United Nations Security Council voted for Boutros-Ghali, the United States refused to yield to international pressure to drop its lone veto. After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy and became the only U.N. secretary-general ever to be denied a second term. The United States then fought a four-round veto duel with France, forcing it to back down and accept Kofi Annan as the next secretary-general. In his memoirs, Clarke said that &quot;the entire operation had strengthened Albright&#x27;s hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration&quot;.

=== Secretary of State ===
When Clinton began his second term in January 1997, following his re-election, he required a new Secretary of State, as incumbent Warren Christopher was retiring. The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy. Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction went for different candidates such as Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, and former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke. Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful. When Albright took office as the 64th U.S. Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S. Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government at the time of her appointment. Not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., she was not eligible as a U.S. presidential successor.

During her tenure, Albright considerably influenced American foreign policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Middle East. Following the Dayton Agreement, in which a cease-fire in the Bosnian War was reached, President Clinton committed to sending American troops to Bosnia to enforce the agreement, as strongly recommended by Albright. According to Albright&#x27;s memoirs, she once argued with Colin Powell for the use of military force by asking, &quot;What&#x27;s the point of you saving this superb military for, Colin, if we can&#x27;t use it?&quot; Albright strongly advocated for U.S. economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq.

As Secretary of State, she represented the U.S. at the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. She along with the British contingents boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of the Chinese-appointed Hong Kong Legislative Council, which replaced the elected one. In October 1997, she voiced her approval for national security exemptions to the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that NATO operations should not be limited by controls on greenhouse gas emissions, and hoped that other NATO members would also support the exemptions at the Third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan.
According to several accounts, Prudence Bushnell, U.S. ambassador to Kenya, repeatedly asked Washington for additional security at the embassy in Nairobi, including in a letter directly addressed to Albright in April 1998. Bushnell was ignored. She later stated that when she spoke to Albright about the letter, Albright told her that it had not been shown to her. In &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;, Richard Clarke writes about an exchange with Albright several months after the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in August 1998. &quot;What do you think will happen if you lose another embassy?&quot; Clarke asked. &quot;The Republicans in Congress will go after you.&quot; &quot;First of all, I didn&#x27;t lose these two embassies&quot;, Albright shot back. &quot;I inherited them in the shape they were.&quot;

In 1998, at the NATO summit, Albright articulated what became known as the &quot;three Ds&quot; of NATO, &quot;which is no diminution of NATO, no discrimination and no duplication – because I think that we don&#x27;t need any of those three &quot;Ds&quot; to happen&quot;.

In February 1998, Albright partook in a town-hall style meeting at St. John Arena in Columbus where she, William Cohen, and Sandy Berger attempted to make the case for military action in Iraq. The crowd was disruptive, repeatedly drowning out the discussion with boos and anti-war chants. James Rubin downplayed the disruptions, claiming the crowd was supportive of a war policy. Later that year, both Bill Clinton and Albright insisted that an attack on Saddam Hussein could be stopped only if Hussein reversed his decision to halt arms inspections.

In an interview on The Today Show, February 19, 1998, Albright said &quot;If we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future...&quot; 

Albright became one of the highest level Western diplomats ever to meet Kim Jong-il, the then-leader of communist North Korea, during an official state visit to that country in 2000.

On January 8, 2001, in one of her last acts as Secretary of State, Albright made a farewell call to Kofi Annan and said that the U.S. would continue to press Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition of lifting economic sanctions, even after the end of the Clinton administration on January 20, 2001.

Albright received the U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards Foundation, in 2001.

=== Post-Clinton administration ===
Following Albright&#x27;s term as Secretary of State, Czech president Václav Havel spoke openly about the possibility of Albright succeeding him. Albright was reportedly flattered, but denied ever seriously considering the possibility of running for office in her country of origin.

Albright was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. Also that year, Albright founded the Albright Group, an international strategy consulting firm based in Washington, D.C., that later become the Albright Stonebridge Group. Affiliated with the firm is Albright Capital Management, which was founded in 2005 to engage in private fund management related to emerging markets.

Albright accepted a position on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2003. In 2005, she declined to run for re-election to the board in the aftermath of the Richard Grasso compensation scandal, in which Grasso, the chairman of the NYSE board of directors, had been granted $187.5 million in compensation, with little governance by the board on which Albright sat. During the tenure of the interim chairman, John S. Reed, Albright served as chairwoman of the NYSE board&#x27;s nominating and governance committee. Shortly after the appointment of the NYSE board&#x27;s permanent chairman in 2005, Albright submitted her resignation. According to &quot;PolitiFact&quot;, Albright opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although after the U.S. was committed to the war, she said she would support the President.

Albright served on the board of directors for the Council on Foreign Relations and on the International Advisory Committee of the Brookings Doha Center. As of 2016, she was the Mortara Distinguished Professor of Diplomacy at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C. Albright served as chairperson of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and as president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation. She was also the co-chair of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor and was the chairwoman of the Council of Women World Leaders &quot;Women&#x27;s Ministerial Initiative&quot; up until November 16, 2007, when she was succeeded by Margot Wallström.

Albright guest starred on the television drama &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as herself on October 25, 2005.
She also made a guest appearance on &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, in the eighth episode of the seventh season.

At the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 2007, Albright declared that she and William Cohen would co-chair a new Genocide Prevention Task Force created by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the American Academy of Diplomacy, and the United States Institute of Peace. Their appointment was criticized by Harut Sassounian and the Armenian National Committee of America, as both Albright and Cohen had spoken against a Congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide.

Albright endorsed and supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign. Albright was a close friend of Clinton and served as an informal advisor on foreign policy matters. On December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama nominated then-Senator Clinton for Albright&#x27;s former post of Secretary of State.

During this period, she also served as a business consultant and brand ambassador for Herbalife, a global multi-level marketing (MLM) corporation that develops and sells dietary supplements. The company is alleged to be a fraudulent pyramid scheme.

In September 2009, Albright opened an exhibition of her personal jewelry collection at the Museum of Art and Design in New York City, which ran until January 2010. In 2009, Albright also published the book &quot;Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat&#x27;s Jewel Box&quot; about her pins.

In August 2012, when speaking at an Obama campaign event in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, Albright was asked the question &quot;How long will you blame that previous administration for all of your problems?&quot;, to which she replied &quot;Forever&quot;. In October 2012, Albright appeared in a video on the official Twitter feed for the Democratic Party, responding to then-GOP candidate Mitt Romney&#x27;s assertion that Russia was the &quot;number-one geopolitical foe&quot; of the United States. According to Albright, Romney&#x27;s statement was proof that he had &quot;little understanding of what was actually going on in the 21st Century [and] he is not up to date and that is a very dangerous aspect [of his candidacy]&quot;.

Albright described Donald Trump as &quot;the most un-American, anti-democratic leader&quot; in U.S. history. She also criticized the Trump administration for its delay in filling some diplomatic posts as a sign of &quot;disdain for diplomacy&quot;.

After 2016, Albright served as chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm, and chair of the advisory council for The Hague Institute for Global Justice, which was founded in 2011 in The Hague. She also served as an Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project (WJP). The WJP works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the rule of law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

=== Investments ===
Albright was a co-investor with Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and George Soros in a $350 million investment vehicle called Helios Towers Africa, which intends to buy or build thousands of mobile phone towers in Africa.

== Controversies ==
=== Sanctions against Iraq ===

During the 1990s and 2000s, many surveys and studies concluded that excess deaths in Iraq—specifically among children under the age of 5—greatly increased after the implementation of sanctions against Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. On the other hand, several later surveys conducted during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq (2003–2011) &quot;all put the U5MR in Iraq during 1995–2000 in the vicinity of 40 per 1000,&quot; suggesting that &quot;there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions.&quot;

On May 12, 1996, then-ambassador Albright defended the sanctions on a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment in which Lesley Stahl asked her, &quot;We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that&#x27;s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?&quot; and Albright replied, &quot;We think the price is worth it.&quot; The segment won an Emmy Award. Albright later criticized Stahl&#x27;s segment as &quot;amount[ing] to Iraqi propaganda&quot;, saying that her question was a loaded question. She wrote, &quot;I had fallen into a trap and said something I did not mean&quot;, and that she regretted coming &quot;across as cold-blooded and cruel&quot;. She apologized for her remarks in a 2020 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calling them &quot;totally stupid&quot;. Albright addressed the controversy in her 2020 memoir, acknowledging that her answer was &quot;a mistake&quot; and &quot;that UN sanctions contributed to hardships in Iraq,&quot; but also noting that &quot;the producers of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; were duped. Subsequent research has shown that Iraqi propagandists deceived international observers,&quot; citing a 2017 article in &quot;The BMJ&quot;.

=== Art ownership lawsuit ===
Following &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s profile of Albright by Michael Dobbs, an Austrian man named Philipp Harmer launched legal action against Albright, claiming her father had illegally taken possession of artwork that belonged to his great-grandfather, Karl Nebrich. Nebrich, a German-speaking Prague industrialist, abandoned some of the possessions in his apartment when ethnic Germans were expelled from the country after World War II under the Beneš decrees. His apartment, at 11 Hradčanská Street in Prague, was subsequently given to Korbel and his family. Harmer alleged that Korbel stole his great-grandfather&#x27;s artwork. Counsel for Albright&#x27;s family stated that Harmer&#x27;s claim was unfounded.

=== Allegations of hate speech against Serbs and war profiteering ===
In late October 2012, during a book signing in the Prague bookstore Palác Knih Luxor, Albright was visited by a group of activists from the Czech organization Přátelé Srbů na Kosovu (Friends of Serbs in Kosovo). She was filmed saying, &quot;Disgusting Serbs, get out!&quot; to the Czech group, which had brought war photos to the signing, some of which showed Serbian victims of the Kosovo War in 1999. The protesters were expelled from the event when police arrived. Two videos of the incident were later posted by the group on their YouTube channel. Filmmaker Emir Kusturica expressed thanks to Czech director Václav Dvořák for organizing and participating in the demonstration. Together with other protesters, Dvořák also reported Albright to the police, stating that she was spreading ethnic hatred and disrespect to the victims of the war.

Albright&#x27;s involvement in the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia was the main cause of the demonstration – a sensitive topic which became even more controversial when it was revealed that in 2012 her investment firm, Albright Capital Management, was preparing to bid in the proposed privatization of Kosovo&#x27;s state-owned telecom and postal company, Post and Telecom of Kosovo. In an article published by the New York City-based magazine &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, it was estimated that the deal could be as large as €600 million. Serbia opposed the sale, and intended to file a lawsuit to block it, alleging that the rights of former Serbian employees were not respected. The bid never happened and was withdrawn by her investment fund.

=== Hillary Clinton campaign comment ===
Albright supported Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. While introducing Clinton at a campaign event in New Hampshire ahead of that state&#x27;s primary, Albright said, &quot;There&#x27;s a special place in hell for women who don&#x27;t help each other&quot; (a phrase Albright had used on several previous occasions in other contexts). The remark was seen as a rebuke of younger women who supported Clinton&#x27;s primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, which many women found &quot;startling and offensive&quot;. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed published several days after the remark, Albright said: &quot;I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender.&quot;

== Honorary degrees and awards ==
Albright held honorary degrees from Brandeis University (1996), Mount Holyoke College (1997), the University of Washington (2002), Smith College (2003), Washington University in St. Louis (2003), University of Winnipeg (2005), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2007), Knox College (2008), Bowdoin College (2013),
Dickinson College (2014), and Tufts University (2015).

Ellenbogen Citizenship Award presented by the Prague Society for International Cooperation. In March 2000 Albright received an Honorary Silver Medal of Jan Masaryk at a ceremony in Prague sponsored by the Bohemian Foundation and the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2006, she was named by Carnegie Corporation to the inaugural class of winners of the Great Immigrants Award.
In 2010, she was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2020, Albright was named by Time magazine among the world&#x27;s 100 powerful women who defined the last century.

Albright was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.

== Personal life ==
Albright married Joseph Albright in 1959. The couple had three daughters before divorcing in 1982. She had been raised Catholic, but converted to the Episcopal Church upon her marriage in 1959. Her parents had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941, during her early childhood, after fleeing Czechoslovakia for England in 1939, to avoid anti-Jewish persecution before they immigrated to the U.S. They never discussed their Jewish ancestry with her later.

When &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on Albright&#x27;s Jewish ancestry shortly after she had become Secretary of State in 1997, Albright said that the report was a &quot;major surprise&quot;. Albright said that she did not learn until age 59 that both her parents were born and raised in Jewish families. As many as a dozen of her relatives in Czechoslovakia—including three of her grandparents—had been murdered in the Holocaust.

In addition to English, Russian, and Czech, Albright spoke French, German, Polish, and Serbo-Croatian. She also understood spoken Slovak.

Albright mentioned her physical fitness and exercise regimen in several interviews. In 2006, she said she was capable of leg pressing . Albright was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013.

===Death and funeral===

Albright died from cancer in Washington, D.C., on March 23, 2022, at the age of 84. Many political figures paid tribute to her, including U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and former British prime minister Tony Blair.

Her funeral, held at Washington National Cathedral on April 27, was attended by President Joe Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former vice president Al Gore, and former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, as well as presidents Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia
and Vjosa Osmani of Kosovo. She was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown, Washington, DC.
