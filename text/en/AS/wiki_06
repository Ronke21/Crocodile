<text>Westville is a town in Franklin County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,819. Westville is on the northern border of the county, northwest of Malone.

== History ==


The area was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1800. The town of Westville was formed from the town of Constable in 1829. The community has always been chiefly a farming community, with rich clay soils in the north and sandy soils in the southern part of the town. The Salmon River meanders through the township and was important to its early industry and its agriculture. In the 19th century, Westville was largely settled by Scottish and English people who had migrated from Vermont and other parts of New England. The only churches in the community were Protestant, the Presbyterian Church at Westville Corners and Methodist-Episcopal at Westville Center.

Around the time of the Civil War, there was an influx of French Canadians into northern New York, and some took up farming in the community. In the 19th century and early 20th century, there were several small industries in the community, a gristmill, a butter factory, a starch factory, and several sawmills. Most of these industries were located on the Salmon River. Over time, the industries disappeared and left only farming as the stable economic activity, as it is today.

<text>Gloversville is a city in the Mohawk Valley region of Upstate New York, United States. The most populous city in Fulton County, it was once the hub of the United States&#x27; glovemaking industry, with over 200 manufacturers there and the adjacent city of Johnstown. In 2020, Gloversville had a population of 15,131.

==History==
Settlers of European descent came to the Gloversville area as early as 1752.

The region, historically known as &quot;Kingsborough&quot;, was acquired by Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, who established tremendous influence with the Native Americans of the area, which translated into control of the Mohawk Valley region. It was due to Johnson where the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy remained allied with England during the French and Indian War. In reward, Johnson was granted the Kingsborough Tract, a large parcel of land which was settled by Scottish Highlanders. Some of the Highlanders were so loyal to Johnson that after the Revolutionary War, they followed his son to Canada.

In 1752, Arent Stevens purchased land in the area. Puritans from New England settled there at the end of the 18th century, utilizing the houses and cleared land that had been left behind when the Highlanders emigrated. By 1803, according to Rev. Elisha Yale, the population of Kingsborough consisted of &quot;233 families and about 1,400 souls. Of the families, 191 are of English descent, twenty-three Scotch, fourteen Dutch, and five Irish.&quot;

In 1852 Gloversville had a population of 1,318 living on 525 acres in 250 small wood-frame houses centered on the &quot;Four Corners&quot; formed by the intersection of Main and Fulton Streets. The proximity of hemlock forests to supply bark for tanning made the community a center of leather production early in its history: there were already 40 small glove and mitten factories there by 1852. The city would become the center of the American glovemaking industry for many years. From 1890 to 1950, 90% of all gloves sold in the United States were made in Gloversville.

Upon the establishment of a United States post office in 1828, &quot;Gloversville&quot; became the official name of the community. Prior to that Gloversville had been known as &quot;Stump City&quot; because of the large number of trees that had been cut down. In 1853, Gloversville incorporated as a village, and then in 1890 as a city. The city grew rapidly, and the population swelled from 4,000 in 1877 to 13,864 in 1890.

Glove-making operations had gradually changed from being home-based to being factory-based, and large tanneries and glove shops employed nearly 80% of the residents of Gloversville area. Home workers sewed the gloves from leather which had been cut in factories. Related businesses, such as box makers, sewing machine repairmen, and thread dealers opened to serve the industry.

Until 1936, Gloversville had a very active electric interurban line, the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad. It ran from Gloversville, through Johnstown, along the Mohawk River to Amsterdam, then to Scotia, then across the Mohawk River, and into downtown Schenectady to the New York Central station. In 1932, in a bold move during the Great Depression it acquired unique bullet cars in an attempt to revive the economy. Freight operation continued through this era. Gloversville also became the main headquarters for the Schine movie industry in the mid-20th century.

From the 1950s onwards, the decline of the glove industry left the city more and more deindustrialized and financially depressed, with many downtown storefronts abandoned and store windows covered with plywood. Many houses were abandoned when some people moved out of town to find jobs elsewhere. The city&#x27;s population peaked at 23,634 in 1950 and had since fallen to 15,665 people in 2010. In 2018, redevelopment plans of downtown Gloversville were revealed. In 2019, Mayor Vincent DeSantis (D) proposed economic revitalization plans. On June 5, 2020, the Regan Development Corporation, based in Ardsley, New York, proposed plans to develop a new commercial space and apartment complex for the city. The city, along with the Fulton County Center for Regional Growth, also began expanding digital marketing to attract new residents and businesses from throughout New York State in efforts to diversify.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water. New York State Route 29A (Fulton Street) is an east–west road through the city. New York State Route 30A is a north–south highway along the eastern edge of the city, leading south into Johnstown and northeast to Mayfield at the southwestern end of Great Sacandaga Lake. Another north–south highway, New York State Route 309 (Bleecker Street), has its southern terminus at NY-29A in the center of Gloversville.

Cayadutta Creek, a tributary of the Mohawk River, flows southward through the city.

The city sits in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains and therefore is within a climatic transition zone. Gloversville experiences the warmer summer temperatures common throughout the Capital Region, Hudson Valley, and Mohawk Valley while experiencing generally more copious precipitation throughout the year than the Capital Region. This manifests in commonplace rolling thunderstorms throughout the summer months and snowfall amounts more akin to the lake-pocked higher elevations of the Adirondacks in the winter months.

<text>In linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. Formally,

Because equal matrices have equal dimensions, only square matrices can be symmetric.

The entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. So if formula_1 denotes the entry in the formula_2th row and formula_3th column then

for all indices formula_2 and formula_5

Every square diagonal matrix is symmetric, since all off-diagonal elements are zero. Similarly in characteristic different from 2, each diagonal element of a skew-symmetric matrix must be zero, since each is its own negative.

In linear algebra, a real symmetric matrix represents a self-adjoint operator represented in an orthonormal basis over a real inner product space. The corresponding object for a complex inner product space is a Hermitian matrix with complex-valued entries, which is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, in linear algebra over the complex numbers, it is often assumed that a symmetric matrix refers to one which has real-valued entries. Symmetric matrices appear naturally in a variety of applications, and typical numerical linear algebra software makes special accommodations for them.

== Example ==
The following formula_6 matrix is symmetric:
formula_7
Since formula_8.

== Properties ==
===Basic properties===
* The sum and difference of two symmetric matrices is symmetric.
* This is not always true for the product: given symmetric matrices formula_9 and formula_10, then formula_11 is symmetric if and only if formula_9 and formula_10 commute, i.e., if formula_14.
* For any integer formula_15, formula_16 is symmetric if formula_9 is symmetric.
* If formula_18 exists, it is symmetric if and only if formula_9 is symmetric.
* Rank of a symmetric matrix formula_9 is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues of formula_9.

===Decomposition into symmetric and skew-symmetric===
Any square matrix can uniquely be written as sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix. This decomposition is known as the Toeplitz decomposition. Let formula_22 denote the space of formula_23 matrices. If formula_24 denotes the space of formula_23 symmetric matrices and formula_26 the space of formula_23 skew-symmetric matrices then formula_28 and formula_29, i.e.
formula_30
where formula_31 denotes the direct sum. Let formula_32 then
formula_33

Notice that formula_34 and formula_35. This is true for every square matrix formula_36 with entries from any field whose characteristic is different from 2.

A symmetric formula_23 matrix is determined by formula_38 scalars (the number of entries on or above the main diagonal). Similarly, a skew-symmetric matrix is determined by formula_39 scalars (the number of entries above the main diagonal).

=== Matrix congruent to a symmetric matrix ===
Any matrix congruent to a symmetric matrix is again symmetric: if formula_36 is a symmetric matrix, then so is formula_41 for any matrix formula_9.

=== Symmetry implies normality ===
A (real-valued) symmetric matrix is necessarily a normal matrix.

=== Real symmetric matrices ===

Denote by formula_43 the standard inner product on formula_44. The real formula_23 matrix formula_9 is symmetric if and only if
formula_47

Since this definition is independent of the choice of basis, symmetry is a property that depends only on the linear operator A and a choice of inner product. This characterization of symmetry is useful, for example, in differential geometry, for each tangent space to a manifold may be endowed with an inner product, giving rise to what is called a Riemannian manifold. Another area where this formulation is used is in Hilbert spaces.

The finite-dimensional spectral theorem says that any symmetric matrix whose entries are real can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. More explicitly: For every real symmetric matrix formula_9 there exists a real orthogonal matrix formula_49 such that formula_50 is a diagonal matrix. Every real symmetric matrix is thus, up to choice of an orthonormal basis, a diagonal matrix.

If formula_9 and formula_10 are formula_23 real symmetric matrices that commute, then they can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix: there exists a basis of formula_44 such that every element of the basis is an eigenvector for both formula_9 and formula_10.

Every real symmetric matrix is Hermitian, and therefore all its eigenvalues are real. (In fact, the eigenvalues are the entries in the diagonal matrix formula_57 (above), and therefore formula_57 is uniquely determined by formula_9 up to the order of its entries.) Essentially, the property of being symmetric for real matrices corresponds to the property of being Hermitian for complex matrices.

=== Complex symmetric matrices ===
A complex symmetric matrix can be &#x27;diagonalized&#x27; using a unitary matrix: thus if formula_9 is a complex symmetric matrix, there is a unitary matrix formula_61 such that formula_62 is a real diagonal matrix with non-negative entries. This result is referred to as the Autonne–Takagi factorization. It was originally proved by Léon Autonne (1915) and Teiji Takagi (1925) and rediscovered with different proofs by several other mathematicians. In fact, the matrix formula_63 is Hermitian and positive semi-definite, so there is a unitary matrix formula_64 such that formula_65 is diagonal with non-negative real entries. Thus formula_66 is complex symmetric with formula_67 real. Writing formula_68 with formula_36 and formula_70 real symmetric matrices, formula_71. Thus formula_72. Since formula_36 and formula_70 commute, there is a real orthogonal matrix formula_75 such that both formula_76 and formula_77 are diagonal. Setting formula_78 (a unitary matrix), the matrix formula_79 is complex diagonal. Pre-multiplying formula_61 by a suitable diagonal unitary matrix (which preserves unitarity of formula_61), the diagonal entries of formula_79 can be made to be real and non-negative as desired. To construct this matrix, we express the diagonal matrix as formula_83. The matrix we seek is simply given by formula_84. Clearly formula_85 as desired, so we make the modification formula_86. Since their squares are the eigenvalues of formula_87, they coincide with the singular values of formula_9. (Note, about the eigen-decomposition of a complex symmetric matrix formula_9, the Jordan normal form of formula_9 may not be diagonal, therefore formula_9 may not be diagonalized by any similarity transformation.)

== Decomposition ==
Using the Jordan normal form, one can prove that every square real matrix can be written as a product of two real symmetric matrices, and every square complex matrix can be written as a product of two complex symmetric matrices.

Every real non-singular matrix can be uniquely factored as the product of an orthogonal matrix and a symmetric positive definite matrix, which is called a polar decomposition. Singular matrices can also be factored, but not uniquely.

Cholesky decomposition states that every real positive-definite symmetric matrix formula_9 is a product of a lower-triangular matrix formula_93 and its transpose,
formula_94

If the matrix is symmetric indefinite, it may be still decomposed as formula_95 where formula_96 is a permutation matrix (arising from the need to pivot), formula_93 a lower unit triangular matrix, and formula_57 is a direct sum of symmetric formula_99 and formula_100 blocks, which is called Bunch–Kaufman decomposition 

A general (complex) symmetric matrix may be defective and thus not be diagonalizable. If formula_9 is diagonalizable it may be decomposed as
formula_102
where formula_49 is an orthogonal matrix formula_104, and formula_105 is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of formula_9. In the special case that formula_9 is real symmetric, then formula_49 and formula_105 are also real. To see orthogonality, suppose formula_110 and formula_111 are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues formula_112, formula_113. Then
formula_114

Since formula_112 and formula_113 are distinct, we have formula_117.

== Hessian ==
Symmetric formula_23 matrices of real functions appear as the Hessians of twice differentiable functions of formula_15 real variables (the continuity of the second derivative is not needed, despite common belief to the opposite). 

Every quadratic form formula_120 on formula_44 can be uniquely written in the form formula_122 with a symmetric formula_23 matrix formula_9. Because of the above spectral theorem, one can then say that every quadratic form, up to the choice of an orthonormal basis of formula_125, &quot;looks like&quot;
formula_126
with real numbers formula_127. This considerably simplifies the study of quadratic forms, as well as the study of the level sets formula_128 which are generalizations of conic sections.

This is important partly because the second-order behavior of every smooth multi-variable function is described by the quadratic form belonging to the function&#x27;s Hessian; this is a consequence of Taylor&#x27;s theorem.

== Symmetrizable matrix ==
An formula_23 matrix formula_9 is said to be symmetrizable if there exists an invertible diagonal matrix formula_57 and symmetric matrix formula_132 such that formula_133

The transpose of a symmetrizable matrix is symmetrizable, since formula_134 and formula_135 is symmetric. A matrix formula_136 is symmetrizable if and only if the following conditions are met:
# formula_137 implies formula_138 for all formula_139
# formula_140 for any finite sequence formula_141

<text>Northville is a village in the northern part of the town of Northampton in Fulton County, New York, United States, northeast of Gloversville. The population was 993 at the 2020 census. It lies within Adirondack Park and serves as the southern terminus for the Northville-Placid Trail.

==History==
The site of the village was first settled around 1786, but areas south of the village were settled around 1762. The village was once on high ground between the Sacandaga River and Hunters Creek. When the river was dammed in 1930 to form the Sacandaga Reservoir, now called Great Sacandaga Lake, the river valley became an arm of the lake. The village now lies on a peninsula surrounded by the lake, with three bridges connecting it on the west, east and south. The arm of the Great Sacandaga Lake to the east is known locally as Northville Lake or the &quot;Little Lake&quot;.

Main Street was surveyed and laid out in 1797, and the first store was opened there in 1800, and other stores followed soon thereafter. The population, however, grew slowly: by 1807 there were only seven families living on Main Street. The first brick building in the settlement was constructed in 1819.

A post office was opened in 1824 and in 1827 adopted the name &quot;Northville.&quot; By 1835 Northville had become a regional financial center, and began to attract fishermen, hunters and tourists around 1850. A map published in 1868 showed that the village was mainly concentrated on Main Street, although there was a residential development on Bridge and First Streets, and a cluster of industrial buildings on Mechanic Street. Second, Third, Fourth, Centre and Grove Streets had been laid out but were largely empty.

The village was incorporated in 1873, within the town of Northampton. At that time the lumber industry, with its associated milling, cooperage, tanning and woodenware industries, has created a boomtown in Northville and in the hamlet of Sacandaga Park, across the Sacandage River. There were hotels and entertainment halls, and the area was connected by railroad when the Gloversville and Northville (G&amp;N) was completed in 1875 Three years later, the village&#x27;s population had reached 1,000.

In the late 19th century, The development of the Sacandaga Park resort by the Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville (FJ&amp;G) nearby Northville helped Northville&#x27;s economy grow, as tourists flocked to the &quot;Coney Island of the North&quot;. Hotels were built and the FJ&amp;G built a new railroad station on River Street. Guests of the park would use the train service to take day trips to Northville. Businesses and industry also grow, and the village&#x27;s population had almost doubled by 1880. Hunter&#x27;s Creek was dammed to create a reservoir and watermains were installed on the main streets, becoming available to the public in 1891, and the village&#x27;s first bank opened in 1895.

Northville continued to grow and prosper into the early 20th century. Development spread into streets that had been empty, new streets were laid out, and the population continued to grow.

The Conklingville Dam, built to control flooding on the Hudson River, of which the Sacandaga River was a tributary, was finished on March 27, 1929, bringing about the creation of the Great Sacandaga Lake. The lake came to the edge of the village, while other nearby locations, like Sacandaga Park, were fully or partially flooded. The village became a peninsula, and was now further away from connecting roads, but the reservoir did not fundamentally change the physical character of the village. The timing was unfortunate, coming as it did at the beginning of the Great Depression, and the village struggled to recover its economy in its new isolated condition. The growth of new kinds of tourism helped, as did a new emphasis on the history of the village.

The Northville Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.89%, is water.

The village is located at 43°13.5′N 74°10.5′W in the Adirondack Park on a northern extension of the Great Sacandaga Lake. The Sacandaga River enters the lake to the west of the village. The river and lake are part of the Hudson River watershed.

The village is just east of New York State Route 30, connected to the highway by a bridge over the Sacandaga River, and is also served by County Roads 143, 149, and 153. Route 30 leads north to Speculator in the Adirondacks and Route 30 leads south to Route 30A, to the village of Fonda on the Mohawk River.

<text>Ashland is a town in Greene County, New York, United States. The population was 682 in the 2020 US census, down from 784 in the 2010 census. Ashland is in the northwestern part of the county.

== History ==
Early settlements were abandoned during the American Revolution, but the town was re-settled in 1788. The town was created from parts of the towns of Windham and Prattsville in 1848.

When the town was still part of Windham, it was called Scienceville due to there being &quot;some families of more than ordinary education&quot; in the area. When Scienceville became a separate community in 1848, it was renamed Ashland after the estate of Henry Clay.

The presence of hemlock forests led to a tanning industry. Hemlock bark was an important raw material used for leather tanning, due to it being a good source of tannic acid.

However, Ashland suffered a recession in the early 1850s when its tanning industry collapsed after the community exhausted its supply of hemlock bark. Around the same time, the cotton and wool mills lost business due to being located inland, resulting in expensive transportation rates.

In 1890, the population was 560.

A local YMCA was opened on March 29, 1895, but closed due to a lack of support in 1901.

<text>Durham is a town in Greene County, New York, United States. The population was 2,627 at the 2020 census. 

== History ==

The land that would become the town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1755 within Albany County. The town was established from part of the town of Coxsackie in 1790 as the &quot;Town of Freehold&quot;. In the spring of 1800, Freehold became part of the newly formed Greene County. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Durham&quot; in 1805, the town having been called informally &quot;New Durham&quot; by the many settlers from Connecticut.

Part of the town was lost in 1803 to form the new towns of Cairo, Greenville, and Windham. In 1836, the western part of Durham became the town of Conesville in Schoharie County.

The first documented visit to the Durham area was by Eliab Youmans, who had been commissioned to survey the Maitland patents in 1767. Undoubtedly, explorers, hunters, and trappers preceded Youmans, but their travels were unrecorded. The patents were the first official parceling out of the largely unclaimed land and were the precursors to settlement. Eight patents have been identified for lands that were in, or partly in, the town of Durham.

Historically, the Maitland Patent is the one most often cited, despite the fact that it was not one of the first grants. The grant, which was the first to lie exclusively in the future town of Durham, is historically significant as being the location for land described in the first known recorded lease in Durham and thus contains the first documentation for the initial settlement of the town. This patent of was made to Colonel Richard Maitland, a British army officer of Scottish birth. The patent encompassed land that now includes the Oak Hill area, as well as surrounding farmland leased by the earliest settlers. The first known lease was to Lucas DeWitt, dated May 3, 1774, for property in &quot;DeWittsburg&quot;. The language of that lease suggests an occupation of the land by the earlier settlers, perhaps by 1771. In the early nineteenth century, Oak Hill matured into a vigorous industrial hamlet with highly productive mills and many fashionable homes.

The establishment of the first settlement in Durham is credited to three men: Lucas DeWitt, John Plank, and Hendrick Plank. These pioneers established homes at what was then called DeWittsburg, now Oak Hill. The American Revolution forced the pioneers to temporarily abandon their homes until the end of the war. Hendrick Plank was abducted by the Native Americans and removed to Canada, where he died in captivity. The two remaining pioneers and Hendrick&#x27;s widow, who remarried to Leonard Patrie, all returned by approximately 1782 to reestablish their homes. DeWitt brought with him a small hand mill for grinding grain and was, in one respect, the first miller in the town, as well as being a farmer.

The town of Halcott is basically the valley of Vly Creek, and ringed by mountains on three sides. Most access to the town is from the south, via the Delaware County village of Fleischmanns.

The pass between Bearpen and neighboring Vly Mountain is traversed by Halcott Mountain Road, an unimproved county highway which reaches at the col, making it the highest elevation free public through road in New York State. It is also the only route between Halcott and the rest of Greene County. Like Hardenburgh in nearby Ulster County, to reach the rest of the county via a paved road one must leave and go through a portion of either Ulster or Delaware counties.

Due to this geographic isolation, Halcott is the only place in Greene County whose telephones are in the 845 area code.

A small bridge was destroyed, and numerous houses were also washed away by the creek. Farms near the creek were flooded as well. Flash flooding also was an issue. Certain roads that run through the town were flooded and some were damaged. Many homes in Lexington lost power.

<text>Palenville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Greene County, New York, United States. The population was 1,002 at the 2020 census.

Palenville is in the southwestern part of the town of Catskill, located at the junction of Routes 23A and 32A. It lies at the foot of Kaaterskill Clove, at the base of the Catskill Mountains. Kaaterskill Creek, exiting the Clove, runs through the town, and was spanned by a swinging footbridge, destroyed during Tropical Storm Irene. The creek provides a number of swimming holes in the summer months, and the Long Path runs through the town.

==History==
Palenville takes its name from the Palen family, who built and operated tanneries throughout the Catskills starting the 1820s. The tannery era was short. When the local supply of hemlock bark was exhausted, the tannery closed, leaving Palenville to reinvent itself.
With many waterfalls and natural vistas nearby, Palenville was an important center of the Hudson River School of painting during the 19th century. Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, and other notable painters stayed and worked in Palenville during the height of the movement. The famous painting &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; depicts Cole and William Cullen Bryant near Kaaterskill Falls, just uphill from the town. The famous Catskill Mountain House was also located just outside Palenville. Palenville was the fictional home of Rip Van Winkle (the subject of a short story by Washington Irving).

Palenville historically was described as the &quot;First Art Colony in America&quot; Dr. Roland Van Zandt, in &quot;The Catskill Mountain House&quot;.

With the coming of the twentieth century, the large boarding houses of the mountain top started to close, but Palenville and the surroundings were often visited by city dwellers. Palenville was one of the Catskills&#x27; vacation resorts, hosting nearly two dozen small and medium-sized boarding houses and many hotels at the turn of the century. Palenville, Kaaterskill Creek, and Kaaterskill Clove have been subjects for several painters, including those listed above.

Late in the 20th century an art gallery opened on Palenville&#x27;s Main Street, and the Pine Orchard Summer Festival was founded. Opening in 1980 and hosting its first national juried show in 1981, the privately owned and funded Terrance Gallery exhibited more than 1,200 American artists, in a call to revisit the historic gathering place of the 19th-century painters. The Pine Orchard, located on along the Manorville Road, through fundraising and grants refurbished a chapel into a theater and hosted opera, plays, musicians, writers and artists. Shakespeare and the Circus arts were presented there by the Bond Street Theater group.
Mary Pickford made several movies in Palenville. Robert Goss of the group &quot;Dripping Goss&quot; (American Gothic Records) had a single that sold well in Europe in the 1990s, some of which were recorded at the Turning Mill Studio in Palenville.

The Terrance Gallery and the Pine Orchard festivals have closed, but the Palenville Library and the Woodbine Inn are still open.

Palenville was featured on the Endless Thread podcast.

Other noted artists who frequented Palenville and the Clove included Winslow Homer, Asher B. Durand, Thomas Addison Richards, John Frederick Kensett and Sanford R. Gifford. Landscape painters of the 20th century included Albert Handel, Barry Hopkins, Athena Billias, Michelle Moran and Patti Ferrara. George H. Hall, who was a genre painter, took up residence in Palenville towards the end of the 19th century; and Terrance J. DePietro, an abstract painter, who was early on influenced by the Hudson River School, maintained residence and a studio from the latter part of the 20th century into the 21st. He brought artists from Quebec, Canada, including Nicole Lemelin and Remi LaRoche.

<text>Prattsville is a town in Greene County, New York, United States. The town is in the northwestern part of the county. As of the 2020 census, the population was 774.

== History ==
The area of the town was first settled around 1763, and the region was then called &quot;Schoharie Kill&quot;. An attempt during the American Revolution by the British and their Loyalist allies to drive the settlers out was thwarted when they were defeated by the settlers.

Prattsville was established in 1824 from the town of Windham. Some of the town was lost to form the town of Ashland in 1848.

Prattsville was later named after Zadock Pratt, a congressman and prominent citizen. Pratt built a tannery larger than any other in the world at the time, helping it become a major town in upstate New York. His life is depicted through a series of stone carvings called Pratt Rock which he commissioned during his lifetime.

The 1830 population of the town was 830. When Pratt built his tannery, it created a vast number of jobs, and the population grew to 1,989 by 1850. However, by 1845 all of the hemlock bark had been non-sustainably extracted from the forests for around, and Pratt was forced to close the tannery. No Hemlock re-plantings had been undertaken by Pratt. The jobs that were lost could not be replaced, and the town&#x27;s population dwindled to 1,314 by 1875. The Old Episcopal Manse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, and the John and Martinus Laraway Inn was added in 2012.

On August 28, 2011, Hurricane Irene caused record flooding in the town by Schoharie Creek, causing major damage and destroying large areas of the town. Every structure on the strip that comprises Main Street was partly or fully destroyed, including all 22 of the town&#x27;s businesses. Eleven houses collapsed in the flood, fifteen were condemned and torn down, and more than 100 homes were so damaged that the residents couldn&#x27;t return to them, but there were no fatalities. It received widespread national news coverage because the town had nearly been washed away. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo labeled Prattsville as the place in New York State hardest hit by the storm.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.51%, is water.

The town is in the Catskill Mountains. The northern town line is the border of Schoharie County, and the western town line is the border of Delaware County.

Schoharie Creek, a tributary of the Mohawk River, flows northward through the town past the hamlet of Prattsville.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 665 people, 253 households, and 182 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 406 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Tannersville is a village in Greene County, New York, United States. The village is in the north-central part of the town of Hunter on Route 23A. The population was 568 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The village was founded around lumber mills and tanneries. It was incorporated in 1895.

Tannersville&#x27;s tanning business collapsed in the mid-19th century. It was gradually replaced by the summer resort trade, which reached its peak in 1882 when the railroad came to Tannersville. However, the rise of the automobile in the early 20th century led to a steady economic decline, as travelers were no longer rooted to one spot for an entire summer.

Due to its close proximity to Hunter Mountain ski area, it serves as the local commercial district, with inns, restaurants, and shopping.

Tannersville has experienced a revival in the 21st century. The Hunter Foundation has implemented the town-wide &quot;Paint Program&quot; — the vision of Elena Patterson, a local artist — with the help and support of Glenn Weyant who was the mayor at the time, corporate sponsors, and local residents. The Paint Project involves painting downtown buildings in multicolored pastels, often with cartoon-like pictures on the shutters. It has attracted waves of tourists who come to see the dramatic paint schemes. The project prompted much attention when it was publicized in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2003. The project was also featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, on CNBC, and on all three of the local Albany-based television networks. The village also received some attention for serving as the center of activities for the Catskill Jazz Factory artist development program.

Tannersville is experiencing an influx of tourists from both the New York and other areas, who are attracted to its abundant hiking trails, waterfalls, and old-time charm.

The Tannersville Main Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2008. Other NRHP listed buildings are All Souls Church and Hathaway.

In November 2021, Tannersville was named the second Capital Region winner of the 5th round of the New York State Downtown Revitalization Initiative. The $10 million grant would enable the town to focus on economic development and improvements to enrichment. &quot;With the impact COVID-19 has had on small businesses and communities, it is crucial that the state invest in their revitalization so we can come back better than before,&quot; Governor Kathy Hochul said. &quot;This funding will help take Tannersville, a village rich with history, to the next level so that it may grow and flourish as an example of the best of what Upstate New York has to offer.&quot;

<text>Hope is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 403 at the 2010 census.

First settled in 1790 and established as a town in 1818, Hope is located in the southeastern corner of the county and is northwest of Schenectady.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the land occupied by present-day Hope was within the territory of the Mohawk tribe, the easternmost tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy and one of the original &quot;Five Nations&quot; which founded the confederacy sometime around 1450. Despite its longtime control by the Mohawks, Hope was largely uninhabited when, on July 31, 1772, proprietor John Bergen and 23 of his associates purchased 19,589 acres of land from the Mohawk Turtle Clan. The purchase documents were signed by Mohawk Chief Hendricks, who drew a turtle in lieu of a signature. The land that Bergen and his associates bought became known as &quot;Bergen&#x27;s Purchase.&quot;
Hope was first permanently settled in 1790 near the current south town line by Gideon and Jeremiah Homestead, who arrived from Massachusetts. The first stone house was built in 1801 by David Isdell, on land he had purchased earlier that same year. Wary of Indian attack, Isdell incorporated an escape tunnel in his home for &quot;protection against marauders,&quot; but unfortunately, his youngest daughter was notoriously kidnapped by Native Americans while picking berries, and was never heard from again; according to one account she perished in an Indian village. Isdell&#x27;s home, also known as the &quot;Old Eglin House,&quot; collapsed in 1930.

Hope was originally the southern district of the Town of Wells, but after its electors voted to separate and form a new town, the southern district was reorganized as the &quot;Town of Hope&quot; on April 15, 1818, with a population of 608 as of the 1820 census. In the 1830s, Montgomery County ceded Hope to Hamilton County, of which Hope currently occupies the most southeastern part. In 1850, with booming agriculture, mining, sawmills, and tanneries, Hope&#x27;s total population peaked at 1,125, with the subsequent decrease mainly due to residents moving away as a result of industrial decline. The town&#x27;s area was considerably reduced on April 5, 1860, when a large portion of western Hope, with a population of 380, broke off to form part of the Town of Benson.

While numerous hotels were built during the late 1800s, the population began to decline with the start of the twentieth century, as the town&#x27;s formerly dynamic industrial businesses began to cease operations. By 1905 the population had fallen to 317 residents, and by 1925 it had plunged to only 163. Much of the developed land fell into disuse, essentially all industrial activity halted, and a number of the town&#x27;s one room schools closed. Tourism, however, remained an important industry, and New York Route 30 began to provide travelers with lodging, gas stations, and other amenities. Today, Hope is a largely undeveloped residential community, with an estimated population of 387 as of 2014.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.09%) is water.

The southern border of the town is Fulton County and the eastern boundary is Saratoga County.

<doc id="126502" wikidata="Q3708610" url="?curid=126502" title="Indian Lake, New York">
<text>Indian Lake is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 1,352 at the 2010 census. The name is from a lake of the same name that is largely inside the town. There are no permanent stop lights in the town. Law enforcement is provided by New York State Troopers and Hamilton County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

The town is on the eastern border of the county and is northeast of Utica.

Indian Lake terms itself the &quot;Moose capital of the Northeast&quot;. Their welcoming sign on Route 28 even features this critter, and several other examples of this claim can be found throughout the town itself.

== History ==
The town of Indian Lake was established in 1858 from the towns of Gilman (now defunct), Long Lake, and Wells. In 1861, Indian Lake was expanded using territory from the towns of Gilman and Lake Pleasant.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which of the town are land, and , or 5.42%, are water.

The town lies within the Adirondack Park. Essex and Warren counties border the town to its east. In the village center, the east–west State Route 28 meets the north–south Route 30. The Hudson River forms part of the eastern town line.

Land within the town is a mixture of state and private ownership. There are dozens of seasonal hunting camps.

===Rainbow Lake Dam===
Rainbow Lake dam was built in 1929. Safety inspectors had described the dam as dangerous as early as 1970, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers categorized the dam as &quot;unsafe, emergency&quot; in 1979. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation called for the dam&#x27;s removal in 2004 due to the potential to cause loss of life should the dam fail. The dam owners, connected to a New York City real estate developer and a religious non-profit organization in Brooklyn, ignored an order from the DEC commissioner that required submitting an emergency action plan, and skipped a judicial hearing, in 2013. The DEC lawyers subsequently referred the case to the state attorney general. The dam owners missed three other deadlines between 2015 and 2016; the state sued in December 2018 on grounds that the owners&#x27; unresponsiveness &quot;amounts to a callous and wanton disregard for their legal duty to mitigate risk to life and property&quot;.

The Rainbow Lake Dam, near the hamlet of Indian Lake, New York, was removed in May 2023.

==Climate==
Indian Lake has a humid continental climate (Dfb), although it is much colder than most of New York due to its high elevation and northern location. Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are warm and humid. Precipitation is abundant year round, but peaks in summer. The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of 15.4, while the warmest month is July with a mean of 63.8. Just 0.1 day per year exceeds 90, with the last such instance coming in 1988. Days in the 80s are also relatively uncommon, with an average of just 18 per year. The record high is 105 in June 1919, but the temperature has not exceeded 95 since 1935. The record low is -42 in January 1908. The coldest temperature in a typical year is -22, putting Indian Lake in hardiness zone 4B. The record low high is -12 in 1968, while the record high low in a day is 74 in 2006.

The wettest year on record was 2011 with 60.80&quot;, while the driest year ever was 1963 with 27.42&quot;. The wettest month ever was June 1922 with 10.31&quot; while the driest month was November 1989, with no recorded precipitation.

<text>Lake Pleasant is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 897 at the 2020 census. It contains the hamlet of Lake Pleasant, the county seat of Hamilton County.

The town of Lake Pleasant is within the Adirondack Park and is centrally located in the county. The town is a tourist hub, with seasonal homes comprising about three-quarters of the housing units in the area. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the unofficial summer season, the small town is a busy community, with many activities including a parade, fireworks, summer musical, camping, hiking, water activities, historical activities, art show, geocaching, and mountain biking.

== History ==

=== Native Americans ===
Archaeological evidence of Native Americans has been found in arrowheads and spearheads near the shores of Lake Pleasant. Many historians believe Lake Pleasant was the hunting and fishing grounds of both Mohawk and Algonquin tribes. These Native Americans would travel to the Adirondack Mountains to hunt only during the warm months, while their villages were located in the Mohawk and Hudson Valley regions.

There was a Mohawk man, who named himself Captain Gill, who lived in a wigwam at the outlet of Lake Pleasant during the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. He had a wife named Molly, who had a daughter named Molly Jr., although Capt. Gill didn&#x27;t claim the daughter as his own. Old Capt. Gill was a trail guide for the first settlers. He would show them places to hunt and fish. Capt. Gill was most famous for his story telling and would tell folklore of the Iroquois nation. One story told of a forgotten tribe that lived year-round near Round Lake (now known as Sacandaga Lake) near the present-day hamlet of Lake Pleasant. This tribe had their village on a hill which is now behind the Hamilton County buildings. The legend talks about an evil deed the tribe did and the Flying Head that came out of Lake Sacandaga and chased them out of the Adirondack Mountains.

=== First settlers ===
The first settlers arrived around 1795; this area was then a part of the town of Mayfield in Montgomery County.

The early town was once described as &quot;A wild waste...so poor that nobody inclines to settle in it.&quot;

The inexpensive land was offered by New York City landowners to induce settlement. Heavily forested majestic mountains, abundant game for food and furs, and numerous lakes and streams full of fish awaited the first settlers. A few hardy pioneers came to the wilderness, cleared the land and built self-sufficient farms. They built gristmills and sawmills for local use. All seemed good except for the heavy snows and lack of good roads, which meant they were isolated in the winter and muddy spring.

A short cool summer growing season meant adopting their farming to crops that would survive to feed themselves and livestock. Sheep were the main livestock and did well on the rocky hillsides, and cloth was manufactured in many homes. Wild animals such as wolves, coyotes, bobcats and mountain lions had to be dealt with. Apple orchards were planted with some success. A few mills to craft woodenware and tools were built. Some of the first settlers found income from shingle making, and nearly every building was roofed with these wooden shingles. Small dairies supplied butter, cheese, and milk to neighbors and later to logging camps and large hotels. Development was slow and deprivation was numerous. Many settlers left to be closer to their families where farm land was richer and jobs that offered a steady income could be found. Several small settlements separated by distance and a lack of passable roads soon became small towns. The large area was impractical to govern, and the Montgomery County courthouse was away. In 1805, the town of Wells was established, which included the area of Lake Pleasant.

Lake Pleasant was formed in 1812 from part of the town of Wells, before the formation of Hamilton County, with about 300 residents. It was a large area with scattered settlements and large reaching boundaries. It extended north indefinitely and to the west to the Herkimer County line. Hamilton County became a provisional county in 1816 but since it lacked enough residents it was counted along with Montgomery County.

=== War of 1812 ===
The United States declared war on Great Britain on June 18, 1812. The settlers of Wells and Lake Pleasant were afraid of potential attacks from Native Americans who allied with the British Empire to attack American settlements. The Native Americans (yet unknown what tribe or nation) were seen roaming in the forest hunting, trapping and fishing. Despite no attacks, the Lake Pleasant settlers who considered themselves on the northern frontier boundary of the St. Lawrence, fled their homes and scattered themselves in the counties of Saratoga, Rensselaer and Montgomery. All inhabitants except the Peck family left Lake Pleasant, and so did a large majority of Wells. An application was made by a remaining few settlers to the New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins for an order to raise a company of volunteers from Lake Pleasant and Wells to create a militia in order to allay the fears of the inhabitants, to protect them from a possible massacre and to encourage them to return to their homes. The petition was granted, and William B. Peck was commissioned captain of the Wells and Lake Pleasant Home Guards of Company C under Montgomery County&#x27;s Militia 122 regiment. Lt. John L. Francisco later took command of the militia when Peck retired from his post.

The War of 1812 brought a need for roads to be built so the US could invade Canada. A military road was created through the town to reach the St. Lawrence River so men and provisions could be transported easily into Canadian territory.

=== Transformation of Lake Pleasant ===
The town of Lake Pleasant was formed in 1812 from the town of Wells. Lake Pleasant was a &quot;mother town&quot; of Hamilton County, and other towns were made, in whole or part, by removing parts of its territory: Morehouse (1835), Arietta (1836), part of Long Lake (1837), part of Gilmantown (1839−1860), part of Hope (1847), part of Wells (1858), and part of Indian Lake (1861).

Gilmantown stretched over from Wells to Long Lake and was soon recognized as impractical; the land was annexed to Lake Pleasant and Wells. Gradually settlement continued and two communities developed about apart near the waters of Lake Pleasant. In 1844, the community of Lake Pleasant was also known as &quot;Sageville&quot; after Hezekiah Sage built a hotel and attempted to rename the community after himself. In 1897, the town&#x27;s name returned to Lake Pleasant.

The small settlement at the foot of the lake was Lake Pleasant until 1864 when Joel Newton built a small store and hotel in the center of town and secured a post office with the name &quot;Newton&#x27;s Corners&quot;. At that time Page Hill and Page Street were included in Newton&#x27;s Corners. Joel Newton&#x27;s structure burned in 1870, and in 1872 the Newton&#x27;s Corners post office was reopened in Satterlee&#x27;s store. Henry Dunning built a hotel in 1882 where Newton&#x27;s hotel had been and the post office had moved there, and 1896 the community received a new name, Speculator, after the mountain seen across the lake.

In 1892, a few ambitious and industrious business leaders felt they needed to update and modernize their facilities. Speculator was a &quot;booming Mecca&quot; for tourists. With the support of the voters in 1925, the village of Speculator was &quot;incorporated&quot; with a mayor and two trustees, which later changed to four trustees. The village of Speculator purchased a small water system of Dexter Slack and expanded it. The village had a generating plant and waterwheel installed at Christine Falls, and by 1926 they had electricity.

=== Age of tourism ===

Growth escalated in the Victorian era between the mid-1800s and the early 1900s. Whole families spent their summers enjoying the mountain hospitality and fresh air. Several more hotels were built to accommodate them, and eventually more stores, homes and several cottages were built. Around the 1850s, city sportsmen began to come to the Adirondack Mountains to hunt, fish, and enjoy expeditions into the deep woods. They hired local men who knew the area to be guides. The guides provided food and crude lean-tos for shelter. Hunting shanties were later widely used. With these sportsmen came their whole families to use the many hotels and boardinghouses in Lake Pleasant and Speculator. Private summer camps and cottages were built, as well as family and children&#x27;s camps, such as Camp-of-the-Woods, Camp Setag for girls, Kamp Kun-ju-muk for boys, the YMCA Camp Agaming, and Deerfoot Lodge for boys, around the shores of local lakes.

After World War I, famous athletes came to practice in the isolated communities, such as Gene Tunney, Max Schmeling, and Max Baer, who arrived to train for the heavyweight championship fight.
=== Age of lumbering ===

In the beginning, small sawmills provided lumber for local use. After the Civil War, large lumber companies were formed and mills were built near the Glens Falls area. At first logging was prevalent along the upper Hudson River, which was used to float the logs to the mills. Later logging operations moved into Lake Pleasant, and the Sacandaga River was used to float logs to Glens Falls. The state of New York designated rivers as public highways for moving logs to the larger companies. Many local farmers found winter employment with these companies as well as supplying the companies with potatoes, meat, and dairy products and hay and feed for the horses. The lumber companies bought large parcels of land for their timber. Some of this land was later abandoned and became state land. This was the beginning of the Adirondack Park as designated in 1892.

<text>Long Lake is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 791 at the 2020 census.

The town is named for Long Lake, beside which it sits. A census designated place bearing the same name sits within Long Lake, home to 596 of the town&#x27;s 791 inhabitants. The town is entirely within the Adirondack Park and is the northernmost town in the county. It is a summer tourism destination offering fishing, hiking, boating and swimming. In the winter months, snowmobiling is also popular. Long Lake is the home of the historic Adirondack Hotel. Long Lake is also noted for being home to Sabattis Scout Reservation, a long-term camp operated by the Longhouse Council, Boy Scouts of America.

== History ==

The town was settled &quot;circa&quot; 1833 by Joel Plumley, a native of Vermont.

The town of Long Lake was formed in 1837 from sections of the towns of Arietta, Morehouse, Lake Pleasant, and Wells. In 1861, the town was increased by additions from Arietta, Lake Pleasant, and Morehouse.

Long Lake is part of the 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2) acquired from the Mohawk nation as part of the 1771 Totten and Crossfield Purchase. Long Lake is a glacial widening of the Raquette River and is part of the water route that connects the Fulton Chain Lakes with the Saint Lawrence River drainage. This route was frequently traveled by guideboat in the mid-late 19th century. At that time, &quot;a typical trip might start at the Saranacs from which a party could make its way to the Raquette River via Indian Carry and Stoney Creek.&quot; The trip continued &quot;via the lakes accessible from it— Long, Raquette, Forked, Blue and Tupper.&quot; Settled by the 1830s, Long Lake was isolated, except by water, until William Seward Webb&#x27;s Mohawk and Malone Railway was built through what was then known as Long Lake West in 1892. Long Lake and Long Lake West were connected by a stage route. The Mohawk &amp; Malone Railway was taken over by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1894, and was merged into the New York Central Railroad in 1913. Passenger rail service on the NYC ended on April 24, 1965. The town of Long Lake West was later renamed Sabattis, after Peter Sabattis and his son Mitchell Sabattis, the Abenaki Indian guides who came down from Canada and first settled in this area, followed by a long line of their offspring and family.

Long Lake West was the site of a fire that destroyed most of the town in 1908.

Long Lake is the starting point of the Roosevelt-Marcy Trail. On September 14, 1901 Theodore Roosevelt was climbing Mount Marcy when he got word that President William McKinley, who had been shot two weeks before in Buffalo, but had been expected to improve, had taken a serious turn for the worse.

Roosevelt rushed down from his campsite at Lake Tear of the Clouds to the closest town and telephone, which was outside of Newcomb, approximately east of Long Lake. From there he took a legendary midnight stagecoach ride to the closest train station to the south, at North Creek, where he learned that McKinley had died. Roosevelt was sworn in at Buffalo.

<text>Speculator is a village in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 406 at the 2020 census. The Speculator Mountain rises just south of the village.

Speculator is the only incorporated village within Hamilton County and is within the town of Lake Pleasant. The village includes the northeastern end of a lake, also called Lake Pleasant. The local inhabitants sometimes refer to the village as the &quot;Four Corners&quot;, referring to the intersection of NYS Route 8 and NYS Route 30 in the middle of the business district.

Speculator is within the Adirondack Park.

== History ==
=== Native Americans ===
Archeological evidence of Native Americans has been found in arrowheads and spearheads near the shores of Lake Pleasant. Many historians believe Speculator was the hunting and fishing grounds of both Mohawk and Algonquin tribes. These Native Americans would only travel to the Adirondack Mountains to hunt during the warm months, while their villages were located in the Mohawk and Hudson Valley regions. There was a Mohawk, who named himself Captain Gill, who lived in a wigwam at the outlet of Lake Pleasant, during the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. He had a wife named Molly, who had a daughter named Molly Jr., although Capt. Gill didn&#x27;t claim the daughter as his own. Old Capt. Gill was a trail guide for the first settlers. He would show them places to hunt and fish. Capt. Gill was most famous for his storytelling of the Iroquois Nation, such as the Flying Head.

=== Newton&#x27;s Corners ===
The small settlement at the outlet of Lake Pleasant was part of the town of Lake Pleasant. In 1864, Joel Newton built a small store and hotel in the center of town and secured a post office with the name &quot;Newton&#x27;s Corners&quot;. At that time, Page Hill and Page Street were included in Newton&#x27;s Corners. Joel Newton&#x27;s structure burned in 1870, and in 1872 the Newton&#x27;s Corners post office was reopened in Satterlee&#x27;s store. Henry Dunning built a hotel in 1882, on the former site of Newton&#x27;s hotel and the post office had moved there, and in 1896, the community received a new name, &quot;Speculator&quot;, after the mountain seen across the lake.

=== Becoming Speculator ===
In 1892, a few ambitious and industrious business leaders felt they needed to update and modernize their facilities. Speculator was a &quot;booming Mecca&quot; for tourists. With the support of the voters in 1925, the village of Speculator was incorporated with a mayor and two trustees, which later changed to four trustees. The village of Speculator purchased a small water system of Dexter Slack and expanded it. The village had a generating plant and waterwheel installed at Christine Falls, and by 1926 they had electricity.

=== Age of tourism ===
Growth escalated in the Victorian era between the mid-1800s and the early 1900s. Entire families spent their summers enjoying the mountain hospitality and fresh air. Several more hotels were built to accommodate them, and eventually more stores, homes and several cottages were built. Around the 1850s, city sportsmen began to come to the Adirondack Mountains to hunt, fish, and enjoy expeditions into the deep woods. They hired local men to be guides, who provided food and crude lean-tos for shelter. Hunting shanties were later widely used. With these sportsmen came their whole families to use the many hotels and boardinghouses in Lake Pleasant and Speculator. Private summer camps and cottages were built and along came the established family and children camps. Camps such as Camp-of-the-Woods, Camp Setag for girls, Kamp Kun-ju-muk for boys, the YMCA Camp Agaming, and Deerfoot Lodge for boys were established around the shores of local lakes.
After World War I, famous athletes came to practice in the isolated communities, such as Gene Tunney, Max Schmeling, and Max Baer, who arrived to train for their heavyweight championship fights at various times.
=== Age of lumbering ===
In the beginning, small sawmills provided lumber for local use. After the Civil War, large lumber companies formed and mills were built near the Glens Falls area. At first logging was prevalent along the upper Hudson River which was used to float the logs to the mills. Later, logging operations moved into Lake Pleasant, and the Sacandaga River, the outlet of Lake Pleasant, was used to float logs to Glens Falls as the state of New York designated rivers as public highways for moving logs to the larger companies. Many local farmers found winter employment as lumberjacks, and also supplied the companies with potatoes, meat, animal feed and dairy products. The lumber companies bought large parcels of land for their timber. Some of this land was later abandoned and became state land. This was the beginning of the Adirondack Park as designated in 1892.

<doc id="126509" wikidata="Q3709821" url="?curid=126509" title="Wells, New York">
<text>Wells is a town in Hamilton County, New York, United States. The population was 674 at the 2010 census. The town is named after Joshua Wells, a land agent, who built the first mills in the area. It is in the Adirondack Park and on the eastern border of the county. It is northwest of Schenectady.

==History==
The area was first settled around 1798. The town was formed in 1805 while still part of Montgomery County, and was set off from parts of the towns of Mayfield and Northampton. The town was subsequently reduced by the formation of other towns in Hamilton County, to include Hope (1818) and Long Lake (1837).

The town of Gilman was reportedly named for settler John Gilman. Elias P. Gilman petitioned the state and had surveys of Gilman made in 1838. Land was taken from Wells in 1841, but much of that region was returned to Wells when Gilman was dissolved in 1860. Wells has been increased subsequent to its initial formation by parts of Mayfield (1812, 1816), Northampton (1816), and Lake Pleasant (1858).

===War of 1812===
The United States of America declared war on Great Britain on June 18, 1812. The settlers of Wells and Lake Pleasant were afraid of potential attacks from Native Americans who allied with the British Empire to attack American settlements. The Native Americans were seen roaming in the forest hunting, trapping and fishing. Despite no attacks, the Adirondack settlers, who considered themselves on the northern frontier boundary of the St. Lawrence, fled from their homes and scattered themselves to the counties of Saratoga, Rensselaer and Montgomery. All inhabitants except the Peck family left Lake Pleasant, and so did a large majority leave Wells. An application was made by a remaining few settlers to New York governor Daniel D. Tompkins for an order to raise a company of volunteers from Lake Pleasant and Wells to create a militia in order to &quot;allay the fears of the inhabitants,&quot; to protect them from a possible massacre and to encourage them to return to their homes. The petition was granted and William B Peck of Lake Pleasant was commissioned captain of the Wells and Lake Pleasant Home Guards of Company C under Montgomery counties militia 122 regiment. Lt. John L Francisco of Wells later took command of the militia, as William Peck retired from his post.

The War of 1812 brought a need for roads to be built so United States forces could invade Canada. A military road was created through the town of Wells to reach the St. Lawrence river so men and provisions could be transported easily into Canadian territory.

=== Plane crash ===
A Massachusetts Air National Guard plane crash occurred on September 17, 1986, in Wells. Four planes were involved in the training mission and two of the four crashed into the Adirondack mountains, killing one pilot and injuring the other. The crash is said to have been the inspiration for a two-part episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, set in the nearby village of Northville, New York, but no filming took place in either location. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.66%) is water.

The eastern town line is the border with Warren County.

New York State Route 30 is a north-south highway. New York State Route 8, an east-west highway, runs concurrently with NY-30 in the central part of Wells.

The area was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1798.

==Recreation==
Wells is a small rural community set on Lake Algonquin. The town is a tourist destination for outdoor activities including boating, kayaking, hiking, camping, fishing, and snowmobiling. In the winter it hosts ice racing on the lake. Every year, Old Home Days is hosted during the first full weekend of August.

<text>German Flatts is a town in Herkimer County, New York, United States. The population was 12,263 at the 2020 census down from 13,258 at the 2010 census.

The town is in the southern part of Herkimer County, on the south side of the Mohawk River, across from the village of Herkimer. The town includes the villages of Ilion and Mohawk.

== History ==


===Herkimer===
This was one of the original areas of the Burnetsfield Patent in the province of New York, where in 1722–1723, Governor William Burnet granted Palatine German immigrants leases to purchase land from the Mohawk, the powerful eastern nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. It was the first land sold to Europeans west of Schenectady. During the 18th-century warfare in the valley, the village was attacked by French and Iroquois forces during the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War), and many women and children were taken to Canada as captives.

On September 17, 1778, Mohawk chief and Loyalist leader Joseph Brant led a force of 150 Iroquois and 300 Loyalists under the command of Captain William Caldwell in a surprise attack on the area of German Flatts. German Flatts, now known as Little Falls, Fort Herkimer, Mohawk, and Ilion, was left virtually undefended by Patriot troops prior to the raid.

The Iroquois and Loyalist raiders captured hundreds of head of cattle and sheep before setting fire to every house, barn and mill in German Flatts. Despite the complete destruction of the town, including 63 houses, 57 barns, three gristmills and one sawmill, only three men were killed. The day before, four Patriot scouts had run into the Loyalists while on reconnaissance. Though only one, Adam Helmer, survived the encounter, he ran the back to the village of German Flatts to warn the residents.

As a result, the vast majority of the town&#x27;s people were able to seek safety in the area&#x27;s forts, Herkimer and Dayton, and survived the destruction of their town. Three Demuth children were captured playing outside the fort and taken by the raiders. After the war in an exchange of prisoners, the two eldest, Catherine and George, returned to their family. The youngest, Samuel, had become assimilated to his Onondaga family and chose to remain with them. As an adult, he served as an interpreter for the Iroquois and settlers in the valley.
The town was set apart in the now defunct Tryon County, which was broken up into Montgomery and other counties after the Revolutionary War. It was established as a town in 1788 before the formation of Herkimer County. The area that was to become the town had also been called &quot;German Flatts&quot;.

===Towns===
In 1791, when Herkimer County was established, German Flatts was one of the three original towns. Three new towns were created from German Flatts in 1792: Frankfort, Litchfield, and Warren. Another part of German Flatts was used in 1829 to form part of the town of Little Falls, which developed on both sides of the Mohawk River at the falls.

<text>Ilion is a village in Herkimer County, New York, United States. Located in the Mohawk Valley region, the population was 7,646 at the 2020 census.

The village is at the northern edge of the town of German Flatts, though a tiny portion is in the town of Frankfort. It is south of the Mohawk River and Erie Canal.

==History==

Ilion is a name for the ancient city of Troy.
The area where Ilion is located was first settled by Palatine Germans under the Burnetsfield Patent around 1725. Settlers first took plots along Steele Creek, which flows into the Mohawk River. Gradually they built many mills along the creek. After the American Revolution, a small community was set up in the area named &quot;New London&quot;. This area of the village still has buildings which use the name &quot;London&quot;.

The community began to flourish starting around 1816 when Eliphalet Remington created his first rifle. He developed the Remington Arms manufacturing company. The community was stimulated in growth by the completion in 1825 of the Erie Canal, which completed area trade and connection with products from the Great Lakes region.

In 1843 a post office was desired, so the people had to choose a name. Remington refused to be the namesake of the village, and it was eventually named Ilion.

The village of Ilion was incorporated in 1852. Ilion is one of only twelve villages in New York still incorporated under a charter, the others having incorporated or re-incorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

In December 2023 RemArms LLC announced that the Remington Arms factory located in the village will be permanently closed in March 2024, eliminating 300 jobs. The property was sold to a developer in December 2024.

==Geography==
Ilion is located in the northwest corner of the town of German Flatts. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.31%, are water. The village is on the south bank of the Mohawk River and is bordered to the east by the village of Mohawk.

==Demographics==

The First United Methodist Church, Thomas Richardson House, Remington Stables, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
Until its merger in 2013 with the Mohawk Central School District, Ilion Central School District was composed of three buildings: Remington Elementary, Barringer Road Elementary, and Ilion Jr/Sr High School. The athletic team&#x27;s nickname was the Golden Bombers, the mascot was the Bomber Bear, and the school colors were gold and brown. Barringer Road Elementary, which remained open, nicknames its students the Bobcats. Remington Elementary was rented (and later sold) to Herkimer County BOCES and now houses its Pathways Academy, which provides education for students who struggle in a traditional school environment.

In the 2010–2011 year, the district had a $25 million budget and about 1,600 students; the 2011 budget proposed a cut of $1.1 million. Prior to their merger with Mohawk, Ilion Central School District was among the poorest in the state of New York. More than a third of its students were eligible for free or low-priced lunches, a standard measure of poverty. Ilion was promised additional state education aid after the CFE court ruling in 2006, but due to the state budget crisis, this did not come to fruition. Although the buildings remained in good repair, the district was not able to afford any foreign language education (other than Spanish), and offered only four of 34 possible AP courses.

A plan to merge the Mohawk and Ilion school districts had been proposed in 2009. In 2012, voters rejected a three-way merger including Herkimer Central School District, and a four-way merger that included Frankfort-Schuyler School District. In early 2013, voters approved the merger of the Mohawk and Ilion school districts. The new Central Valley Central School District began classes starting with the 2013–2014 academic year, with Ilion&#x27;s high school serving as the new district&#x27;s high school.

==Transportation==
New York State Route 5S, an east–west highway, passes through the northern side of the village. New York State Route 51 (Central Avenue/Otsego Street), a north–south highway, passes through the village center and has its northern terminus north of the village at New York State Route 5.

The area was settled by Palatine Germans after 1722. In 1725, the King of Great Britain and Governor Burnet granted Mohawk to the Palatine Germans in what was known as the Burnetsfield Patent.

George Washington was known to stop in Mohawk to have lunch at the Shoemaker Tavern on his way to and from Fort Stanwix in Rome.

Mohawk became known as &quot;Bennetts Corners&quot; after a hotel stand that was located here in 1826. In 1838, the village became 
known as &quot;Mohawk&quot;.

The village was incorporated on April 16, 1844. The first president of the village, Frederick Bellinger, came into office on May 4 of that year.

The first mayor of Mohawk was James V. Casey, who was elected in 1960. The current mayor is Jim Baron.

Mohawk is one of only twelve villages in New York still incorporated under a municipal charter, the other villages having incorporated or re-incorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

Norway was formed in 1792 from the town of Herkimer immediately after the creation of Herkimer County. Norway was originally a very large town, and it was subsequently broken up, directly or indirectly, into about 36 new towns in several bordering counties. In Herkimer County, the towns of Fairfield (1796), Russia (1806), Ohio (1823), Wilmurt (now defunct), and Webb (1836) were made by dividing Norway. Part of Newport was taken from Norway in 1806. The creation of Oneida County, Lewis County, Clinton County, Hamilton County, and St. Lawrence County from Herkimer County accounts for the remaining towns derived from Norway.

In 1825, the town&#x27;s population was 1,168.

Because of poor soil conditions, early farmers eventually turned to raising dairy herds. By 1887, there were six cheese factories in Norway.

<text>Poland is a village in Herkimer County, New York, United States. The population was 508 at the 2010 census.

Poland is on the border shared by the towns of Newport and Russia. The village is north of the county seat in Herkimer and is northeast of Utica. Poland Central School has roughly 500 students from grades pre-k through 12th grade.

== History ==
Poland was briefly called &quot;Maple Valley&quot; and &quot;Russia Flats&quot; when it was first settled around 1800 on land owned by Samuel Wright. The first post office, established in 1838 in the hotel at the corner of Main and Case streets, was known as &quot;Danielsville&quot;, after Nahum Daniels, who owned a large amount of land in the village. The first postmaster, Joseph Benchley, soon changed the name because of the confusion with Dansville in western New York. The simplest explanation for the name &quot;Poland&quot; is that the village is adjacent to and southwest of Russia, New York, just like Poland in Europe. It is the only U.S. place called Poland to be named after the country, the rest are named after people or are of obscure origin. In 2019, Poland Central School caught on fire from a wiring issue in the basement.

In 1869 there were 200 residents and approximately 60 buildings. By the 1880s there was a church, store, hotels, grist- and sawmill, tannery sash and blind factory, wagon shop, two blacksmith shops, cheese box factory, cabinet shop, and a bootjack and ladder manufacturer. House building was booming.

Poland had a stop on the Herkimer, Newport and Poland Railway.

By 1906, there were more than 150 buildings even after two disastrous fires.

Poland was incorporated May 10, 1890, with Charles Bowen as the first President (mayor).

<doc id="126531" wikidata="Q597246" url="?curid=126531" title="Webb, New York">
<text>Webb (sometimes referred to as Webb Town) is the northernmost town in Herkimer County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census it had a population of 1,797.

It is named after William Seward Webb, president of the Raquette Lake Transportation Company, the Fulton Chain Railway Company, Fulton Navigation Company, and the Mohawk and Malone Railway. The railroads in Webb were instrumental in opening the Adirondacks to the tourism rush of the mid-to-late 19th century. The Adirondack Railroad resumed tourist passenger service through the town in 2022.

== History ==

Attempts were made to settle Webb &quot;circa&quot; 1800 and 1811, but both efforts failed due to extreme climate, harsh weather and poor land for farming. The first permanent settlers, Otis Arnold and family, arrived in approximately 1837 and began their try at the land. The Arnolds ultimately succeeded in cultivating and selling hay feed, vegetables, milk and fruit. Eventually, map makers and guidebooks made note of the settlement. The Arnolds opened their house as a hotel of sorts, and the area became known for its beautiful rivers, lakes and mountains.

In 1836, the town of Wilmurt was formed from parts of the towns of Ohio and Russia. Only the south part of Wilmurt was heavily settled. Webb was formed from the northern part of the now-defunct town of Wilmurt in 1896. Part of Wilmurt was returned to the town of Ohio.

When Dr. William Seward Webb&#x27;s Mohawk and Malone Railway reached the town in 1892, it precipitated twenty years of prosperity from lumbering and tourism.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.61%, are water. Webb has the most land area of any town in New York State, although Brookhaven covers a larger area when including water.

Webb is in the Adirondack Park. One end of the Fulton Chain Lakes is located in the town. New York State Route 28 crosses the southern part of the town from west to east, passing through the communities of Old Forge and Thendara.

Boldt Castle is a 120-room mansion on Heart Island, located near Alexandria Bay. The castle was designed by the firm of W. D. Hewitt and G.W. Hewitt, Architects of Philadelphia, who also designed Druim Moir Castle in Philadelphia. Boldt Castle was built at the turn of the century by multi-millionaire George C. Boldt for his wife, Louise, as a testimony of his love for her. Mr. Boldt invested over $2.5 million to build this replica of a Rhineland castle.

Boldt planned on presenting it to his wife on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Work was underway on the eleven buildings that would comprise the castle complex when in January 1904 Louise Boldt died, ending the dreams of a lifetime. George Boldt ordered that all work be stopped and for 73 years the Castle and the other structures on the island were left to the forces of nature. The Thousand Islands Bridge Authority acquired the property in 1977; since that time, several million dollars have been spent rehabilitating and restoring the castle and surrounding structures. Ferries allow access to the castle on an hourly schedule daily. In 1979, the movie Fear No Evil was filmed at several sites in and around Boldt Castle, marking the only time the castle has made an appearance in cinema.

Every August, 10 days are devoted to &quot;Bill Johnston&#x27;s Pirate Days&quot;, a town-wide festival that features professional performers acting out pirate battles and a &quot;siege&quot; of the town by the &quot;Pirate of the Thousand Islands&quot;, Bill Johnston, whom the festival is named after. It is encouraged that attendees dress in pirate attire, as do the actors who line the streets. The festival is also educational, with many groups providing galleries, displays, and informative presentations of the weapons and ships used during the Golden Age of Piracy.

<text>Black River is a village in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 1,348 at the 2010 census. The village is on the border of the towns of Le Ray and Rutland, east of Watertown.

== History ==
The area was first settled around 1806 by the erection of a mill on the south side of the Black River. The village was previously called &quot;Lockport&quot;, and grew to include both sides of the river as well as two small river islands.

On February 20, 1890, a large fire destroyed the business section of the downtown. Buildings destroyed by the fire included the Poor Block (which included a three-story building with an opera house on the third floor); the D.J. Scott and Son Block; the Arthur House (a hotel); Parkinson&#x27;s Store (the old 1881 post office); Whipple and Hadsell&#x27;s Store; F.H. Dillenbeck&#x27;s Tinshop and Hardware Store; A.W. McDowell&#x27;s Store; George Graham&#x27;s barber shop; the I.O.O.F. Hall and two residential dwellings. The Kennedy Stone house was badly burned, but was later restored. Having no fire department at the time, the residents of Black River immediately made plans to organize a fire department later that year. Black River Fire Company No. 1 was organized September 4, 1890, and incorporated on January 3, 1891. The department was re-incorporated as the Black River Fire Department on February 21, 1940. This department still provides fire protection for the village, and is one of the oldest continually operating fire departments in Jefferson County.

The community incorporated as a village in 1891, taking land in the towns of Rutland and Le Ray.

The LeRay Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The Black River flows through the center of the village and forms the border between the towns of Le Ray and Rutland.

<doc id="126541" wikidata="Q992499" url="?curid=126541" title="Chaumont, New York">
<text>Chaumont ( ) is a village in Jefferson County, New York, United States. Its population was 624 at the 2010 census. The village is named for Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, son of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s landlord and friend at Passy in France. The village of Chaumont is in the town of Lyme and is northwest of Watertown.

== History ==
In 1750, Ray had bought the Chaumont castle (named from the Old French for &quot;bald hill&quot;, and built in two periods around 1500) in the Loire Valley of France. (, the village near it is called Chaumont-sur-Loire to distinguish it from the many other Chaumonts in France.) His son, known as James Leray or James Leray Chaumont, travelled to the United States and later settled there.

The first European-descended settlement of the village began in 1802, replacing an unsatisfactory site chosen the previous year. The economy of the early village was based on fishing and ship building.

In July 1853, the community contained about fifty dwellings, along with other structures. Chaumont was incorporated as a village in 1874, and its historic core was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as the Chaumont Historic District. The village has twice been proposed to be dissolved into the surrounding town of Lyme. The first dissolution referendum was defeated by a margin of 129–72 in March 1999; a second attempt was rejected by a 145–102 margin on November 6, 2012.

In addition to the Chaumont Historic District, the Cedar Grove Cemetery, Chaumont Grange Hall and Dairymen&#x27;s League Building, Chaumont House, Chaumont Railroad Station, George Brothers Building, George House, and Menzo Wheeler House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Depauville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the southern region of the town of Clayton, within Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was at 577 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
In 1784, the Oneida people ceded all territory to the state of New York except for a tract of land around known as Penet Square. The Oneida considered the tract as a gift to Pierre Penet. After Penet&#x27;s death, rights of land ownership were blurred and squatters occupied the territory as early as 1785. Catfish Falls was a settlement at the head of the Chaumont River, named after the waterfall within the settlement. The squatters that inhabited this area were often called &quot;Catfish People&quot;, marking their settlement from the clearing of trees establishing its boundaries. In 1816, merchant Francis Depau purchased several lots in Penet Square including Catfish Falls, later renaming the settlement &quot;Depauville&quot; after himself.

Depauville during the early 1800s was a site of manufacturing; the settlement contained a gristmill and sawmill. Lumber was a profitable resource for the region. Depauville also produced limewater, nearly 1,000 barrels after two years of production, a first for the county. Around 1868 the Depauville Steamboat Company was established and produced side-wheel steamboats. The &quot;M. W. Wright&quot; was constructed in 1968, a steam-powered vessel from bow to stern, with a width of , and weighing in at nearly 43 tons. The ship was large enough to raise concerns on its capability to navigate the shallow waters of the Chaumont River before reaching Lake Ontario.

Depauville&#x27;s first Fire District was created in 1932 and during the Great Depression housed a camp of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC established a headquarters consisting of ten camps at the Madison Barracks in Sackets Harbor.

Depauville saw damage from a microburst on July 15, 1995. In 1996, the Clayton Fire District formed, bringing the Depauville Fire Department under the same umbrella with the Clayton Fire Department, although each retained its identity. Depauville in January 1998 witnessed one of the most destructive natural disasters that Jefferson County had ever endured, the Ice Storm of 1998, 36 hours of freezing rain that left damaged homes and properties, impassable roadways and many people powerless and hungry for weeks.

==Geography==
Depauville is located in northern Jefferson County at (44.143189, -76.057757), in the southern part of the town of Clayton. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Depauville hamlet is located at the junction of New York State Route 12 and County Roads 11 (Sylvia Street), 12 (Overbluff Road), and 179 (Caroline Street). Route 12 leads north to the village of Clayton on the St. Lawrence River and southeast to Watertown, the county seat. The village is mostly on the south bank of the Chaumont River.

==Recreation==
Depauville provides community events held at each of two churches, the fire department banquet hall and public library. Depauville also has a small town market and a bar, the Depauville Hotel. The Depauville Hotel is one of many stops for snowmobilers during the winter months as it is a crossroad of snowmobile trails that travel north to Clayton and eventually Gouverneur or west to Chaumont that accesses Lake Ontario. Depauville is a site for hunting and fishing as the salmon spawn and migration includes the Chaumont River from Lake Ontario. Access to the Thousand Islands region is a 10-minute drive northbound on State Route 12.

<doc id="126544" wikidata="Q808210" url="?curid=126544" title="Barisan Nasional">
<text>The Barisan Nasional (BN; ) is a political coalition of Malaysia that was founded in 1974 as a coalition of centre-right and right-wing political parties to succeed the Alliance Party. It is the third largest political coalition with 30 seats in the Dewan Rakyat after Pakatan Harapan (PH) with 82 seats and Perikatan Nasional (PN) with 74 seats.

The coalition consists of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), and United Sabah People&#x27;s Party (PBRS).

The Barisan Nasional coalition employs the same inter-communal governing model of its predecessor the Alliance Party but on a wider scale, with up to 14 communal political parties involved in the coalition at one point. It dominated Malaysian politics for over thirty years after it was founded. Taken together with its predecessor Alliance, it had a combined period of rule of almost 61 years from 1957 to 2018, and was considered the longest ruling coalition party in the democratic world.

Since 2008, the coalition has faced stronger challenges from opposition parties, notably the Pakatan Rakyat and later the Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliances. The Barisan Nasional coalition lost its hold of the parliament to PH for the first time in Malaysian history after the 2018 general election. It was also the first time Barisan Nasional became the opposition coalition, with former prime minister and Barisan Nasional chairman Mahathir Mohamad becoming PH&#x27;s leader. As a result, the Sabah and Sarawak BN component parties left the coalition and formed their own coalitions in 2018 and 2022. In the aftermath of the 2020 Malaysian political crisis, together with four other parties, the Barisan Nasional coalition returned to power under a Perikatan Nasional-led government. However, it suffered its worst result in the 2022 election, falling to third behind Pakatan Harapan and Perikatan Nasional, but it stayed in government by supporting Pakatan Harapan.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Barisan Nasional is the direct successor to the three-party Alliance coalition formed by United Malays National Organisation, Malaysian Chinese Association, and Malaysian Indian Congress. It was founded in the aftermath of the 1969 general election and the 13 May riots. The Alliance Party lost ground in the 1969 election to the opposition parties, in particular the two newly formed parties, Democratic Action Party and Gerakan, as well as Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party. Although the Alliance won a majority of seats, it gained less than half the popular vote, and the resulting tension between different communities led to the May 13 riots and the declaration of a state of emergency. After the Malaysian Parliament reconvened in 1971, negotiations to form a new alliance began with parties such as Gerakan and People&#x27;s Progressive Party, both of which joined the Alliance in 1972, quickly followed by Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) in 1973.

The Barisan Nasional, which included regional parties from Sabah and Sarawak (Sabah Alliance Party, Sarawak United Peoples&#x27; Party, Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu), was formally registered in June 1974 as a coalition of nine parties. It contested the 1974 general election as a grand coalition under the leadership of the prime minister Tun Abdul Razak, which it won with considerable success.

=== 1977–2007 ===

In 1977, PAS was expelled from Barisan Nasional following a revolt by PAS within the Kelantan state legislature against the chief minister appointed by the federal government. Barisan Nasional nevertheless won the 1978 general election convincingly, and it continued to dominate Malaysian politics in the 1980s and 1990s despite some losses in state elections, such as the loss of Kelantan to PAS, and Sabah to United Sabah Party which later joined Barisan Nasional.

By 2003, Barisan Nasional had grown to a coalition formed of more than a dozen communal parties. It performed particularly well in the 2004 general election, winning 198 out of 219 seats.

Although Barisan Nasional never achieved more than 67% of the popular vote in elections from 1974 to 2008, it maintained the consecutive two-thirds majority of seats in this period in the Dewan Rakyat until the 2008 election, benefitting from Malaysia&#x27;s first-past-the-post voting system.

=== 2008–2018 ===
In the 2008 general election, Barisan Nasional lost more than one-third of the parliamentary seats to Pakatan Rakyat, a loose alliance of opposition parties. This marked Barisan&#x27;s first failure to secure a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament since 1969. Five state governments, namely Selangor, Kelantan, Penang, Perak and Kedah fell to Pakatan Rakyat. Perak however was later returned via a court ruling following a constitutional crisis. Since 2008, the coalition has seen its non-Malay component parties greatly diminished in the peninsula.

The losses continued in the 2013 general election, and it recorded its worst election result at the time. BN regained Kedah but lost several more seats in Parliament along with the popular vote to Pakatan. Despite winning only 47% of the popular vote, it managed to gain 60% of the 222 parliamentary seats, thereby retaining control of the parliament. The 1MDB scandal, which erupted in 2015, further damaged BN&#x27;s reputation.

And finally, during the 2018 general election, Barisan Nasional lost control of the parliament to Pakatan Harapan, winning a total of only 79 parliamentary seats. The crushing defeat ended their 61-year rule of the country, taken together with its predecessor (Alliance), and this paved the way for the first change of government in Malaysian history. The coalition won only 34% of the popular vote amid vote split of Islamic Party. In addition to their failure in regaining the Penang, Selangor and Kelantan state governments, six state governments, namely Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Kedah and Sabah fell to Pakatan Harapan and WARISAN (Sabah). The Terengganu state government also fell but to the Gagasan Sejahtera. Barisan Nasional was only in power in three states; namely Perlis, Pahang and Sarawak.

Many of BN&#x27;s component parties left the coalition following its humiliating defeat at the 2018 general election, reducing its number to 4 compared to 13 before the election. These parties either aligned themselves with the new Pakatan Harapan federal government, formed a new state-based pact or remained independent. They include three Sabah-based parties (UPKO, PBS and LDP), four Sarawak-based parties (PBB, SUPP, PRS and PDP, which formed a new state-based pact GPS), (under Kayveas faction) and Gerakan. experienced a leadership dispute, with Maglin announcing that the party remained within the coalition and Kayveas announcing that the party had left the coalition, resulting in the dissolution of the party on 14 January 2019.

Among the remaining four component parties in Barisan National, UMNO&#x27;s parliamentary seats have reduced from 54 to 38 since 16 members of parliament left the party, while MCA&#x27;s parliamentary seat maintains one. MIC&#x27;s parliamentary seats have reduced from two to one after the Election Court nullified the results of the election for the Cameron Highlands federal constituency due to bribery, but BN regained its seat from a direct member under the 2019 by-election.

As a result of these developments, BN&#x27;s parliamentary seats have reduced to 41, compared with 79 seats that BN won in the general election.

MCA and MIC made a statement in March 2019 that they want to &quot;move on&quot; and find a new alliance following disputes with the secretary-general, Nazri Abdul Aziz. Mohamad Hasan, the acting BN chairman, chaired a Supreme Council meeting in which all parties showed no consensus on dissolving the coalition.

=== 2019–present ===
In January 2019, all Sabah UMNO branches including Sabah BN branches were dissolved and officially closed, leaving only one BN branch open. This brings the total BN seats in Sabah to only 2 seats.

Since 2019, Barisan Nasional recovered some ground and won a number of by-elections, such as the 2019 Cameron Highlands by-election, 2019 Semenyih by-election, 2019 Rantau by-election, and 2019 Tanjung Piai by-election, defeating Pakatan Harapan.

In September 2019, UMNO decided to form a pact with the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) called Muafakat Nasional. Its main purpose is to unite the Malay Muslim communities for electoral purposes. There was however no formal agreement with the other parties of Barisan Nasional, although there were calls for Barisan Nasional to migrate to Muafakat Nasional. Barisan Nasional continued to function as a coalition of four parties comprising UMNO, MCA, MIC and PBRS but aligned themselves with Perikatan Nasional to form a new government in March 2020 after the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government. Barisan Nasional form a new government on 15 August 2021 with Perikatan Nasional after the collapse of the Perikatan Nasional government.

Barisan Nasional also recovered control of the Johor, Malacca and Perak state governments.

On 20 November 2021, Barisan Nasional won a two-thirds majority of 21 out of 28 seats in the Malacca State Legislative Assembly.

On 12 March 2022, Barisan gained a landslide victory in the 2022 Johor state election, allowing it to form the much more stable Johor state government with a two-thirds majority in the Johor State Legislative Assembly, which is 40 out of 56 seats while defeating Pakatan Harapan with 12 seats, Perikatan Nasional with 3 seats and Malaysian United Democratic Alliance with 1 seat.

==== 2022 election ====
In the 2022 election, BN faced the worst result in its history, winning 30 out of 222 seats, compared to 82 and 74 seats for Pakatan Harapan and Perikatan Nasional respectively. Several key figures including Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Mahdzir Khalid, Azeez Rahim, Tengku Zafrul Aziz, and Khairy Jamaluddin, lost to either PN or PH candidates in their own constituencies. BN also lost several state elections held in Pahang and Perak and won no seats in Perlis. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the party president, was re-elected with a slim majority of 348, high decrease from 2018 Malaysian general election which he won with majority of 5073 votes. The election produced a hung parliament, but BN decided to support the biggest coalition Pakatan Harapan and was rewarded with cabinet posts in the government.

== Organisation ==

In 2013, the vast majority of Barisan Nasional&#x27;s seats were held by its two largest Bumiputera-based political parties—the United Malays National Organisation, and Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu. For most of its history, both the Malaysian Chinese Association and Malaysian Indian Congress have played major roles in Barisan Nasional, but their representation in Parliament and state legislatures has become much more diminished. Nevertheless, each component party purports to represent – and limit membership – to a certain race: UMNO for the Malays, MCA for the Chinese and so on. In the view of some scholars:

Although both the Alliance and BN registered themselves as political parties, membership is mostly indirect through one of the constituent parties while direct membership is allowed. The BN defines itself as a &quot;confederation of political parties which subscribe to the objects of the Barisan Nasional&quot;. Although in elections, all candidates stand under the BN symbol, and there is a BN manifesto, each individual constituent party also issues its own manifesto, and there is intra-coalition competition for seats prior to nomination day.

<text>Henderson is a town in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 1,360 at the 2010 census. The town is named after William Henderson, the original European-American land owner.

Henderson is in the western part of the county and is southwest of Watertown. The Great Lakes Seaway Trail runs through the town along New York State Route 3 and includes a monument to its founder, William E. Tyson.

== History ==
This area had long been occupied by the Onondaga people, a nation of the Iroquois Confederacy, a Native American coalition of tribes who controlled most of upstate and western New York around the Great Lakes by the 15th century. Because most nations of the confederacy had allied with the British in the American Revolutionary War, after the defeat of Britain the United States forced the Iroquois to cede most of their land in New York under the terms of the peace treaty. The tribes moved to Canada, where the British offered them land in what is now Ontario.

New York made available for sale millions of acres of the former Iroquois lands at very low prices in an effort to stimulate settlement and agricultural development of its western and upstate territories. It offered some land to veterans as payment for their service during the war. Speculators based in New York City bought huge portions of land and sold them later for development.

In 1801 Benjamin Wright surveyed and divided the town into lots, but settlers did not begin to arrive until 1802. Most settlers migrated from New England, which had limited lands available for farming. The town was officially organized in 1806 from territory previously part of the town of Ellisburg.

The Cyrus Bates House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 and the Norton–Burnham House, the birthplace of architect Daniel Burnham, was added in 2016.

A common belief is that early explorers visited this town during the 16th century.

Settlement began around 1802. Due to the large expanse of low-lying land, there was a great deal of sickness in the town.

During the War of 1812, the inhabitants built a fort, but tore it down after visiting British officials assured them no harm would come to them if they removed fortifications.

Residents Ira Polley (Polly) and Chauncey Bugby (later Buckby) were active combatants supporting the Republic of Canada and Canadian independence in the Patriot War (1837). They were captured and sentenced to exile to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) in Australia. Both men were subsequently released but elected to remain in Australia, married, and have numerous descendants today.

The town of Lyme was organized from part of the town of Brownville in 1818. In 1849, the northern part of Lyme was used to form the town of Cape Vincent.

The hamlet of Chaumont set itself off from the town in 1874 by incorporation as a village.

District School No. 3 at Putnam Corners, Evans-Gaige-Dillenback House, Getman Farmhouse, and Lance Farm were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

<text>Mannsville is a village in the town of Ellisburg in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 354 at the 2010 census, down from 400 in 2000. The name is from Barzillian Mann, early developer.

Mannsville is in the southeastern part of Ellisburg and is south of Watertown.

== History ==
The community was first settled around 1801. Mannsville incorporated as a village in 1879. In 1885, a fire burned several structures in the small village, but they were soon rebuilt.

In the 1830s missionaries served the area. The Mannsville Methodist-Episcopal Church was organized in 1847 with Rev. Fuller serving as the first pastor. The building was erected in 1859. The parsonage, located three houses east, was built in 1880. In 1957 a large addition was built, and the sanctuary was remodeled in 1967. A new steeple was erected in 2002 with funds provided by Ethel S. Joyner, and work done by Graves Construction.

The first school building in the community was a little red schoolhouse built in 1826, at the intersection of Balch Place and current Route 11. A second larger two-story building was built on Lorraine Street, but burned in 1878. The third school, built on the foundation of the Lorraine street building, burned in January 1883. A new building was dedicated in September 1883. There were 106 students in three departments. The schoolhouse again burned in 1907. A new two-story building was completed in 1908, and is currently known as the Mannsville Manor Elementary School. The cement blocks were made to resemble stone. O.D. Greene Jr. of Adams was the builder. Classes ran from first to eighth grades. The district centralized in 1930 with other districts in the towns of Ellisburg and Lorraine.

In the early 1930s, six village men held a meeting in the old Club House on Mill Street in Mannsville. With a dollar each, the Mannsville Volunteer Fire Department was established. In 1949 they became incorporated and merged with Pierrepont Manor to become the Mannsville Manor Fire Department, or tongue in cheek as the &quot;Cellar Savers&quot;.

In May 1960 seven active members of the Mannsville Manor Fire Department borrowed $200 from the department to start the first ambulance service in southern Jefferson County, which at that time served six townships. This was the beginning of Rescue 48. In May 1976, Rescue 48 was reorganized with 25 active members supplying 24-hour ambulance service. The Mannsville Manor Rescue Squad observed their 30th anniversary in 1990. On January 4, 1991, the Rescue Squad became one of the first volunteer paramedic ambulance services in Jefferson County.

The Pierrepont Manor Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

<text>Natural Bridge is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 365.

It is located in the northeastern corner of the town of Wilna and is east of Watertown. The name &quot;Natural Bridge&quot; was derived from Natural Bridge Caverns, marble cave which the Indian River runs underground through. Natural Bridge Station is a location along a railroad line southeast of the community in Lewis County.

==History==

In 1812, a hunter, Aleaser Carr, crossed the Indian River on what he assumed to be a log while hunting. Much to his amazement while hunting a short time later, he again came to the river on the same side as before he crossed. After an examination by himself and a party of hunters, it appeared that he had unknowingly recrossed the river on what turned out to be a marble arch. Consequently, this is how Natural Bridge received its name.

Settlement began in the area in 1818. The former king of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, known in America as the Count de Survilliers, owned land consisting of a one-mile square. After coming to look at his land in 1828, he was impressed by the limestone arch and with being so close to his lake, &quot;Lake Bonaparte&quot; ( to the northeast), he decided to build a second summer residence in Natural Bridge in 1829. He resided here with his &quot;Madame&quot; until 1835. The house was destroyed in September 1905 in a fire that also consumed two hotels and their barns, the country store, and another dwelling house.

An old story which still proves to be a mystery today is of the Joseph Bonaparte residence. The cellar of the residence was supposedly connected by secret passage to the caverns so that if he ever needed to escape, he had this passage.

Natural Bridge Caverns, the hamlet&#x27;s namesake, was formerly operated as a show cave, with tourists being ferried by boat on the underground portion of the Indian River.

==Geography==
Natural Bridge is located along the eastern edge of Jefferson County at (44.068527, -75.494749), in the eastern part of the town of Wilna. It is bordered to the east by the town of Diana in Lewis County.

<doc id="126565" wikidata="Q1973465" url="?curid=126565" title="Sackets Harbor, New York">
<text>Sackets Harbor (earlier spelled [[Sackett (surname)|Sacketts]] Harbor) is a village in Jefferson County, New York, United States, on Lake Ontario. The population was 1,450 at the 2010 census. The village was named after land developer and owner Augustus Sackett, who founded it in the early 1800s.

Sackets Harbor is in the western part of the town of Hounsfield and is west of Watertown. The heart of the village, with a Main Street and well-preserved 19th century buildings, has been recognized as the Sackets Harbor Village Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

To support the War of 1812, the US Navy built a major shipyard and its headquarters for the Great Lakes at the village. Within a short period, more than 3,000 men worked at the shipyard. The Army constructed earthworks, forts, barracks and supporting infrastructure to defend the village and navy shipyard, and its troops also camped in the village. The thousands of military personnel made it seem like a city. By the fall of 1814, this was the third-largest population center in the entire state, after Albany and New York City. With its strategic protected harbor on Lake Ontario and military installations, the village had national importance through the 19th century.

Soon after the war, the Army strengthened its defenses on the northern frontier by constructing Madison Barracks. The village also developed a commercial shipyard and many business connections to communities around the Great Lakes. Its businessmen were also connected to bases in the major markets of Louisville, Kentucky, and New Orleans. In 1817 a consortium of local businessmen supported construction of the 240-ton &quot;Ontario&quot;, the first US steamboat on the Great Lakes. In July 1834, the commercial schooner &quot;Illinois&quot; from Sackets Harbor was the first to enter the harbor of the new settlement of Chicago. Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site commemorates a battle during the War of 1812 and the contribution of the area to the United States defense.

== History ==
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, this area had been inhabited for thousands of years by differing cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic tribe were the Iroquoian-speaking Onondaga, part of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, or Iroquois Confederacy. Long trading with the French and English, the Mohawk and most of the Six Nations allied with the British during the Revolution, hoping to dislodge the American colonists from their territory. Following the war, they were forced to make major cessions of most of their land in New York to the United States. Most of the Iroquois went to Canada and settled on land granted by Great Britain.

In the large-scale sales of of public lands in the postwar period, Sackets Harbor was founded in 1801 by Augustus Sackett, a land speculator from New York City. He and others had high hopes for trade across Lake Ontario with Kingston and other parts of Canada. With one of the few natural harbors on Lake Ontario, Sackets Harbor was the most significant community in the area until the founding of the city of Watertown.

The area attracted migrants from New England, as well as immigrants from Great Britain and France. The latter were fleeing the turmoil of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. They cleared heavy forest and gradually constructed houses for a village center. Edmund Luff, a young English immigrant, constructed a non-denominational meetinghouse, where all Christians met until they built their own churches in later decades. Converted to a residence, the house still stands.

The American Revolution did not resolve all issues with Great Britain. Border issues and increasing tensions led the US to impose the Embargo Act of 1807 prohibiting trade with Great Britain, which effectively included Canada. People on both sides of the border, Canadian (many of them Native Americans, including Loyalists who had fled there after the Revolution) and American, quickly built up a vigorous smuggling trade across the waters and through the nearby Thousand Islands area along the St. Lawrence River. But the embargo reduced trade. The US government first stationed forces in the area to try to reduce smuggling.

By the 1810 census, there were 943 qualified voters in the village. Sackets Harbor incorporated as a village in 1814, during the War of 1812.

=== War of 1812 ===

As tensions increased with Great Britain, the US began to build up its military forces at Sackets Harbor, including creating a major shipyard at what became Navy Point. The scale of buildup was such that the citizens were outnumbered on a scale of about 8:1 by thousands of sailors and soldiers, camp followers and traders. Some 3,000 workers built the warships, and most had been recruited from the New York City area.

Limited sanitary facilities and medical knowledge made the dense troop encampments breeding grounds for infectious diseases, such as typhus, which quickly spread to villagers, too. By February 1813, Sackets Harbor was the largest community in the state north of the Mohawk River.

The village was the site of two battles during the War of 1812. In the first battle in 1812, the brig USS &quot;Oneida&quot; and shore batteries repulsed an attacking force of five British ships. The village became a major base of operations for both the Navy (including US Marine Corps) and Army for the duration of the war. The Army built defensive earthworks around much of the village, and Fort Tompkins with barracks near Navy Point. Local militia built Fort Volunteer north of the village main streets. Thousands of troops gathered to defend the shipyard and village, and to attack Canada.

The numbers of troops so exceeded what could be built to shelter them that in 1813 troops were housed with residents, in stores, in barns and in tents. Village women counted themselves lucky if they were only cooking for officers. By the spring of 1813, the Army had gathered approximately 5,200 men in the village.

Most importantly, by 1813 the village became the US Naval Headquarters on the Great Lakes. Working at the Navy Point shipyard were 3,000 highly skilled men, including hundreds of shipbuilders and carpenters brought from New York City because of a lack of locally skilled craftsmen. The yard was constructed and supervised during the war by New York City naval architect and shipbuilder Henry Eckford. They rapidly built eleven warships to establish control over the Great Lakes.

Control of the Great Lakes ultimately ended up in the hands of both the peoples of Canada and the United States (with the exception of Lake Michigan, which is located entirely within the United States) and has been managed since 1909 by the International Joint Commission.

In the Second Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor in May 1813, British forces landed and attacked the village, but they were again driven off. Most of the American garrison and ships were at the western end of the lake at the time in another conflict. The American defense was marred by officers&#x27; mistaken orders at Navy Point to destroy stores and a partially constructed ship, to prevent capture by the British.

The buildup continued. In the fall of 1813, the Navy had moved its hospital off a ship and was temporarily renting the non-denominational meeting house from settler and preacher Edmund Luff. The next year a two-story hospital was constructed on land just north of the village and south of Mill Creek, on land that was bought from his father Samuel Luff. By the fall of 1814, Sackets Harbor was the third-largest population center in all of New York state, after Albany and New York City.

Until the federal government established the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, it had several schools for the training of midshipmen. Commodore Isaac Chauncey, writing to the Secretary of the Navy on November 30, 1814, described a school established at Sacket&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario in that year:

Sir. I have the pleasure to inform you that I have established a Mathematical School under the direction of my Chaplain the Revd. Mr. Felch who is fully competent to the duties of such a School. More than One hundred Officers attend this School, as they can be spared from duty and about Sixty Lieutenants and Midshipmen attend daily who make great progress in the various branches of Mathematics Navigation. etc.

The end of the war came in 1815 before the Navy completed construction of the last warship, the USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;. She was put into storage and never completed. She was finally scrapped in 1883.

=== 19th through 20th centuries ===

The military recognized the continued importance of Sackets Harbor&#x27;s strategic location. The Navy Shipyard operated until 1874, building ships such as USRC &quot;Active&quot; (1843), a revenue cutter. In 1848 a new Sackets Harbor Naval Station was constructed. After 1884, the base was used mostly for training.

The Army took over privately owned land of Samuel Luff just north of the village to build Madison Barracks (c. 1814–1819). Well into the late 19th century, this was a substantial military installation; the Army added new construction including housing, a school, a hospital, stables for horses, and supporting infrastructure. Ulysses S. Grant was among the officers who served here. During World War I, the base was used primarily as a hospital post, and in World War II as a training post.

Madison Barracks has been designated as an Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The New York State Museum of Military History calls it &quot;a living museum of military architecture&quot;. Forts :: New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center Comprising the northeastern quarter of the village, the Madison Barracks is being slowly redeveloped as a planned commercial/residential area. The New York City consortium Fort Pike Associates holds title to unsold land in the complex.

In July 2017, the Horse Island, located just west of the village, was acquired for preservation by the Civil War Trust, aided by a grant from the National Park Service. It was the site of a War of 1812 engagement. This was the first time in the US that a grant from the American Battlefield Land Grant program has been used to preserve a War of 1812 site.

Sackets Harbor developed as an important Great Lakes port through most of the 19th century. Commercial shipyards were built that adjoined Navy Point. In 1817 a local consortium of military officers and businessmen—General Jacob Brown, Commodore Melancthon Taylor Woolsey, Charles Smyth, Eric Lusher, Elisha Camp, Samuel F. Hooker, and Hunter Crane—financed the construction of the 240-ton &quot;Ontario&quot;. It was the first US steamboat to be built west of the Hudson River and operated on the Great Lakes. This was the beginning of extensive steamboat traffic on the Great Lakes, including passenger boats that stopped at towns around the lakes.

On July 12, 1834, Louis Hooker, a son of Samuel Hooker, was aboard the schooner &quot;Illinois&quot; from Sackets Harbor when it was the first commercial ship to enter Chicago harbor, a sign of what was soon to be greatly increased Great Lakes trade with that city and region. Samuel F. Hooker and his sons had shipping interests in Sackets Harbor with national networks; their firm had steamboats based in Louisville, Kentucky. These were part of the Mississippi River trade to and from New Orleans, a major port and one of the wealthiest cities in the nation before the American Civil War. Thus Hooker and similar upstate New York businessmen gained some of their wealth from the domestic slave trade, as Louisville was a major shipping point for slaves sold to New Orleans markets and the Deep South.

As cities industrialized and major economic development moved West, from 1870–1930 the village became a popular destination for families taking lengthy summer vacations. It attracted visitors from Chicago and other major cities around the Great Lakes, many of whom had family who had lived in Sackets Harbor before the mid-19th century westward migration. Some maintained second homes in historic properties of the village.

In the early 21st century, heritage tourism and summer recreation have been renewed sources of growth for the village. Navy Point is a marina providing moorings and facilities for private boats.

The Elisha Camp House, Galloo Island Light, Madison Barracks, Sackets Harbor Battlefield, Sackets Harbor Village Historic District, and Union Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On May 15, 2018, residents voted to dissolve the village by a vote of 112–70, and it took effect on December 31, 2018. As of the 2019 American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau still lists Harrisville as a village.

==History==
In 1815, Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of Napoleon I and former King of Spain, purchased a tract of land from James Le Ray, part of which became the town of Diana. Harrisville, the largest community in the town, takes its name from Foskit Harris, who settled there in 1833. Harris constructed a sawmill and gristmill, harnessing the West Branch of the Oswegatchie River for power to operate the mills. When early settlers discovered that the landlord John LaFarge, from whom La Fargeville, New York, takes its name, had acquired title to Bonaparte&#x27;s land, they abandoned the area, and Harrisville languished for 20 years.

In 1859, Samuel H. Beach and William R. Dodge built a massive tannery on the east side of the river. The structure had 160 vats and was capable of turning out 40,000 sides of sole leather per year. In 1879, David Botchford and Co. acquired the tannery, which closed in 1902.

By 1880 Harrisville had become the commercial and industrial center of the town of Diana. The abundant natural resource of forests and water shaped industrial development and served to attract investors and residents supported by a chair factory, a sash and door factory, and several active lumber dealers. In addition, carriage makers, blacksmiths, a harness shop, and numerous general merchandise stores and retail service establishments such as barbershops and hotels supported community development.

The Carthage &amp; Adirondack Railroad came to Harrisville in 1887, replacing the earlier, unsuccessful Black River &amp; St. Lawrence Railroad, which had relied on maple rails to support heavy locomotives. The Carthage &amp; Adirondack transported leather, lumber, and paper from Harrisville mills. As a common carrier, the railroad also brought visitors to Lake Bonaparte and other vacation spots in the northern Adirondacks. The depot is now home to the Town of Diana Historical Museum.

Around 1905, the Diana Paper Company built a mill on the Botchford Tannery&#x27;s former location. The mill primarily produced paper for magazines and catalogs. During World War I, the company experienced financial difficulty because of unfavorable wood contracts. After years of struggle, the company filed for bankruptcy in 1927. St. Regis Paper Company acquired the mill and ran it until 1954, when the Harrisville Paper Company bought it. The mill ceased operations in 1957.
