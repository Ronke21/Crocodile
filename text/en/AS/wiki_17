<text>Waverly is the largest village in Tioga County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 U.S. census, Waverly had a population of 4,177. It is located southeast of Elmira in the Southern Tier region. This village was incorporated as the southwest part of the town of Barton in 1854. The village name was conceived by Joseph &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Hallett, founder of its first Fire Department and pillar of the community, dropping the second &quot;e&quot; from the name of his favorite author&#x27;s novel, &quot;Waverley&quot; by Sir Walter Scott. The former village hall is listed on the National Historic Places list.

Waverly is part of the Binghamton metropolitan area. The village was previously a regular stop on the Black Diamond Express passenger service. It is located in the Penn-York Valley, a once thriving Rust Belt railroad region that spans Northeastern Pennsylvania and New York and includes Waverly in New York state and South Waverly, Sayre, and Athens in Pennsylvania. The region&#x27;s combined population is nearly 30,000 and the village&#x27;s population was 4,444 as of the 2010 census. 
==History==
In earlier times, this territory was a prime location for Native American travel, trade, and warfare because of its strategic location a valley surrounding the confluence of two rivers along the New York state border where the mouth of the Chemung River empties into the Susquehanna River as it turns southward into Pennsylvania. This locale was likely occupied by the Susquehannock people for several centuries before European pathfinders discovered this place. 

===European settlement===
French explorer Étienne Brûlé was probably the first European to visit the area, meeting with the Susquehannocks and travelling down the Susquehanna River in 1615. In the wake of the Beaver Wars of the mid-Seventeenth Century, the area came firmly under the control of the Iroquois, until the Sullivan Expedition during the American Revolutionary War broke their power. The Battle of Newtown (August 29, 1779), the only major battle of that expedition, occurred approximately west of the current location of Waverly.

John Shepard was one of the more prominent early white settlers, buying , including all of what would become Waverly, and building a mill on the banks of Cayuta Creek in 1796. The settlement would soon become known as Milltown, just across the border in Pennsylvania. A second mill site on the creek north of the border would soon be known as Factoryville, now East Waverly. An adjacent smaller community named Villemont also became established. At the beginning of the railroad age the community began to thrive. 

From 1849 to 1851, the New York &amp; Erie Railroad reached the vicinity, opening a rail connection eastward to New York City via Binghamton, and westward to Lake Erie via Elmira. In 1854, Waverly was incorporated as a village. 

Waverly increased its viability and became an important railroad junction, when construction of the Lehigh Valley Railroad from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania reached northward to this village in 1869 and effectively linked both railway operations. This also helped spur the economic development of Waverly&#x27;s southern neighbor Sayre, Pennsylvania, home to Lehigh Valley Railroad&#x27;s locomotive yard and shops. At the height of the railroad age, approximately 41 trains entered the village per day and the population of the village was nearly triple what it is today.

===19th century===
 

In May 1870, a Waverly banker named Howard Elmer, along with Charles Anthony and James Fritcher, bought the Pine Plains area between Waverly and Athens. Elmer convinced Asa Packer to locate a new railroad repair facility on the Pine Plains for the expanding Lehigh Valley Railroad, which was making a push north from Duryea at the Lackawanna to connect to the Erie Railroad at Waverly to achieve a market share in the much coveted New York City-Great Lakes sweepstakes. Robert Heysham Sayre, president of the Pennsylvania and New York Railroad, helped cement the deal. The town was named in his honor. Sayre was incorporated on January 27, 1891. The town would become famous for its extensive rail yard (still appreciably large today at half the peak size) and more famous for the railroad repair shops and steam locomotive repair and manufacturing shops situated in the town, which employed thousands.
===20th century===
In 1904, when the locomotive shops were built at Sayre, the main shop building was believed to be the largest structure in the world under one roof, but held that title for only a brief time. The railroad founded as a coal rail road in 1855 to connect the Coal Region operated through traffic up the Susquehanna to Elmira and points north and west from 1870 until 1976, but maintenance facilities were shifted away before that with the switch away from anthracite steam locomotives to diesels post-World War II. With the decline of the steam railway industry, business commerce and supporting industries have shifted away from the valley while jobs and population have also declined since 1940; the railroad dependent rust belt towns beginning the process sooner because of dieselization of railroads.

The largest celebration in the village was held on August 26, 1910; the Old Home Celebration lasted four hours and packed the streets with spectators.

Several factories of historical significance contributed to a flourishing period in Waverly&#x27;s development. They included the Hall-Lyons furniture factory which was located on Broad Street and the Manoil Manufacturing Co. whose prominence as a toy company, especially from 1937 to 1941 when it produced hollow-cast toy soldiers, sometimes called dime store soldiers, along with toy airplanes and cars, was located on Providence Street. Businesses in and around Waverly in the 20th century included the Spencer Glove Company and the &quot;Waverly Sun&quot; newspaper, both owned by Hart I. Seely and located in Waverly; the Tioga Mills, Inc., a feed mill company and Agway (Country Foods Division) of Syracuse, New York, as a pet food plant. Others are the Food and Drug Research Laboratories, the State Line Auto Auction and O’Brien&#x27;s Inn, known for its scenic view of the Chemung Valley. The J. E. Rodeo Ranch operated during the 1940s and 1950s in Barton.

Grace Episcopal Church, the United States Post Office, Waverly Village Hall, and former Mary W. Muldoon High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Waverly is located in a river valley in the Allegheny Plateau just north of the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chemung rivers, along with Athens, Pennsylvania, South Waverly, Pennsylvania, and Waverly. Together, these small towns make up the greater area known as the Penn-York Valley, which includes locations in both New York and Pennsylvania. There is no physical border between the towns, and the grid of streets and avenues blend seamlessly from one town to another.

==Geography==
Waverly is located at (42.005247, -76.537892).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 2.3 square miles (6.1 km2), 2.3 square miles (5.9 km2) of which is land and 0.1 square mile (0.1 km2) of which is water. The total area is 2.14% water.

The Chemung River skirts the western edge of the village, and joins the Susquehanna River approximately south Waverly in Athens Township, Pennsylvania. Another Susquehanna tributary, Cayuta Creek, also known locally as Shepard&#x27;s Creek, flows through the eastern part of the village before joining the Susquehanna in Sayre, Pennsylvania.

Waverly is so close to New York state&#x27;s southern border that the village is part of a much larger community that runs into Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Waverly combines with South Waverly, Sayre and Athens, Pennsylvania to make up the larger community of the Penn-York Valley or simply &quot;The Valley&quot;, which has a state border running through it. Waverly is also a short distance from the border of Chemung County to the west.

==Recent events==

* Two Rivers State Park
In 2005, a parcel of scenic woodlands, surrounding the Waverly Reservoir property and encompassing Waverly Glen park, was designated as Two Rivers State Park for its location just north of the confluence of the Chemung River along the western edge of the village and the Susquehanna River to the south of the village. Hiking and biking trails may be available, as well as a large pond, picnic tables, a basketball court, two tennis courts, children&#x27;s gym equipment, covered pavilions, water taps and barbecue fireplaces. The sign at the entrance is gone. Directly south of the park, I86 (Rte 17) briefly enters Pennsylvania before re-entering New York State.
* Tioga Downs Horse Racing
In 2006, the horse racing track at Tioga Downs in neighboring Nichols NY, was expanded to include a Racino with the addition of casino facilities. State funding was secured for this facility, including $1,000,000 for the construction of a waste water treatment plant.
* Historical Downtown Preservation
A large portion of the former Snyder Hotel building in downtown Waverly collapsed during a severe weather storm in the summer of 2007, requiring emergency efforts to clear fallen bricks, wood and other building products and restore the safety of downtown operations. Concerns regarding safety remain with some of the historic buildings along Broad Street. Decisions remain as to whether to tear down or renovate these buildings. Waverly sought financial assistance under the state&#x27;s &quot;Restore New York&quot; funding program, but was unable to secure any. A tax increase referendum conducted December 11, 2008, resulted in voter approval to secure financing for what has subsequently led to the purchase and relocation of all village municipal services to the former Ithaca Street School, after outgrowing the available space at the historic Waverly Village Hall. On February 14, 2012, the Village of Waverly Trustees accepted a purchase offer for the former Village Hall building by a potential owner, who has agreed to abide by the New York State Historic Preservation Office regulations for its historical preservation.

<text>Cayuga Heights is a village in Tompkins County, New York, United States, and an upscale suburb of Ithaca, New York. The population was 4,114 at the 2020 census.

The Village of Cayuga Heights is in the Town of Ithaca, directly northeast of the City of Ithaca and the main campus of Cornell University. The village is home to many Cornell faculty members, including its president.

==History==
After the Revolutionary War, much of Central New York was divided into tracts to be given to veterans. Several veterans received lots in what is now Cayuga Heights and started farms.

In the early 1800s, Ithaca started to grow as a small city and inland port. In 1865, Ezra Cornell started Cornell University. Students and faculty members initially lived on campus and in Ithaca, but rapid expansion in the late 1800s and early 1900s spurred new development north of the Fall Creek gorge. Two trolley bridges were built across the gorge, and a streetcar connected downtown, Cornell, and the budding residential development north of the gorge.

In 1901, local businessmen Charles Newman and Jared Blood bought nearly 1,000 acres of farmland and started the Cayuga Heights Land Company. They hired landscape architect Harold Caparn, who designed the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, to design an organic, curving, park-like layout of roads and trees. Cayuga Heights was incorporated as a village in 1915, consisting of a one-half square mile of land from the City of Ithaca line to what is now Upland Road. In 1924, Cayuga Heights Elementary School was built.

After World War II, Cayuga Heights continued to expand. Community Corners Shopping Center was built as a small suburban shopping plaza for residents in 1947. In 1952, the village opened its wastewater treatment plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.

The village resisted attempts to be annexed by the growing City of Ithaca. Instead, it more than tripled in size in 1954 when it annexed approximately 1.4 square miles of land in the Town of Ithaca, extending from Upland Road to the Town of Lansing border. A large addition was built onto Cayuga Heights Elementary School in the late 1950s. In 1969, the First Congregational Church relocated from downtown Ithaca to a new building on the former site of the Country Club of Ithaca, which had relocated a mile east.

The village was a founding member of the Bolton Point Water System when it opened in the mid-1970s. In 1980, Cayuga Heights Elementary School closed due to declining enrollment. It reopened in 1988.

In 1995, the last large plot of open land in Cayuga Heights, the former Savage Farm, was developed into a retirement community, Kendal at Ithaca, by the Kendal Corporation. 

Kendal has since become home to many retired Cornell University faculty members; a local joke for many years was that it had the best physics department in the country, as Nobel Prize winner Hans Bethe, along with Boyce McDaniel, Dale Corson, and many other physicists, were long-time residents.

On January 12, 2015, the board of trustees of the Village of Cayuga Heights unanimously adopted a resolution declaring freedom from domestic violence to be a fundamental human right.

==Government and politics==
The main governmental body of the Village of Cayuga Heights is the board of trustees. Meetings are convened by the mayor or by an appointed deputy. The village offices are in Marcham Hall, a stone mansion built by a granddaughter of Ezra Cornell

===Mayors===
* Frederick G. Marcham, 1956–1987
* Ronald Anderson, 1988–2002
* Walter Lynn, 2003–2007
* Jim Gilmore, 2008–2012
* Kate Supron, 2012–May 2016
* Linda Woodard, June 2016–present

===Fire Department===
The Cayuga Heights Fire Department was founded in 1955 and provides fire, rescue, and ALS first-response emergency medical services to the village, areas of the Town of Ithaca, and parts of Cornell University. The department is an all-volunteer agency with response times averaging under three minutes. This is due to the department&#x27;s dedicated volunteers, as well as the innovative and highly successful &quot;bunker program&quot; that allows for 7-8 Firefighter/EMTs to live in a second-floor dormitory and provide duty shifts in exchange for their room in the station. Unlike conventional membership recruiting/acceptance methods, the department recruits and restricts new member acceptance to bi-annual &quot;recruit classes&quot; in tandem with the academic semesters. As a result, many firefighters are Cornell students.

The department&#x27;s current home, the Ronald E. Anderson Fire Station, was built in 2000 and named after the then-mayor. The fire company is technically a 501(c)(3) non-profit independent of the village, which allows it to sponsor annual fundraising drives.

===Police Department===
The Cayuga Heights Police Department is a small department consisting of a chief, a sergeant, four full-time officers, a clerk, and several part-time officers and school crossing guards.

==Deer controversy==

Cayuga Heights has received national attention for its large population of white-tailed deer, as many as 125 per square mile. Efforts to control the deer population have sparked huge controversy in the village.

In 2011, the village Board of Trustees approved a plan to reduce the deer population by sterilizing 20 to 60 does in two years while killing the remaining 160 to 200 deer in the village. Paul Curtis, a Natural Resources Professor at Cornell who has worked with the board of trustees, said &quot;The primary problems that the deer cause to the community are damage to garden plants, deer-vehicle accidents and the potential threat of the spread of foreign diseases.” Opponents of the deer culling program have criticized it as a &quot;war on sweet innocent deer&quot;, a &quot;brutal slaughter&quot;, and Cayuga Heights as a &quot;constant killing field&quot;. Local opposition group CayugaDeer.org has accused the board of trustees&#x27; actions as deceptive and dishonest, and sued the village to stop the culling. Few residents agreed to allow the village to cull deer on their property, and in November 2012, the board of trustees abandoned its plan to cull the deer, instead deciding to capture and sterilize does.

<text>Danby is a town in Tompkins County, New York, United States. The population was 3,457 at the 2020 census. The town is in the southern part of the county and is south of the city of Ithaca.

== History ==
The Cayuga people, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, occupied the land at the head of Cayuga Lake for centuries. Indigenous peoples were largely forced out of Upstate New York by the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition in 1779. The land that would become the Town of Danby was a part of the Watkins and Flint Purchase, a 336,380 acre patent granted by New York State to numerous eastern investors in 1794. Danby&#x27;s first European-American settlers, including Isaac and John Dumond and Jacob and Joseph Yaple, arrived in 1795.

The town of Danby was created from the town of Spencer on February 22, 1811. Danby was part of Tioga County until 1822 when it was annexed by Tompkins County. In 1839, a part of the town of Caroline was added to Danby, and part of Danby was lost to the town of Dryden in 1856.

The Ithaca-Owego Turnpike was completed through Danby in 1811, connecting Cayuga Lake with the Susquehanna River. Today, Route 96B generally follows the same route and continues to provide an important connection between Ithaca and Binghamton and communities downstate.

==Notable people==
* Prince and Lement Duplex, African American Revolutionary War veteran and his wife who moved to Danby from Connecticut in 1811
* William Grant Egbert, violinist and founder of the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892, which would later become Ithaca College, was born in Danby 
* Wilson Greatbatch, engineer and inventor from Buffalo, who held more than 325 patents, lived in Danby during his education at Cornell University in the late 1940s
* Samuel Parker, presbyterian minister who was ordained at the Danby Federated Church in 1812; author of &quot;Parker&#x27;s Exploring Tour Beyond the Rocky Mountains&quot;, an account of his 1835 trip to the Pacific Northwest

==Geography==
Tompkins County is often included in the Finger Lakes Region of New York State, but is sometimes included in the Southern Tier Region. The physical geography of Danby mirrors this duality as the drainage divide between the Susquehanna River and Lake Ontario runs across the town. Generally, waters in the northern and western portions of the town flow north into Cayuga Lake, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River, while waters in the southeastern portion of the town flow south into the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.

Danby is situated along the northern edge of the Allegheny Plateau, part of the Appalachian Mountains. The town is characterized by three primary land forms:

* The deep north-south valley of Cayuga Inlet in the western part of the town
* The western slopes of the Sixmile Creek valley in the northeastern part of the town
* A highland plateau in the central portion of the town rising in the north to Ithaca&#x27;s South Hill and narrowing in the south into the valley of Willseyville Creek

Elevations range from approximately 450 feet above sea level where Cayuga Inlet crosses the northern town line, to about 1230 feet at Town Hall in Danby Hamlet, to just over 1800 feet at Dawes Hill in the southwestern part of the town and Roundtop in the southeastern part of the town. The dramatic hill and valley lands of Danby have sometimes been referred to as the &#x27;Danby Highlands&#x27;.

==Transportation==
New York State Route 96B (Danby Road) runs north-south through the central portion of the town, generally along the route of the 1811 Ithaca-Owego Turnpike.

New York State Routes 34/96 runs north-south through the western portion of the town, through the valley of the Cayuga Inlet.

A Norfolk Southern Railway branch line between Sayre, PA and Ludlowville, NY runs through the western portion of the town, through the valley of the Cayuga Inlet. This railroad was built in 1871 as the Ithaca &amp; Athens Railroad and later become part of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. There was a depot in West Danby, on the north side of Station Road, east of the tracks. Passenger service to West Danby ended in the 1940s and passenger service on this line ended in 1961.

A former branch line of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad ran across the far northeastern part of the town, along the border with the Town of Caroline. This was originally built in 1834 as the Ithaca and Owego Railroad, one of the first in the United States. The line originally included two inclined planes to descend into Ithaca. These were rebuilt as a switchback railroad and leased to the DL&amp;W in 1855. The line was abandoned in 1956.

The Finger Lakes Trail crosses the town east-west through the Danby State Forest.

<text>Trumansburg is a village in Tompkins County, New York, United States. The population was 1,797 at the 2010 census. The name incorporates a misspelling of the surname of the founder, Abner Treman. The Tremans spelled their surname several different ways; &quot;Truman,&quot; however, was not one of them. The village&#x27;s application for a post office established the present spelling. The Village of Trumansburg is located within the Town of Ulysses and is northwest of Ithaca, New York.

==History==

The village was incorporated in 1872, in the former Central New York Military Tract. The village was originally named &quot;Tremaine&#x27;s Village&quot;, after an early settler, Abner Tremaine (Tremain, Treman), who was granted the land for his service in the American Revolutionary War. The village was built around a cascade on the creek that provided power for grain mills. 

In the 19th century Trumansburg was dominated by Col. Hermon Camp, an officer in the War of 1812 who settled in what was to become the village. For many years he was the local postmaster, and founded a bank, now the Tompkins Trust Company, the largest bank in the county. His imposing and elegant Greek Revival style house remains the largest in the village. The Hermon Camp House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the First Presbyterian Church of Ulysses, William Austin House, Indian Fort Road Site, and Second Baptist Society of Ulysses.

In the latter half of the 20th century, as the quality of the road between Trumansburg and Ithaca improved and &quot;country living&quot; became more fashionable, the village became home to many faculty and staff at nearby Cornell University and Ithaca College, as well as many musicians. Between 1961 and 1970, Robert Moog built electronic music equipment including Theremins and his famous synthesizers in a downtown storefront.

From 2004 to 2007, the mayor was John R. Levine, the original author of &quot;The Internet for Dummies&quot;.

==Village life==

Trumansburg was a milltown and commercial center for the agricultural community from its inception until the Second World War. Since the late 1940s it has become a combination of a bedroom suburb for Ithaca and a modest tourist destination, with restaurants and antique stores. Since 1991, the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance has taken place each July at the village fairgrounds and is hosted by nationally popular Trumansburg-based band Donna the Buffalo. From 1973 to 2016, the Rongovian Embassy to the USA (&quot;the Rongo&quot;) was a regional center for live music. The village is also located along the Cayuga Wine Trail and is close to Taughannock Falls.

Other cultural resources include the Ulysses Philomathic Library, a member of the Finger Lakes Library System, the Trumansburg Conservatory of Fine Arts, which offers concerts and music lessons, and the Ulysses Historical Society Museum, with collections of local historical material.

Baptist, Catholic, Episcopalian, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches are located within the village, with a Baptist church and a meetinghouse of the LDS Church located just outside the village limits.

The Trumansburg Central School District consists of the Elementary School, Russel I. Doig Middle School, and Charles O. Dickerson High School, all of which share a campus at 100 Whig Street. School and local athletic teams use the nickname the Blue Raiders. The Trumansburg Central School District Foundation provides financial support for local educational programs.

==Geography==
Trumansburg is located at (42.540447, -76.660121). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.83% is water. The village is located on the Trumansburg Creek (also known as Frontenac Creek) which arises on the ridge west of the village and empties into Cayuga Lake at Frontenac Point. Trumansburg is in the northern part of Tompkins County with its northern boundary bordering Seneca County. It is approximately 12 miles north of Ithaca, New York on the west side of Cayuga Lake. The scenic Taughannock Falls State Park, featuring one of the highest waterfalls east of the Rocky Mountains, is located just southeast of the village at the edge of Cayuga Lake.

===Climate===
Trumansburg has cold, snowy winters and enjoys warm, pleasant summers. The average annual temperature is , and the average annual precipitation is .

==Transportation==
Trumansburg is bisected by NY Route 96, a state highway, enlarged and re-routed in 1961, that runs north to Waterloo and south to Ithaca. Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT) (Route 21) provides local bus service to Ithaca with connections to long-distance bus and air service there.

In the 19th century, Trumansburg had a port at Frontenac Point, at the mouth of the Trumansburg Creek on Cayuga Lake. The lake is connected at its north end to the Erie Canal via the Cayuga-Seneca Canal. The docks, warehouses and hotels that made up the port have long since been torn down or have burned. Only scattered pilings remain, and the site is now a camp owned by the local Boy Scout council.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad ran through Trumansburg between September 13, 1873, and October 1962, when the portion south to Ithaca was abandoned and most of the easements sold to the New York Gas &amp; Electric Company (NYSEG). The portion north to Geneva was abandoned in 1967. In the last 15 years the state park system has bought back much of the right-of-way and is in the process of constructing a biking and hiking trail along the portion south to Ithaca. It is called the Black Diamond Trail, after the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s premier passenger train that ran between New York City and Buffalo along the line (although not stopping in Trumansburg).

<doc id="127450" wikidata="Q2489840" url="?curid=127450" title="Accord, New York">
<text>Accord (, ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Ulster County, New York, United States. Accord is located in the eastern part of the Town of Rochester (not to be confused with the City of Rochester) along US 209. Accord is the seat of town government. As of the 2020 census the population is 573.

Accord is also the name associated with the U.S. Postal Service Zip Code 12404, which takes in a much larger portion of Rochester than the CDP.

==History==
A Delaware and Hudson Canal town originally named Port Jackson, it is thought that the name &quot;Accord&quot; resulted from a petition of the townspeople to the Capitol in Albany for a new name. The response was that the authorities could not come to an accord about a new name so the name &quot;Accord&quot; was chosen. The local pronunciation of this word is with a flat &#x27;A&#x27; with the accent on the &#x27;A&#x27; (ACK-kord).

Accord is home to a Paleolithic site discovered in 2004 called the &#x27;Mettacahonts Creek Find&#x27;, as it is currently being reviewed there is evidence of the items recovered dating to a period earlier than the currently accepted arrival of humans in North America. The over 200 specimens recovered, in pristine condition, are unusual in that there are multiples of the same lithics and there are large examples not commonly found in typical lithic sites in North America. It is also believed that the site was used over a period of many thousands of years. The collection is privately owned.

Appeldoorn Farm, Common School No. 10, and Joachim Schoonmaker Farm, in rural areas near the hamlet, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
An application to list most of the hamlet on the Register as the Accord Historic District was filed with the U.S. National Park Service in December 2019; the next month it was approved and the district was listed.

Denning is located in the western part of the county, deep inside the Catskill Mountains. The location of the town in the Catskill State Park accounts in part for its low population.

== History ==
Denning was established in 1849 from part of the Town of Shandaken. The region had been part of the Hardenburgh Patent granted to Johannes Hardenburgh in 1708. William H. Denning, for whom the settlement was named, bought a tract of land at a tax sale.

Since the town is entirely within the Catskill Park, large tracts of land are owned by the state Department of Environmental Conservation as part of New York&#x27;s Forest Preserve. These forests are either in the Sundown Wild Forest in the eastern parts of the town or the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area in its central regions. Within the former are the three southernmost Catskill High Peaks: Peekamoose, Table and Lone mountains. At 3,847 feet (1,173 m), Table&#x27;s summit is the highest point in the town. Slide Mountain, the highest peak in the Catskills, is north of Denning.

<text>Ellenville is a village within the town of Wawarsing, Ulster County, New York, United States. Its population was 4,167 at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==
The village of Ellenville is about 90 miles northwest of New York City and 90 miles southwest of Albany. The village is located at the junction of routes NY 52 and U.S. Route 209, and is bisected by the recently designated Shawangunk Scenic Byway. Ellenville lies in the Rondout Valley, at the eastern base of the Catskill Mountains, and the western base of the Shawangunk Ridge, which is listed by the Nature Conservancy as one of the &quot;75 Last Great Places on Earth.&quot;

The north-flowing Sandburg Creek and east-flowing Beer Kill intersect in Ellenville near the current site of the Ellenville Central School and join the Rondout Creek, which flows north to join the Hudson River near Kingston. Ellenville is within the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 8.8 square miles (22.7 km2), of which 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2, 0.68%) is covered by water.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2010, 4,135 people, 1,578 households (occupied housing units), and 1,047 families were residing in the village. The population density was .

==Government==
Ellenville is one of three incorporated villages in Ulster County, along with New Paltz and Saugerties.

Ellenville village offices are housed at the Ellenville Government Center, 2 Elting Court. In 2007, the village transferred its offices and the police department from its location at North Main Street, primarily to address the old village hall&#x27;s limited space and failure to meet mandated handicapped-accessibility requirements.

The government of Ellenville is headed by an elected board composed of a mayor and four trustees. As of 2007, all terms were increased from two to four years, and elections were moved from March to November, to be held on odd-numbered years only. Daily administration of Ellenville is supervised by an appointed village manager, an appointed village clerk, an appointed village treasurer, and department heads for the five departments: police, street, building and code enforcement, water, sewer.

== History ==
The area was originally called &quot;Socconessing&quot; by the first inhabitants, the Esopus Munsee of the Lenape. &quot;Socconessing&quot; means &quot;a muddy place where the water comes out&quot;, referencing the Sandburg Creek. The Esopus lived in this area for thousands of years before being pushed out by the early pioneers.

The first building erected in what is now the center of the village was built around 1798 by Alpheus Fairchild, who moved west from Connecticut. However, in what is now the easternmost part of the village, the Bodley homestead most likely stood well before the Revolution, as did portions of the Bevier and Sax farms. It was named &quot;Fairchild City&quot; or just &quot;The City&quot; after Alpheus Fairchild, who bought most of today&#x27;s village in 1798 from John A. DeWitt; Fairchild had a dwelling erected on part of the site where the George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building stands today. Nathan and Maria Hoornbeek bought the dwelling and enlarged it, converting it into an inn. The Hoornbeek Tavern was a gathering place for the citizens, and many important decisions about the community were made at meetings held there. Indeed, the decision to change the name of the community to &quot;Ellenville&quot; was proposed at the Hoornbeek Tavern. Village leaders, unable to agree upon a new name, were persuaded by Ellen Snyder, Maria Hoornbeek&#x27;s sister, to name the village after her.

Charles Hartshorn came to &quot;The City&quot; to try a case in the Hoornbeek Tavern in 1823. He opened the first store that same year, and led a drive to choose a &quot;real&quot; name for the community. Hartshorn also applied to the federal government for approval of a post office and was named the first postmaster. He later erected a home for his family on the former site of the Hoornbeek Tavern. In 1856, he was elected first president of the newly incorporated village of Ellenville.

Noted American composer Homer Newton Bartlett resided at 32 Maple Avenue in Ellenville for many years during the late 19th century.

Just north of the village, the Joseph Y. Resnick Airport (N89) is named in honor and memory of U.S. Congressman Joseph Yale Resnick, a Wawarsing native. Ellenville Regional Hospital, just north of the airport, and the Nevele Tower, just south of the village, were both dedicated by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson, at Congressman Resnick&#x27;s request.

Ellenville was the fourth community featured on ABC&#x27;s television show, &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;, recorded in New York City on August 6, 2005, and broadcast on September 4, 2005.

The village&#x27;s Christ Lutheran Church and Parsonage, Ellenville Downtown Historic District, George and John R. Hunt Memorial Building, and United States Post Office are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Ellenville has three copies of the statue known as &quot;The Boy with the Leaking Boot&quot;.

Due to good launch sites and favorable weather conditions, Ellenville became a major center for the development of hang gliding in the 1970s and 1980s. The area is now home to three major hang-gliding schools and is considered one of the best sites for instruction east of the Mississippi. On most weekends, hang gliders can be seen launching off of two sites on the Shawangunk Ridge just south of Nevele and Honors Haven.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Church===
Father John Raffeiner was a German priest who ministered to German-speaking Catholics throughout the Diocese of New York well before it was split into the dioceses of Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, and Newark. Ellenville was one of his less accessible destinations, but he formed a congregation there in 1850. Rev. John Raufeisen became pastor and built a small frame structure known as St. Mary&#x27;s. Raufeisen also established the Church of Sts. Michael and Wendilinus in Ulster Heights, and the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Woodbourne, where a number of Bavarians had settled. He preached in Bridgeville, Callicoon, Fallsburgh, Grahamsville, Lackawack, Neversink, North Branch, Otisville, Stephen&#x27;s, and Factories. Raffeiner assisted in establishing St. Peter&#x27;s for the German community of Rondout. From 1861 Raufeisen lived in Rondout, where the need was greater, but continued to visit Ellenville.

In 1864, Rev. George J. Veith was appointed pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s, Ellenville, although he resided in Jeffersonville. In 1871, Rev. Constantine Van Drost became St. Mary&#x27;s first resident pastor. In 1881, Rev. Andrew J. Sauer built a new church, dedicated to St. Andrew. In 1903, a dam above the village burst, threatening to carry away St. Mary&#x27;s, when a floating barge lodged against a tree, diverting the water.

==Transportation and commerce==
One of the first roads in America, the Old Mine Road, which followed earlier Indian trails, led to sporadic Dutch and later settlements along its length from New Jersey to Kingston, including Ellenville, but with no navigable rivers, the construction of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal in the 1820s led to the first major boom in development of Ellenville as a canal town and manufacturing center. The D&amp;H Canal was eventually superseded at the close of the 19th century by the New York, Ontario and Western Railway, more commonly known as the O&amp;W or NYO&amp;W, which opened up a significant tourism and hospitality industry, including dozens of hotels, inns, boarding houses, and bungalow colonies. The eventual modernization of the Old Mine Road into US 209 continued to bring vacationers to the area, even after passenger railroad service was discontinued in the 1940s. Relatively inexpensive and increased air travel beginning in the 1960s, a generational change in tastes, and, most recently, the economic downturn&#x27;s impact on tourism in general, though, have taken their toll. The Nevele Hotel, perhaps the most famous local resort, was closed in 2009. Its sister resort hotel, the Fallsview, has recently been purchased and renamed Honor&#x27;s Haven, and has undergone major renovations and introduced health-related programs in an attempt to attract new customers.

The canal and westward expansion led to various industrial opportunities. Reportedly, very pioneer wagon heading west carried a Napanoch axe and an Ellenville demijohn. Ellenville pottery and glassworks still remain sought-after collector items; many examples are on display at the Ellenville Public Library&#x27;s Terwilliger House Museum. Knife manufacturing was a major industry in Ellenville and Napanoch for over 100 years; the Ulster Knife Company set up in the 1870s, eventually merging with Imperial Knife Company and Schrade Cutlery, finally becoming Imperial Schrade until its closing in 2004.

In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of the lost Old Spanish Tunnel at the base of the Shawangunk Ridge in Ellenville led to the development of the Sun-Ray Spring and the international marketing by White Rock beverage entrepreneur Frank T. Huntoon of Sun-Ray Water, tested and promoted as the &quot;World&#x27;s Purest Spring Water&quot;. Although beset by financial difficulties from its inception, the water and its carbonated derivatives were sold until the early 1920s, and redeveloped as &quot;Pure Rock Mineral Water&quot; in 1939, also serving as a base for Pepsi-Cola bottled in Ellenville during World War II.

In the late 1940s, Joseph Resnick, a radio officer in the U.S. Merchant Marine during the war, developed a turnable DIY antenna system just as the TV boom was taking off. With his brothers Harry and Louis, he created Channel Master, and built one of the region&#x27;s major manufacturing plants just north of the Ellenville border, along with an aluminum plant to fabricate necessary components. After selling the company to Avnet, production moved to South Carolina. The vacated Channel Master factory was eventually bought by Imperial Schrade, and the aluminum plant by VAW, and later Hydro Aluminum; both factories closed in the 2000s, leaving hundreds unemployed, compounding Ellenville&#x27;s economic doldrums that began with a decline of the tourism and hotel industry in the 1960s, and the development of regional shopping malls, which directed much shopping traffic away from the village.

==Education==
The village is in the Ellenville Central School District. Ellenville is served by Ellenville Central School for prekindergarten to grade 12. In 1938, Ellenville adopted the Blue Devil as the official mascot.

<doc id="127456" wikidata="Q3709827" url="?curid=127456" title="Esopus, New York">
<text>Esopus ( ) is a town in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 9,548 at the 2020 census. The town was named after the local indigenous tribe and previously thought to mean &quot;small river&quot; in English. However, in the Lenape` language, the word translates to &quot;Wellspring of Creation&quot;. The Esopus people were one of the Lenape (Delaware) bands, belonging to a people who ranged from western Connecticut through lower New York, western Long Island, and parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania along the Delaware River. The town is on the west bank of the Hudson River south of the city of Kingston. Its center is in Port Ewen. US Route 9W passes along the eastern side of the town.

==History==
The town was founded in 1811 from territory taken from Kingston, New York, which also was called &quot;Esopus&quot; at one time. It was officially formed on April 5, 1811. In 1818, a part of it was set off to Kingston, and a portion of Hurley was annexed. On April 12, 1842, a portion of New Paltz was annexed, making up what is mostly present-day Esopus.

The first known European to settle in the area was a trapper by the name of Christoffel &quot;Kit&quot; Davits, who bartered with the Esopus people, a branch of the Lenape. Around 1652 or 1653 many settlers moved south from the Manor of Rensselaerswyck where they had worked the patroon&#x27;s land.

During the American Revolution, a colonial prison was established there in the fall of 1777 to house overcrowding of a prison ship anchored offshore. The British army attacked this settlement in the same year and burned it to the ground.

The Cumming-Parker House, Esopus Meadows Lighthouse, Col. Oliver Hazard Payne Estate, Poppletown Farmhouse, and Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Klyne Esopus Holy Cross Monastery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other noteworthy structures in Esopus include the Mount Academy.

==Notable people==

In the early 19th century, Esopus was a popular summer residence for wealthy American families such as the Astors, Durkees, Paynes, Rockefellers, Smiths, Tiffanys and Whitneys, who built architecturally significant mansions and hunting lodges on the west bank of the Hudson River, across from the Vanderbilt and Roosevelt estates on the east bank.

Historical figures and celebrated people who have lived in Esopus include naturalist John Burroughs; financier Harry Payne Bingham; abolitionist Sojourner Truth; 19th-century U.S. politician George W. Pratt; Standard Oil treasurer Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne; business leader and president of Avco Corporation Raymond Rich; the Smith Brothers, who invented the first cough drops in America; Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini (patron saint of immigrants); Major Gen. Daniel Butterfield, who founded the American Express Company and wrote &quot;Taps&quot; in 1862; Eugene R. Durkee, who made a fortune in spices and salad dressings and whose West Park summer mansion became part of the Christian Brothers monastery; John Jacob Astor III; boxing champion Floyd Patterson who attended Wiltwyck School for Boys in West Park; and Alton Brooks Parker, a lawyer and judge who ran for U.S president as the 1904 Democratic party nominee, losing to incumbent Theodore Roosevelt.

In the early part of the 21st century, Esopus became known as a haven for artists and performers, including Academy Award-, Emmy Award- and Tony Award-winning actress Frances McDormand, singer and Broadway actress Kelli O&#x27;Hara, actor Sebastian Roché, director Joel Coen, choreographer/director Joe Langworth, actress Blair Ross, Emmy Award-winning actor Peter Dinklage, actress Connie Ray, and reality television personality Luann de Lesseps.

==United Nations==

In 1946, Esopus was under consideration for the United Nations headquarters. The community was not alone: no fewer than 248 towns in New York State were among the possible locations, along with cities in other parts of the United States and in nearly every European country. On January 9, 1946, a photo appeared in the &quot;Kingston Daily Freeman&quot;, with a caption reading, &quot;The local UNO Committee mapping a tentative itinerary for the Sub-Committee of the United Nations Organization (UNO) was impressed with the view shown above from Camp Chi-Wan-Da on the River road between Port Ewen and Ulster Park.&quot;

Many local property owners organized to oppose the proposed UN headquarters, however, fearing eminent domain. Ultimately, a donation of more than eight million dollars by John D. Rockefeller Jr. for 16 acres of land in Manhattan provided the UN with its current headquarters in 1948.

<text>Glasco is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 2,013 at the 2020 census.

Glasco is a community in the Town of Saugerties east of U.S. Route 9W. The community is north of Kingston.

==Geography==
Glasco is located at (42.047539, -73.952860).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (29.92%) is water.

Glasco is on the west bank of the Hudson River.

==History==

Glasco&#x27;s name was taken from a glass company located in the mountain area several miles inland. The glass was carried by horse down the &quot;Glasco Turnpike&quot; to the banks of the Hudson where it was shipped on for ports of sale. The settlement along the river where the glass was loaded became known as Glasco.

Settled largely by unskilled workers, first from Ireland and then from Italy, they came to the area in great numbers in the late 19th century by ferry after landing in New York City. They tended to live in company housing on the banks of the river. At one point, the town boasted over six brick factories, a ferry service, a school, churches and several saloons. Bricks were sent down the Hudson River by barge to furnish the construction of America&#x27;s cities. The Hudson River also played a role in other economic activities. Some entrepreneurial immigrants opened small businesses to service the community, such as harvesting ice from the Hudson River, which was stored in large ice houses along the banks of the river and sold in the summers to homes and businesses. Fishing was also a cottage industry among those not working in the brickyards. In the bluffs above the clay mining operations of the brickyards, small estates and dairy farms were established.

By the mid 20th century, the brick yards had all closed down. One family operator, Washburn, allegedly relocated to Virginia to continue brick making. Other brickyards were abandoned and simply vanished into the undergrown of trees and wildlife.

Recently, residents of New York City have begun to purchase weekend homes within the boundaries of Glasco. At the foot of the Catskill Mountains, and within walking distance of the Hudson River (relatively unpolluted at that point), the hamlet has seen real estate prices skyrocket since 2000, along with an increase in single-family home construction.

<text>Hardenburgh is a town located in the western part of Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 221 at the 2020 census. The town is located inside the Catskill Park.

== History ==
Hardenburgh was established in 1859 from the Towns of Denning and Shandaken. The town was named for Johannes Hardenbergh, a landowner and patentee.

Between 1976 and 1983, 236 residents—more than half the town&#x27;s residences—became ministers of the Universal Life Church (an organization allowing mail-in &quot;ordinations&quot;), as part of a bid to obtain tax exemptions and as a protest against high property taxes. The ordination movement, which included some subsistence farmers and loggers, were angered at the tax burden that fell on them, which was high because of the thousands of acres of land within the town owned by tax-exempt religious and civil organizations (including the Zen Buddhists&#x27; Dai Bosatsu Zendo, the Nassau County Boy Scouts, the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, and a group of Tibetan monks). Ultimately, in 1982, the New York State Court of Appeals held that Hardenburgh&#x27;s &quot;mail-order ministers&quot; were not entitled to exemptions from property tax unless the land was exclusively for church use.

The Balsam Lake Mountain Fire Observation Station, Coykendall Lodge, and Grant Mills Covered Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is almost exclusively residential; in the 1990s, it had a single general store. The town adopted its first zoning ordinance in 1992.

==Geography and topography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.28%) is water.

The town is the westernmost town in Ulster County, deep in the Catskill Mountains. It sits north of the town of Denning. A 1907 work described Hardenburgh as having &quot;some of the most rugged and austere natural features&quot; in the county, with a rocky, stony topography ill-suited for agriculture. The landscape is characterized by mountain crags with occasional valley and forestland, and various lakes, streams, and glens. Among the Catskill High Peaks within the town&#x27;s limits are Graham Mountain, Balsam Mountain, and Eagle Mountain.

Because of the mountains, the only direct route from Hardenburgh to the rest of the county are hiking trails over them. Any vehicular traffic must go through either Sullivan or Delaware counties.

One of those lesser mountains, Dry Brook Ridge, effectively divides the town as well. The portion north of it, in the Dry Brook valley, uses the ZIP code and telephone exchange of the nearby Delaware County hamlet of Arkville. The portion to the south, containing the headwaters of the famous Beaver Kill trout stream, is likewise oriented to the Sullivan County hamlet of Lew Beach to its south, although it contains a few of its own unique toponyms such as Turnwood, its only real road junction.

Alder Lake, a 45-acre impoundment made in the 1900s, is also located in the town.

<doc id="127459" wikidata="Q3460901" url="?curid=127459" title="High Falls, New York">
<text>High Falls is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 700 at the 2020 census.

Portions of High Falls are located in the towns of Marbletown, Rosendale, and Rochester.

==History==
The High Falls Historic District and Lock Tender&#x27;s House and Canal Store Ruin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

High Falls takes its name from the nearby feature on Rondout Creek, where the creek cuts through a large rock formation and goes over a large waterfall. It was an attractive source of water power, and millers were drawn to it from colonial times. The first bridge to nearby Stone Ridge, on the main road through the valley between the Shawangunks and Catskills, was built during this time. The stone Jacob DePuy House, from 1797 (expanded in mid-19th century), reflects this era and retains much of its original fabric.

A large stone house with a large American flag draped across its upper right story behind an evergreen tree. In front of it is a blue and gold historical marker on the Jacob DePuy house. In the early 19th century, a cotton and woolen factory in the hamlet made it a center of local manufacturing, serving many of the farms in the surrounding area. This set the stage for the construction and opening of the canal in 1828. The D &amp; H was built to transport anthracite coal from Northeastern Pennsylvania to New York City via Kingston, where it was transferred to ships plying the Hudson River.

High Falls would be important not only for its location at a key water crossing, spanned by a John A. Roebling aqueduct, and frequent layover on the canal, but for the natural cement discovered at nearby Rosendale during the canal&#x27;s construction, which needed the millpower. As the canal remained in operation for the remainder of the century, it would transform the hamlet from an isolated rural community to a bustling, yet small, industrial town, especially after the canal was expanded in 1850 to handle bigger barges. In addition to the facilities built by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, such as a lock tender&#x27;s house and general store, small stores and shops were built nearby to take advantage of the canal traffic. They and the hamlet&#x27;s street and block layout still exist today, a testament to that period.

Development declined along with the canal&#x27;s fortunes, and the district has changed little since the canal ceased operations in 1899, other than the state&#x27;s relocation of the portion of New York Route 213 that goes through it in 1956. Its post-canal future began thirty years earlier. The road extending down from the Shawangunks had made High Falls a point of embarkation via carriage for canal or rail travelers destined for Mohonk Mountain House atop the ridge. This may have helped it establish itself as a vacation or weekend destination of its own, a reputation it still enjoys today. The nearby hills and fields and their mountain vistas are home to many second homes for residents of New York City and its downstate suburbs. The shops and stores are now boutiques and restaurants that cater to them on weekends and in summertime.

==History==

===Colonial Era===
Kerhonkson was the site of a colonial fort, on Deyo&#x27;s Hill, that served settler-colonial interests.

Before the Burning of Kingston on October 12, 1777, all the important documents of the nascent New York state government and government officials were moved to Kerhonkson, remaining for two weeks until they were moved to Albany, making Kerhonkson briefly the capital of New York.

===Canal Era===
The Delaware and Hudson Canal was completed in 1828. This opened up local industries such as coal, lumber, dairy, and hotel. Barges towed by mules transported goods along Rondout Creek from Pennsylvania to the Hudson River. In the canal era, Kerhonkson was known as Middleport 

===Railroad Era===
The Delaware and Oswego Railroad was constructed in 1909 along the old canal towpath and a station was constructed along Main Street to ship out dairy products. The Summitville to Kingston segment was acquired by the New York, Ontario and Western. In the line&#x27;s waning years, passenger service was reduced to Sunday and holiday service, and summer only. The tracks were pulled up in 1957 once products were being moved by truck upstate. The path is now a popular local hiking and biking destination known as the Rail Trail. It is 3.5 miles long.

===Peg Leg Bates===
In 1951, the famed tap dancer Peg Leg Bates became the first African-American resort owner in the Catskills when he opened the Peg Leg Bates Country Club in Palentown, a hamlet in the northern end of the Kerhonkson Zip Code. His wife Alice E. Bates died in 1987, and Bates leased the property to a new owner, Doreen Richardson, in 1989. Part of Route 209 in Ulster County was named “Clayton Peg Leg Bates Memorial Highway” in his honor.

Richardson operated the former Peg Leg Bates club as the &quot;Mountain Valley Resort&quot; until her death in 2012.

The Peg Leg Bates resort played an important role in the history of the civil rights movement in 1966 when a meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) held there voted to expel whites from its staff.

==Religion==
Congregation Tifereth Yehuda Veyisroel is the primary Jewish temple in the area. It was constructed in 1924. The community house also found on that property was constructed in 1954. In 2013 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Federated Church of Kerhonkson is a Protestant church that is partially of the Methodist denomination and partially of the Reformed denomination. The church has a food pantry (&quot;Christ&#x27;s Cupboard&quot;), a thrift shop, and a pet food pantry.

Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church is located on Foordmore Road. The parish is part of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford.

The Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes on Route 209 in Kerhonkson is a Catholic mission associated with the parish of St. Mary and St. Andrew in Ellenville.

==Local sports==
Kerhonkson has hosted a baseball Little League, Indian Valley Little League, since 1953. Indian Valley won the 2017 District 16 championship, defeating Rondout Valley Little League. More recently Indian Valley removed its longtime mascot, Chief Wahoo, from signs, shirts, hats, website, and Facebook for its racial insensitivity.

The local swim team, the Kerhonkson Barracudas, are based out of the Kerhonkson Elementary School pool and compete against other local teams in the summer.

==Local services==
The Kerhonkson Fire Department is on Main Street near where the railroad used to be. It has a social hall that holds meetings of local organizations, dinners, and parties.

The Kerhonkson-Accord Volunteer Ambulance Corp is along Route 209 and provides first aid service for both Kerhonkson and Accord.

==Education==
The CDP is in Rondout Valley Central School District.

Kerhonkson Elementary School is one of two elementary schools in the Rondout Valley Central School District.

==World records==

<text>Milton is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 1,650 at the 2020 census. The locale was named after John Milton, an English poet.

The community of Milton is located in the northeastern part of the town of Marlborough.

==History==
Captain William Bond was the first settler of record in the area of Milton, having obtained a patent from Queen Anne on June 12, 1712, which patent reserved the right to any trees fit for masts, planks, or otherwise suitable for her majesty&#x27;s navy. Although Bond followed the sea, he served as deputy surveyor in Marlborough in 1717. Edward Hallock was a seafaring man who owned several vessels, all but one being destroyed by French cruisers. He and his family relocated from Long Island to Milton in late December 1760, and subsequently purchased land from Captain Bond&#x27;s daughter Sukie. Hallock was a preacher in the Society of Friends.

In 1770 Captain Anning Smith constructed a small square dock on the river, where he built a wooden mill. The road leading to it, called the King&#x27;s highway, was one of the first roads opened for the settlers living farther inland. Around 1845 the &quot;old dock&quot; came into possession of investors from Poughkeepsie, who established a factory for the manufacture of pins. Sloops were built and launched near here. In 1844 Sumner Colman started a wheel-barrow factory at the pin factory dock. In 1880 Henry H. Bell, from Long Island, started a plush and glove-lining factory at the site of the old pin factory. This later expanded to include the site of the former wheelbarrow factory which had burned in 1852.

In 1802 Charles Millard had two sawmills specializing in white pine. In the summer timber arrived in rafts sent down river from Glens Falls, Fort Edward, and around Lake Champlain. In winter most of the lumber was shipped from the east side of the river hauled by teams over the ice. In 1824 Charles Millard moved across the river to New Hamburg, establishing a lumber yard there. His son Walter carried on the business on the west side. Millard and Mills&#x27; steamboat &quot;Splendid&quot; sailed daily from the Milton dock.

James Hall and Jacob Rowley ran auger factories in Milton at an early date. In 1822 Moses Birdsall ran a hat factory. Jesse I. Conklin had a general store, one of three in the village. The &quot;National Pioneer&quot; was published at Milton in 1830, by Daniel S. Tuthill. Sands and Lockwood maintained a freight line to New York. William Carpenter, whose ancestors hailed from Wales, came to Milton around 1853 from Plattekill. Carpenter practiced surveying and had a fruit farm. In 1863 L. Harrison Smith opened a coal and lumber yard at Milton landing.

The Milton Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

===Churches===
====United Methodist====
Circuit riders served the Methodists in this village as far back as 1786. Meetings were held in the home of James Perry. On November 16, 1812 the Milton M.E. Society was incorporated. A church building was erected on the former Sands property. The Milton Methodist Church is the oldest Methodist building in Ulster County. It remained a circuit station until 1858 D.W.C Van Gaasbeck became the first pastor. The Marlboro Methodists joined the Milton Methodists in 1982 to form one congregation. In 2012 the community celebrated its 200th anniversary.

====St. James Roman Catholic Church====
Irish Catholics began to arrive in Milton around 1850. To hear Mass they had to go by horse-boat to a place called &quot;The Hollow&quot; near Wappingers Falls. Some went to Poughkeepsie. In 1865 Milton became a mission of Rosendale and was attended every two or three weeks by a Father O&#x27;Toole and later by Rev. Patrick Brady. In 1867 Rev. Michael Phelan of Port Ewan purchased the old Methodist meeting house in Marlboro where Mass was said for Catholics of Marlboro and Milton. In 1874 Rev. James Francis Mee was appointed first resident pastor in Milton with missions at Marboro and Ireland Corners (otherwise known as Gardiner).

In 1882 Father Mee purchased land for a Catholic cemetery in Lattintown, interments having been made previously in a cemetery near Poughkeepsie. Upon Mee&#x27;s transfer to Rye in 1886, his successor, Rev. James L. Hoey also took charge of the missions in Marlboro and Roseton. Father Richard B. Cushion served from November 1909 to May 1913. Cushion is remembered for having been particularly attentive to the needs of the Italian members of the congregation. They initially came to the area as farm laborers picking berries; many went on to become permanent farmers and fruit dealers.

In August 2015, the parish of St. James merged with St. Mary&#x27;s CAT church where all people may be cats.

<doc id="127474" wikidata="Q7186711" url="?curid=127474" title="Phoenicia, New York">
<text>Phoenicia is a hamlet (and census-designated place) of Shandaken in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 268 at the 2020 census, making it the second highest populated community in the town. The village center is located just off Route 28 at its junction with Route 214 and is nestled at the base of three peaks, Mount Tremper, Romer Mountain, and Sheridan Mountain. The community sits at the confluence of the Esopus Creek and Stony Clove Creek. A popular getaway for New Yorkers, the hamlet has frequented many tourism guides as among the best vacation towns in the greater New York City area.

== History ==
The geographic area that would eventually be named Phoenicia was fertile hunting and fishing land for the Mohawk, Mohican, and Lenape peoples for hundreds of years before European settlers arrived. Of particular note are the Esopus Lenape, who are believed to be the people who spent the most time in the area.

The first European settlement in the area is believed to be in the mid-18th century, as Ulster county as a whole began to see more European immigration and land access in the more fertile lower valleys became restricted. These access restrictions particularly began to push poorer subsistence farmers into the Catskill mountains. Most of these early settlers were of Dutch, English, and Scottish origin, with Dutch being the most commonly spoken European language.

The 19th century saw industry move into the area, with tanning becoming the dominant employer early and eventually ceding to bluestone quarrying towards the latter half of the century. This era saw the decline of Dutch cultural dominance.

The hamlet housed the Phoenix Tannery from 1836 until it closed around 1870, eventually burning down in 1873. The Phoenix, along with most of the new industry in the area, primarily employed recent Irish immigrants and was at different times known as the Newkirk and Simpson Tannery, Simpson Tannery, Simpson&#x27;s Tannery, and Edinburg Tannery. Many believe the Phoenix Tannery is the source of the hamlet&#x27;s name.

As the extractive industries of tanning and quarrying began to wane in the region towards the latter half of the 1800s, tourism began to take off with Phoenicia a major center. An 1879 article from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;In The Ulster Catskills: Attractions of Shandaken Valley&quot;, notes &quot;many thousands of people will come [to the Catskills] annually to escape the heat of the pent-up cities, and spend some of their hard-earned money in gaining renewed strength and vigor of body and mind.&quot;

The Ulster and Delaware Railroad arrived at this community first, making it the first to develop the tourist industry which is still a major part of the local economy. The New York Central Railroad acquired the railroad on February 1, 1932. It continued passenger service through the development, albeit only once-daily except Sundays in its final years. That service ended on March 31, 1954.

In 1960, the Empire State Railway Museum opened in the historic Ulster &amp; Delaware Phoenicia Railroad Station.

On August 23, 1986, Phoenicia became the home of The Shandaken Eagle, a two-ton cast-iron eagle with a 13 foot wingspan who originally lived atop New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Depot.

The Phoenicia Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Beginning in 2010, the town hosted the Phoenicia International Festival of the Voice every August. It has moved to New Paltz.

<doc id="127476" wikidata="Q3461421" url="?curid=127476" title="Port Ewen, New York">
<text>Port Ewen is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 3,678 at the 2020 census. Port Ewen is in the Town of Esopus, south of Kingston, along U.S. Route 9W. Port Ewen is bounded by the Rondout Creek to the north, the Hudson River to the east, the hamlets of Connelly and Sleightsburgh to the northwest and northeast, respectively, the hamlet of Ulster Park to the south, and New Salem to the west.

==History==
The prospect of finding work with the Pennsylvania Coal Company attracted many to Port Ewen. Port Ewen was served by the West Shore Railroad, which shipped, among other freight, high explosives produced by the Nitro Powder Company in Kingston.

Before the opening of the Kingston–Port Ewen Suspension Bridge in 1921, those wishing to cross the Rondout Creek would have to take the &quot;Skillypot&quot;, a chain ferry that ran to Sleightsburgh, noted for its sporadic service.

===Hercules Powder Company===
Hercules Powder Company was formed in 1882 by DuPont and Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company. In 1902 by DuPont purchased Laflin &amp; Rand which it operated as a subsidiary. In 1904 it dissolved Hercules as it continued to consolidate it holdings. However in 1912 successful antitrust litigation forced Duport to divest itself of Laflin and much of its explosive manufacturing. Laflin&#x27;s patents for smokeless powder went to a revived Hercules Powder Company based in Wilmington, Delaware. The Port Ewen plant produced a range of special detonators designed for military use, as well as construction jobs that required blasts of dynamite. In 1973, two women were injured in an explosion of blasting caps.

===Religious Establishments===
Port Ewen has been served by several religious establishments, including the Town of Esopus United Methodist Church, the Catholic Church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Reformed Church of Port Ewen.

====Catholic Church of the Presentation====
A Catholic mission of St. Mary&#x27;s in Rondout had been established in Port Ewen for the large number of boatmen who lived on the northern side of Rondout Creek in Kingston. In 1873 the mission was split off as a separate parish and placed in the charge of Rev. Michael Phelan. The Church of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary was dedicated by Archbishop John McCloskey on June 14, 1874. Aside from attending to missions in the nearby hamlets of Eddyville and Esopus, Phelan also traveled to southern Ulster County, where he formed the nucleus of a parish in the hamlet of Milton.
Rev. Thomas O&#x27;Hanlon became pastor of Port Ewen&#x27;s Church of the Presentation in 1877. O&#x27;Hanlon built the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart in Eddyville. He died in 1883 and was buried at the entrance of the church.

==Environmental Concerns==
Port Ewen and adjacent Ulster Park were once a work site of Dyno Nobel explosives, listed as a manufacturing/distribution location in the 2012 Sustainability Report issued by Dyno Nobel / Incitec Pivot Limited. The location of the former Hercules Inc./Dyno-Nobel site has been designated a state Superfund site: &quot;The site is listed as a &quot;Class 2&quot; site in the State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites (list of State Superfund sites). A Class 2 site represents a significant threat to public health or the environment and action is required.&quot; The downstream spread of contaminants has impacted Port Ewen from the original site in Ulster Park. &quot;The primary contaminants of concern at the site are inorganic (metals) in the soil site-wide and creek sediments and &quot;energetic&quot; (potentially explosive) materials in wetland sediment and in specific locations in the manufacturing area. Volatile organic compounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethene or TCE) are also present in the groundwater near the former shell plant. The presence of potentially explosive materials complicate implementation of a remedy at this site.&quot;

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) had identified in a May 2023 state report, &quot;mercury, lead, copper, zinc, and dozens of other chemicals&quot; in sediment investigations of Plantasie Creek, adjacent to the public elementary school. According to the NY DEC, &quot;Former manufacturing operations for primers and igniters for explosives took place in the developed portion of the site, which occupies approximately 100 acres. However, present-day operations include producing electric detonators within a smaller portion of the site.
Disposal activities occurred within the plant area and in wetland areas in the eastern portion of the property. Most of the surrounding areas are naturally vegetated with cover types ranging from old fields to forested areas.&quot; A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Superfund Community Report for June 2024 indicated that &quot;On May 21, 2024, DEC issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the town of Esopus for the unpermitted work. The town immediately worked closely with DEC to implement corrective measures, including covering areas of soil disturbance and installing temporary fencing near the elementary school to reduce the risk of public exposure.&quot; 
Levels of lead exceeding 15 ppb have been found in some water supplies of Robert R. Graves Elementary, Port Ewen&#x27;s public elementary school, according to an August 2021 analysis completed by EnviroTest Laboratories, LLC, with the highest recorded level of 90 ppb. Lead levels in water supplies exceeding 15 ppb have also been found in nearby Anna Devine Elementary School, located in Ulster Park, according to an analysis completed on behalf of Ulster BOCES. The highest level of lead recorded in the Anna Devine report was 230 ppb.

<text>Rosendale is a town in the center of Ulster County, New York, United States. It once contained a village Rosendale, primarily centered around Main Street, but which was dissolved through vote in 1977. The population was 5,782 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

At the time of the European settlement, the region was inhabited by the Lenapes, who were a member of the Algonquian peoples. The area which was eventually known as Rosendale is generally attributed to having been founded by Jacob Rutsen in 1680 from 600 acres purchased from the Lenapes straddling the Rondout Creek. Initially, the land was leased but Rutsen expanded his holdings and built a homestead, in which he resided from 1700 until his death in 1730. The Town of Rosendale was formed in 1844 from parts of the Towns of Hurley, Marbletown, and New Paltz.

Hamilton Child of Syracuse, New York published a &quot;Gazetteer and Business Directory of Ulster County, N. Y.&quot; in 1872 that described the town.

==St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church==
In the mid 1800s priests from St. Peter&#x27;s in Poughkeepsie served missions in Saugerties and Rondout. In 1840 Rev. John N. Smith, pastor in Poughkeepsie, extended his care to Rosendale. In 1842, his successor, Rev. Myles Maxwell celebrated Mass in Petrie&#x27;s cooper shop. That same year Maxwell was named the first resident pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s in Rondout, and Rosendale became a mission served out of Rondout.
St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was organized by Father Thomas Martin O.P., pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s in Rondout. Services were held in the home of Walter Delmar. In August 1850 the first Mass was celebrated in the new church. St. Peter&#x27;s remained a mission of St. Mary&#x27;s until 1855 when Rev. Edward Lynch, assistant at St. Mary&#x27;s, was named pastor of the new parish of St. Peter&#x27;s, Rosendale. In 1874 Rev. Martin O&#x27;Flaherty became pastor. Given the ever-increasing Catholic population, attracted by the opportunity of employment in the cement quarries, plus the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal, a new, larger church building, designed by Arthur Crooks, was built. The first Mass in the new church was celebrated on Christmas Day 1876.

In 1881 pastor John J. Gleason built a parish school and convent. The school was staffed by the Sister of Charity. Upon Gleason&#x27;s death in 1894, he left a bequest of $500 to Kingston hospital. A mission was established in Whiteport. In 1897, Rev. P. Maughan, a Civil War veteran, became pastor and built the parish hall.

==Rosendale cement==
The Rosendale region is most well known for the production of natural cement. The Rosendale natural cement industry began during the construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal in 1825. The Delaware and Hudson Canal was later finished in 1828 using the world class cement. Rosendale natural cement soon gained a reputation for quality among engineers and was used in the construction of many of the United States&#x27; most important landmarks, including the Brooklyn Bridge, the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, Federal Hall National Memorial, and one of the wings of the United States Capitol. The industry fell into decline in the early 1900s.

Rosendale natural cement was produced from dolomite extracted from mines in the Rosendale and Whiteport members of the Late Silurian Rondout Formation. The natural levels of magnesium and clay in the dolomite from the Rondout Formation are ideally suited for cement production and required none of the chemical additives characteristic of modern Portland cement production.

Several abandoned dolomite mines still exist in the Rosendale region. A mine on the property of the Snyder Estate, which is maintained as part of a museum preserving the history of the Rosendale natural cement industry by the Century House Historical Society, is open to the public. Other mines have been put to a number of uses, including mushroom farming and movie locations. The records storage management company Iron Mountain currently maintains at least one mine for storing anything from microfiche to data backup tapes.

In 2004 limited cement mining resumed in Rosendale, and Rosendale natural cement is again being produced. Freedom Cement LLC, in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, is producing natural cement for use in historic restoration projects.

==Geography==

<text>Rosendale is a hamlet located in the Town of Rosendale in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 1,285 at the 2020 census. It was also a census-designated place known as Rosendale Village until 2010, when the U.S. Census Bureau designated it Rosendale Hamlet. Some maps continue to list the place as just Rosendale. As of 2020, the &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the CDP name was dropped.

The area was originally settled in the late 17th century by Jacob Rutsen, a merchant from Albany, but did not become a major population center until the 1825 discovery of Rosendale cement in the region; the development of the cement industry, and the growth of the Delaware and Hudson Canal along the Rondout Creek and Main Street, gave rise to substantial economic development in Rosendale. The town&#x27;s cement was used in the construction of numerous national landmarks. The Wallkill Valley Railroad reached the village in 1871, and its depot in the village was the largest station on the Wallkill Valley line. Rosendale was formally incorporated as a village in 1890.

An 1895 fire destroyed half the village, as it had no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20th century, the decline of the natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route 32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January 1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village&#x27;s mayor at the time of the vote viewed the dissolution as a work of conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.

After the disincorporation, the commercial center of the former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has had a number of notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route 32, and the Rosendale trestle, a former railroad bridge that was renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale&#x27;s founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski jumping competitions and mine collapses.

== History ==

=== Early settlement ===

The earliest recorded human habitation in Rosendale was a Native American village, which included a cemetery, centered around a spring that no longer exists. The first person of European descent to settle the Rosendale area was a merchant from Albany, Jacob Rutsen (originally &quot;Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt&quot;). Rutsen received a patent on October 8, 1677, for a tract of land, located in what is now Rosendale, after purchasing it from a local Indian named Anckerop. Anckerop agreed to the sale on the condition that he be allowed, &quot;the right to plant ... maize annually for the duration of his life&quot;, and that Rutsen would plow the involved fields.

Dirck (also spelled &quot;Direk&quot;) Keyser secured a lease to the land from Rutsen on June 17, 1680, and built the first house in Rosendale; the terms of Keyser&#x27;s lease stipulated that he build a stone house on the property at the base of what is now Joppenbergh Mountain. On June 23, 1682, fifteen members of the Esopus tribe sold Rutsen more land, by the Rondout Creek. This land was surveyed by Philip Wells on May 28, 1685; Wells declared the size of the purchase to be south of the creek, and to the north. There was also a island within the creek. Rutsen was given a patent for the combined area on August 26, 1686.

In 1700, Rutsen took the house from Keyser and expanded it. The settlement was known as &quot;Rosendall&quot; as early as 1700, and was also called &quot;Roasendale&quot; in documents as early as May 28, 1685. The name is thought to be either a reference to wild roses growing throughout the region, or of Dutch origin, as the word existed in period documents from the Netherlands. After Rutsen&#x27;s death in 1730, he was buried in the area which eventually became the village. His tombstone eulogizes him as the &quot;Founder of Rosendale&quot;.

The village remained sparsely populated and only consisted of two houses when the Delaware and Hudson Canal reached it after the materials used to manufacture Rosendale cement, named after the town, were discovered locally in 1825. Early settlers had avoided the area because the northern land, comprising present-day Rosendale Village, was a known floodplain, and the lands south of the creek were less mountainous and at a higher elevation.

=== Industrial growth ===

The 1825 dolomite deposit was the &quot;single largest natural cement deposit in the United States&quot;, encompassing between High Falls and Kingston. The cement was used in the construction of the Delaware &amp; Hudson canal and quickly became the &quot;primary impetus for the town to grow and prosper&quot;.

By 1835 the village contained a hydraulic cement plant, a post office, tavern, and several stores and houses. When the surrounding town of Rosendale was created from parts of Hurley, New Paltz and Marbletown on April 26, 1844, the village was referred to by the same name as the town. On December 7, 1847, New York passed a law which allowed the municipal incorporation of villages within the state. The Wallkill Valley Railroad was opened to Rosendale in 1871, with the Rosendale trestle across the Rondout Creek completed the following year. James S. McEntee, a former Delaware and Hudson engineer, was the only person to have seen the opening of both the canal and the trestle. The Rosendale station was the largest depot on the Wallkill Valley rail line. Unlike the other stations on the line, it was designed to have an &quot;L&quot; shape, rather than being rectangular, because the building was &quot;squeezed by the severe slope behind it&quot;. In 1888, a pinkeye outbreak killed off many horses in Rosendale and along the canal.

Rosendale was sung about in a canal-related folk song in the 1880s called &quot;Sari Jane&quot;. The village&#x27;s cement mines were mentioned in a poem by D. Taylor, &quot;Carrying Coal On The D &amp; H Canal&quot;, and another poem, &quot;Trip Down The Canal&quot;, by DeWitt E. Clinton and his wife. An 1840 painting by James Smilie depicting Rosendale was one of the earliest paintings to feature the canal.

The village was formally incorporated in 1890. Rosendale cement was used in the construction of several national monuments, such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Washington Monument, Grand Central Terminal, and parts of the Statue of Liberty and the United States Capitol. At its peak Rosendale had fourteen bars on the same street, while the local cement industry employed 5,000 people and was producing four million barrels of cement each year.

=== Decline and disasters ===
A fire destroyed half the village in 1895, burning 26 buildings and causing more than $125,000 in damage. The village had no form of fire protection, though there had been an attempt prior to the fire to establish such a utility. Ironically, &quot;those who were the heaviest losers by the fire were the ones who worked hardest to defeat the movement&quot;. About 10,000 people came to Rosendale following the fire to look at the charred remains, packing the village in &quot;a scene [reminiscent of] an old-time country fair&quot;. In 1900, the village attempted to purchase a water plant for $40,000. The New York &amp; Rosendale Cement Company sued to prevent bonding for the purchase. Before the case could reach the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, the village elected a new board of trustees, which attempted to block the purchase. They were unsuccessful and the village was forced to complete the purchase in 1903. The village enacted an ordinance in December 1901 to remove snow, ice and dirt from local gutters and sidewalks. Power lines were built throughout the village in 1906.

A &quot;strawberry and ice cream festival&quot; was held at Rosendale&#x27;s Episcopal church on June 12, 1906. Around this time the village had an annual firemen&#x27;s parades, which included athletic events, such as baseball and tug of war, as well as brass bands, dances, and speeches. Several different fire companies from throughout the region were involved in the parades.
By 1910, the canal running through Rosendale had closed. On July 5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house was hit by lightning and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased industrial use of Portland cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was detrimental to Rosendale&#x27;s economy, and the village lost almost 70 percent of its population between 1900 and 1920; only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.

The village suffered a severe flood in August 1928. Several feet of floodwater reached the first floors of buildings on Main Street, and the Kingston Fire Department sent boats to rescue stranded residents. In many houses, &quot;muddy and slimy&quot; water had filled the cellar &quot;to the top step of the cellar stairway&quot;. Driveways had been washed out and planking was put down so that pumps could remove the water. Other major floods occurred in March 1936, August 1955, and October 1955. The water was as high as above the level of the street during the 1955 floods. In October 1956, a dinner reception was held to honor the government leaders and flood control officers who had coordinated rescue efforts during the previous year&#x27;s floods.

The village petitioned the state for a census recount in 1957 in an attempt to secure additional state aid. The recount was performed in March 1957 and showed that the village&#x27;s population had increased 16 percent since the 1950 census. The village received additional state aid. In December 1963 the federal government approved a $100,000 appropriation for flood control projects along the Rondout Creek in the town of Rosendale; the plan included changes to the shape of the creek itself and &quot;raising a section of [the village&#x27;s] Main Street to the level of Route 32&quot;.

On a clear, sunny day in July 1964, a group of six boys went swimming in the Rondout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After getting out of the creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale&#x27;s fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at &quot;Reid&#x27;s Village Inn&quot;.

Rosendale had lost its bowling alley to a 1967 fire, and, on January 14, 1969, a local hotel burned down. The hotel, &quot;Reid&#x27;s Village Inn&quot;, was owned by village mayor Joseph Reid. Reid and his wife lived in the building, and lost all their possessions in the fire. Total damage was estimated to be between $50,000 and $75,000. Within two days of the blaze, the village purchased a fire truck and scheduled hearings for alternate-side parking and water meter proposals. By this time, the Army Corps of Engineers had built a flood wall, relocated several buildings, dredged the bottom of the creek, and raised a portion of Main Street about . The project caused the island in the creek to become a peninsula, connected to the northern bank. Since the completion of these projects, the village has not suffered floods as extreme as those of 1955.
In 1970, Rosendale&#x27;s mayor ran off after declaring that the village &quot;had gone broke&quot;. The commercial center of the village was shifting from Main Street (concurrent with Route 213) to Route 32; businesses on Route 32 included a department store, butcher shop, nail salon, barbershop, and restaurants. The village itself served as the commercial center of the town. The growth of shopping malls in nearby Kingston put many local stores out of business, and the last cement plant in Rosendale closed in 1971; abandoned cement mines were eventually used by edible mushroom growers who produced their crops &quot;on beds of horse manure&quot;. Large piles of the manure were visible along Binnewater Road. The caves were also used to acquire naturally filtered water, maintain corn at a consistently cool temperature, and house a records storage facility.

The storage facility, operated by Iron Mountain Incorporated, consists of street lights amid two-story buildings, all &quot;erected beneath the old limestone caves leased from&quot; the Snyder Estate for 99 years. It was opened for a public viewing in 1976 to quell rumors that the &quot;heavily guarded&quot; facility, described as a &quot;subterranean James Bond set&quot;, was part of a cave network that connected the village to Kingston, and that the facility was actually a fallout shelter for federal officials; the facility is capable of withstanding a &quot;direct atomic hit on [nearby] Poughkeepsie&quot;. Sealed behind a steel door, the facility contains &quot;its own well and ... sewage system&quot;, and enough generators to remain self-sufficient for three months.

=== Rise of hippie movement ===

The man who suggested that the underground facility have a public exhibition was a local personality, Billy Guldy. Guldy was born around 1940 in Kingston, and, by the 1970s, had become a leading figure in Rosendale Village&#x27;s hippie movement. He declared himself a king, and frequently dressed as one. He owned a bar called &quot;The Well&quot;, and a hotel in the village, and his portrait was painted on the door of a local bar. He declared Halloween a national holiday, ran for president, and led 200 people in a parade down Main Street. At one point Guldy took a bus to Yankee Stadium to give baseball player Fred Stanley the &quot;key to Rosendale&quot;. Some older residents considered Guldy crazy, and former village trustee Harold Schoonmaker felt &quot;there&#x27;s something wrong with a man that walks around the streets barefoot, wearing a robe and derby&quot;. The village&#x27;s children viewed Guldy favorably and were quite friendly with him.

Some of the village&#x27;s more traditional residents felt overwhelmed by the influx of beatniks, and locals were conflicted over whether Rosendale&#x27;s transformation into an art colony would benefit the village in the long term. A major clash between the hippies and village police occurred at a bar on June 21, 1975, causing over 150 people to show up to see what was going on. Although &quot;there were many people actively involved&quot; in the riot, only Guldy was charged.

A group that opposed the hippie movement managed to keep Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a write-in candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.

=== Disincorporation ===
When Raivo Puusemp, a conceptual artist and art instructor at SUNY Ulster, became mayor of Rosendale, the village was plagued by an &quot;overbearing tax structure and problems with its municipal utilities&quot;. Though disincorporation was already known as a possible solution to the village&#x27;s crises, it had been an &quot;emotionally charged issue&quot; and no action had been taken. By this time Rosendale &quot;could [no longer] govern itself&quot;. The village and town governments had often been at odds; the town was governed by Republicans, while the village was increasingly under Democratic control. This friction manifested in several ways. Town and village officials would frequently disrupt each other&#x27;s meetings, and the town ordered its snow plows to raise their blades while passing through the village; the village subsequently bought its own plow and banned the town&#x27;s plow from entering village limits.

During his campaign, Puusemp did not mention disincorporation or how it related to art, though he had already decided two months before the election that the only solution to the village&#x27;s problems was disincorporation. Beginning in 1969, Puusemp &quot;developed an interest in group dynamics and social and political processes&quot;. In some of his early artworks (termed &quot;influence pieces&quot;), Puusemp would manipulate subjects into unknowingly executing his ideas while believing that they, the subjects, had come up with said ideas on their own. He entered politics to combine &quot;influence and concept ... compatibly&quot;.

Viewing the &quot;project [as] an artwork in the form of a political problem&quot;, Puusemp convinced the people of Rosendale to disincorporate by publicly comparing the village&#x27;s finances to what would be &quot;need[ed] to maintain a viable town&quot;. The village&#x27;s board of trustees strongly favored dissolution and &quot;forced three separate votes before [reaching] a 179 to 87 majority to abolish the village&quot;. A public referendum on the dissolution was held on March 16, 1976, which passed in a 2–1 landslide. Puusemp resigned as mayor on October 1, and moved to Utah with his family. He vowed never to run for office again. During his tenure in office, and in the aftermath of his resignation, Puusemp received widespread popular support.

Marc Phelan, a village trustee and associate of Puusemp, became mayor following Puusemp&#x27;s departure. He was reelected the following March with 141 votes, beating three other candidates to become the village&#x27;s last mayor. Rosendale became unincorporated on January 1, 1977, though the village government did not disband until the end of 1977; the village completely ceased to exist &quot;at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, 1977&quot;. Ironically, the state and federal government provided funding for new sewage and water systems following the disincorporation, mitigating the primary reasons residents had voted to dissolve.

Puusemp documented the dissolution by collecting &quot;press clippings, council meeting minutes, and public documents&quot; and publishing them after his friend, performance artist Paul McCarthy, urged him to do so. Both the book and the dissolution of Rosendale Village itself can be considered different facets of the same artistic work. The 1980 census listed Rosendale Village as a census-designated place (CDP). The former village is also considered a hamlet, an unofficial term which refers to a named but unincorporated place in New York. Rosendale Village is the largest voting bloc in the town of Rosendale, and of all former villages in the Hudson Valley, Rosendale was the last to dissolve.

=== Modern Rosendale ===
After the village&#x27;s disincorporation, taxes decreased for former village residents, but increased for Rosendale residents throughout the rest of the town. The population of the former village has grown 24.5 percent, from 1,220 to an estimated 1,519 people. The same year that the village chose to disincorporate, the Wallkill Valley rail line that ran through the village also ceased regular service.

The revitalization of businesses in the former village was credited to the influx of artists. Prior to the 1980s, store owners in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.

On September 13, 1991, the Century House Historical Society was formed to preserve and educate on the history of the Rosendale cement industry. The New York State Education Department granted a permanent charter to the organization on June 13, 2000. The Society maintains a museum and holds frequent events on the history and geology of the area. The Society held a concert in one of the former cement mines, the Widow Jane Mine, around 1996; the concert caused severe traffic and presented a fire hazard, and the society was subsequently sued by the town which was subsequently dismissed. The Widow Jane Mine has been the site of poetry readings, Taiko drumming, &quot;all-night raves, Halloween horror shows and role-playing vampire games&quot;. It is also one of the few mines in Rosendale that is almost completely horizontal, and is part of the Snyder Estate Natural Cement Historic District.

Rosendale hosts several annual festivals. The Rosendale Street Festival, held in the end of July on Main Street, showcases local talent and celebrates the birthday of Rosendale icon, Uncle Willy. Rosendale has held an annual pickle festival since 1998. Some view the pickle festival as a form of social expression, and the &quot;current artisan pickling scene&quot; has been compared to the mentality of early microbreweries. The pickle festival was originally started by Eri Yamaguchi and Bill Brooks, as a way to introduce Ulster County to pickled Japanese food, such as oshinko. The festival has featured Japanese traditional dancing. At the first pickle festival the number of people attending was 1,000, a number five times greater than expected. The following year it was double that, and by 2003, attendance was almost 5,000. Rosendale also holds a recurring winter festival known as &quot;Frozendale&quot;, and in late September 2010, the hamlet had a zombie-themed festival. Rosendale has also held two Mermaid Parades in recent years the first in 2015 and the second in 2016. Historically, Rosendale&#x27;s festivals have &quot;draw[n as many as] 30,000 people&quot;.

== Geography and geology ==

Rosendale Village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The former village is located at the center of the town of Rosendale, and is &quot;situated on the [former Delaware and Hudson] canal and Rondout Creek&quot;, about north of the creek&#x27;s confluence with the Wallkill River. The highest recorded crest of the Rondout Creek in Rosendale was on October 16, 1955. The creek does not normally rise above , but overflows its banks after reaching . The hamlet&#x27;s ZIP code is 12472 and it is in area code 845. Rosendale Village is bordered by the creek and by the Joppenbergh Mountain. It is traversed by state routes NY 32 and NY 213. The former village is east of the hamlet of High Falls, north of the village of New Paltz, and south of the city of Kingston.

Rosendale is underlain by a shale member of the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines the bottom of the Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation&#x27;s dolomite member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.

== Climate ==
There is more precipitation during May than in any other month; Rosendale currently has an annual precipitation of about . Between 1931 and 1955, the town averaged each year. July is the hottest month, on average; the hottest recorded temperature occurred during July 1995. January is the coldest month, and the lowest recorded temperature was taken in January 1961.
== Landmarks ==

=== Churches ===
Rosendale Village has had four churches throughout its existence: a Baptist, Dutch Reformed, Catholic and Episcopal church. Of these churches, only the Catholic one still functions as a church.

The first Baptist minister arrived in Rosendale in March 1839, and the first baptisms took place on April 5, 1840. The &quot;First Associate Baptist Society in the Village of Rosendale&quot; was incorporated on May 22, 1840. A meeting house for the society was built in 1842; it was dedicated on October 17 and its pews were purchased on November 4. The church underwent a revival between 1875 and 1876, and was reincorporated on May 1, 1876, as the &quot;Baptist Church of Rosendale&quot;. It was closed as a church in 1929, and sold in 1972 to a local filmmaker, Walter Helmuth, who used it as a house. At some point it housed a &quot;fraternal organization of farmers&quot; and was known as the &quot;Grange&quot;. In the 1990s it was used as a theater. On January 15, 2004, the building burned down. Though the town&#x27;s fire station was directly across the street, the extreme cold hindered firefighters&#x27; efforts to control the fire.

The &quot;Protestant Reformed Dutch Church of Rosendale&quot; was incorporated on November 28, 1843. The church originally cost $2,500 to build, and was designed to seat 300 people. It burned down and was rebuilt in 1895. In 1985, it was renovated and converted into a glass studio called &quot;Belltower Lighting&quot;.

Catholic priests had come to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper&#x27;s shop. The original &quot;Church of St. Peter&quot; was completed in the summer of 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August 15. The church was not officially incorporated until April 29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village&#x27;s rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December 25, 1876; the building&#x27;s total construction cost was $31,000. The &quot;Church of St. Peter&quot; is the only one of the village&#x27;s churches that still functions as a church.

Rosendale&#x27;s Episcopal church, the &quot;All Saints&#x27; Chapel&quot;, was built in 1876. It was hit hard by the floods of 1955, to the point where &quot;the rising water floated the organ up toward the altar&quot;. It was abandoned after the flooding, and was purchased by a local cement magnate, so that it could be converted into the Rosendale Library; the library association had its charter granted on October 24, 1958. The building was severely damaged by a fire on January 15, 1975, but was restored, and a new wing was added; the wing was named after Anna Mae Auchmoedy, the building&#x27;s first librarian. In 1986, the library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Joppenbergh Mountain ===
Joppenbergh is a mountain, adjacent to the hamlet&#x27;s railroad trestle and Route 213. It was named after Rosendale&#x27;s founder, Jacob Rutsen, and mined throughout the late 19th century for the dolomite that was used in the manufacture of natural cement. There was a large cave-in on December 19, 1899, that destroyed mining equipment and collapsed shafts within the mountain. Though it was feared that several workers had been killed, the collapse happened during lunch, and all the miners were outside, eating. Since the collapse the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls.

During the late 1930s, Joppenbergh became the site of several skiing competitions, which continued until the early 1940s. The slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale&#x27;s first competition in 1937; Schelderup participated in a competition that July after the slope was coated with borax. Skiing stopped until the 1960s, when a new slope was built, and competitions were held until 1971.

The town of Rosendale considered buying land near the mountain in 2003 for parking. The following year, the town leased a tract of land to build a municipal parking lot. Joppenbergh was put up for sale in 2009, and, in March 2011, the Open Space Institute offered to purchase the entire property and sell it to the town; the following month, Rosendale&#x27;s town board agreed to the deal.

=== Railroad bridge ===
In 1869 the town of Rosendale issued municipal bonds to pay for its portion of the Wallkill Valley Railroad, and construction of a railroad bridge spanning the Rondout Creek began the following year. After bridging the Wallkill River in New Paltz, the railroad reached Rosendale in 1871. The Rosendale trestle was formally opened during a large ceremony on April 6, 1872. The height of the bridge terrified onlookers, who questioned the trestle&#x27;s sturdiness. The bridge&#x27;s completion allowed the rail line to continue north to Kingston.

The bridge was rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 to convert it from iron to steel. It was repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, the stability of the trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.

Rahl installed decking on half of the trestle between 1989 and 1991, attempting to open it as a bungee jumping platform. A court ruling found that such a venture violated zoning laws, and the town denied Rahl a variance. In 2009 the county seized the trestle, and it was sold to an environmental group. The trestle was closed in 2010 for repairs, and was opened in 2013 as part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail.

=== Route 32 bridge ===

During the American Revolution, General George Clinton crossed the Rondout Creek at Rosendale Village in October 1777, arriving &quot;one or two days too late to resist the British attack&quot; on Kingston by the forces of General John Vaughan. Clinton&#x27;s fording spot is now the location of a bridge on State Route 32. The bridge, originally built around 1934, was refurbished in 1970, and again between 2008 and 2009. While the bridge was being renovated in 2009, only one lane had been open, congesting traffic. The total cost of the project was $5.5 million. There is a 58-spot park and ride on Route 32, by Rosendale&#x27;s community center, that is served by the Ulster County Area Transit and Trailways bus services.

=== Theater ===
Originally a casino in the 1920s, the Rosendale Theater was seized by the village and converted into a theater in 1949 by Anthony Cacchio, a man who bore a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger. The first film shown on opening night in February 1949 was &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot;. Caccio owned the building outright by 1954, and operated it with his son, Anthony Cacchio Jr., who banned popcorn in the theater in 1969. The theater served as the village&#x27;s fire department at one point.

In early 2010, a real estate developer approached the Cacchios with an offer to purchase the theater. A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help take out a $385,000 mortgage. Since completing its purchase of the theater on August 19, 2010, the Rosendale Theatre Collective has added a digital projector, surround sound system, stage thrust, and retractable screen. The group plans to add a concession stand and move the ticket booth outside during warm months. In late February 2011, the theater received a $175,000 state grant to renovate the building.

<text>Metal Machine Music (subtitled *The Amine β Ring) is the fifth studio album by American rock musician Lou Reed. It was recorded on a three-speed Uher machine and was mastered/engineered by Bob Ludwig. It was released as a double album in July 1975 by RCA Records, but taken off the market three weeks later. A radical departure from the rest of his catalog, the &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; album features no songs or recognizably structured compositions, eschewing melody and rhythm for modulated feedback and noise music guitar effects, mixed at varying speeds by Reed. Also in 1975, RCA released a Quadrophonic version of the &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; recording that was produced by playing it back both forward and backward, and by flipping the tape over.

The album cost Reed his reputation in the music industry while simultaneously opening the door for some of his later, more experimental material and has generally been panned by critics since its release. In 2008, Reed, Ulrich Krieger, and Sarth Calhoun collaborated to tour playing free improvisation inspired by the album as Metal Machine Trio. In 2011, Reed released a remastered version of &quot;Metal Machine Music.&quot;

==Style==
A major influence on Reed&#x27;s recording, for which he tuned all the guitar strings to the same note, was the mid-1960s drone music work of La Monte Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music, whose members included John Cale, Tony Conrad, Angus MacLise and Marian Zazeela. Both Cale and MacLise were also members of the Velvet Underground (MacLise left before the group began recording).

The Theatre of Eternal Music&#x27;s just intonation harmonies, sustained notes, and loud amplification influenced Cale&#x27;s subsequent contribution to the Velvet Underground in his use of both unconventional harmony and feedback. Recent releases of works by Cale and Conrad from the mid-sixties, such as Cale&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Dream Syndicate&quot; series (&quot;The Dream Syndicate&quot; being the alternative name given by Cale and Conrad to their collective work with Young) testify to the influence this mid-sixties experimental work had on Reed years later.

In an interview with rock journalist Lester Bangs, Reed stated that he &quot;had also been listening to Xenakis a lot.&quot; He also claimed that he had intentionally placed sonic allusions to classical works such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; and &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphonies in the distortion, and that he had attempted to have the album released on the RCA Red Seal classical label. He repeated the latter claim in a 2007 interview.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; confounded reviewers and listeners when it was first released. &quot;The Stranger&quot;″s Dave Segal later claimed it was one of the most divisive records ever, challenging both critics and the artist&#x27;s core audience, similar to the reception of Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Agharta&quot; album, which was issued around the same time.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine reviewed the album as sounding like &quot;the tubular groaning of a galactic refrigerator&quot; and as displeasing to experience as &quot;a night in a bus terminal&quot;. In the 1979 &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, critic Billy Altman said it was &quot;a two-disc set consisting of nothing more than ear-wrecking electronic sludge, guaranteed to clear any room of humans in record time&quot;. (This aspect of the album is mentioned in the Bruce Sterling short story &quot;Dori Bangs&quot;.) The first issue of the seminal New York zine &quot;Punk&quot; placed Reed and the album in its inaugural 1976 issue, presaging the advent of both punk and the discordance of the New York No Wave scene. Reed biographer Victor Bockris wrote that the recording can be understood as &quot;the ultimate conceptual punk album and the progenitor of New York punk rock&quot;. The album was ranked number two in the 1991 book &quot;The Worst Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Records of All Time&quot; by Jimmy Guterman and Owen O&#x27;Donnell.

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau referred to &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; as Reed&#x27;s &quot;answer to &quot;Environments&quot;&quot; and said it had &quot;certainly raised consciousness in both the journalistic and business communities&quot; and was not &quot;totally unlistenable&quot;, though he admitted for white noise he would rather listen to &quot;Sister Ray&quot;. Writing in &quot;MusicHound Rock&quot; (1999), Greg Kot gave the album a &quot;woof!&quot; rating (signifying &quot;dog-food&quot;), and opined: &quot;The spin cycle of a washing machine has more melodic variation than the electronic drone that was &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot/MH&quot;&gt;Gary Graff &amp; Daniel Durchholz (eds), &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot;, Visible Ink Press (Farmington Hills, MI, 1999; ), p. 931.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine included the album in a list of &quot;Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists&quot;, and it ranked number four in &quot;Q&quot; list of the 50 worst albums of all time. It was again featured in &quot;Q&quot; in December 2010, on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Career Suicides&quot; list, where it came eighth overall. The &quot;Trouser Press Record Guide&quot; referred to it as &quot;four sides of unlistenable oscillator noise&quot;, parenthetically calling that assessment &quot;a description, not a value judgment&quot;. Mark Deming&#x27;s review for AllMusic said that while noise rock groups &quot;have created some sort of context for it&quot;, &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; &quot;hasn&#x27;t gotten any more user friendly with time&quot;, given it &quot;paus[ed] only for side breaks with no rhythms, melodies, or formal structures to buffer the onslaught&quot;.

Rock critic Lester Bangs wrote of &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;: &quot;as classical music it adds nothing to a genre that may well be depleted. As rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll it&#x27;s interesting garage electronic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. As a statement it&#x27;s great, as a giant FUCK YOU it shows integrity—a sick, twisted, dunced-out, malevolent, perverted, psychopathic integrity, but integrity nevertheless.&quot; Bangs later wrote a tongue-in-cheek article about the album, titled &quot;The Greatest Album Ever Made&quot;, in which he judged it &quot;the greatest record ever made in the history of the human eardrum&quot;. In 1998, &quot;The Wire&quot; included &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; in its list of &quot;100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)&quot;, with Brian Duguid writing:

In a December 2017 review, Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; a score of 8.7 out of 10. He describes the album as an &quot;exhilarating&quot; listen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson/Pitchfork&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the intense criticism (or perhaps because of the exposure it generated), &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; reportedly sold 100,000 copies in the US, according to the liner notes of the 2000 CD reissue by RCA/Buddah Records. The original 1975 RCA Victor LP edition was withdrawn within three weeks of its release.

==Performance==
Lou Reed did not perform &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; on stage until March 2002, when he collaborated with an avant-garde classical ensemble at the MaerzMusik festival in Berlin. The 10-member group Zeitkratzer performed the original album with Reed in a new arrangement by Ulrich Krieger, featuring classical string, wind, piano, and accordion. Live recordings with (2007) and without (2014; all-acoustic) Reed are available commercially.

A few years later, Reed formed a band named Metal Machine Trio as a noise rock/experimental side project.

==In popular culture==
The language of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; aliens known as the Breen was inspired by &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, which the post-production sound staff were instructed to listen to when creating the electronic cackle that served as the Breen&#x27;s voices.

On &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, Joel Hodgson&#x27;s character likened watching &quot;Mighty Jack&quot; to &quot;listening to two hours of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;.&quot; Later on the show, Michael J. Nelson&#x27;s character says &quot;Monster immediately gets up and puts on his &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;&quot; due to the background music during the mutation scene in &quot;The Horror of Party Beach.&quot;

==Track listing==
Side one
# &quot;Metal Machine Music A-1&quot; – 16:10

Side two
# &quot;Metal Machine Music A-2&quot; – 15:53

Side three
# &quot;Metal Machine Music A-3&quot; – 16:13

Side four
# &quot;Metal Machine Music A-4&quot; – 15:55

On the original vinyl release, timings for sides 1–3 were stated as &quot;16:01&quot;, while the 4th side read &quot;16:01 or ∞&quot;, as the last groove on the LP was a continuous loop, known as the locked groove. On CD, this locked groove was imitated for the final 2:22 of the track, fading out at the end. On later CD, DVD, and BluRay reissues, the tracks are retitled as &quot;Part 1&quot;, &quot;Part 2&quot;, &quot;Part 3&quot;, and &quot;Part 4.&quot;

<text>Shandaken is a town on the northern border of Ulster County, New York, United States, northwest of Kingston, New York. As of the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 2,866. The name is believed to be from an Esopus phrase for &quot;land of rapid waters.&quot;

== History ==
The town was first settled around the time of the American Revolution. Shandaken was established as a town in 1804 from part of the Town of Woodstock.

In 1809, the town was increased by territory from the Town of Neversink (in Sullivan County). Later, some of Shandaken was used to help form the Towns of Denning, Hardenburgh, and Olive.

<text>Shawangunk is a town in southwestern Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 13,563 at the 2020 census. The town takes its name from its largest stream, the Shawangunk Kill. The name Shawangunk is from the language of the Lenape people. Kill is an abbreviation of the Dutch word for creek, &quot;Killitje.&quot; It is pronounced Shuh-Whan-Gung 

== History==
Shawangunk was first settled by Europeans during the 1680s. The region was first designated a precinct about 1710, and became the township of Shawangunk in 1788. The town&#x27;s name comes from the Dutch transliteration of the Munsee Lenape name or phrase. The approximate Lenape pronunciation was &quot;Sha-WAN-gunk,&quot; probably meaning &quot;in the smoky air.&quot; The name first appears in the 1682 Indian deed to Gertrude Bruyn. It is uncertain if this was the Indians&#x27; actual proper name for their nearby village and &quot;New Fort,&quot; destroyed by the Dutch on September 5, 1663, during the Second Esopus War, or if the name was merely a phrase invented by the Indians in connection with the Bruyn land purchase, possibly describing some temporary feature of the landscape. Suggestions as to whether the name may have referred to smoky conditions on the day of Bruyn&#x27;s first tour of the land with the Indians in the 1670s, or to the smoky ruins of the destroyed Indian village during the preceding decade, are purely speculative. Use of the name to designate the creek on which Bruyn settled (Shawangunk Kill), and the mountain range, came somewhat later. Locals pronounce the name &quot;SHONG-gum,&quot; an obvious corruption or contraction of the original name, but one on record at least as far back as 1777 (Marc B. Fried, &quot;Shawangunk Place-names&quot; pp. ix-xi, 3-12, 96-97). Present-day citizens of Shawangunk often refer to themselves as living in particular hamlets such as Wallkill or Walker Valley rather than the town as a whole; this is due to the fact that many residents of the western part of the town are in the school district of Pine Bush (nearby across the county line) and have Pine Bush mailing addresses, also doing much of their shopping in that Orange County hamlet.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.55%) is water.

The southern town line and half of the eastern town boundary is the border of Orange County, New York.

The northeastward-flowing Wallkill River passes through the eastern half of town and lends its name to the hamlet, which lies along its east bank. The western part of the town, including Walker Valley, climbs the lower slopes of the eponymous mountains. The Shawangunk Kill, a major tributary of the Wallkill, divides the town approximately in half.

==Government==
The town of Shawangunk is led by a supervisor and a board of four council members. The current supervisor is John Valk, Jr., in office since 1998.

<text>Ulster is a town in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 12,660 at the 2020 census.

The town of Ulster is in the northeastern part of the county. The town is directly north of the city of Kingston. Ulster is partially situated inside Catskill Park.

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and U.S. Route 9W pass through the western part of the town. U.S. Route 209 crosses the Hudson River from the eastern side of the town.

==History==
The town of Ulster, newest of the twenty towns in the county, was created by the Ulster County Board of Supervisors on November 28, 1879, with land taken from the town of Kingston. Formed in protest to what was considered political misrule by the authorities of the town of Kingston, the action of the supervisors was soon ratified by the state legislature. The first meeting of the town of Ulster was held in the hotel of George A. Stoddard on March 2, 1880. James Myer Jr. was its first supervisor. The new town contained approximately 27.5 square miles of land. It was bordered the city of Kingston on three sides, and by the Hudson River and the towns of Kingston, Saugerties, Hurley, Woodstock, and Rosendale. Rondout Creek separated Ulster from the town of Esopus to the south.

&quot;While the establishment of Ulster solved the problem of political corruption in the parent town of Kingston, another problem was inadvertently created. When the boundaries of Ulster were established, it was obvious just how severe the punishment of the town of Kingston had been: the new town had Eddyville with the Delaware and Hudson Canal terminus lock, the land bordering the Hudson with its icehouses and brickyards and all the advantages for trade and travel, the flat farm land of the Saugerties Road and the Brabant with its road leading into the interior. The Esopus Creek with all the potential for mills was locate within the new town. Finding a centrum or hub around which the township could unite was virtually impossible as it was little more than a collection of hamlets bound together by only a legislative act.&quot; (Burgher manuscript)

Although the new town lacked a geographic center, Eddyville was its economic hub. Named for George Eddy, a mill owner whose family established a cotton mill and a sawmill on the Rondout, Eddyville became a thriving hamlet in large part due to the Delaware and Hudson Canal.

Present East Kingston was first called Flatbush. Originally named by the Esopus tribe of the Lenape, the Dutchlater called it &quot;Vlakke Basch&quot;. It became the site of cement works, ice houses and brickyards, and became second only to Eddyville in significance in the newly-formed Town of Ulster. Present Rider Park and Post Park are on former brickyards.

The hamlet of Lake Katrine bears the name of the nearby lake. The lake was first called Auntrens Pond, and the area nearby was first called Pine Bush.

Bluestone quarrying was the main industry in Ruby, which was known as both Dutch and German settlement in earlier times.

&quot;The township remained primarily rural and agricultural until the post World War II years when so much happened so quickly and Ulster had to move into the 20th century ready or not. A major corporation, IBM, opened its Kingston facility. The economy of Ulster, the city of Kingston and neighboring towns changed irreversibly as housing developments sprang up, schools were built and other businesses arrived.&quot; (Burgher manuscript)

The town of Ulster is noted as being the &quot;business hub&quot; of Ulster County. Many historical sites dot the landscape.

In 1999, Lisa Groppuso was the first female supervisor, elected on the Democratic ticket. Groppuso had previously served four two-year terms (1990–1998) as town clerk.

In 2005 Ulster voters elected 21-year-old Nicky B. Woerner as the youngest town supervisor in New York State history, and elected the first Democratic town board in the town&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (7.20%) is water.

The eastern town line is formed by the Hudson River, and the western section of the town borders the City of Kingston.

Esopus Creek flows northward through the center of the town.

<text>Wallkill is a hamlet (and census-designated place), generally identified as coterminous with ZIP Code 12589, telephone exchange 895 in the 845 area code and most of the Wallkill Central School District located mostly in the eastern half of the town of Shawangunk, Ulster County, New York, United States, but partly spilling over into adjacent regions of the Orange County towns of Newburgh and Montgomery. The population was 2,166 at the 2020 census.

The Wallkill and Shawangunk correctional facilities are located in Wallkill. The hamlet&#x27;s attractions include the Walden–Wallkill Rail Trail, the original Borden Farm (namesake for the area&#x27;s middle school, John G. Borden Middle School), the Wallkill River, the Magnanini Winery, and for its proximity to the Shawangunk Mountains.

==History==

Before European settlement, this area was populated by the Munsee branch of the Lenape (Delaware) people, who occupied the upper Delaware Valley, the adjacent Catskill foothills, and most of what is now the state of New York south of the Catskills, as well as northern New Jersey (Kraft 2001).
The Waronawanka (Waranawankong), known to history as the Esopus Indians, were the Munsee tribe present in the region of the Shawangunk Grasslands Refuge. They inhabited the Rondout-Wallkill Valleys/Shawangunk Mountain region southward to their boundary with the Murderer&#x27;s Kill Indians (Moodna Creek, near Cornwall) and southwestward along the Shawangunks to their border with the Minisink tribe, near where present Interstate 84 crosses the ridge in western Orange County (Fried 2005).

A number of Indian tribes served as mediators between the Esopus and the Dutch during the Esopus Wars, including not only nearby tribes such as the Mohicans and Wappingers, but also the Mohawks, Senecas and Hackensack Indians, whose proximity to the major Dutch settlements at Fort Orange and New Amsterdam made them useful to both sides (Fried 1975). In 1664, a peace treaty ended the final conflict with the now impoverished Esopus Indians. Later the same year, the Dutch lost their North American colonies to the English. By 1684, the Esopus tribe had sold most of their ancestral lands to the colonies, though many Indians continued living on portions of the land until settlers actually took possession during succeeding decades.

The Lenape population had been ravaged not only by war, but by European diseases for which they had no natural immunity. The last known sale of land by an Esopus Indian in Ulster County occurred in 1770 (Fried 2005). The refuge itself lies close to two sites of great historic interest; only a mile to the west, the Esopus tribe had a major village on the Shawangunk Kill that was the scene of a dramatic battle and rescue of prisoners by Dutch forces in 1663, during the Second Esopus War.

Wallkill is also a destination for international visitors to Watchtower Farms, which draws tens of thousands each year to a free guided tour of its printery. The Watchtower Society (a legal entity of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) has operated the facility since 1963, initially to produce food cost-effectively for volunteer workers at its offices and printeries in Brooklyn, New York. Some printing of Awake! and The Watchtower began at Wallkill in 1973, and by 2004 their entire United States printing operation was shifted from Brooklyn to an expanded Wallkill printery. The Watchtower printery at Wallkill is considered an example in automated printing, binding, and packaging. Aside from those run for the federal government, Watchtower&#x27;s Wallkill plant is the largest in-plant printing operation in the United States.

The Walstein Childs House, J. B. Crowell and Son Brick Mould Mill Complex, Andries DuBois House, and Reformed Dutch Church of New Hurley are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Wawarsing is a town in Ulster County, New York, United States. The population was 12,771 at the 2020 census. The name Wawarsing was once believed to mean &quot;a place where the streams wind&quot; in the Lenape language, referring to the geography in the hamlet of Wawarsing; specifically, the joining of the Ver Nooy Kill and the Rondout Creek at Port Ben. The name Wawarsing was used by the Lenape to designate the current hamlet and the fields to the north and south of it for at least six miles in both directions. It is the only Lenape name known to refer to an exact location in Ulster County.

The town is in the western part of the county. The southern and easternmost portions are on the Shawangunk Ridge. Most of the hilly town is in the Appalachian foothills, while the northernmost part is in the Catskills. It has three state forests (Shawangunk Ridge, VerNooykill, and Witches Hole), as well as most of Minnewaska State Park and Sam&#x27;s Point Preserve, and portions of the Catskill Preserve and Sundown State Park. US 209 crosses the town, passing through many principal communities: Spring Glen, Laurenkill, Ellenville, Napanoch, the hamlet of Wawarsing, Soccanissing, and Kerhonkson. US 44 begins at a junction with 209 near the east town line. N.Y. Route 52 runs east–west near the southern border. All three roads are part of the Shawangunk Ridge National Scenic Byway.

== History ==
The Lenape settlement &quot;at Wawarasinke&quot; was burned by English militiamen, led by Marten Crieger, after the Natives attacked Wiltwyck and took captives in 1663. In 1685, Warnaar Hoornbeek leased land there and was accepted as its first European pioneer. In 1703 the areas of Mombaccus and Wawarasink, Ulster County, were made The Town of Rochester. During The Revolutionary War, Wawarsing, Napanoch and Pinebush (Kerhonkson area) were attacked by British raiders, who massacred many women and children and burned the farms. In 1906, Wawarsing, Napanoch, Laurenkil, Lackawack and Grenfield joined together to form The Town of Wawarsing out of Southern Rochester and parts of unincorporated Ulster County.

The O &amp; W Railroad Station at Port Ben was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.32%) is water.

The western and southern borders of the town are Sullivan County, New York.

The northern part of the town is the southernmost portion of the Catskill Mountains. The eastern border is the Shawangunk Ridge (pronounced ). Rondout Creek passes through the town, as do the Sandburg, Laurenkill, Beerkill, Fantinekill and Vernooy Kill creeks.

<text>Glens Falls is a city in Warren County, New York, United States and is the central city of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 14,830 at the 2020 census. The name was given by Colonel Johannes Glen, the falls referring to a large waterfall in the Hudson River at the southern end of the city.

Glens Falls is a city in the southeastern corner of Warren County, surrounded by the town of Queensbury to the north, east, and west, and by the Hudson River and Saratoga County to the south. Glens Falls is known as &quot;Hometown U.S.A.&quot;, a title &quot;Look&quot; magazine gave it in 1944. The city has also referred to itself as the &quot;Empire City.&quot;

==History==

The area is originally called Chepontuc (&quot;difficult place to get around&quot;) in the Iroquoian languages of the area&#x27;s Indigenous inhabitants. It also referred to as the &quot;Great Carrying Place.&quot; Later, European-American settlers named the area &quot;The Corners&quot; in English.

As a halfway point between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry, the falls was the site of several battles during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. The then-hamlet was mostly destroyed by fire twice during the latter conflict, forcing the Quakers to abandon the settlement until the war ended in 1783. Fire also ravaged the village in 1864, 1884, and 1902.

In 1766 it was renamed Wing&#x27;s Falls for Abraham Wing – the leader of the group of Quakers who established the permanent settlement – and for the falls on the Hudson River. Wing&#x27;s claim to the name of the falls and the hamlet was transferred to Colonel Johannes Glen of Schenectady in 1788, either on collection of a debt, as a result of a game of cards, or in exchange for hosting a party for mutual friends, depending on which local legend is believed. Colonel Glen changed the name to &quot;Glen&#x27;s Falls,&quot; though it was often printed with varying spelling such as &quot;Glenn&#x27;s,&quot; or &quot;Glens&quot;. The spelling &quot;Glens Falls&quot; came to be the common usage.

A post office was established in 1808. Glens Falls became an incorporated village in 1839, and was re-incorporated in 1874 and 1887, expanding the village to what would become the city limits when the state legislature granted the city charter in 1908, at which time the city became independent from the town of Queensbury.

In 2003, with permission from Queensbury, Glens Falls annexed approximately of the town. The land, known as Veterans Field or the Northway Industrial Park, is on Veterans Road between Luzerne Road and Sherman Avenue and is just east of I-87. The land was vacant at the time. A thin, strip of Sherman Avenue was part of this annexation, to comply with state law on contiguity of annexed land. As a result, the city and town share co-own this stretch of highway.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (2.54%) is water.

The city is on the Hudson River, in the Adirondack foothills, at the border of Saratoga County.

<doc id="127499" wikidata="Q3501630" url="?curid=127499" title="Hague, New York">
<text>Hague is a town in northeastern Warren County, New York, United States located on the scenic Lake George. It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 854 at the 2000 census. The town was named after the city The Hague in the Netherlands.

== History ==
In 1757, during the French and Indian War, Sabbath Day Point was used as an encampment and staging area for the French Army and nearly two thousand Odawa in an expedition to capture the British Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George. While at the Sabbath Day Point camp, they conducted an ambush of a group of British soldiers and captured many. Later at the Sabbath Day Point base camp, the Indians cannibalized some of the captured British prisoners.

Sabbath Day Point was used a landing place in 1758 for British armies en route to attack the French at Fort Carillion and again in 1759 when General Jeffery Amherst finally succeeded in capturing Fort Carillon. It was then renamed Fort Ticonderoga.

During the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin twice encamped there traveling to and from Canada as an emissary of the Continental Congress in an unsuccessful attempt to have Canada join the Colonies in the revolution. He was Postmaster General and in this capacity, he conducted temporary postal processing functions on each of his stays at Sabbath Day Point.

The town was first settled around 1796.
The Town of Hague was originally part of the Town of Bolton and was created in 1807 as the Town of Rochester. In 1808 it changed its name to Hague.

In 1904 the waters of Hague bay were home of the Lake George Monster. The &quot;monster&quot; was the creation of Harry Watrous, and was part of a practical joke.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (19.58%) is water.

New York State Route 8 ends at Route 9N, which joins the lakeside communities on the eastern side of the town.

The eastern town line is the border of Washington County. The town and county include the surface of Lake George so that only the opposite shore is part of Washington County. The northern town boundary is the border of Essex County.

==The Hague Chronicle==
A monthly newspaper produced by volunteers since 1972, The Hague Chronicle covers town meetings, the activities of various organizations in the area, and news of the Town of Hague and the greater Lake George area. Bobbi Bryant Taylor serves as the current editor and publisher of the Hague Chronicle. 

==Hague Central School==
The Town of Hague had its own centralized school district from 1927 to 1979. The former Hague Central School, razed in 1985, stood on the site of the current Hague Community Building, and was constructed in two sections in 1927 and 1930. The centralization of the school districts in Hague came nearly a decade before other towns in the region centralized their schools.

Throughout the 1970s, a bitter battle raged between seasonal and year-round residents over the viability of the school, with a student population of about 200 in grades K-12. Several annexation votes were held between 1971 and 1979. Many argued that consolidation with the Ticonderoga Central School District to the north would reduce taxes in the Town. Ironically, three decades after consolidation, the same segment of seasonal residents that originally pushed for consolidation now are protesting that Hague is taxed disproportionately. 

Through the last decades of its existence, Hague athletic teams were known as the Raiders, using various depictions of Indians as their mascot. Originally sporting red and gray colors, those team colors had morphed into red and white by the 1970s.

Hague competed in the old Marcy League, which included teams from Bolton Landing, Chestertown, Horicon, Pottersville, Keene Valley, Indian Lake, Minerva, Newcomb, Long Lake, and Wells. Hague competed in soccer, basketball, and baseball.

In 1977-78 and again in 1978–79, Hague&#x27;s basketball team advanced in the post-season beyond the sectionals. Competing in Section VII as a Class D school, the Hague Raiders won the Section VII title both years, advancing to the State Semi-Finals in 1978. In 1979 the Raiders advanced to the Capital District Semi-Finals.

<text>Queensbury is a town in Warren County, New York, United States. The population was 29,169 at the 2020 census.

It contains the county seat of Warren County, located at a municipal center complex on U.S. Route 9 south of the village of Lake George. It was moved to the complex in 1963 from the original county seat of Lake George. The town is located in the southeastern corner of the county and is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is named in honor of Queen Charlotte. Although primarily located north of the city of Glens Falls, Queensbury surrounds the city on three sides.

Six Flags Great Escape and Hurricane Harbor, a Six Flags theme park, is located in northwest Queensbury. West Mountain, a downhill skiing area, is located in the southwestern part of town.

==History==
The roots of Queensbury trace back to the Queensbury Patent in 1762, a colonial land grant authorized by the British Crown. It was designed to encourage settlement in the area near the southern Adirondack foothills, close to Lake George and the Hudson River. This patent, named in honor of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, successfully attracted Quaker settlers the following year in 1763. Quaker families began to move into the area, clearing land and establishing farms and homesteads. In 1777, their peaceful existence was disrupted by the Revolutionary War. The Quakers, known for their pacifist beliefs, abandoned Queensbury during the war due to hostilities and the proximity to military campaigns. The region was largely uninhabited during this period. Following the end of the war, the Quakers returned to Queensbury in 1783 and resumed their settlement efforts.

In 1786, the settlement was re-established as the town of Queensbury. In 1788, the town included all of what is today Warren County. It lost territory in 1792 when the town of Fairfield (Lake Luzerne) was formed and again in 1810 to form part of the town of Caldwell (Lake George). In 1908, the then largest village within Queensbury, Glens Falls, incorporated as a city and became a separate municipality. The population of Queensbury has exceeded that of Glens Falls since the 1980 Census.

In 2003, with permission from Queensbury, Glens Falls annexed approximately of the town. The land, known as Veterans Field or the Northway Industrial Park, is on Veterans Road between Luzerne Road and Sherman Avenue and is just east of I-87. The land was vacant at the time. A thin, strip of Sherman Avenue was part of this annexation, in order to comply with state law regarding contiguity of annexed land. Both the city and town now share ownership of this stretch of highway as a result.

The Sanford House and Asa Stower House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

The western town line is the border with the town of Lake Luzerne. The southern town boundary is defined by the border with the city of Glens Falls and the Hudson River, across which lies Saratoga County. The eastern town line is the border of Washington County, also New York State. The northern border is defined by the town of Lake George and, according to the town and Warren County, by the shoreline of the body of water, Lake George, itself. However, several maps, including those published by the USGS, depict the northern boundary as including part of the lake, including Speaker Heck Island and Happy Family Islands.

Parts of western and northern Queensbury are within the Adirondack Park.

==Government==
Queensbury is a town of the first class, and as such has a town board with a town supervisor and four councilmen. Town residents petitioned to establish a ward system in 1981 and again in 1985 whereby the town would be divided into four wards. In a ward system, whereas the supervisor is elected by the entire town electorate, each councilman is elected by only the electorate of the ward he or she will be representing. Having been approved by the voters by referendum in 1985, the first town board to be elected under the ward system convened in 1986. Queensbury is one of only ten of New York&#x27;s 932 towns that had a ward system as of 2000. The town has an ethics board, planning board, and zoning board of appeals.

As of 2025, the town government officials are:

* John Strough – Town Supervisor
* Anthony Metivier – Deputy Supervisor; Councilman, Ward 1
* Scott Gushlaw – Councilman, Ward 2
* Michael Dixon – Councilman, Ward 3
* Timothy McNulty – Councilman, Ward 4

In county government, Queensbury is entitled to five of the 20 seats on the Warren County Board of Supervisors. (Glens Falls also has five seats, whereas the remaining ten towns in the county have one seat each.) Four of Queensbury&#x27;s seats are filled by town-wide election, whereas the fifth is reserved for the town supervisor.

==Emergency services==
Emergency services can be accessed by dialing 911, which routes calls to Warren County&#x27;s 911 Communications Center.

Law enforcement and other police services are provided by the Warren County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and are supplemented by the New York State Police, which maintains a barracks in the town. Queensbury has not had its own police force since disbanding it in 1982.

The town is divided into five fire protection districts: Bay Ridge, North Queensbury, Queensbury Central, South Queensbury, and West Glens Falls. Each district contains at least one fire station, with Queensbury Central and West Glens Falls each having two stations.

<doc id="127504" wikidata="Q3708819" url="?curid=127504" title="Stony Creek, New York">
<text>Stony Creek is a town in the southwestern part of Warren County, New York, United States. It is northwest of the city of Glens Falls and is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 767 at the 2010 census. The town is named for a creek that flows through it. Stony Creek is within the Adirondack Park.

== History ==
The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1795. Stony Creek was established as a town in 1852 from a portion of the Town of Warrensburg called &quot;Athol.&quot;

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, when a tannery existed at the confluence of Roaring Branch and Stony Creek near the center of town, the peak population of 1,250 was attained. During that time, extensive logging was done in western Stony Creek. Once many of the hemlock trees were taken out, and tanning practices changed, the tannery closed and Stony Creek&#x27;s population decreased significantly and has remained at lower levels since then.

The center of town – referred to by residents as the &quot;four corners&quot; (where the roads from nearby towns Hadley and Warrensburg intersect and continue on to Wilcox Lake/Harrisburg and Lens Lake, both of which terminate at those destinations) – includes the main business and social area of town. The Stony Creek Inn, the Creek Center Mercantile and the Post Office now occupy three of the four corners and a small park adjacent at Roaring Branch occupies the fourth. 

In addition to the four corners, the other main area of activity in Stony Creek is the John T. O&#x27;Neill Green Meadows Park (aka &quot;rec field&quot;) which is situated just west of the four corners and along Stony Creek itself. The rec field includes a swimming hole (below a small low-head dam on Stony Creek), basketball court, softball diamond and backstop, a large pavilion under which every Tuesday night in July and August the town presents Music in the Park, playground and covered area with picnic tables.

The &quot;rec&quot; field is also the site of the long-running annual Mountain Festival. In the past, the original Mountain Days celebrated the 100th anniversary of the town and paid homage to the area&#x27;s rich logging tradition, attracting thousands of attendees. It included competitions such as the greased pole climb (where competitors stood on each others&#x27; shoulders to get to the top of a debarked, greased pole where a $100 bill was nailed), chainsaw and bandsaw speed competitions, wood chopping competitions, axe throwing competitions, and greased pig chases. In recent years, Mountain Days, now called Mountain Festival, has become a more traditional and smaller festival, with music, food and activities for kids and stands selling various local arts and crafts. The festival continues to grow with added attractions each year.

The Methodist Episcopal Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

<text>In computer architecture and engineering, a sequencer or microsequencer generates the addresses used to step through the microprogram of a control store. It is used as a part of the control unit of a CPU or as a stand-alone generator for address ranges.

Usually the addresses are generated by some combination of a counter, a field from a microinstruction, and some subset of the instruction register. A counter is used for the typical case, that the next microinstruction is the one to execute. A field from the microinstruction is used for jumps, or other logic.

Since CPUs implement an instruction set, it&#x27;s very useful to be able to decode the instruction&#x27;s bits directly into the sequencer, to select a set of microinstructions to perform a CPU&#x27;s instructions.

Most modern CISC processors use a combination of pipelined logic to process lower complexity opcodes which can be completed in one clock cycle, and microcode to implement ones that take multiple clock cycles to complete.

One of the first integrated microcoded processors was the IBM PALM Processor, which emulated all of the processor&#x27;s instruction in microcode and was used on the IBM 5100, one of the first personal computers.

Recent examples of similar open-sourced microsequencer-based processors are the MicroCore Labs MCL86, MCL51, and MCL65 cores which emulate the Intel 8086/8088, 8051 and MOS 6502 instruction sets entirely in microcode.

==Simple example==
The Digital Scientific Corp. Meta 4 Series 16 computer system was a user-microprogrammable system first available in 1970. Branches in the microcode sequence occur in
one of three ways. 
* A branch microinstruction specifies the address of the next instruction, either conditionally or unconditionally. The logical index (IX) option causes the 16-bit Link register to be logical ORed into the branch address, thus providing a simple indexed branch capability.

* All the arithmetic/logical instructions allow the jump (J) modifier, which redirects execution to the microinstruction addressed by the Link register.

* All the arithmetic/logical instructions allow both the decrement counter (D) and jump (J) modifiers. In this case, the 8-bit loop counter register is decremented. If it is then not zero, a branch is taken to the contents of the Link register. If it is zero, execution continues with the next instruction.

One more sequencing option allowed on a branch instruction is the execute (XQ) option. When specified, the single instruction at the branch address is executed, but then execution continues after the original branch instruction. The IX option can be used with the XQ option.

==Complex example==
The IBM System/360 was a series of compatible computers introduced in 1964, many of which were microprogrammed. The System/360 Model 40 is a good example of a microprogrammed machine with complex microsequencing.

The microstore consists of 4,096 56-bit microinstructions that operate in
a horizontal microprogramming style. The store is addressed by the 12-bit
read-only address register (ROAR). Unlike most registers in the
S/360 architecture, bits in the ROAR are numbered from bit 0 on the right
to bit 11 on the left.
The model 40 performs no sequential execution of microinstructions and
therefore the microsequencer doesn&#x27;t really branch in the conventional
sense. Instead, each microinstruction specifies the address of the next one
to be executed. Four fields in the microinstruction contribute to the new
address.

* CA, 4 bits: Part of the next address, depending on the other fields.
* CB, 4 bits: Determines bit 1 of the next address.
* CC, 4 bits: Determines bit 0 of the next address.
* CD, 2 bits: Controls how the next address is assembled (except when the CB field contains 15).

There are essentially three combinations or formats of these fields.

=== Functional branch format ===
When the CB field contains 15, a &quot;functional branch&quot; occurs. The bits of
the new microstore address in the ROAR are determined as follows.
* bits 11–10: CD field
* bits 9–6: CA field
* bit 5: always 0
* bits 4–1: high-order 4 bits of the Q register, which is the right input to the 8-bit ALU
* bit 0: result of the test specified by the CC field

The CC field can specify various tests of the state of the machine. It can
also specify a constant 0 or 1 for an unconditional bit. 

This format alters the flow of control to 1 of 16 instruction &quot;pairs&quot;
within the low 32 words of a 64-word block of microstore (because bit 5 is
always 0). The CC field then determines which instruction of the pair
receives control.

=== CD = 0, 1, 3 format ===
When the CD field is 0, 1, or 3, flow of control is directed to an
instruction within the current 64-word block. The bits of the new microstore
address are determined as follows.
* bits 11–6: remain the same
* bits 5–2: CA field
* bit 1: if CD = 0, result of the test specified by the CB field; otherwise 0
* bit 0: result of the test specified by the CC field

The CA field selects 1 of 16 4-word groups within the current 64-word block.
The CB and CC fields then determine which instruction of the 4 receives
control.

=== CD = 2 format ===
When the CD field is 2, flow of control is directed in a nonobvious manner. The
bits of the new microstore address are determined as follows:
* bits 11–10: remain the same
* bits 9–6: CA field
* bits 5–2: remain the same
* bit 1: result of the test specified by the CB field
* bit 0: result of the test specified by the CC field

The next instruction is in the same 1K-word region as the current
instruction, because bits 11–10 remain the same. The CA field determines
the 64-word block within the region. The instruction is in the same 4-word
group within the new block as the current instruction is within the current
block, because bits 5–2 remain the same.
The CB and CC fields then determine which instruction of the 4 receives
control.

=== Simplification ===
This description has been simplified. It ignores the following features.
* The model 40 can run in CPU mode or channel mode. The description addresses only CPU mode.
* If the microinstruction is not in functional branch format and the CD field is 1 or 3, bit 1 of the next address is always 0. In this case, the values of the CD and CB fields determine one of a set of control lines to raise.

<text>A music sequencer (or audio sequencer or simply sequencer) is a device or application software that can record, edit, or play back music, by handling note and performance information in several forms, typically CV/Gate, MIDI, or Open Sound Control, and possibly audio and automation data for digital audio workstations (DAWs) and plug-ins.

== Overview ==

=== Modern sequencers ===

The advent of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and the Atari ST home computer in the 1980s gave programmers the opportunity to design software that could more easily record and play back sequences of notes played or programmed by a musician. This software also improved on the quality of the earlier sequencers which tended to be mechanical sounding and were only able to play back notes of exactly equal duration. Software-based sequencers allowed musicians to program performances that were more expressive and more human. These new sequencers could also be used to control external synthesizers, especially rackmounted sound modules, and it was no longer necessary for each synthesizer to have its own devoted keyboard.

As the technology matured, sequencers gained more features, such as the ability to record multitrack audio. Sequencers used for audio recording are called digital audio workstations (DAWs).

Many modern sequencers can be used to control virtual instruments implemented as software plug-ins. This allows musicians to replace expensive and cumbersome standalone synthesizers with their software equivalents.

Today the term &quot;sequencer&quot; is often used to describe software. However, hardware sequencers still exist. Workstation keyboards have their own proprietary built-in MIDI sequencers. Drum machines and some older synthesizers have their own step sequencer built in. There are still also standalone hardware MIDI sequencers, although the market demand for those has diminished greatly due to the greater feature set of their software counterparts.

== Types of music sequencer ==

Music sequencers can be categorized by handling data types, such as:
* MIDI data for MIDI sequencers (implemented as hardware or software)
* CV/Gate data for analog sequencers and possibly others (via CV/Gate interfaces)
* Automation data for mixing-automation in DAWs, and software effect / instrument plug-ins for DAWs with sequencing features
* Audio data in audio sequencers including DAWs, loop-based music software, etc.; or phrase samplers including grooveboxs, etc.

Also, music sequencer can be categorized by its construction and supporting modes.

=== Analog sequencer ===

Analog sequencers are typically implemented with analog electronics, and play the musical notes designated by a series of knobs or sliders corresponding to each musical note (step). It is designed for both composition and live performance; users can change the musical notes at any time without regarding recording mode. And also possibly, the time interval between each musical note (length of each step) can be independently adjustable. Typically, analog sequencers are used to generate repeated minimalistic phrases which may be reminiscent of Tangerine Dream, Giorgio Moroder or trance music.

=== (step recording mode) ===


On step sequencers, musical notes are rounded into steps of equal time intervals, and users can enter each musical note without exact timing; Instead, the timing and duration of each step can be designated in several different ways:
* On the drum machines: select a trigger timing from a row of &quot;step-buttons&quot;.
* On the bass machines: select a step note (or rest) from a &quot;chromatic keypad&quot;, then select a step duration (or tie) from a group of &quot;length-buttons&quot;, sequentially.
* On the several home keyboards: in addition to the real-time sequencer, a pair of &quot;step trigger buttons&quot; is provided; using it, notes on the pre-recorded sequence can be triggered in arbitrary timings for the timing dedicated recordings or performances. (See ).

In general, step mode, along with roughly quantized semi-realtime mode, is often supported on the drum machines, bass machines and several groove machines.

=== Realtime sequencer (realtime recording mode) ===

Realtime sequencers record the musical notes in real-time as on audio recorders, and play back musical notes with designated tempo, quantizations, and pitch. For editing, usually &quot;punch in/punch out&quot; features originated in the tape recording are provided, although it requires sufficient skills to obtain the desired result. For detailed editing, possibly another visual editing mode under graphical user interface may be more suitable. Anyway, this mode provides usability similar to audio recorders already familiar to musicians, and it is widely supported on software sequencers, DAWs, and built-in hardware sequencers.

=== Software sequencer ===
A &quot;software sequencer&quot; is a class of application software providing a functionality of music sequencer, and often provided as one feature of the DAW or the integrated music authoring environments. The features provided as sequencers vary widely depending on the software; even an analog sequencer can be simulated. The user may control the software sequencer either by using the graphical user interfaces or a specialized input devices, such as a MIDI controller.


=== Audio sequencer ===
Alternative subsets of audio sequencers include:

== History ==

=== Early sequencers ===

The early music sequencers were sound-producing devices such as automatic musical instruments, music boxes, mechanical organs, player pianos, and Orchestrions. Player pianos, for example, had much in common with contemporary sequencers. Composers or arrangers transmitted music to piano rolls which were subsequently edited by technicians who prepared the rolls for mass duplication. Eventually consumers were able to purchase these rolls and play them back on their own player pianos.

The origin of automatic musical instruments seems remarkably old. As early as the 9th century, the Persian (Iranian) Banū Mūsā brothers invented a hydropowered organ using exchangeable cylinders with pins, and also an automatic flute-playing machine using steam power, as described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;. The Banu Musa brothers&#x27; automatic flute player was the first programmable music sequencer device, and the first example of repetitive music technology, powered by hydraulics.

In 1206, Al-Jazari, an Arab engineer, invented programmable musical automata, a &quot;robot band&quot; which performed &quot;more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection.&quot; It was notably the first programmable drum machine. Among the four automaton musicians were two drummers. It was a drum machine where (cams) bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.

In the 14th century, rotating cylinders with pins were used to play a carillon (steam organ) in Flanders, and at least in the 15th century, barrel organs were seen in the Netherlands.
In the late-18th or early-19th century, with technological advances of the Industrial Revolution various automatic musical instruments were invented. Some examples: music boxes, barrel organs and barrel pianos consisting of a barrel or cylinder with pins or a flat metal disc with punched holes; or mechanical organs, player pianos and orchestrions using book music / music rolls (piano rolls) with punched holes, etc. These instruments were disseminated widely as popular entertainment devices prior to the inventions of phonographs, radios, and sound films which eventually eclipsed all such home music production devices. Of them all, punched-paper-tape media had been used until the mid-20th century. The earliest programmable music synthesizers including the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer in 1957, and the Siemens Synthesizer in 1959, were also controlled via punch tapes similar to piano rolls.
Additional inventions grew out of sound film audio technology. The drawn sound technique which appeared in the late 1920s, is notable as a precursor of today&#x27;s intuitive graphical user interfaces. In this technique, notes and various sound parameters are triggered by hand-drawn black ink waveforms directly upon the film substrate, hence they resemble piano rolls (or the &#x27;strip charts&#x27; of the modern sequencers/DAWs). Drawn soundtrack was often used in early experimental electronic music, including the Variophone developed by Yevgeny Sholpo in 1930, and the Oramics designed by Daphne Oram in 1957, and so forth.

=== Analog sequencers ===


During the 1940s–1960s, Raymond Scott, an American composer of electronic music, invented various kind of music sequencers for his electric compositions. The &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;, once covered on the wall of his studio in New York during the 1940s–1950s, was an electro-mechanical sequencer to produce rhythmic patterns, consisting of stepping relays (used on dial pulse telephone exchange), solenoids, control switches, and tone circuits with 16 individual oscillators. Later, Robert Moog would explain it in such terms as &quot;the whole room would go &#x27;clack – clack – clack&#x27;, and the sounds would come out all over the place&quot;.
The Circle Machine, developed in 1959, had incandescent bulbs each with its own rheostat, arranged in a ring, and a rotating arm with photocell scanning over the ring, to generate an arbitrary waveform. Also, the rotating speed of the arm was controlled via the brightness of lights, and as a result, arbitrary rhythms were generated.
The first electronic sequencer was invented by Raymond Scott, using thyratrons and relays.

Clavivox, developed since 1952, was a kind of keyboard synthesizer with sequencer. On its prototype, a theremin manufactured by young Robert Moog was utilized to enable portamento over 3-octave range, and on later version, it was replaced by a pair of photographic film and photocell for controlling the pitch by voltage.

In 1968, Ralph Lundsten and Leo Nilsson had a polyphonic synthesizer with sequencer called Andromatic built for them by Erkki Kurenniemi.

=== Step sequencers ===


The &quot;step sequencer&quot;s played rigid patterns of notes using a grid of (usually) 16 buttons, or steps, each step being 1/16 of a measure. These patterns of notes were then chained together to form longer compositions. Sequencers of this kind are still in use, mostly built into drum machines and grooveboxes. They are monophonic by nature, although some are multi-timbral, meaning that they can control several different sounds but only play one note on each of those sounds.

=== Early computers ===

On the other hand, software sequencers were continuously utilized since the 1950s in the context of computer music, including computer-&quot;played&quot; music (software sequencer), computer-&quot;composed&quot; music (music synthesis), and computer &quot;sound generation&quot; (sound synthesis). In June 1951, the first computer music &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; was played on CSIRAC, Australia&#x27;s first digital computer. In 1956, Lejaren Hiller at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign wrote one of the earliest programs for computer music composition on ILLIAC, and collaborated on the first piece, &quot;Illiac Suite for String Quartet&quot;, with Leonard Issaction. In 1957 Max Mathews at Bell Labs wrote MUSIC, the first widely used program for sound generation, and a 17-second composition was performed by the IBM 704 computer. Subsequently, computer music was mainly researched on the expensive mainframe computers in computer centers, until the 1970s when minicomputers and then microcomputers became available in this field.

==== In Japan ====
In Japan, experiments in computer music date back to 1962, when Keio University professor Sekine and Toshiba engineer Hayashi experimented with the TOSBAC computer. This resulted in a piece entitled &quot;TOSBAC Suite&quot;.

===Early computer music hardware===
 In 1965, Max Mathews and L. Rosler developed Graphic 1, an interactive graphical sound system (that implies sequencer) on which one could draw figures using a light-pen that would be converted into sound, simplifying the process of composing computer-generated music. It used PDP-5 minicomputer for data input, and IBM 7094 mainframe computer for rendering sound.

Also in 1970, Mathews and F. R. Moore developed the GROOVE (Generated Real-time Output Operations on Voltage-controlled Equipment) system, a first fully developed music synthesis system for interactive composition (that implies sequencer) and realtime performance, using 3C/Honeywell DDP-24 (or DDP-224) minicomputers. It used a CRT display to simplify the management of music synthesis in realtime, 12-bit D/A converter for realtime sound playback, an interface for CV/gate analog devices, and even several controllers including a musical keyboard, knobs, and rotating joysticks to capture realtime performance.

=== Digital sequencers ===
In 1971, Electronic Music Studios (EMS) released one of the first digital sequencer products as a module of Synthi 100, and its derivation, Synthi Sequencer series.
After then, Oberheim released the DS-2 Digital Sequencer in 1974, and Sequential Circuits released Model 800 in 1977 

==== In Japan ====

In 1977, Roland Corporation released the MC-8 MicroComposer, also called &quot;computer music composer&quot; by Roland. It was an early stand-alone, microprocessor-based, digital CV/gate sequencer, and an early polyphonic sequencer. It equipped a keypad to enter notes as numeric codes, 16 KB of RAM for a maximum of 5200 notes (large for the time), and a polyphony function which allocated multiple pitch CVs to a single Gate. It was capable of eight-channel polyphony, allowing the creation of polyrhythmic sequences. The MC-8 had a significant impact on popular electronic music, with the MC-8 and its descendants (such as the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer) impacting popular electronic music production in the 1970s and 1980s more than any other family of sequencers. The MC-8&#x27;s earliest known users were Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1978.

=== Music workstations ===


In 1975, New England Digital (NED) released ABLE computer (microcomputer) as a dedicated data processing unit for Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer (1973), and based on it, later Synclavier series were developed.

The Synclavier I, released in September 1977, was one of the earliest digital music workstation product with multitrack sequencer. Synclavier series evolved throughout the late-1970s to the mid-1980s, and they also established integration of digital-audio and music-sequencer, on their Direct-to-Disk option in 1984, and later Tapeless Studio system.

In 1982, renewed the Fairlight CMI Series II and added new sequencer software &quot;Page R&quot;, which combined step sequencing with sample playback.

While there were earlier microprocessor-based sequencers for digital polyphonic synthesizers, their early products tended to prefer the newer internal digital buses than the old-style analogue CV/gate interface once used on their prototype system. Then in the early-1980s, they also re-recognized the needs of CV/gate interface, and supported it along with MIDI as options.

==== In Japan ====
Yamaha&#x27;s GS-1, their first FM digital synthesizer, was released in 1980. To program the synthesizer, Yamaha built a custom computer workstation . It was only available at Yamaha&#x27;s headquarters in Japan (Hamamatsu) and the United States (Buena Park, California).

=== MIDI sequencers ===

In June 1981, Roland Corporation founder Ikutaro Kakehashi proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers&#x27; instruments as well as computers, to Oberheim Electronics founder Tom Oberheim and Sequential Circuits president Dave Smith. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from Yamaha, Korg and Kawai. In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith. The first MIDI sequencer was the Roland MSQ-700, released in 1983.

It was not until the advent of MIDI that general-purpose computers started to play a role as sequencers. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based MIDI sequencers were developed. MIDI-to-CV/gate converters were then used to enable analogue synthesizers to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer. Since its introduction, MIDI has remained the musical instrument industry standard interface through to the present day.

=== Personal computers ===

In 1987, software sequencers called trackers were developed to realize the low-cost integration of sampling sound and interactive digital sequencer as seen on Fairlight CMI II &quot;Page R&quot;. They became popular in the 1980s and 1990s as simple sequencers for creating computer game music, and remain popular in the demoscene and chiptune music.

Modern computer digital audio software after the 2000s, such as Ableton Live, incorporates aspects of sequencers among many other features.

==== In Japan ====
In 1978, Japanese personal computers such as the Hitachi Basic Master equipped the low-bit D/A converter to generate sound which can be sequenced using Music Macro Language (MML). This was used to produce chiptune video game music.

It was not until the advent of MIDI, introduced to the public in 1983, that general-purpose computers really started to play a role as software sequencers. NEC&#x27;s personal computers, the PC-88 and PC-98, added support for MIDI sequencing with MML programming in 1982. In 1983, Yamaha modules for the MSX featured music production capabilities, real-time FM synthesis with sequencing, MIDI sequencing, and a graphical user interface for the software sequencer. Also in 1983, Roland Corporation&#x27;s CMU-800 sound module introduced music synthesis and sequencing to the PC, Apple II, and Commodore 64.

The spread of MIDI on personal computers was facilitated by Roland&#x27;s MPU-401, released in 1984. It was the first MIDI-equipped PC sound card, capable of MIDI sound processing and sequencing. After Roland sold MPU sound chips to other sound card manufacturers, it established a universal standard MIDI-to-PC interface. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based MIDI software sequencers were developed.

<text>A DNA sequencer is a scientific instrument used to automate the DNA sequencing process. Given a sample of DNA, a DNA sequencer is used to determine the order of the four bases: G (guanine), C (cytosine), A (adenine) and T (thymine). This is then reported as a text string, called a read. Some DNA sequencers can be also considered optical instruments as they analyze light signals originating from fluorochromes attached to nucleotides.

The first automated DNA sequencer, invented by Lloyd M. Smith, was introduced by Applied Biosystems in 1987. It used the Sanger sequencing method, a technology which formed the basis of the &quot;first generation&quot; of DNA sequencers and enabled the completion of the human genome project in 2001. This first generation of DNA sequencers are essentially automated electrophoresis systems that detect the migration of labelled DNA fragments. Therefore, these sequencers can also be used in the genotyping of genetic markers where only the length of a DNA fragment(s) needs to be determined (e.g. microsatellites, AFLPs).

The Human Genome Project spurred the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as Next Generation Sequencers (NGS) to sequence the human genome. These include the 454, SOLiD and Illumina DNA sequencing platforms. Next generation sequencing machines have increased the rate of DNA sequencing substantially, as compared with the previous Sanger methods. DNA samples can be prepared automatically in as little as 90 mins, while a human genome can be sequenced at 15 times coverage in a matter of days.

More recent, third-generation DNA sequencers such as PacBio SMRT and Oxford Nanopore offer the possibility of sequencing long molecules, compared to short-read technologies such as Illumina SBS or MGI Tech&#x27;s DNBSEQ.

Because of limitations in DNA sequencer technology, the reads of many of these technologies are short, compared to the length of a genome therefore the reads must be assembled into longer contigs. The data may also contain errors, caused by limitations in the DNA sequencing technique or by errors during PCR amplification. DNA sequencer manufacturers use a number of different methods to detect which DNA bases are present. The specific protocols applied in different sequencing platforms have an impact in the final data that is generated. Therefore, comparing data quality and cost across different technologies can be a daunting task. Each manufacturer provides their own ways to inform sequencing errors and scores. However, errors and scores between different platforms cannot always be compared directly. Since these systems rely on different DNA sequencing approaches, choosing the best DNA sequencer and method will typically depend on the experiment objectives and available budget.

==History==

The first DNA sequencing methods were developed by Gilbert (1973) and Sanger (1975). Gilbert introduced a sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA followed by cleavage at specific bases whereas Sanger&#x27;s technique is based on dideoxynucleotide chain termination. The Sanger method became popular due to its increased efficiency and low radioactivity. The first automated DNA sequencer was the AB370A, introduced in 1986 by Applied Biosystems. The AB370A was able to sequence 96 samples simultaneously, 500 kilobases per day, and reaching read lengths up to 600 bases. This was the beginning of the &quot;first generation&quot; of DNA sequencers, which implemented Sanger sequencing, fluorescent dideoxy nucleotides and polyacrylamide gel sandwiched between glass plates - slab gels. The next major advance was the release in 1995 of the AB310 which utilized a linear polymer in a capillary in place of the slab gel for DNA strand separation by electrophoresis. These techniques formed the base for the completion of the human genome project in 2001. The human genome project spurred the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as Next Generation Sequencers (NGS). In 2005, 454 Life Sciences released the 454 sequencer, followed by Solexa Genome Analyzer and SOLiD (Supported Oligo Ligation Detection) by Agencourt in 2006. Applied Biosystems acquired Agencourt in 2006, and in 2007, Roche bought 454 Life Sciences, while Illumina purchased Solexa. Ion Torrent entered the market in 2010 and was acquired by Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific). And BGI started manufacturing sequencers in China after acquiring Complete Genomics under their MGI arm. These are still the most common NGS systems due to their competitive cost, accuracy, and performance.

More recently, a third generation of DNA sequencers was introduced. The sequencing methods applied by these sequencers do not require DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction – PCR), which speeds up the sample preparation before sequencing and reduces errors. In addition, sequencing data is collected from the reactions caused by the addition of nucleotides in the complementary strand in real time. Two companies introduced different approaches in their third-generation sequencers. Pacific Biosciences sequencers utilize a method called Single-molecule real-time (SMRT), where sequencing data is produced by light (captured by a camera) emitted when a nucleotide is added to the complementary strand by enzymes containing fluorescent dyes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies is another company developing third-generation sequencers using electronic systems based on nanopore sensing technologies.

==Manufacturers of DNA sequencers==

DNA sequencers have been developed, manufactured, and sold by the following companies, among others.

===Roche===

The 454 DNA sequencer was the first next-generation sequencer to become commercially successful. It was developed by 454 Life Sciences and purchased by Roche in 2007. 454 utilizes the detection of pyrophosphate released by the DNA polymerase reaction when adding a nucleotide to the template strain.

Roche currently manufactures two systems based on their pyrosequencing technology: the GS FLX+ and the GS Junior System. The GS FLX+ System promises read lengths of approximately 1000 base pairs while the GS Junior System promises 400 base pair reads. A predecessor to GS FLX+, the 454 GS FLX Titanium system was released in 2008, achieving an output of 0.7G of data per run, with 99.9% accuracy after quality filter, and a read length of up to 700bp. In 2009, Roche launched the GS Junior, a bench top version of the 454 sequencer with read length up to 400bp, and simplified library preparation and data processing.

One of the advantages of 454 systems is their running speed. Manpower can be reduced with automation of library preparation and semi-automation of emulsion PCR. A disadvantage of the 454 system is that it is prone to errors when estimating the number of bases in a long string of identical nucleotides. This is referred to as a homopolymer error and occurs when there are 6 or more identical bases in row. Another disadvantage is that the price of reagents is relatively more expensive compared with other next-generation sequencers.

In 2013 Roche announced that they would be shutting down development of 454 technology and phasing out 454 machines completely in 2016 when its technology became noncompetitive.

Roche produces a number of software tools which are optimised for the analysis of 454 sequencing data. Such as,

* &quot;GS Run Processor&quot; converts raw images generated by a sequencing run into intensity values. The process consists of two main steps: image processing and signal processing. The software also applies normalization, signal correction, base-calling and quality scores for individual reads. The software outputs data in Standard Flowgram Format (or SFF) files to be used in data analysis applications (GS De Novo Assembler, GS Reference Mapper or GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer). 
* &quot;GS De Novo Assembler&quot; is a tool for &quot;de novo&quot; assembly of whole-genomes up to 3GB in size from shotgun reads alone or combined with paired end data generated by 454 sequencers. It also supports de novo assembly of transcripts (including analysis), and also isoform variant detection. 
* &quot;GS Reference Mapper&quot; maps short reads to a reference genome, generating a consensus sequence. The software is able to generate output files for assessment, indicating insertions, deletions and SNPs. Can handle large and complex genomes of any size. 
* Finally, the &quot;GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer&quot; aligns reads from amplicon samples against a reference, identifying variants (linked or not) and their frequencies. It can also be used to detect unknown and low-frequency variants. It includes graphical tools for analysis of alignments.

===Illumina===

Illumina produces a number of next-generation sequencing machines using technology acquired from Manteia Predictive Medicine and developed by Solexa. Illumina makes a number of next generation sequencing machines using this technology including the HiSeq, Genome Analyzer IIx, MiSeq and the HiScanSQ, which can also process microarrays.

The technology leading to these DNA sequencers was first released by Solexa in 2006 as the Genome Analyzer. Illumina purchased Solexa in 2007. The Genome Analyzer uses a sequencing by synthesis method. The first model produced 1G per run. During the year 2009 the output was increased from 20G per run in August to 50G per run in December. In 2010 Illumina released the HiSeq 2000 with an output of 200 and then 600G per run which would take 8 days. At its release the HiSeq 2000 provided one of the cheapest sequencing platforms at $0.02 per million bases as costed by the Beijing Genomics Institute.

In 2011 Illumina released a benchtop sequencer called the MiSeq. At its release the MiSeq could generate 1.5G per run with paired end 150bp reads. A sequencing run can be performed in 10 hours when using automated DNA sample preparation.

The Illumina HiSeq uses two software tools to calculate the number and position of DNA clusters to assess the sequencing quality: the HiSeq control system and the real-time analyzer. These methods help to assess if nearby clusters are interfering with each other.

===Life Technologies===
Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) produces DNA sequencers under the Applied Biosystems and Ion Torrent brands. Applied Biosystems makes the SOLiD next-generation sequencing platform, and Sanger-based DNA sequencers such as the 3500 Genetic Analyzer. Under the Ion Torrent brand, Applied Biosystems produces four next-generation sequencers: the Ion PGM System, Ion Proton System, Ion S5 and Ion S5xl systems. The company is also believed to be developing their new capillary DNA sequencer called SeqStudio that will be released early 2018.

SOLiD systems was acquired by Applied Biosystems in 2006. SOLiD applies sequencing by ligation and dual base encoding. The first SOLiD system was launched in 2007, generating reading lengths of 35bp and 3G data per run. After five upgrades, the 5500xl sequencing system was released in 2010, considerably increasing read length to 85bp, improving accuracy up to 99.99% and producing 30G per 7-day run.

The limited read length of the SOLiD has remained a significant shortcoming and has to some extent limited its use to experiments where read length is less vital such as resequencing and transcriptome analysis and more recently ChIP-Seq and methylation experiments. The DNA sample preparation time for SOLiD systems has become much quicker with the automation of sequencing library preparations such as the Tecan system.

The colour space data produced by the SOLiD platform can be decoded into DNA bases for further analysis, however software that considers the original colour space information can give more accurate results. Life Technologies has released BioScope, a data analysis package for resequencing, ChiP-Seq and transcriptome analysis. It uses the MaxMapper algorithm to map the colour space reads.

===Beckman Coulter===
Beckman Coulter (now Danaher) has previously manufactured chain termination and capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencers under the model name CEQ, including the CEQ 8000. The company now produces the GeXP Genetic Analysis System, which uses dye terminator sequencing. This method uses a thermocycler in much the same way as PCR to denature, anneal, and extend DNA fragments, amplifying the sequenced fragments.

===Pacific Biosciences===
Pacific Biosciences produces the PacBio RS and Sequel sequencing systems using a single molecule real time sequencing, or SMRT, method. This system can produce read lengths of multiple thousands of base pairs. Higher raw read errors are corrected using either circular consensus - where the same strand is read over and over again - or using optimized assembly strategies. Scientists have reported 99.9999% accuracy with these strategies. The Sequel system was launched in 2015 with an increased capacity and a lower price.

=== Oxford Nanopore ===
Oxford Nanopore Technologies&#x27; MinION sequencer is based on evolving nanopore sequencing technology to nucleic acid analyses. The device is four inches long and gets power from a USB port. MinION decodes DNA directly as the molecule is drawn at the rate of 450 bases/second through a nanopore suspended in a membrane. Changes in electric current indicate which base is present. Initially, the device was 60 to 85 percent accurate, compared with 99.9 percent in conventional machines. Even inaccurate results may prove useful because it produces long read lengths. In early 2021, researchers from University of British Columbia has used special molecular tags and able to reduce the five-to-15 per cent error rate of the device to less than 0.005 per cent even when sequencing many long stretches of DNA at a time. There are two more product iterations based on MinION; the first one is the GridION which is a slightly larger sequencer that processes up to five MinION flow cells at once. And, the second one is the PromethION which uses as many as 100,000 pores in parallel, more suitable for high volume sequencing.

=== MGI ===
MGI produces high-throughput sequencers for scientific research and clinical applications such as DNBSEQ-G50, DNBSEQ-G400, and DNBSEQ-T7, under a proprietary DNBSEQ technology. It is based upon DNA nanoball sequencing and combinatorial probe anchor synthesis technologies, in which DNA nanoballs (DNBs) are loaded onto a patterned array chip via the fluidic system, and later a sequencing primer is added to the adaptor region of DNBs for hybridization. DNBSEQ-T7 can generate short reads at a very large scale—up to 60 human genomes per day. DNBSEQ-T7 was used to generate 150 bp paired-end reads, sequencing 30X, to sequence the genome of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 to identify the genetic variants predisposition in severe COVID-19 illness. Using a novel technique the researchers from China National GeneBank sequenced PCR-free libraries on MGI&#x27;s PCR-free DNBSEQ arrays to obtain for the first time a true PCR-free whole genome sequencing. MGISEQ-2000 was used in single-cell RNA sequencing to study the underlying pathogenesis and recovery in COVID-19 patients, as published in Nature Medicine.

The town population was 938 at the 2010 census, an increase of 7.2% since the 2000 census. The town of Hampton is located in the northeastern corner of Washington County.

== History ==
This area of New York was part of a jurisdictional dispute between New York and Vermont. The matter was not settled until after 1790.

The town was formed in 1786 and was once called &quot;Hampton Corners&quot; and &quot;Greenfield.&quot; It was founded by former American Revolutionary War officer Gideon G. Warren. The first town meeting was conducted in his home. Many of the first settlers were from Massachusetts and Connecticut. The land contains parts of early land patents, including Skene&#x27;s Little Patent and those issued to groups of British officers.

In 1783, the Poultney River at the eastern town line suddenly changed course and became unnavigable due to a sudden influx of water.

Red slate and other colored slates were mined here.

The William Miller Chapel and Ascension Rock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Thus, many of the main hills, valleys, creeks and roads run diagonally across Hebron in keeping with the general outlay of the Appalachians.

Hebron is notably at once a nexus between valley regions within the &#x27;Great Valley&#x27;, and also between mountain regions. The nexus of the Champlain and Hudson Valleys (described in greater detail below in the paragraph on watersheds) is located here. The taller peaks of the Taconics are on the Vermont side of the border, and begin to dwindle comparatively into foothills in Hebron. Hebron can be described as the foothills between the Adirondack Mountains of New York, and the Taconic and Green Mountains of Vermont. Hebron thus is at once at a high point dividing valleys, and a lowlands dividing mountain areas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.32%) is water.

The eastern town line of Hebron is the Vermont border, and the beginning of New England proper. The town of Salem is adjacent to the south. The towns of Argyle, Hartford and Granville (famous for its colored slate) make up the remaining border on the western and northern edges.

NY Route 22 is a north–south highway through the eastern part of the town, running roughly parallel to the Vermont border. Route 30 connects Salem to Hartford through the western part of Hebron. Route 31, the longest road through Hebron, cuts across diagonally from Route 30 connecting West Hebron to West Pawlet, Vermont.

Hebron is at the threshold between two major watersheds whose waters travel great distances in opposite directions, only to rejoin in the Atlantic Ocean. The formal valleys and watersheds to which Hebron belongs are the following: Champlain Valley/Lake George Watershed—02010001 ; Hudson River Valley/Hudson-Hoosic Watershed—02020003 . Waters in the northernmost part of Hebron drain via the Mettawee River north into Lake Champlain, where they mix with waters from Lake George (&quot;Horican&quot;) and then flow into the Saint Lawrence River (&quot;Kaniatarowanenneh&quot;). These Hebron waters mingle in the Saint Lawrence with waters of all the Great Lakes as they flow northeastward into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and join the Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile, the majority of Hebron waters drain south via Black Creek into the Batten Kill (&quot;Dionondehowa&quot;) and then the Hudson River (&quot;Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk&quot; or Muhheakantuck), and flow south into the Atlantic Ocean just below New York City.

The two branches of Black Creek join in West Hebron just west of the village&#x27;s main street, and after the waterfall in the West Branch of Black Creek (which is just before Patterson Road). See map . See the approximation of the watershed divide mapped in context of mountains and valleys . See Washington County for a set of contextual maps.

== History ==
Settled in the late 18th century, Hebron was first known as the District of Black Creek. The British Crown granted parcels of land in the area, called &quot;patents,&quot; to soldiers who served in the French and Indian War (1754-1763) (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War). Most of the grants were to members of the Highland Scottish 77th Regiment. Many of the parcels were transferred from officers and soldiers to speculators, who sold them to New England and Scotch-Irish settlers. Some of the patents that form the town are Lintot, Blundell and Sheriff. Originals of these patents are held by the National Archives.

The town of Hebron was formed March 23, 1786, and named after Hebron, Connecticut. Its namesake is the biblical Hebron, the largest city in the present-day West Bank, 30 km south of Jerusalem.

The main road running north–south through the Hebron area, now named Route 22, used to be known as the “Great Northern Turnpike” (or “the Turnpike”). Two historic milepost markers remain in the town, one at 7047 State Route 22, the second just north of Chamberlin Mills Road. A third is just south of the town line with Salem, New York. A peddler&#x27;s wagon belonging to Lorenzo Levi Brown of Hebron is in the wagon collection of the Museum of Long Island at Stony Brook, New York.

The town developed as an agricultural community, which it still is today. By 1864, it was the chief potato-producing area of Washington County. Potatoes have been superseded by dairy farming. In recent decades, farms have been consolidated into larger operations. While the town has numerous residents whose families have been in the area for three generations, it also has new part-time residents who have second homes here. Others have retired here for the beauty of the area.

=== Hebron Volunteer Fire Company ===
The West Hebron Volunteer Fire Company was formed in 1947. Willard Bain, a charter member, died in February 2008. The first fire truck, BRUSH 356, was put into service in 1947 and operated until 2008. It was retired after the purchase that spring of a CAFS truck ATTACK 356. In 1978, the East Hebron Fire Company was formed after the homes of Nelson Greene and Alfred &quot;Pug&quot; Getty burned down. Getty donated the land and Greene led the group of volunteers who built Station Two. The two companies later merged to form the Hebron Volunteer Fire Company. www.HebronVolunteerFireCompany.com

The Hebron Volunteer Fire Company First Response Team provides emergency medical services to the town. These firefighters/emergency medical technicians (EMTs) respond to medical and trauma-related calls. All first responders are licensed as EMTs by the State of New York. David Getty, a lifelong resident of Hebron, is Fire Chief.

=== Hebron Preservation Society ===
The Hebron Preservation Society was chartered by the State of New York in 1975. The Society maintains a museum, with collections held in two historic buildings located on the east side of Route 22 in the hamlet of East Hebron. The former one-room school house built in 1845 was acquired from the Salem School District, and a small tenant farm house, built in the early 19th century, was purchased in 1990. The society published &quot;HEBRON: A Century In Review&quot; in 1988, with a second edition in 2006. The museum houses a display of school house memorabilia, varied articles, ledgers, books, and family genealogies pertaining to the residents, businesses and organizations in Hebron.

=== Beauty of Hebron potato ===
The Beauty of Hebron potato variety was promoted by a local seedsman, Edward L. Coy (E.L. Coy). Both Coy and Rachel Campbell of Hebron took credit for the discovery. The variety was a naturally fertilized seedling of Garnet Chili. The earliest published reference to the Beauty of Hebron variety is from the 1876 Annual Agricultural Society Meeting in Marblehead, Massachusetts. The next year, in 1877 the US Department of Agriculture introduced the Beauty of Hebron potato to growers in 26 states for tests. Various major seed companies of the time claimed credit for its commercial introduction, including J. M. Thornburn of New York City, JJH Gregory of Marblehead, and Peter Henderson of New Jersey.

In 1879 Coy shipped &quot;Hebron Beauties&quot; to London. The Beauty of Hebron was one of the varieties used to restock the British Isles after the potato blight and Great Famine of Ireland. Its use spread throughout the British Empire to localities such as New Zealand and New Caledonia. By the turn of the 20th century, it was also a favorite of market and home gardeners in the United States. In 1946, the USDA did not list it in commercial production in the United States, but the 1959 &quot;Potato Variety Handbook&quot; of the American Potato Association includes the Beauty of Hebron. Most current tissue culture stocks and tubers came from Elmer Hansen of Alberta, Canada; in 1988 he provided seed to Will Bownall and the Seedsavers organization, devoted to preserving historic varieties.

The Beauty of Hebron is listed on the RAFT list of Threatened American Foods. The Beauty of Hebron is maintained at the Canadian Potato Research Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; the University of North Dakota Potato Breeding Program; and with a commercial breeder. As of 2008, it was not known if the potato variety was in commercial production. Due to Sally Brillion of the Hebron Preservation Society, amateur gardeners began to cultivate the Beauty of Hebron potato in 2006.

<text>Hudson Falls (formerly Sandy Hill) is a village located in Washington County, New York, United States. The village is in the southwest of the town of Kingsbury, on U.S. Route 4. Hudson Falls is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 7,428. It was the county seat of Washington County until 1994, when the county seat was moved to Fort Edward.

== History ==
In 1764, Albert Baker built Kingsbury&#x27;s first sawmill near what is known today as Baker&#x27;s Falls. As early as 1792, the area of Kingsbury near Baker&#x27;s Falls was referred to as Sandy Hill. In 1810, the hamlet incorporated as a village, keeping the name Sandy Hill. Its boundaries expanded to their current limits in the 1840s.

Around 1824, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal was constructed to bring water from the Hudson River to the Champlain Canal. With the opening of the Feeder Canal, Sandy Hill became a prosperous manufacturing center, producing lumber, paper, pianos, wagons, pulleys, and other products. The Glens Falls Feeder Canal is no longer used commercial traffic, but the route of Canal is a fourteen mile long park, with a walking and bike trail on the old tow path.

Stone quarried in Hudson Falls was used to construct the Bennington Battle Monument (1889) and the Brooklyn Bridge. The former site of the quarry has been redeveloped for use by the Washington-Saratoga-Warren-Hamilton-Essex Board of Cooperative Educational Services.

In 1851, Francis Wolle invented the first bag-making machine and formed a company that would later become the Union Bag and Paper Company. In 1892, the company relocated from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to Hudson Falls, where it had a paper mill. In 1906, the Union Paper and Bag Company built the Fenimore Bridge (Sandy Hill Bridge), spanning the Hudson River between Hudson Falls built in Washington County and the town of Moreau in Saratoga County, since the company had plants in both locations. For a brief period of time, the closed-spandrel arch bridge was the longest multiple span, reinforced-concrete arch bridge in the world. The bridge was closed to all traffic in 1989, although various plans have been proposed over the years to reopen the span; for example, in 2018, there was a proposal to convert it into a pedestrian walkway and bike path.

==Churches==
* The First Presbyterian Church of Hudson Falls was organized in 1803. Services were held in the town courthouse until a new church building was dedicated in 1827 at the site of the Old Burying Ground. This building was demolished around 1893 to make way for a larger structure, which was dedicated in 1895.
* Zion Episcopal was founded in 1817 as the Episcopal-Methodist Church. Services were held in a parishioner&#x27;s home until a new building was completed in 1849 and consecrated as Zion Episcopal Church. In 1968, lightning caused a fire that gutted the interior, which was then rebuilt.
* The first Roman Catholic church between Albany and Canada, St. Mary&#x27;s, was constructed in the 1830s in Sandy Hill (later Hudson Falls) on Wall Street. It later burned down, and a new one was erected on Park Place. St. Paul&#x27;s Church was founded in the 1870s to serve French Canadians in Sandy Hill. They purchased the small wooden old First Baptist Church at the top of River Street, after that congregation built a second, larger church next to the courthouse.

A charter for a Township of Kingsbury was granted by King George III on May 11, 1762. It was named after a small parish on the western outskirts of London. Its first settler was James Bradshaw. Albert Baker arrived second, constructing a sawmill at what is today known as Baker&#x27;s Falls. John Jones built a mill in the northwest corner of town. Following his death, Edward Patten purchased Jones&#x27; land and renamed the settlement Pattens Mills, a name by which it is still known.

During the American Revolutionary War, General John Burgoyne and his troops passed through the town after the Battle of Fort Anne. In 1780, Major Christopher Carleton led a raid that set fire to everything but the homes of Loyalists.

Charlotte County, of which Kingbury was a part, was annexed by the Vermont Republic in 1781. The following year, it renounced its claim to Charlotte County, and New York officially recognized the town of Kingsbury. In 1810, the settlement near Baker&#x27;s Falls incorporated as the village of Sandy Hill, though it changed its name to Hudson Falls in 1910.

In 1823, the Champlain Canal was opened, followed in 1833 by the Glens Falls Feeder Canal. Major industry consisted of farming, milling, mining, and logging. Limestone was produced at Smiths Basin.

<text>White Creek is a town in Washington County, New York, United States. It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town population was 3,275 at the 2020 census. The town contains the White Creek Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==History==

Settlement in the town of &quot;White Creek began after the granting of the Cambridge Patent in 1761. The first settlers in the present hamlet of White Creek were Quakers. John Allen built the first permanent residence in 1757 with a later addition in 1770, a house which remains as one of the best-preserved structures surviving from the eighteenth century in White Creek. The Cornell House and the Christopher Allen House (both built 1772) also survive from the colonial period, reflecting a rich variety of house styles. According to local tradition, the Christopher Allen House was operated as a tavern, and its ballroom also served as a temporary hospital for wounded from the nearby Battle of Waloomsac [Bennington] in 1777.

White Creek was formed from Cambridge in 1815. It became a center of regional commerce late in the eighteenth century, and local prosperity reached its high point during the 1840s. Among the most interesting and important of White Creek&#x27;s historic buildings are its commercial structures. The hotel and tavern and the harness shop are outstanding, rare Greek Revival-style rural commercial buildings whose presence in the historic district contribute to a fuller understanding of life in White Creek during the nineteenth century. The businesses housed in these and other White Creek structures prospered, enabling owners to build comfortable homes along the streets of the hamlet. Most of these residences survive within the present district, and their stylistic treatment illustrates the relationship between wealth and taste in White Creek from the 1750s to the 1880s.

Present day White Creek is made up of mostly farms, fields, small residences, and forest land. There is one small community located on Route 68 and Niles Road that is a cluster of about 20-30 homes. These residences make up the White Creek National Historic District.

<text>Newark ( ) is a village in Wayne County, New York, United States, south east of Rochester and west of Syracuse. The population was 9,017 at the 2020 census. The Village of Newark is in the south part of the Town of Arcadia and is in the south of Wayne County. It is the most populous community in Wayne County.

==History==
The current village includes the former &quot;Miller&#x27;s Basin&quot; and &quot;Lockville&quot; prior to its own incorporation in 1839. The Village of Newark was incorporated in 1853. It was in Newark, New York that Jackson &amp; Perkins Company, famous for its roses, was founded in 1872 by Albert Jackson and his son-in law Charles H. Perkins. The Perkins mansion is now listed on the historic register.

The Jackson–Perkins House, 310 High Street, is significant for its association with the growth and development of the Jackson and Perkins Company, one of the largest and best-known horticultural firms in the United States. The company was established in 1872 by Albert E. Jackson and his son-in-law, Charles H. Perkins, fruit growers and amateur gardeners, who had purchased the property in 1864.

Initially, Perkins, a lawyer, banker and vice-president of Chase Bros. Nursery (Rochester) began experimenting with cultivating grapes and other fruits on the property; however, his growing passion for roses led to a substantial increase in horticultural activity, and in 1884 the company hired E. Alvin Miller, a professional propagator and breeder. This marked a substantial enlargement in the size and professionalism of the company, which began to cultivate roses and other ornamentals on a large scale. Although the growth of the company led to the acquisition of additional farms, the family&#x27;s High Street estate remained the center of operations, with experiments in propagation taking place on site and the residence&#x27;s library serving as the company&#x27;s main office. In 1910, Charles Perkins&#x27;s son, George C. Perkins, took over as president. Charles H. Perkins began living in Santa Ana, California during the winters where he began a large poultry business with his brother, Wyllys. He also had an orange ranch run by his oldest son Albert J. Perkins. After George C. resigned, his cousin Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Perkins became president until the 1960s.

In the first decades of the twentieth century, Jackson and Perkins achieved worldwide fame, particularly for its roses. In 1908, the company received an award from the National Rose Society for Great Britain for the popular &quot;Dorothy Perkins&quot; climbing rose. During the 1920s and 30s the company&#x27;s research directors were prolific in developing hundreds of new varieties and the company sold millions of plants. In addition to roses, Jackson and Perkins also became major distributors of clematis, lilacs, boxwoods, azaleas, and rhododendrons. After specializing in the wholesale trade for more than half a century, Jackson and Perkins&#x27;s popular exhibit at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair led to its entrance into the retail market as a mail order business.

During WWII the largest rose grower in the world folded in Germany due to the war. This left the door open for J&amp;P to become the &quot;Rose Capital of America&quot; and the world&#x27;s rose garden. Jackson and Perkins is now located in Hodges, South Carolina, a division of the Park Seed Co. and is a full service nursery that disseminates more than one million catalogues and ships more than three million roses and other plants to customers each year.

In 1852, Charles W. Stuart purchased a farm on what is now North Main St, and in need of an income he sold fruit trees door to door to area farms. This was the beginning of a direct selling business and C.W. Stuart Nursery became one of the largest wholesale nurseries in the country.

In 1949, the C.H. Stuart Co.(C.W. Stuart&#x27;s son), with many successes direct selling, formed a small division, Sarah Coventry Inc., named after C.H. Stuart&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Sarah Coventry Beale, which marketed costume jewelry until 1984.

In 1900, 4,578 people lived in Newark, New York; in 1910, 6,227; and in 1940, 9,646. Newark has become the industrial and retail center of the county. The Jackson–Perkins House and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Remnants of the former Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 59 (also called the Upper Lockville Lock) are located along North Clinton Street across from the current Lock 28B in Newark, just off N.Y. Route 31. It was a double-chamber lock built in 1841, and had a lift of to the west. The former Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 58 (also called the Middle Lockville Lock) is a few blocks east off Lyons Street, but one of the chambers is being used by a scrap company. Volunteers cleared the other chamber as part of a canal trail project.
Located where Military Brook enters the canal on West Union Street is a little known remnant of the original Erie Canal. It is where Military Brook a.k.a. Whipspool Creek was routed UNDER the canal to the north side where it eventually flowed through the Newark Cemetery on its way to the Ganargua Creek.

In December 1954, the Hoffman Clock Museum was founded and opened within the Newark Public Library. The collection is named for Augustus Hoffman, Newark resident and Lyons watchmaker and jeweler who amassed much of the collection that now makes up the museum.

The village is part of the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. Erie Canal Lock 28B is located below the bridge on North Clinton Street, just off N.Y. Route 31. It was built around 1913, and has a lift of to the west.

The name of &#x27;Lockville&#x27; came from its location near three locks, numbered 57, 58 and 59, built on the original Erie Canal route. In 1839, Lockville became incorporated as the Village of Arcadia. It merged into Newark when that community was incorporated as a village in 1853.

Wiley Schoolhouse (built 1874) is a fully restored historic one-room school for the former District #11 located at the intersection of Wiley (CR 374), Hogback and Olmstead roads in the southwest part of town. The Crusoe House (built 1824), located on N.Y. Route 89 near Crusoe Lake, is currently the oldest building in the Town of Savannah.

<text>Sodus Point is a village in Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 900 at the 2010 census. However, the last official US Census in 2020 recorded the population at 822. The name is derived from a nearby body of water, Sodus Bay. It is considered to be within the larger Rochester metropolitan area.

The Village of Sodus Point is in the northeastern part of the Town of Sodus. This is a lakeside community surrounded on three sides by water.

== History ==
In 1794, the village was the site of the first European-American settlement in Sodus town. Before the American Revolution, the area for centuries was the territory of the Onondaga Nation.

During the War of 1812, the village was burned by a British raiding party, leaving all but one building demolished. The village was rebuilt.

The area became an important port on Lake Ontario in the 19th Century. As the Erie Canal shifted state transportation patterns, the village&#x27;s function as a port declined. In the later 19th century, it became a popular vacation resort, especially for people from Chicago and other cities during the summers.

Sodus Point was incorporated in 1957.

The schooner &quot;Lotus&quot;, Customs House, and Sodus Point Light are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Writer Elizabeth F. Ellet was a native of the town.

==Geography==
Sodus Point is located at (43.269332, -76.987608).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and 0.67% is water.

The village is on the shore of Lake Ontario on a point of land on the northwest edge of Sodus Bay, an arm of Lake Ontario. The name &quot;Sodus&quot; reportedly is derived from a native word meaning &quot;gleam on the water.&quot; Another possible origin is the Iroquois &quot;Land of Silver Waters.&quot;

County Road 101 (Lake Road/Lake Avenue) leads into the village from the west. New York State Route 14 has its northern terminus at the village.

<text>Walworth is a town in Wayne County, New York, United States named after Reuben Walworth, a state official. The population was 9,449 at the 2010 census.

The Town of Walworth is on the western border of the county and is east of Rochester, New York. It has a hamlet, also called Walworth.

== History ==

The town was first settled in 1799 when four brothers named Andrew, John, Samuel, and Daniel Millet left their homes in Connecticut, traveled west and became the first settlers in what is now the hamlet of Walworth. There they built crude log cabins, the first dwellings in Walworth.

Stephen and Daniel Douglas, also from Connecticut, located in this area in 1800. Stephen Douglas built the first frame house on the southwest corner of the present four corners of the hamlet of Walworth. Soon after, they gave their name to this growing community and for a number of years it was known as Douglas Corners.

The Town of Walworth was created on April 5, 1830, when it was separated from the Town of Ontario by an act of New York State Legislature dated April 20, 1829, the last town formed in Wayne County. (Laws of the State of New York, Chapter 196)

Theron Yeomans of Walworth introduced Holstein cattle to the United States and was the first president of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America. Susan Cleveland, sister of President Grover Cleveland, married into the Yeomans family.

In 1934, a freeze killed many of the town&#x27;s orchards, leading to a sharp decline in fruit growing.

In 2024, a traffic light issue at the town&#x27;s center (441/Walworth-Ontario Rd) caused lots of frustration. (see more below)

==2024 Traffic Light Debacle ==

=== Overview ===
The traffic signal at the intersection of New York State Route 441 and Walworth-Ontario Rd in Walworth, NY, has been inoperative for several months as of late 2024. The signal currently operates as a flashing red for north-south traffic on Walworth-Ontario Rd and a flashing yellow for east-west traffic on Route 441. This configuration has led to significant delays for north-south travelers and raised safety concerns due to the lack of a full stop for opposing traffic on Route 441.

=== Background ===
The malfunctioning signal has drawn criticism from local residents and commuters, as the town has acknowledged the need for a replacement but cited delays due to supply chain issues. Despite these delays, the town has not acted on suggestions from the public to borrow or purchase a temporary signal from neighboring municipalities. The lack of responsiveness has led to growing frustration among residents.

=== Impact ===
Safety Concerns: Residents fear the risk of accidents at the intersection, given that drivers on Route 441 are not required to stop, while those on Walworth-Ontario Rd face delays.

Increased Travel Times: The flashing configuration causes bottlenecks for north-south traffic, significantly slowing travel times.

=== Community Response ===
The issue has sparked conversations (mainly on the town facebook group) about municipal efficiency and priorities. Some residents have drawn ironic comparisons to notable historical events in Walworth, such as former President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s visit to the town for his sister&#x27;s wedding in 1885. 

=== Town Statements ===
Officials from the Town of Walworth have stated that a replacement signal is on order, though no estimated installation date has been provided. The delay is reportedly due to a lack of available traffic light components amid ongoing supply chain disruptions.

=== Future Developments ===
As of November 2024, the timeline for resolving the traffic signal issue remains unclear. The matter has been discussed in town board meetings, but public dissatisfaction continues to grow as winter conditions exacerbate safety concerns.
