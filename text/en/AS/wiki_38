Zanesfield is named for Isaac Zane, who was born in 1753 in what was then Berkeley County, Virginia, and is now Hardy County, West Virginia. He was the youngest brother of Ebenezer Zane, for whom Zanesville, Ohio, is named.

In 1762 at the age of nine, Isaac was captured by Native Americans of the Wyandot tribe and adopted into the tribe. He lived with them along the Sandusky River for seventeen years. He married Myeerah (White Crane), daughter of Chief &quot;Tarhe&quot;. They had several children.

His Wyandot connections and bilingual abilities served Zane well. He later served as a guide to the Commissioners of the Northwest Territory during their treaty conferences with the Native Americans. Zane purchased from the federal government at the site of Zanesfield in about 1795. In return for his service to the United States, in 1802, the United States Congress granted Isaac Zane three tracts totalling in Champaign County, Ohio (see Zane&#x27;s Tracts#Isaac Zane Tracts). In 1803, he was elected as one of the first trustees of Jefferson Township. Isaac Zane died in 1816, and was buried near Zanesfield.

The village was laid out in 1819 by Alexander Long and Ebenezer Zane.

<text>Amherst ( ) is a city in Lorain County, Ohio, United States. It is located west of Cleveland within the Cleveland metropolitan area. The population was 12,681 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The original village, which eventually became known as Amherst, was established/founded by pioneer settler Jacob Shupe (who came to this area in 1811; however, what would become the specific “downtown” area was settled by Josiah Harris in 1818), although the original tiny village was first known only as &quot;Amherst Corners&quot; in the early-1830s. When the village-plat was officially recorded in 1836, it was simply named the &quot;town plat of Amherst&quot;, but became &quot;Amherstville&quot; circa-1839, and was later changed to &quot;North Amherst&quot;, until finally again simply &#x27;Amherst&#x27; in 1909. (The original 1820s postal-name of the village&#x27;s first post-office was &quot;Plato&quot;; and the village&#x27;s post-office retained that postal-name into the 1840s, even after the local-government name of the village officially became &#x27;Amherstville&#x27; by 1840.)

The village is often said to have had its beginnings as early as 1811, because land which was settled by pioneer Jacob Shupe, in the &quot;Beaver Creek Settlement&quot; (about a mile north of the later village site), was eventually included into the Amherst city-limits. Shupe&#x27;s pioneering efforts within the township, which included constructing his own grist-mill/saw-mill and distillery, certainly added to the area&#x27;s desirability for later pioneers to settle here).
By the latter 1800s, Amherst acquired the title &quot;Sandstone Center of the World&quot;.
Many early buildings are constructed of native sandstone, and the quarries were also an important source of grindstones. There were nine sandstone quarries in the area operating at the peak of production. Cleveland Quarries Company, established in 1868, no longer quarries in Amherst but is still actively quarrying Berea Sandstone.

<text>As part of the Apollo program by NASA, 24 astronauts flew nine missions to the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972. During six successful two-man landing missions, twelve men walked on the lunar surface, six of whom drove Lunar Roving Vehicles as part of the last three missions. Three men have been to the Moon twice, one orbited once and took a circumlunar trajectory the second time, while the other two landed once apiece. Apart from these 24 men, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. , 6 of the 24 remain alive. No woman has been to the Moon, but a number of non-human animals have circled or orbited it, including two tortoises, several turtles, and five mice.

Apollo missions 8 and 10–17 were the nine crewed missions to the Moon. Apollo 4–6 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight. The Apollo program included three other crewed missions: Apollo 1 (AS-204) did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire, while Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit missions that only tested spacecraft components and docking maneuvers. Apollo missions 18, 19, and 20 were canceled. Twelve astronauts later flew unused Apollo command modules in the Apollo Applications Program&#x27;s Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. Of the 24 astronauts who flew to the Moon, two went on to command a Skylab mission, one commanded Apollo–Soyuz, one flew as commander for Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle, and two commanded orbital Space Shuttle missions.

== Prime crew members ==
NASA&#x27;s Director of Flight Crew Operations during the Gemini and Apollo programs was Donald K. &quot;Deke&quot; Slayton, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a minor cardiac arrhythmia – paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments. In March 1972, Slayton was restored to flight status, and flew on the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission.

The prime crew members selected for actual missions are here grouped by their NASA astronaut selection groups, and within each group in the order selected for flight. Two versions of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) spacecraft were developed: Block I, intended for preliminary low Earth orbit testing; and Block II, redesigned for the lunar landing. The Block I crew position titles were Command Pilot, Senior Pilot (second seat), and Pilot (third seat). The corresponding Block II titles were: Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot. The second seat pilot was given secondary responsibility for celestial navigation to keep the CSM&#x27;s guidance computer accurately calibrated with the spacecraft&#x27;s true position, and the third seat pilot served as a flight engineer, monitoring the health of the spacecraft systems.

== Apollo astronauts by their dates of selection by NASA ==

=== 1959 ===

* Virgil I. &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom began his career at NASA in 1959. In 1966, he was selected as Command Pilot for the first crewed Apollo mission, a low Earth orbit test. This mission ended a month before its scheduled launch, when a cabin fire on the launch pad killed Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee on January 27, 1967.
* Walter M. Schirra Jr. also began his NASA career in 1959. He was selected in October 1968 as Command Pilot for Apollo 7, an 11-day, low Earth orbit shakedown test of the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module and the first crewed launch for the Apollo project.
* Alan B. Shepard Jr. – America&#x27;s first man in space on &quot;Freedom 7&quot; was originally selected to command Gemini 3, but was medically grounded for the duration of Gemini due to Ménière&#x27;s disease and assisted Slayton in Flight Operations. After corrective surgery, Shepard was restored to flight status and commanded Apollo 14, the third successful Moon landing mission.

===1962===
All of these astronauts flew on Gemini, and except for White, each commanded one Gemini and one Apollo mission:

* Edward H. White II – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 4 who made the United States&#x27; first walk in space, selected as Senior Pilot (second seat) on Apollo 1. White was killed in the Apollo 1 fire along with Grissom and Chaffee.
* James A. McDivitt – Commander of Gemini 4, selected in late 1966 to command the first Earth orbital flight test of the Apollo Lunar Module with the CSM. This mission flew in March 1969 as Apollo 9. After his flight, McDivitt was promoted to Manager of Lunar Landing Operations, and in August 1969 was promoted to Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program.
* Frank F. Borman II – Commander of Gemini 7, selected to command a higher Earth orbit test of the complete Apollo spacecraft. But when delays prevented the LM from being ready in time for its first flight in December 1968, Borman&#x27;s mission was changed to the first lunar orbital flight of the CSM on Apollo 8.
* James A. Lovell Jr. – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 7, and commander of Gemini 12, flew as Command Module Pilot (second seat) on Apollo 8. Lovell became the first to fly a second Apollo mission as commander of Apollo 13, the third lunar landing attempt. This mission was unsuccessful, due to a Service Module electrical system failure caused by an oxygen tank explosion. Lovell and his crew managed to return to Earth safely. Lovell is the only person to fly to the Moon twice without landing there.
* Thomas P. Stafford – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 6A and commander of Gemini 9A, commanded a lunar orbital test of the Lunar Module on Apollo 10. He also commanded the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission.
* John W. Young – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 3 and commander of Gemini 10, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 10. Young later commanded the successful Apollo 16 lunar landing. He also commanded the first Space Shuttle flight, STS-1 &quot;Columbia&quot;, April 12–14, 1981, and STS-9, also on &quot;Columbia&quot;, November 28–December 8, 1983.
* Neil A. Armstrong – Commander of Gemini 8, commanded Apollo 11, becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon.
* Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad Jr. – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 5 and commander of Gemini 11, commanded Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. He went on to command Skylab 2, successfully completing repairs to the spacecraft that saved it for this and two subsequent missions.

===1963===
This was the first class of astronauts for which test pilot experience was not required, but military jet fighter pilot experience was acceptable.

Five of this group got their first spaceflight experience as second seat on Gemini:
* David R. Scott – Second-seat veteran of Gemini 8, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 9, and commanded the Apollo 15 lunar landing.
* Eugene A. Cernan – Second-seat veteran on Gemini 9A, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10, and commanded the final lunar landing mission Apollo 17.
* Michael Collins – Second-seat veteran on Gemini 10, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 11.
* Edwin E. &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin Jr. – Second-seat veteran on Gemini 12, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 11, the first Moon landing.
* Richard F. Gordon Jr. – Second-seat veteran on Gemini 11, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 12. Gordon was selected to command the Apollo 18 lunar landing, which was later canceled.

The remaining six members of this group were selected for their first space flights on Apollo:
* Roger B. Chaffee – Selected as Pilot (third seat) on Apollo 1, was killed with Grissom and White in the fire.
* Donn F. Eisele – Flew second seat on Apollo 7.
* R. Walter Cunningham – Flew third seat on Apollo 7.
* Russell L. &quot;Rusty&quot; Schweickart – Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 9. Schweickart performed an EVA outside the spacecraft, testing the portable life support system used on the Moon.
* William A. Anders – Flew third seat on Apollo 8.
* Alan L. Bean – Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 12. He later served as commander for Skylab 3.

===1965===

In June 1965, NASA named a group of five scientist astronauts, the first group qualified by doctorate degrees rather than test or military fighter pilot experience. Geologist Harrison H. &quot;Jack&quot; Schmitt participated heavily in the geological training of the lunar landing astronauts, as well as assisting in the analysis of returned samples and the preparation of mission reports. In 1970, he was selected as Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 15 backup crew, and prime crew on Apollo 18. When program cutbacks canceled missions 18 through 20, NASA&#x27;s lunar geological community insisted on having a geologist on the Moon, so Slayton reassigned Schmitt to Apollo 17.

===1966===
NASA named a group of 19 more astronauts in April 1966. None had spaceflight experience before their Apollo mission.
* T. Kenneth Mattingly II – Selected as prime Command Module Pilot for Apollo 13, Mattingly was exposed to German measles days before the flight and was grounded by the flight surgeon, though ultimately did not contract the disease. He swapped places with his backup and flew on Apollo 16. He also flew on STS-4 and STS-51-C.
* John L. &quot;Jack&quot; Swigert Jr. – Flew as Mattingly&#x27;s backup on Apollo 13.
* Fred W. Haise Jr. – Flew as Lunar Module Pilot on the unsuccessful Apollo 13. Haise was selected to command the Apollo 19 lunar landing, which was canceled. Haise would later be named commander of the first crew for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s Approach and Landing Tests using the prototype Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
* Stuart A. Roosa – Command Module Pilot on Apollo 14.
* Edgar D. Mitchell – Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 14.
* Alfred M. Worden – Command Module Pilot on Apollo 15.
* James B. Irwin – Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 15.
* Charles M. Duke Jr. – First achieved public recognition as capsule communicator during the Apollo 11 Moon landing; notable for the quote: &quot;...we copy you on the ground. You&#x27;ve got a bunch of guys about to turn blue; we&#x27;re breathing again. Thanks a lot.&quot; Duke flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 16.
* Ronald E. Evans Jr. – Command Module Pilot on Apollo 17.

==Astronauts who trained for Apollo but did not fly==
* L. Gordon Cooper Jr. – from the Mercury Seven; veteran of Mercury &quot;Faith 7&quot; and commander of Gemini 5, was replaced as Apollo 14 commander by Alan Shepard and resigned from NASA in 1970.
* Clifton C. &quot;C.C.&quot; Williams Jr. – from Group 3; was named as Schweickart&#x27;s Lunar Module Pilot backup crew, but was killed when the T-38 jet he was flying crashed near Tallahassee, Florida on October 5, 1967. He was replaced by Bean, who flew on Apollo 12.
* Vance D. Brand – from Group 5; was on the support crew for Apollo 8 and Apollo 13; was named as Apollo 15 backup Command Module Pilot. Flew on the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (not a flight of the Apollo program). He also flew as commander of STS-5, STS-41-B and STS-35.
* Edward G. Givens Jr. – from Group 5; was on the support crew of Apollo 7, but died in a car crash near Houston, Texas on June 6, 1967.
* Joe H. Engle – from Group 5; was originally named as Apollo 17 Lunar Module Pilot, but lost his slot to Schmitt. After Apollo, he flew in the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests, then commanded STS-2 and STS-51-I.

== Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon ==
Twelve men walked on the Moon during six Moon landings of the Apollo program between July 1969 and December 1972. All landed on the surface only once, and five missions consisted of two or more surface extravehicular activities (EVAs). Four of them are alive with an average age of 
years. Most astronauts at that time came from the military services and were considered to be on active duty during their NASA service. The few exceptions were considered civilian NASA astronauts, regardless of any prior military service.

On the last of their three Apollo 17 EVAs, Harrison Schmitt stepped out of the Apollo Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon after Gene Cernan, and is therefore the 12th and most recent person to have stepped out onto the Moon. When they re-entered the lunar module Cernan stepped in last, and is therefore the last person to have walked on the Moon.

Alan Shepard was the oldest person to walk on the Moon, at age 47 years and 80 days. Charles Duke was the youngest, at age 36 years and 201 days.

Jim Lovell and Fred Haise were scheduled to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 13 mission, but the lunar landing was aborted following an explosion in the spacecraft service module en route to the Moon. Haise was again scheduled to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 19, but Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceled on September 2, 1970.

Joe Engle had trained on the backup crew for Apollo 14 to explore the Moon with Cernan, but he was replaced by Schmitt on the primary crew for Apollo 17. Schmitt had previously been crewed with Apollo 12 Command Module pilot Dick Gordon in anticipation of Apollo 18, but Schmitt replaced Engle on Apollo 17 after the cancellation of Apollo 18 and Apollo 19, leaving Gordon as the last Apollo astronaut to train extensively for lunar exploration without ever landing on the Moon.

== Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing ==
Besides the 12 people who have walked on the Moon, 12 more have flown to within 0.001 lunar distance of its surface. , two of them are alive with an average age of 
years. During each of the six missions with successful lunar landings, one astronaut remained in lunar orbit while the other two landed. In addition, the three-person crews of Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 also entered lunar orbit, and the crew of Apollo 13 looped around the Moon on a free-return trajectory.

All nine crewed missions to the Moon took place as part of the Apollo program over a period of just under four years, from 21 December 1968 to 19 December 1972. The 24 people who have flown to the Moon are the only people who have traveled beyond low Earth orbit.

Jim Lovell, John Young, and Eugene Cernan are the only three people to have flown to the Moon twice. Young and Cernan each set foot on it during their respective second lunar missions, while Lovell is the only person to have flown to the Moon twice without landing.

During Cernan&#x27;s first lunar mission on Apollo 10, he tied the present record set by Bill Anders on Apollo 8 as the youngest person to fly to the Moon. Each was 35 years and 65 days old on his launch date and 35 years and 68 days old when he entered lunar orbit. The oldest person to fly to the Moon was Alan Shepard, who walked on its surface during the Apollo 14 mission. Shepard was 47 years and 74 days old on his launch date and 47 years and 78 days old when he entered lunar orbit.

Jim Lovell and Fred Haise were scheduled to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 13 mission, but the lunar landing was aborted following a major malfunction en route to the Moon. Haise was again scheduled to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 19, but Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were canceled on September 2, 1970. Because of Apollo 13&#x27;s free-return trajectory, Lovell, Swigert and Haise flew higher above the Moon&#x27;s 180° meridian (opposite Earth) than anyone else has flown (254 km/158 mi). Coincidentally, due to the Moon&#x27;s distance from Earth at the time, they simultaneously set the present record for humans&#x27; greatest distance from Earth, reaching an altitude of 400,171 km (248,655 mi) above sea level at 0:21 UTC on 15 April 1970.

== Lunar activities ==
Armstrong descended the lunar module ladder and spoke his famous epigram, &quot;That&#x27;s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot; He then went to work on collecting the contingency sample, which was a scoop of the lunar surface collected early in the mission in case there was an emergency. Armstrong took the TV camera off the lunar module and mounted it to a tripod. After that, Aldrin descended the ladder to join Armstrong. Aldrin egressed to the surface about nineteen minutes after Armstrong. They had some trouble planting the American flag into the lunar soil, but were able to secure it into the surface. Aldrin positioned himself in front of a video camera and began experimenting with different locomotion techniques on the surface. During these experiments, Armstrong and Aldrin received a phone call from President Nixon, congratulating them for the successful landing.

Aldrin then set to work documenting the condition of the spacecraft to ensure it was in proper condition for their upcoming launch. After setting up a couple of experiments with Armstrong, Aldrin went to work hammering a tube into the lunar surface to obtain a core sample. Aldrin&#x27;s EVA ended when they loaded the lunar samples into the spacecraft and tossed out unneeded items, just before sealing the hatch. Armstrong performed the majority of the photography on the surface, which is why there are only five photos of him on the Moon.

Soon after piloting the LM &quot;Falcon&quot; to a landing at Hadley Rille, Scott accomplished the only stand-up EVA through the lander&#x27;s top hatch, using it as a high place from which to refine the geology traverses he and Irwin would undertake during the following days. Scott became the first to drive a vehicle on the Moon as he drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle, more than doubling Apollo 14&#x27;s EVA time. After the final traverse, back outside the LM, Scott performed a demonstration of Galileo&#x27;s theory that all objects fall at the same rate in vacuum by dropping a hammer and a feather for the television camera.

Irwin came onto the lunar surface soon after his commander, Scott. As the LRV&#x27;s first passenger, he had an often rough ride as Scott swerved to avoid craters. It was Irwin who, during the second EVA, first spotted the Genesis Rock and aided Scott in collecting this bit of the early lunar crust. A man of deep Christian religious faith, Irwin quoted from Psalms while on the lunar surface and later became an evangelist.

== Apollo astronauts who never flew to the Moon ==

In addition to the nine lunar missions, there were two crewed flights in the Apollo program that remained in Earth orbit to test fly the spacecraft. Apollo 7 was a crewed test flight of the CSM, and Apollo 9 was a crewed flight test of the CSM and LEM. Of the six astronauts who participated in these missions, five were never rotated to a lunar mission. In addition, the three Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project used crewed CSMs in Earth orbit and are considered part of the Apollo Applications Project. Although Conrad, Bean, and Stafford commanded three of these four flights, the remaining crew members were rookies and thus had long missed the opportunity to fly a Moon mission. Of the seven rookies who flew Skylab, three of them (Paul J. Weitz, Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma) would return to space aboard the Space Shuttle. Vance Brand flew on ASTP as Command Module Pilot and would command three Shuttle missions. Except for Garriott, all Apollo astronauts who also flew on the Shuttle served as commander.

* Walter M. Schirra Jr. – Commander of Apollo 7.
* Donn F. Eisele – Command Module Pilot of Apollo 7
* R. Walter Cunningham – Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 7
* James A. McDivitt – Commander of Apollo 9

<text>My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown is a 1989 biographical comedy-drama film directed by Jim Sheridan (in his director debut) adapted by Sheridan and Shane Connaughton from the 1954 memoir by Christy Brown. A co-production of Ireland and the United Kingdom, it stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Brown, an Irish man born with cerebral palsy, who could control only his left foot. Brown grew up in a poor working-class family, and became a writer and artist. Brenda Fricker, Ray McAnally, Hugh O&#x27;Conor, Fiona Shaw, and Cyril Cusack are featured in supporting roles.

==Plot==
In 1932, Christy Brown is born into a Dublin family of 15. Doctors discover he has severe cerebral palsy. Christy is unable to walk or talk. He is loved and supported by his family, especially his mother. One day, Christy&#x27;s mother trips down the stairs while in labour and Christy is the only person home to see it. He alerts some neighbours to help. Christy&#x27;s father never believed Christy would amount to anything, but becomes proud after witnessing him use his left foot, the only body part he can fully control, to write the word &quot;mother&quot; on the floor with a piece of chalk.

Consequently, Christy seeks a hobby in painting. The neighbourhood youngsters include him in their activities, like street football, but when he paints a picture and gives it to a girl he likes, she returns it. Later, his father loses his job and the family faces exceptionally difficult hardships, so Christy devises a plan to help his brothers steal coal to their mother&#x27;s dismay. Christy&#x27;s mother, who has been gradually gathering some savings in a tin in the fireplace, finally saves enough to buy him a wheelchair.

Christy is then introduced to Eileen Cole, who takes him to her school for cerebral palsy patients and persuades a friend of hers to hold an exhibition of his work. Christy falls in love with Cole, but when he learns during the dinner that she is engaged to be married, he considers suicide. His mother helps him build a private studio for himself, but soon afterward his father dies of a stroke, and during the wake Christy instigates a brawl. At this point, Christy starts writing his autobiography, &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. Cole returns and they resume their friendship. Later, Christy attends a charity event where he meets his handler, a nurse named Mary Carr. She begins reading his autobiography. He asks Mary to go out with him and they then happily leave the fête together.

==Cast==
==Production==
Day-Lewis became interested in the project when he read the opening scene, which features him, as Brown, using his left foot to place a phonograph record on a player and then placing a needle onto it so that it will play. He said of the scene: &quot;I knew it couldn&#x27;t be done... and that intrigued me.&quot; Many scenes were filmed through a mirror, as he could only manipulate his right foot to perform the actions seen in the film. He spent some time preparing for the film at Brown&#x27;s alma mater in Dublin. He later returned there for a visit, with his Academy Award.

Day-Lewis was known for his extreme method acting, and insisted on staying in character during the production of the film, refusing to do anything that Brown could not do. This meant that members of the film crew had to move the actor around in a wheelchair, lift him over obstacles, and even feed him.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;My Left Foot&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. 

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, writing: &quot;&quot;My Left Foot&quot; is a great film for many reasons, but the most important is that it gives us such a complete picture of this man&#x27;s life. It is not an inspirational movie, although it inspires. It is not a sympathetic movie, although it inspires sympathy. It is the story of a stubborn, difficult, blessed, and gifted man who was dealt a bad hand, who played it brilliantly, and who left us some good books, some good paintings and the example of his courage. It must not have been easy.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; polled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would award the 1990 Academy Award for Best Picture to &quot;My Left Foot&quot; instead of &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;.

<text>Avon Lake is a city in northeastern Lorain County, Ohio, United States, located on the southern shore of Lake Erie about west of Cleveland. The population was 25,206 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

== History ==

Avon Lake was first settled in the 17th century and was, along with Avon, Bay Village, and Westlake, inhabited by the Erie. After the war with the Iroquois in 1656 ended the people were largely dispersed or integrated into Iroquois society. The area was then sparsely populated until the Lenape and Wyandot migrated into the area in 1700. The first European settlement in the area was founded in 1786 by Moravian missionaries. The Northwest Indian War resulted in the Indians in the area giving up all land East of Cuyahoga River in the Treaty of Greenville. Undoubtedly this was the start of European contact with the peoples in Avon Lake, who now found themselves in the Connecticut Western Reserve. Any remaining Indian claims to their land were removed after the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary’s.

Noah Davis, the first lakeshore dweller, arrived in Avon Lake in 1812 and lived in a three-sided cabin near the present-day intersection of Lake and Moore Roads for about a year. Wilbur Cahoon, the owner of the land, encountered Davis and moved farther south (on Davis&#x27; advice) in the French Creek precinct where it was not as marshy but more fitting for farming, in 1814. In 1818, Cuyahoga County drew new boundaries, splitting the former entity into two. The west part was Troy Township and the east part was Dover Township. Adam Miller and his family arrived in the following year, and the family has been here ever since. The Millers and others who followed mostly cleared land, sawed timber, and built ships in nearby Black River (eventually renamed Lorain), however Avon Lake&#x27;s shorelines also had a number of sawmills and shipyards. In 1822, Lorain County was formed. Troy Township was renamed &quot;Avon Township&quot; by petition in 1824.

In 1915, Avon Lake separated from the rest of the Township of Avon to form the Township of Avon Lake. In 1960, Avon Lake was granted the status of a city. Avon Lake became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 1993.

<text>Elyria ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Lorain County, Ohio, United States, located at the forks of the Black River in Northeast Ohio southwest of Cleveland. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 52,656. It is a principal city in the Cleveland metropolitan area. The city is home to Lorain County Community College.

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s name is derived from the surname of its founder, Heman Ely, and Illyria, the historical name used by ancient Greeks and Romans to refer to the western Balkans.

==History==

The village of Elyria was founded in 1817 by Heman Ely, who built a log house, dam, gristmill, and sawmill on the village&#x27;s site along the Black River. Ely began to build more houses to accommodate European-American settlers migrating to what was, at that time, within Huron County, Ohio.

By the turn of the 20th century, Elyria was a town of about 8,000. In 1908, Elyria Memorial Hospital was built. In the first half of the 20th century, the town developed some manufacturing, as well as a range of retail businesses.

In August 1967, Midway Mall was opened. It changed the local economy by attracting local businesses from the town center or causing so much competition they went out of business. Industrial restructuring meant that good jobs left the area, and poverty increased. Three major car plant closings in the area led to economic stagnation and joblessness in the 1970s and 1980s that affected numerous communities. The region was nicknamed &quot;the Rustbelt&quot;, suggesting the decline of its former industries.

In the 1990s, Elyria experienced a minor revival with construction of some new roads and housing. It serves as a residential, suburban &quot;bedroom community&quot; for Cleveland, where new businesses and industries are developing with an increase in new jobs.

In the 2000s and 2010s, companies like Bendix and 3M moved their operations elsewhere. To prepare for this, voters passed Issue 6 in March 2016. Issue 6 increased the city&#x27;s income tax by 0.5%. It was used to pay for police, parks, and fiber-optic Internet in the city. With the reconstruction of State Route 57 on the city&#x27;s northwest side by Midway Mall, traffic flow was improved.

==Geography==
Elyria is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Black River flows through Elyria.

<text>Kipton is a village in Lorain County, Ohio, United States. The population was 209 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Kipton was platted around 1852 by Wm.W.Whitney in anticipation of a new railroad route being laid out through his farm. He initially named his new village &quot;Binghamton&quot;, in honor of his former home of Binghamton, NY. However, the name &quot;Camden Station&quot; would instead be used until 1862, when its name was changed to &quot;Kipton Station&quot; (and later becoming known simply as &#x27;Kipton&#x27;).

For many years, Kipton continued as a stop along the Southern Division of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad; however, the line was abandoned and pulled up in 1976. This former railroad route is now a part of a rail trail, the North Coast Inland Trail.

Kipton was the site of a famous train wreck on April 18, 1891, which was caused by railroad engineers&#x27; watches not being in sync; and led to the adoption of stringent quality-control standards for railroad chronometers in 1893. An Ohio Historical marker in Kipton Community Park notes the details of the collision.

<text>Oberlin () is a city in Lorain County, Ohio, United States. It is located about southwest of Cleveland within the Cleveland metropolitan area. The population was 8,555 at the 2020 census. Oberlin is the home of Oberlin College, a liberal arts college and music conservatory with approximately 3,000 students.

The town is the birthplace of the Anti-Saloon League and the Hall-Héroult process, the process of reducing aluminum from its fluoride salts by electrolysis, which made industrial production of aluminum possible.

==History==

Oberlin was founded in 1833 by two Presbyterian ministers, John Jay Shipherd and Philo P. Stewart. The pair had become friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria and discovered a shared dissatisfaction with what they saw as the lack of strong Christian morals among the settlers of the American West. Their proposed solution was to create a religious community that would more closely adhere to Biblical commandments, along with a school for training Christian missionaries who would eventually spread throughout the American frontier. The two decided to name their community after Johann Friedrich Oberlin (1740–1826), an Alsatian minister whose pedagogical achievements in a poor and remote area had greatly impressed and inspired them.

Shipherd and Stewart rode south from Elyria into the forests that then covered the northern part of Ohio in search of a suitable location for their community. After a journey of approximately eight miles, they stopped to rest and pray in the shade of an elm tree along the forest, and agreed that this would be a good place to start their community.

Shipherd traveled back east and convinced the owner of the land to donate of land for the school, and he purchased an additional for the town, at the cost of $1.50 per acre ($371/km2).

In 1834 a charter for the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute was obtained from the legislature of Ohio, and the institute adopted as its motto &quot;Learning and Labor.&quot; The same year saw a freshman class of four students. In those days the words were taken quite literally: tuition at Oberlin was free, but students were expected to contribute by helping to build and sustain the community. This attracted a number of bright young people who would otherwise not have been able to afford tuition. The motto remains to this day.

During the mid-1800s African Americans, predominantly free people of color and runaway slaves, settled in the area.

In Oberlin&#x27;s earliest years, transportation (especially for students) depended heavily on weather-dependent Lake Erie transportation routes; the nearest railroad passed through Wellington, and travellers were forced to rely on stagecoaches between that village and Oberlin. This situation changed in 1852 when the Toledo, Norwalk, and Cleveland Railroad opened a stop in Oberlin along its Grafton line. Fifteen years later, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway opened a new rail station along this line; no longer used for rail transportation, the depot has been converted for community use and sits at the center of a park.

On June 28, 1924, the worst flood in Oberlin history occurred on the same day that a tornado killed 62 people in Lorain. Afterward, the water was so deep that children swam in Tappan Square. Damage was caused to all of downtown Oberlin.

One of Oberlin&#x27;s largest employers was the Federal Aviation Administration, which houses the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center overseeing the airspace of six states and a small part of Canada.

===Abolitionism===
Oberlin was not founded as an abolitionist town. Its status changed with the enrollment in 1835 of the Lane Rebels, a loose group of several dozen students coordinated by abolitionist Theodore Weld. They had withdrawn &quot;en masse&quot; from the new Lane Theological Seminary of Cincinnati because of its treatment of the Black community and opposition to abolition of slavery. Cincinnati, on the Ohio River, was not a city where free blacks were safe, nor did Cincinnati welcome fugitives.

By chance, this group encountered Shipherd, who was travelling around Ohio looking for students for his new Collegiate Institute. The group agreed to come to Oberlin, but on condition that Asa Mahan, who had resigned as a Lane trustee, come as president, and that Oberlin treat Black and white students equally, something no college in the United States did at the time. The trustees, although reluctantly, agreed to these conditions. The first Black enrolees, James Bradley and the brothers Gideon Quarles and Charles Henry Langston, did not enroll in Oberlin but in an affiliated school, the Sheffield Manual Labor Institute. (Their younger brother John Mercer Langston, who in 1888 became the first black elected to the United States Congress from Virginia, also studied at Oberlin.)

By the middle of the 19th century, Oberlin had become a major focus of the abolitionist movement in the United States. Escaped enslaved people were relatively safe there. Thousands of escaped enslaved people crossing the Ohio River from Kentucky came through Oberlin—some to stay in the area, but most as a way-station to recover on their way to Lake Erie, where they found transportation across the lake to the safety of Canada West (Ontario).

The town of Oberlin, then, was an active &quot;station&quot; on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive enslaved people were assisted by a new Ohio law that allowed them to apply for a writ of habeas corpus, which protected them from extradition back to the Southern states from which they had escaped. In 1858, a newly elected Democratic state legislature repealed this law, making fugitives around Oberlin vulnerable to enforcement of the Federal Fugitive Slave Law, which allowed Southern slave-catchers to target and extradite them back to the South.

This situation came to a head with the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, a pivotal event described in Nat Brandt&#x27;s book &quot;The Town That Started the Civil War&quot;. On September 13, 1858, a fugitive named John Price was captured by federal officials and held in neighboring Wellington, Ohio. A large group of Oberlin residents, consisting of both white and black townspeople, students, and faculty, set out for Wellington to release Price from captivity.

The men took Price back from the arresting US Marshal, and eventually smuggled him to Canada, but the authorities were not content to let the matter rest. United States President James Buchanan personally requested prosecution of the group (now referred to by sympathetic parties as &quot;the Rescuers&quot;), and 37 of them were indicted. Twelve of those were formerly enslaved people, including Charles H. Langston. State authorities arrested the US Marshal who had captured Price. In negotiation, the state agreed to free the arresters, and the federal officials agreed to free all but two of those indicted. Simeon M. Bushnell, a white man, and Charles H. Langston were both tried and convicted by an all-Democrat jury. Langston&#x27;s eloquent speech against slavery and injustice persuaded the judge to give them light sentences, with Langston receiving 20 days in jail and a fine of $100. They appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, but on May 30, 1859, their petition was denied.
Three formerly enslaved people—Lewis Sheridan Leary, Shields Green, and John Anthony Copeland, Jr.—participated in John Brown&#x27;s famous 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry. Leary died during the raid, and Green and Copeland were hanged after arrest and conviction. The bodies of Green and Copeland were used for dissection and anatomical study at the Winchester Medical College; the remains were discarded. Leary&#x27;s body was first thrown in an unmarked pit, along with the 7 of the 9 others killed during the raid; much later the bodies were disinterred and reburied at the John Brown Farm, next to his grave. (See John Brown&#x27;s raiders.)

The political ferment resulting from the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue led to a number of major protests throughout the northern part of Ohio, and an unprecedented boost to the anti-slavery Republican party in the 1860 state elections. The governor of Ohio wrote to the new Republican President Abraham Lincoln urging him to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law. Though in point of fact Lincoln declined this request, this decision did not prevent Southern states from seceding, and America was soon embroiled in the Civil War.

The city of Oberlin runs an online dashboard that displays the city&#x27;s use of resources in real time. Effective from July 2013, the dashboard shows outputs of infrastructure, such as Oberlin&#x27;s power plant and water treatment plant.

==Transportation==

Oberlin lies at the intersection of state routes 58 and 511. Its municipal limits extend south to include parts of U.S. Highway 20. Oberlin also lies on a paved bicycle and pedestrian path, the North Coast Inland Trail, which travels southwest to Kipton and northeast to Elyria. The path is built on the former railroad right-of-way of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Southern Branch. Like many smaller municipalities across Ohio, Oberlin was once served by railroads but currently has no railroad service. An old station is visible along the bike path.

The Cleveland &amp; Southwestern interurban line from Elyria served Oberlin from approximately 1903 to its demise in 1928. Its rails basically followed Oberlin/Elyria Rd / Rt 231 from the east, entering town on E. College St, then turned South and followed Rt 58 to Wellington. There was a wye at S. Main and the line continued west to Norwalk, competing with the Lake Shore Electric into the city.

Lorain County Transit (LCT) formerly offered two bus routes in Oberlin on the 33 and 21 routes, the former of which operated to Cleveland Hopkins Airport, while the latter operated between Elyria and Wellington. The routes were shut down due to funding shortfalls. LCT currently operates a door-to-door &quot;Oberlin Connector&quot; bus service, with trips required to begin or end in within Oberlin. Since 2024, Oberlin is served by the EBus, a fare-free public transit bus route operating under contract by Slidr and support from LCT using electric vehicles making several stops across the city on a loop.

<text>Wellington is a village in Lorain County, Ohio. The population was 4,799 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The rights to naming the village were given as a reward for how much road could be contracted to build. The original winner of the contest picked the name “Charlemont,” to near universal disdain. The rights to name the town then went to William Welling, who chose the name “Wellington,” either after himself or the Duke of Wellington.

Wellington was incorporated as a village in 1855.

In 1858, the former American House Hotel (later torn down and replaced by Herrick Memorial Library) was the site of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. A group of men, both white and black and many from Oberlin, swarmed the hotel to rescue runaway slave John Price. He was being held by a US Marshal and his men, who intended to return him to his master in Kentucky.

The abolitionists transported Price out of town en route to the Underground Railroad and helped convey him to Canada. Thirty-seven men were indicted, but only two, Simeon M. Bushnell and Charles Henry Langston, were tried in federal court for interfering with the marshal in carrying out the Fugitive Slave Law. After Langston&#x27;s eloquent speech about slavery and discrimination, the judge gave them light sentences. The events and trial received national attention, and kept the issue of slavery at the forefront of debate.

Archibald M. Willard, painter of the patriotic &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; painting, lived in Wellington during the 19th century. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery on the outskirts of the village. The Spirit of &#x27;76 Museum, also located in Wellington, is dedicated to Willard and the history of Wellington. The original drum and fife used as models in the painting are also on display.

On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1951, two eleven-year-old boys, Gerald Kordelsky and William Flood, accidentally drowned in an abandoned well at Chismar Farm in Wellington.

In 2010, Wellington was named the &quot;Best Old House Neighborhood&quot; for the state of Ohio by &quot;This Old House Magazine&quot; in their annual feature article.

<text>Holland is a village in eastern Springfield Township, Lucas County, Ohio, United States. Holland is a suburb of Toledo. The population was 1,664 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first name of the village was Drakes, which possibly came from the name of a family or was in reference to the large number of geese that did and still fly over the area. Later the crossroads called itself Hardy, which is probably taken from Samuel Hardy, who was one of the signers of a document (along with Thomas Jefferson, Arthur Lee and James Monroe) that ceded the northwest territories of Virginia to the government of the United States. He was a member of the Continental Congress in 1783-1785 and had been a lieutenant governor of Virginia.

The name of Holland has been thought to have come from the fact that ditches being dug in the 1850s to divert the swamp water reminded people of the canals of Holland. Some have said the name was given because of the large number of Dutch people in the area, but there were more New Englanders and New Yorkers in the early settlements than there were Dutchmen. The most likely derivation of the name comes from a story about Franklin Hall (an early house builder in the area) that states when he platted the land for the building of his houses, he asked that it be called Hall Land. Supposedly, the clerk or other official changed the “a” to an “o” and eliminated one “l”, thus Holland.

On May 22, 1852, the first train ran between Toledo and Chicago, on two roads, the Michigan Southern and the Indiana Northern. Three years later, the two railroads consolidated and the Air Line began traversing the rails from Toledo to Elkhart, Indiana. Records of the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad show a station in the area in 1860 with no name, but freight and passengers from that site. In their records of 1880, it shows Holland having a population of 230 people, with the tons of freight increasing almost 20 times while the number of passengers increased by approximately 400% from 1860 to 1880.

In the early 1860s, Robert Clark began developing land north of the railroad and Franklin Hall built houses south of the railroad. Their names are still memorialized in those respective areas by Clark and Hall Streets.

<doc id="129561" wikidata="Q1004755" url="?curid=129561" title="Maumee, Ohio">
<text>Maumee ( ) is a city in Lucas County, Ohio, United States. Located along the Maumee River, it is a suburb about southwest of Toledo. The population was 13,896 at the 2020 census. Maumee was declared an All-America City by the National Civic League in June 2006.

==History==
In pre-colonial times, Native Americans (notably the Ottawa) began using the rich resources at the present site of Maumee, Ohio, in the Maumee River valley. Throughout much of the eighteenth century, French, British and American forces struggled for control of the lower Maumee River as a major transportation artery linking East and West through Lake Erie.

Following the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans of the region, including the Odawa, Ojibwe and Potawatomie, and Shawnee, made alliances in what became called the Northwest Territory by the United States, which claimed it from the British after gaining independence. The Northwest Indian War was a series of conflicts from 1785 through 1795 between these nations and the US; it ended with a decisive American victory over the British and their Native American allies at the Battle of Fallen Timbers at Maumee in 1794. Maumee is the site of Gen. &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne&#x27;s final fort, Fort Deposit, built in Aug. 1794 on his way to the battle of Fallen Timbers. Together with the conclusion of the War of 1812, which preserved most US territory, the end of warfare and defeat of the Native Americans opened the way for American expansion in present-day Ohio. Promoters arrived who were eager to make a fortune in selling and developing western lands.

In 1817 a town plat was laid out at the Foot of the Rapids of the Maumee River, and within a decade, the settlement was gaining recognition as a major trans-shipment point connecting Lake Erie and the land to the west. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 in New York State stimulated migration to Ohio, as it connected Great Lakes communities to the Hudson River and port of New York City. Completion of the Wabash and Erie Canal in 1840 further stimulated the economy. Jessup Scott, a noted town promoter, predicted that Maumee would become the &quot;great city of the West,&quot; surpassing all rivals. By mid-century Maumee was a flourishing center of river trade, commerce and shipbuilding. Nearly twenty mercantile companies crowded the three miles (5 km) of ship docks and competed for the retail and wholesale trade.

In 1840 Maumee was designated as the county seat; lawyers came from miles around to practice in the imposing Greek Revival Lucas County Courthouse erected by private subscription. Court days were a time of trade and commerce, as well. The federal custom house and post office also were located in Maumee.
Dreams of greatness began to fade in the 1850s, when ships too large to navigate the river were introduced for use in the Great Lakes. In addition, the railroad provided faster and cheaper means of transportation than river traffic and drew off business. As the population expanded westward, Maumee lost the county seat in 1854.
Nearly a century later, in the 1970s, Maumee developed an economic renaissance. Today the city is one of the largest business centers in Northwest Ohio. Together, Arrowhead Business Park and Maumee&#x27;s historic business community contribute to the 30,000 plus jobs in the community. Maumee has expanded its original boundaries, and the population is now more than 13,700 residents, representing a continuing downturn from the 15,000+ high of the early 1970s. Maumee&#x27;s neighborhoods retain their small town flavor; in addition, many historic homes and buildings of the early residents still stand along the tree-lined streets of the architectural districts.

==Geography==
Maumee is located about 11 miles upriver of Toledo, which is at the mouth of the Maumee River on Maumee Bay. This is a roughly triangle-shaped city. Its borders are formed by Interstate 80/90 to the north, to the west by Interstate 475/U.S. Route 23, and to the southeast by the Maumee River. It is just downriver from Waterville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Oregon is a city in Lucas County, Ohio, United States. Located on Lake Erie, it is a suburb of Toledo lying east of the city and is home to Maumee Bay State Park. The population was 19,950 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Oregon was once part of the Great Black Swamp. The swamp area was rich with oak, hickory, ash, walnut, elm and maple trees. This led to the establishment of numerous sawmills and settlements. The harvested forests created rich farmland, but the area remained swampy and there was a need for storm drainage. Major ditches were constructed, usually along roadways that followed the path of old Indian trails. These ditches continue to provide storm drainage today, carrying storm water into Maumee Bay.

&quot;The town was named Oregon by Pierre M. Irving, a nephew of Washington Irving, author of the popular book &quot;Astoria&quot;. This book attracted considerable interest in John Jacob Astor&#x27;s trading lands which were located in what is now the state of Oregon. The story, however, is an account of Astor&#x27;s fur trading in the territory of Oregon; but since the nephew was representing Astor&#x27;s interest in fur trading east of the Maumee River, he succeeded in having the town named Oregon. In 1838, Mr. Irving, accompanied by his wife, went to New York expecting to remain there for the summer; but for some reason he never returned.&quot; Quoted in the &quot;History of Oregon and Jerusalem&quot; book, authored by Josephine Fassett.

The first government was Oregon Township, formed in 1838. The land was surveyed and there were public sales for settlements. The area that was the township, is now the City of Oregon, which is bounded on the west by the City of Toledo, the North by Maumee Bay/Lake Erie, on the east by Jerusalem Township (Lucas County) and on the South by the City of Northwood (Wood County). In 1856 the township took ownership of two cemeteries which remain owned by the City today.

The 1800s and 1900s saw the development of an extensive rail system. The Port of Toledo began operations on the south bank of the Maumee River in the early 1800s and developed port operations on the Maumee Bay in Oregon in 1955. These operations continue in the Northwest area of the city.

Because of the water, rail, and surface transportation access available in the city, two major refineries, British Petroleum (BP) and Sun Marketing opened in Oregon around the turn of the century. These two refineries have historically been two of the city&#x27;s largest employers..

The northwestern end of the city grew as an industrial center with a coal powered electrical generating facility and several chemical plants. Pipelines were laid to carry petroleum products to and from the port facilities and other regions. Buckeye Pipeline has the largest pipeline distribution system in Oregon.

As industrialization continued, commercial and residential growth followed. Generally, urban growth continued eastward from Interstate 280 - one of the nation&#x27;s first Interstates. Recently, residential growth has also occurred south of Maumee Bay in the waterfront areas and with perimeter development in the more rural areas.

In 1954 Oregon Township trustees sought to zone the area. At about the same time, City of Toledo officials sought to annex the northwest industrial area of Oregon Township. The annexation failed, and in 1957 there was an election for Oregon to become an incorporated city. The vote was 3,660 in favor and 2,925 opposed. A key issue in incorporation was to have Oregon own and operate a water and a wastewater plant.

The City of Oregon adopted their Charter in 1958. The new city adopted a slogan of &quot;City of Opportunity.&quot; In the mid 1980s, the city added Oregon on the Bay to the City of Opportunity. In 1959 voters approved an &quot;earnings tax&quot; now known as the municipal income tax. The water plant was constructed in 1964 and currently over 90% of the land in Oregon is serviced with waterlines. Plans for an estimated $17.9 million in improvements to the water plant continued in 1998. The original water plant was paid for by a combination of local and federal funds. The city also has a wastewater treatment plant, constructed in 1977, with local and federal funds, which can process up to eight million gallons per day. In 1997 a major upgrade to the wastewater plant was completed. Approximately one-third of the land in the city is serviced by sanitary sewer lines. The city&#x27;s water and wastewater operations also service portions of Jerusalem Township, northern Wood County and northwest Ottawa County.

The first Marco&#x27;s Pizza was established in Oregon in 1978.

<text>Ottawa Hills is a village in Lucas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,790 at the 2020 census. The village was developed on both sides of the Ottawa River (Ohio) and serves as a bedroom community and suburb of Toledo. 

==History==
The Village of Ottawa Hills was developed beginning in 1915. John North Willys, president of the Overland Company, acquired approximately beginning at the intersection of Bancroft Street and Indian Road and extending along the Ottawa River to Central Avenue.

He started development that year, as reported by &quot;The Toledo Times:&quot;
Landscape architects, city planning engineers, landscape gardeners, and other experts, backed by an army of workmen equipment with the latest machinery and tools have been steadily at work on the tract for over a year. They have practically completed the improvement of the first unit of the development, lying at Arrowhead Point (former known as 5 Point). This is at the intersection of Bancroft Street, Secor and Indian Roads, a 20 minute ride from the business district. A cursory inspection of the property reveals the scale on which the improvements are being made. Practically 35% of it has been given over to park purposes. This includes the wooded area along the river&#x27;s course, flanked on one side by Percifilous Bluff and the other side by a slope that rises, by gentle degrees, to a level with the top of the bluff. In the valley, river banks have been dressed gracefully to the water&#x27;s edge. --&quot;The Toledo Times,&quot; August 1, 1915 

John North Willys turned to the E. H. Close Realty Company for the development of Ottawa Hills.
The E. H. Close Realty Company had developed more than of land in Toledo and the surrounding area. Planners, engineers, and architects with national reputations were involved in the layout and design of the Village. They were also established various restrictive covenants to assure proper quality development and construction of homes.

Several annexations have substantially changed the shape of the village from the original . Much of the early development of the village conforms to the original plans that date back to 1915. The portion of the village adjacent to Secor Road and south of Bancroft Street, Plat 1, is very similar in layout and design to the original plans. Many of the oldest homes are located in Plat 1. E. H. Close himself lived in this plat in one of the first homes built in the Village.

<text>Sylvania is a city in Lucas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 19,011 at the 2020 census. Sylvania is a suburb of Toledo, and encompassed by Sylvania Township. Its northern border is the southern border of the state of Michigan.

The name &quot;Sylvania&quot; is borrowed from the Latin &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;forest land&quot;, owing to the dense forests that once made up the region, part of the Great Black Swamp.

==History==

General David White is considered the founder of Sylvania as the first pioneer settler and town supervisor, originally from Palmyra, New York. In 1832, White was given the title of General (possibly after services rendered during the War of 1812), which allowed him to explore the western Lake Erie region. In realizing the potential of some available land to the north of Maumee, Ohio, a notable port city at the time, he acquired a title to the land and built a log cabin at what would eventually be the corner of Summit and Monroe streets near downtown Sylvania.

Prior to White&#x27;s acquisition, the land was a part of Port Lawrence Township, Monroe County, Michigan. Over the course of several years, White, along with his associate, Judge William Wilson, purchased a total of of Port Lawrence and surrounding land in what would eventually become Sylvania, and of what would become Whiteford Township, Michigan, where he also served as the first town supervisor. The relationship between White and Wilson did not last, and when the boundary dispute that lead to the largely bloodless Toledo War began in 1834, they began splitting the lands they had purchased, platting their own towns. That year, White established the first area school in Whiteford, and platted the township there one year later in 1835. Wilson presented the original plat for Sylvania in June 1836, with the town of Whiteford directly adjacent.

Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, rail transportation saw significant expansion throughout the Great Lakes region. In 1833, the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad was chartered as part of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, running from former Port Lawrence, Michigan (now Toledo, Ohio), to the mouth of the Kalamazoo River at Lake Michigan. Trains were at first pulled by horse until the first steam locomotive was installed in 1837. Sylvania built its own railroad depot along the Erie-Kalamazoo Railroad in 1858. While the depot is no longer in operation, the original station building exists as an exhibit in the Sylvania Historical Village, still next to the railroad which remains in use.

Sylvania was incorporated in 1867. A post office called Sylvania has been in operation since 1859.

==Geography==
Sylvania is located approximately west-northwest of Toledo. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

The city lies at the junction of two creeks: Ottawa Creek, flowing south from the community of Ottawa Lake, Michigan, about four miles north of the city, and Ten Mile Creek, a tributary of Ottawa Creek running about from the west, which becomes the Ottawa River and empties into the Maumee River.

The city is built on large shale deposits, which over hundreds of years have been mined in quarries to make concrete, cement and other stone products. Silica shale from the region is renowned among paleontologists for its high-quality fossils from the early Devonian period.

==Arts and culture==

* The Lathrop House, built in 1853 by minister Lucian Lathrop and wife Larissa, was used by abolitionists as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Slaves trying to escape to freedom in the north were given food and shelter, in a secret room behind an oven door. The house is recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a building of significant historical and cultural importance. The building was originally located on Main St, just south of downtown Sylvania, but after a 2002 land dispute, it was moved to Harroun Park across the street.
*The Harroun Family Barn was built by David and Clarissa Harroun in 1858. The Harrouns and their son Edwin aided slaves along the Underground Railroad, transporting them from Maumee, Ohio in David&#x27;s lumber wagon and hiding them in their basement, before they made their way into Michigan. The Harroun property was connected to the Lathrop house via a ravine that ran between them; much of the ravine still exists and the road that runs along it is named Ravine Road.

* The Sylvania Historical Village is an open-air museum in downtown Sylvania, that features both original and reproductions of historical buildings in the city, including the original railroad depot that operated in the area for over 100 years, and an original 1800s log home.

*Fossil Park is a notable attraction that opened in 2001. Visitors can break apart loose shale from a nearby quarry, which often contain fossil specimens such as trilobites. It is one of two locations in the world where visitors without any paleontological experience are allowed to search for fossils themselves.
*The Burnham Building, originally Burnham High School, built in 1927, served as an area high school until the final class graduated in 1960. It was then used as a multipurpose facility until 2010, when it was demolished to make way for the new Maplewood Elementary School.

<text>West Jefferson is a village in Madison County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,137 at the 2020 census. Located along U.S. Route 40, the village has a fairly close relationship with the surrounding township, which include various out-of-corporation-limit neighborhoods (including Haymarket Road, Olmstead Road, Forrest Lake Estates, Goodson Road/Enchanted Valley, and North and South Road).

The majority of West Jefferson&#x27;s early history is unknown. There are some records, but most major documentation does not occur until the late 1840s. During 1848-1849, the Columbus and Xenia railroad raised $20,000 from the citizens of Madison county to build a railroad. The original railroad station build within West Jefferson appears to no longer exist, however, a slightly newer railroad station (most likely built before 1938) still exists as part of the Fisher Cast Steel Mill. Unlike the trains that used to run through the town in the 1930&#x27;s, the current trains are diesel and transport freight instead of passengers.

===2021 shooting===
On May 24, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at an apartment complex in West Jefferson. Three men and one woman were killed, with three of the victims being found inside the building and one outside. A motive has not been determined for the shooting. On June 14, a 35-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with the killings. The shooting marked West Jefferson&#x27;s first homicides since April 2012. In February 2024, the shooter, John Steckel, was convicted of four counts of aggravated murder for the shooting and was sentenced to life without parole.

<text>Austintown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place within Austintown Township, Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. The population was 29,594 at the 2020 census. Located directly west of Youngstown, it is a suburb in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==

Austintown Township was founded in 1793 as township 2, range 3 of the Connecticut Western Reserve by purchase from the Connecticut Land Company.

Throughout the 19th century, the township slowly grew; by 1880, coal miners and their families increased the population to 2,502. A post office called Orange was established on November 15, 1815, and its name was changed to Austintown on May 6, 1872. It ceased operation on May 15, 1917, forwarding mail to West Austintown, Ohio. After World War II, Austintown experienced a population boom as suburban spillover from Youngstown crept into the eastern part of the township, whilst the central Austintown community grew along Ohio State Route 46.

<doc id="129574" wikidata="Q1896710" url="?curid=129574" title="Boardman Township, Ohio">
<text>Boardman Township is one of the fourteen townships of Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. The population was 40,213 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb directly south of Youngstown and the second-largest municipality in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area. Home to Southern Park Mall, Boardman is a major retail hub in the region and is known for being the location of the first Arby&#x27;s restaurant.

==History==

Boardman was founded by Elijah Boardman, a land agent of the Connecticut Land Company and later U.S. Senator, in the late 1790s as township 1, range 2 within the Connecticut Western Reserve. The township was formally established in 1806, although the township government lists it as 1805 on its seal, documents, and signage. It is the only Boardman Township statewide. Boardman was traditionally an agricultural community with grain crops and apple orchards throughout the 19th century. Around the turn of the century, the railroad led to Southern Park, a horse racing facility on Washington Boulevard. Thus, the area was an early draw for Youngstown urbanites. Because of its agricultural nature and proximity to Youngstown, Boardman was ripe for strip development starting as early as 1950. Around this time, the northern areas of the township were developed into suburban spillover from Youngstown&#x27;s south side.

Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., a shopping mall developer from Youngstown, began his company in Boardman. Boardman Plaza on U.S. Route 224 was one of the first strip malls in the country. Established in 1950 by DeBartolo, the plaza had three full-service grocery stores within a few hundred feet of each other. In 1970, DeBartolo opened the more contemporary Southern Park Mall near the intersection of US 224 and Market Street.

Also around 1950, the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the country, opened a headquarters complex in Boardman across from the DeBartolo Corporation. When the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company closed in 1977, a large campus was left for others to develop. Today, the former headquarters is the center of the Southwoods Health medical campus as well as a branch of Youngstown State University and various restaurants.

The fast food chain Arby&#x27;s opened its first location in Boardman in 1964. Directly owned and operated by the corporation, the restaurant moved to a new building in the 1990s across the street from the original building on US 224. The original building was occupied by a bird shop until 2021 and is now vacant.

The township has numerous listings on the National Register of Historic Places, including St. James Episcopal Church, the oldest structure in the township, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Southern Park Stable, the Forest Glen Estates Historic District, the Mill Creek Park Historic District, and the Newport Village Historic District.

==Geography==

===Neighborhoods===
==Demographics==

According to the 2019 American Community Survey and 2020 census, there were 40,213 people, 17,477 households, and 10,171 families residing in the township. The population density was 660.3 people per sq. km. The racial makeup of the township was 83.5% White, 7.51% African American, 1.82% Asian, 0.16% American Indian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.23% from other races, and 5.72% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.76% of the population.

==Economy==

Boardman is a large, sprawling suburb. It is a busy community south of Youngstown composed of many businesses, being one of the main retail hubs of the Mahoning Valley along with the U.S. Route 422 &quot;Strip&quot; in Niles, Ohio.

The primary corridor of development is along U.S. Route 224, with commercial space along almost the entirety of the township&#x27;s length of the road except a portion zoned to Mill Creek Park. Running north-south, Ohio State Route 7 is also a primary artery of commercial development, with important centers such as the St. Elizabeth Boardman Hospital located along this route. At the intersection of Routes 7 and 224 lies Southern Park Mall, which is the largest single shopping destination in Mahoning County. Furthermore, new development is located along the South Avenue artery which parallels the southern extension of Interstate 680 between its Midlothian and Western Reserve Road exits. The location of Boardman at the meeting point of several major local roadways allows it to be a center of commercial activity amongst the southern suburbs of the Youngstown–Warren area.

Boardman abuts one of the Youngstown area&#x27;s most popular attractions, Mill Creek Park. Within the park grounds, there is an rose garden, several small waterfalls, a lily pond with geese and turtles, marshlands, and Lanterman&#x27;s Mill, where grain is ground daily. In addition, there is a 36-hole golf course.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees. The board employs a township administrator for day-to-day administration of township services. As of 2025, the members of the board of trustees are Brad Calhoun, Tom Costello, and Larry Moliterno, and the township administrator is Jason Loree.

==Education==

The Boardman Local School District manages public education within most of the township and some surrounding areas. It consists of Boardman High School (grades 9–12), Boardman Glenwood Junior High School (grades 7–8), Boardman Center Intermediate School (grades 4–6), Robinwood Lane Elementary School, Stadium Drive Elementary School, and West Boulevard Elementary School (all K–3). Certain outlying areas of the township are managed by the Canfield Local School District, the Poland Local School District, and the Youngstown City School District.

Boardman is also home to a private school, namely the Catholic St. Charles School (grades K-8), although further private schools exist in neighborhoods of Youngstown that abut Boardman such as Valley Christian School (grades K-12) and the Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley (grades K-8).

Boardman has a public library, a branch of the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County.

Located in Boardman is also the Boardman Training Center, a post-secondary education facility that focuses on preparing students for healthcare certifications in months.

<text>Campbell (; ) is a city in eastern Mahoning County, Ohio, United States, along the Mahoning River. The population was 7,852 at the 2020 census. Located directly southeast of Youngstown, it is a suburb in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

Campbell was first called East Youngstown and this designation still appears on real estate deeds between 1902 and 1926, when the city was renamed for local industrialist James Campbell, then chairman of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company.

==History==

In 1902, the Youngstown Iron Sheet and Tube Company established a factory near the Mahoning River in what was then Coitsville Township. A settlement grew around the factory, called East Youngstown, due to its location just southeast from downtown Youngstown. The village was incorporated in 1908, as its population swelled with young immigrants to work in the steel industry. Many immigrants to the village were Greeks.

The plant, which would later be known as the Campbell Works, contained four blast furnaces, twelve open hearth furnaces, several blooming mills, two Bessemer converters, a slabbing mill, a butt-weld tube mill, a hot strip mill, seamless tube mills, and and bar mills. Due to the imbalance of ironmaking and steelmaking facilities at the two plants, rail shipments of molten iron &quot;hot metal&quot; were sent from Campbell to the company’s Brier Hill Works from 1937 until 1979.

In 1916, Sheet and Tube workers at the East Youngstown plant rioted during a strike over working conditions, which resulted in most of the town&#x27;s business district being burned to the ground. The strike was quelled by the arrival of National Guard troops. After the riots, the company erected a series of townhouses known as &quot;Iron Soup&quot; that were the first prefabricated concrete home development in the world. In 1926, the city was renamed to recognize James Anson Campbell, president of the iron company during the founding of the city.

The company abruptly closed its Campbell Works and furloughed 5,000 workers on September 19, 1977, a day remembered locally as &quot;Black Monday.&quot;

Campbell is sometimes referred to as the &quot;City of Churches&quot; because of the wide variety of religious structures found throughout the community.

<text>Canfield is a city in central Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. The population was 7,699 as of the 2020 census. It is a suburb surrounded by Canfield Township located at the intersection of U.S. Routes 62 and 224. It is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==
Canfield Township was established in 1798 as township number 1 in range 3 by purchase from the Connecticut Land Company in the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was purchased by six men, although the majority was owned by Judson Canfield, a land agent. The township took his name in 1800. Canfield&#x27;s first settlers arrived shortly after surveying was initiated in 1798, primarily from Connecticut, although waves of German immigrants around 1805 and Irish around 1852 would occur. Goods were transported initially by horse and wagon about 55 miles (91 km) from Pittsburgh; later, the Beaver Canal served as the primary method for commerce. By 1805, Canfield had approximately 17 homes, a store and a school; it became a trade center for the region.

Canfield was part of Trumbull County until 1846, when the counties in the area were redefined and Mahoning County emerged as a new county. Canfield was made the county seat in 1846 and incorporated in 1849, igniting a three decade-long feud with larger Youngstown on which should be the seat. The Ohio State Legislature voted to move the seat to Youngstown in 1874. After the removal of the seat of government, Canfield became the center of the farming community in central Mahoning County. It is home to many examples of classic revival architecture, such as the mid-19th century Charles Ruggles House and Judge Eben Newton House on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Craig Beach is a village in northwestern Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. Located along the shores of Lake Milton, the population was 1,076 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1910, the city of Youngstown acquired 3,416 acres along the Mahoning River in Milton Township to construct a reservoir to be used as a water supply. The plan was to construct a 2,800-foot dam across the river, impounding 1,640 acres. Entertainer Ward Craig founded Craig’s Landing to initially watch the construction of the dam, which later offered a refreshment stand, swimming area, boat docks, and picnic facilities. In 1922, Craig formed his own amusement company that would create the Craig Beach Amusement Park along the new Lake Milton. Featuring rides, a dance hall, as well as rental cottages, Craig Beach became a popular entertainment hub for the area as big bands of the 1930s toured the area. Future crooner Dean Martin would get his start at the Craig Beach dance hall performing with these orchestras. Craig Beach was incorporated as a village in 1931. The amusement park would close by 1966, although Craig Beach would rebound as a small resort town within Lake Milton State Park.

<doc id="129582" wikidata="Q2372872" url="?curid=129582" title="Struthers, Ohio">
<text>Struthers is a city in eastern Mahoning County, Ohio, United States, along the Mahoning River. The population was 10,063 at the 2020 census. Located directly southeast of Youngstown, it is a suburb in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

== History ==
John Struthers, from Washington County, Pennsylvania, purchased of Poland Township land in 1798 and gave it the name Marbletown. John Struthers owned this land until the War of 1812 came around when he and his family suffered financial ruin. The land was dormant until 1865 when it was purchased by Thomas Struthers. Thomas bought this land to honor his father and he was instrumental in bringing industry and railroads to the town. Eventually, the town name was changed to Struthers by popular vote.

In 1943, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses was fined by the city for distributing religious pamphlets door-to-door. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this was a violation of the First Amendment in &quot;Martin v. Struthers&quot;.

===Influence of steel===
The community&#x27;s early history centers on Yellow Creek, where the cradle of steel began with the building of the Hopewell Furnace. This furnace was built in 1803 by Daniel Eaton and was mentioned in the first line of the 1995 Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Youngstown&quot;. The Hopewell Furnace thrived for a little over ten years until John Struthers reached his financial crisis in 1812.

In 1869, Struthers again became an iron-producing community with the construction of the Anna Furnace by the Struthers Iron Company. In 1880, the sheet mill plant of the Summer&#x27;s Brothers Co. was added and in 1888, the plant of the J. A. and D. P. Cooper Gear Company was constructed.

With all these activities, Struthers still remained a village of less than 1,000 inhabitants, after 100 years had elapsed since John Struthers built his first cabin and erected the sawmill and grist mill on Yellow Creek. In 1899, Struthers was brought into closer communication with Youngstown and the upper Mahoning Valley by the completion of an interurban electric line.

In 1902, the neighboring village of East Youngstown (now Campbell) was started. This new community was started shortly after the incorporation of the Youngstown Iron Sheet and Tube Company (known as the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co., since 1905).

With the steel industry booming in the early part of the 1900s, immigrants from throughout Europe flooded into Struthers. Still a village when it was officially incorporated in 1902, Struthers quickly became a city in 1920. The steel industry allowed the city to flourish until 1977, when several area plants closed their doors for good. The city padded the loss of thousands of jobs by using its industrial infrastructure to lure non-steel making jobs, but population losses have continued throughout the start of the new century.

==Geography==

Struthers is located on the banks of the Mahoning River about west of the border between Ohio and Pennsylvania at the intersection of Ohio State Route 616 and Ohio State Route 289. The larger part of the city is across the river from State Route 289 on the south side of the river.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

As a statutory city, Struthers has home rule powers, but operates under a governmental structure prescribed by the state of Ohio. The city has three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial.

The mayor is the chief executive officer of the city charged with executing the laws of the state and ordinances passed by city council as well as overseeing the operations and affairs of the city in conjunction with the various department heads. The mayor is also the appointing authority for the city and, with the Director of Public Service and Safety, constitute the Board of Control. The mayor also has power to veto actions of the City Council.

The City Council is the legislative branch of city government responsible for considering and passing ordinances within its constitutional authority. The Council consists of seven members, four elected from wards and three elected at-large. All council positions are elected for two-year terms. All proposed legislation must receive a majority vote by City Council and be signed by the mayor to be enacted. Should the mayor veto the legislation, a two-thirds (5) votes of council is needed to override the mayor&#x27;s veto.

The Municipal Court constitutes the judicial branch of city government. The head of the judicial branch is the judge, who is elected to a six-year term of office. The Municipal Court&#x27;s jurisdiction is to handle all civil cases where the disputed amount is up to $15,000, criminal misdemeanors, and preliminary hearings for felony crimes committed in the geographic area of the court&#x27;s authority which includes Struthers, Poland Village, Poland Township, New Middletown, Springfield Township, Lowellville, and a portion of the turnpike.

<doc id="129585" wikidata="Q20456" url="?curid=129585" title="Dances With Wolves">
<text>Dances With Wolves is a 1990 American epic Western film starring, directed, and produced by Kevin Costner in his feature directorial debut. It is a film adaptation of the 1988 novel &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, by Michael Blake, that tells the story of Union Army Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Costner), who travels to the American frontier to find a military post and who meets a group of Lakota.

Costner developed the film with an initial budget of $15 million. Much of the dialogue is spoken in Lakota with English subtitles. It was shot from July to November 1989 in South Dakota and Wyoming, and translated by Doris Leader Charge, of the Lakota Studies department at Sinte Gleska University.

The film earned favorable reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Costner&#x27;s directing, the performances, screenplay, score, cinematography, and production values. It was a box office hit, grossing $424.2 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1990, and is the highest-grossing film for Orion Pictures. The film was nominated for 12 awards at the 63rd Academy Awards and won 7, including Best Picture, Best Director for Costner, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. It is one of only four Westerns to win the Oscar for Best Picture, the other three being &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931), &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), and &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007).

It is credited as a leading influence for the revitalization of the Western genre of filmmaking in Hollywood. In 2007, &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1863, 1st Lieutenant John J. Dunbar—serving with the Union Army—is wounded in a stalemated battle at St. David&#x27;s Field in Tennessee. The surgeon intends to amputate his leg. Choosing death in battle instead, Dunbar steals a horse and rides in front of Confederate lines unarmed, but miraculously survives his suicide attempt. The Union soldiers take advantage of the distraction to mount a successful attack. Dunbar is given medical care that saves his leg and is awarded &quot;Cisco&quot;, the horse he rode during his suicide attempt, along with his choice of posting. He requests a transfer to the American frontier so he can see it before it disappears.

Dunbar arrives at Fort Hays where its commander, Major Fambrough, assigns him to the furthest outpost under his jurisdiction: Fort Sedgwick. Fambrough, who is mentally ill, kills himself after Dunbar departs. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a foul-mouthed mule-wagon provisioner, and finds the fort deserted. He decides to rebuild the fort, recording his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by a band of Pawnee while returning to Fort Hays. The deaths of Timmons and Fambrough leave the army unaware of Dunbar&#x27;s assignment, so no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post.

Dunbar encounters his Sioux neighbors when they attempt to steal his horse and intimidate him. Wanting to make peace, he seeks out the Sioux camp. En route, he comes across Stands With A Fist, a white ethnic Sioux woman who was adopted as a girl by the tribe&#x27;s medicine man, Kicking Bird, after her family was killed by Pawnee. She is mutilating herself in mourning for her late Sioux husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover. Though the Sioux are initially hostile, Dunbar gradually establishes a rapport with them, particularly Kicking Bird, the Sioux fighter Wind In His Hair, and the youth Smiles A Lot. Stands With A Fist acts as an interpreter, speaking Lakota and English.

Dunbar comes to respect and appreciate the Sioux. He is accepted into their group after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. He also befriends a wolf he dubs &quot;Two Socks&quot; for his white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, he is given a name that translates as Dances With Wolves. Dunbar learns the Lakota language, and he and Stands With A Fist grow close. He gives the Sioux firearms to help them defend against Pawnee attack. He eventually earns Kicking Bird&#x27;s approval to marry Stands With A Fist.

Because of the threat of encroaching white settlers, Chief Ten Bears decides to move his group to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them but first goes to retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgwick, as it would help the U.S. Army locate the group at its new location. When he arrives, he finds the fort reoccupied by the army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco, and capture Dunbar. He cannot prove his story as one of the soldiers had stolen his diary. Refusing to help the army hunt down the Sioux, he is charged with desertion, and the soldiers begin to transport him back east as a prisoner. Two Socks attempts to follow Dunbar but is shot dead by the soldiers.

His Sioux friends track and attack the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. They meet the others at the winter camp. Dunbar decides to leave with Stands With A Fist because his presence would endanger the group. As they leave, Dunbar and Kicking Bird exchange parting gifts; Smiles A Lot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar&#x27;s rescue; Wind In His Hair proclaims his everlasting friendship to Dunbar.

U.S. troops search the mountains but cannot locate Dunbar or the Sioux. The film&#x27;s epilogue text states that the last of the free Sioux would surrender at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, thirteen years later.

==Production==
Originally written as a speculative script by Michael Blake, it went unsold in the mid-1980s. However, Kevin Costner had starred in Blake&#x27;s only previous film, &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Knights&quot; (1983) and encouraged Blake in early 1986 to turn the Western screenplay into a novel to improve its chances of being produced. The novel was rejected by numerous publishers, but finally was published in paperback in 1988. The rights were purchased by Costner, with an eye on directing it.

Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, had difficulty in raising money for the film. The project was turned down by several studios due to the Western genre no longer being popular, following the disastrous box office of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), as well as the length of the script. After the project languished at both Nelson Entertainment and Island Pictures due to budget reasons, Costner and Wilson enlisted producer Jake Eberts to manage foreign rights in several countries for Costner to retain final cut rights. The two then made a deal with Orion Pictures, in which the studio would distribute the film in North America.

Actual production lasted from July 17 or 18 to November 21 or 23, 1989. Most of the movie was filmed on location in South Dakota, mainly on private ranches near Pierre and Rapid City, with a few scenes filmed in Wyoming. Specific locations included the Badlands National Park, the Black Hills, the Sage Creek Wilderness Area, and the Belle Fourche River area. The bison hunt scenes were filmed at the Triple U Buffalo Ranch outside Fort Pierre, South Dakota, as were the Fort Sedgewick scenes on a custom set.

==Reception==
, the film holds an approval rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 131 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; suffers from a simplistic view of the culture it attempts to honor, but the end result remains a stirring western whose noble intentions are often matched by its epic grandeur.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; was named one of the top ten films of 1990 by over 115 critics and was named the best film of the year by 19 critics.

Because of the film&#x27;s popularity and lasting impact on the image of Native Americans, members of the Lakota Sioux Nation held a ceremony in Washington, D.C., &quot;to honor Kevin [Costner] and Mary [McDonnell] and Jim [Wilson] on behalf of the Indian Lakota nation&quot;, explained Floyd Westerman (who plays Chief Ten Bears in the movie). Albert Whitehat, a Lakota elder who served as a cultural adviser on the film, adopted Costner into his family, and two other families adopted McDonnell and Wilson. Westerman continued, that this is so &quot;They will all become part of one family.&quot; At the 63rd Academy Awards ceremony in 1991, &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; earned 12 Academy Award nominations and won seven, including Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Michael Blake), Best Director (Costner), and Best Picture. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Some of the criticism of the film centered on the lack of authenticity of the Lakota language used in the film, as only one of the actors was a native speaker of the language. Oglala Lakota activist and actor Russell Means was critical of the film&#x27;s lack of accuracy. In 2009, he said: &quot;Remember &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;? That was Lawrence of the Plains. The odd thing about making that movie is that they had a woman teaching the actors the Lakota language, but Lakota has a male-gendered language and a female-gendered language. Some of the Natives and Kevin Costner were speaking in the feminine way. When I went to see it with a bunch of Lakota guys, we were laughing.&quot;

Michael Smith (Sioux), the director of San Francisco&#x27;s long-running annual American Indian Film Festival, said that despite criticisms, &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of good feeling about the film in the Native community, especially among the tribes. I think it&#x27;s going to be very hard to top this one.&quot; However, Blackfeet filmmaker George Budreau countered: &quot;I want to say, &#x27;how nice&#x27;... But, no matter how sensitive and wonderful this movie is, you have to ask who&#x27;s telling the story. It&#x27;s certainly not an Indian.&quot;

Though promoted as a breakthrough in its use of an indigenous language, earlier English-language films, such as &quot;Eskimo&quot; (1933), &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (1950), and &quot;The White Dawn&quot; (1974) also have native dialogue.

David Sirota of Salon referred to &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; as a &quot;white savior&quot; film, as Dunbar &quot;fully embeds himself in the Sioux tribe and quickly becomes its primary protector&quot;. He argued that its use of the &quot;noble savage&quot; character type &quot;preemptively blunts criticism of the underlying White Savior story&quot;.

===Accolades===

In addition to becoming the first Western film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture since 1931&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron&quot;, &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; swept the Motion Picture Academy Awards that year, with a record, for the genre, of seven Oscars (including Best Picture), by far the most of any Western film in history. It also won a number of additional awards, making it one of the most honored films of 1990.

===Home media===
The film was released on home video in the United States in September 1991 by Orion Home Video and beat the rental record set by &quot;Ghost&quot;, at 649,000 units. The extended Special Edition was released on DVD on May 20, 2003, in a two-disc set. &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; was then released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 11, 2011, and was re-released on Blu-ray on January 13, 2015, and again on November 13, 2018.

==Cancelled sequel==
&quot;The Holy Road&quot;, a sequel novel by Michael Blake, the author of both the original novel and the movie screenplay, was published in 2001. It picks up 11 years after the events of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;. John Dunbar is still married to Stands With A Fist, and they have three children. Stands With A Fist and one of the children are kidnapped by a party of white rangers, and Dances With Wolves must mount a rescue mission.

Salvador Carrasco was attached to direct the sequel, but the film was not realized. As of 2007, Blake was writing a film adaptation. However, Costner stated in a 2008 interview that he would &quot;never make a sequel&quot;. A third book titled &quot;The Great Mystery&quot; was planned, but Blake died in 2015.

==Historical references==
Judith A. Boughter wrote: &quot;The problem with Costner&#x27;s approach is that all of the Sioux are heroic, while the Pawnees are portrayed as stereotypical villains. Most accounts of Sioux–Pawnee relations see the Pawnees, numbering only 4,000 at that time, as victims of the more powerful Sioux.&quot;

The history and context of Fort Hays is radically different from that portrayed in the movie. Historic Fort Hays was founded in 1867, with the iconic stone blockhouse being built immediately. Its predecessor, Fort Fletcher (1865–1868), was abandoned for a few months and then relocated a short distance away in 1866. Fort Hays was founded in Cheyenne territory rather than Sioux. Rather than a desolate site, the fort was host to thousands of soldiers, railroad workers, and settlers from the start. The Kansas Pacific Railway and the settlements of Rome and Hays City were built next to the fort in 1867; each was a perceived violation of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, resulting in immediate warfare with the Dog Soldiers. The fort was Sheridan&#x27;s headquarters at the center of the 1867–1868 conflict. A historic seasonal Pawnee tipi village had been located only from Fort Hays, but the Pawnee had been excluded from it by other dominant tribes for some time by the 1860s.

A Christian missionary named John Dunbar worked among the Pawnee in the 1830s and 1840s, and sided with the Native Americans in a dispute with government farmers and a local Indian agent. According to screenwriter Michael Blake, the film character&#x27;s name was chosen at random from lists of Civil War veterans and was merely coincidence.

The fictional Lieutenant John Dunbar of 1863 is correctly shown in the film wearing a gold bar on his officer shoulder straps, indicating his rank as a first lieutenant. From 1836 to 1872, the rank of first lieutenant was indicated by a gold bar; after 1872, the rank was indicated by a silver bar. Similarly, Captain Cargill is correctly depicted wearing a pair of gold bars, indicating the rank of captain at that time.

Author and screenwriter Michael Blake said that Stands With A Fist was actually based upon Cynthia Ann Parker, the white girl captured by Comanches and mother of Quanah Parker.

==Extended version==
One year after the original theatrical release of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, a four-hour version of the film opened at select cinemas in London. This longer cut was titled &quot;Dances With Wolves: The Special Edition&quot;, and it restored nearly an hour&#x27;s worth of scenes that had been removed to keep the original film&#x27;s running time under three hours. In a letter to British film reviewers, Kevin Costner and producer Jim Wilson addressed their reasons for presenting a longer version of the film:

The genesis of the four-hour version of the film was further explained in an article for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that appeared ten months after the premiere of the original film. &quot;While the small screen has come to serve as a second chance for filmmakers who can&#x27;t seem to let their babies go, Kevin Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, hope that their newly completed version will hit theater screens first.&quot;

Costner later stated that he did not work on the creation of the &quot;Special Edition&quot; at all.

==Soundtrack==

==History==
In the early 19th-century, prior to their removal in the 1830s, there was a Wyandot village at this location.

LaRue had its start in the early 1850s when the railroad was extended to that point. A post office has been in operation at LaRue since 1853.

LaRue was home to Walter Lingo, owner of the Oorang Dog Kennels, which bred the nationally recognized King Oorang Airedale Terriers. Lingo also owned the National Football League&#x27;s Oorang Indians, which played in 1922 and 1923. The team consisted of Native American players and was led by Jim Thorpe. They were strictly a traveling team; of the 20 games they played over two seasons, only one was played at &quot;home&quot; in nearby Marion. LaRue remains the smallest town ever to have been the home of an NFL franchise, or probably any professional team in any league in the United States, though River Vale was awful close in the late 1930s.

==Events==
A festival called the &quot;Oorang Bang&quot; in honor of the Oorang Indians, Thorpe, and Oorang Airedales was held on the second weekend of June, featuring a parade, food, rides, and live music. The festival was first organized by local resident Harry Roberts (1924–2003) to fund improvements to the then derelict municipal swimming pool and park, located north of the village.

The Marion County Raceway was located in LaRue.

<text>Marion is a city in and the county seat of Marion County, Ohio, United States. It is located in north-central Ohio, approximately north of Columbus. The population was 35,999 at the 2020 census, down slightly from 36,837 at the 2010 census. It is the largest city in Marion County and the principal city of the Marion micropolitan area. It is also part of the larger Columbus–Marion–Zanesville, OH Combined Statistical Area.

President Warren G. Harding, a former owner of the &quot;Marion Star&quot;, was a resident of Marion for much of his adult life and is buried at Harding Tomb. The city and its development were closely related to industrialist Edward Huber and his extensive business interests. The city is home to several historic properties, some listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Marion County, Ohio.

Marion currently styles itself as &quot;America&#x27;s Workforce Development Capital&quot; given public–private educational partnerships and coordination of educational venues, from four and two–year college programs to vocational and technical training and skill certification programs. The mayor of Marion is Scott Schertzer.

==History==

Marion was laid out in 1822, and is named in honor of General Francis Marion. It was incorporated as a village by the Legislature of Ohio in its 1829-1830 session. On March 15, 1830, Marion elected Nathan Peters as its first Mayor.

Marion was one of Ohio&#x27;s major industrial centers until the 1970s. Products of the Marion Steam Shovel Company (later Marion Power Shovel) were used by contractors to build the Panama Canal, the Hoover Dam, and dug the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River. In 1911, 80% of the nation&#x27;s steam shovel and heavy-duty earth moving equipment was manufactured in Marion, Ohio. NASA contracted with Marion Power Shovel to manufacture the crawler-transporters that moved the assembled Saturn V rockets (used for Project Apollo) to the launch pad.

The city is a rail center for CSX, and Norfolk Southern. Marion has long been a center of grain based (corn and popcorn) snack and other products given its close proximity to nearby growing regions in adjacent counties (ConAgra had a major presence in Marion for decades, and Wyandot Snacks has been active in Marion since the 1960s). Whirlpool Corporation is the largest employer in the city operating the largest clothes dryer manufacturing facility in the world. Nucor Steel&#x27;s facility in Marion is the largest producer of rebar and signpost in Ohio.

Marion, like many small American cities, has progressed in its sensibilities around race. During the 1800s Marion served as a stop in the Underground Railroad known in Ohio as the River to Lake Freedom Trail. In 1839, a Black man, Bill Mitchell, was accused of being a fugitive slave in Marion and was freed in the ensuing legal case. A number of Virginians seeking to reclaim him for his owner brawled in the courtroom in response. The former slave was spirited away by Marion abolitionists and he ultimately made his way to Canada. In February 1919, nearly all of Marion&#x27;s African American residents were driven out of town in response to an attack on a white woman. Marion subsequently became a sundown town, where African Americans were prevented from residing. President Harding, in spite of criticisms, employed African Americans at the &quot;Marion Star&quot;. In the 1920s, Marion city and Marion County supported Native American Jim Thorpe and his efforts to field an all–Native American NFL team called the Oorang Indians. In the 1970s, Dr. Dalsukh Madia, an Indian American, became head of the Smith Center at Marion General Hospital (now part of OhioHealth).

Today, people of color constitute 14% of Marion&#x27;s population. In July 2020 the Marion City Council, led by Mayor Scott Schertzer, unanimously passed a resolution vowing to promote racial equality and justice for its African American community.

==Geography==
Marion is located in the Till plain geological area of Ohio. The flat land was formed (12,000-14,000 years ago) of glacial till that formed when a sheet of ice became detached from the main body of a glacier and melted in place, depositing the sediments it carried. Two small glacial lake plains are located to the west of the city. The county has gently rolling moraine hills left from the retreating glaciers.

Because of the glacial action, the soils are highly productive for agriculture. The soils are blount, pewamo and glynwood.

The city is located about north of Ohio&#x27;s capital city, Columbus, due north along U.S. Route 23. Marion occupies most of Marion Township, which is located just outside the city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Eberson designed the theatre for Young Amusement Company, at an original cost of one-half million dollars ($8.6 million in 2023 dollars). Inside, the auditorium resembles an outdoor palace courtyard, complete with a blue sky and twinkling stars. It has many original Pietro Caproni sculpture castings. The theatre is registered on the National Register of Historic Places. Adjoining the theatre is the May Pavilion, a two-story event space for chamber orchestra concerts, jazz and soft rock bands, amateur theatre productions of plays and small cast musicals, wedding receptions, graduation parties and meetings.

Warren G. Harding House
A national presidential site, the Harding Home was the residence of Warren G. Harding, twenty-ninth president of the United States. Harding and his future wife, Florence, designed the Queen Anne Style house in 1890, a year before their marriage. They were married in the home and lived there for 30 years before his election to the presidency. Like James A. Garfield, an earlier U.S. president from Ohio, Harding conducted his election campaign mainly from the house&#x27;s expansive front porch. During the 3-month front porch campaign, over 600,000 people traveled to the Harding Home to listen to the candidate speak. Harding paid $1,000 to have a Sears catalog house built behind his home so newspaper reporters had workspace to type their stories. The press house is also open to the public. The site is being expanded to include a Presidential Center for Harding, expected to be opened in 2020, the 100th anniversary of Harding&#x27;s election to the Presidency.

Huber Machinery Museum
This museum contains examples of Edward Huber&#x27;s early steam and gasoline tractors and road-building equipment. Huber Manufacturing introduced a thresher in 1875, a steam traction engine in 1898, its first motor graders in the 1920s, a primitive hydraulic control in 1926, and the first Maintainer, a tractor-sized integral motor grader, in 1943. Other Huber products included wheel tractors, agricultural equipment, and three-wheel, tandem and pneumatic rollers.

Marion Union Station and Museum
More than 100 trains pass by Union Station every day. The museum showcases an impressive collection of memorabilia and the AC Tower, which was once the main switching facility for the Erie Railroad, Marion Division.

===Harding Home===

The Harding Home was the residence of Warren G. Harding, twenty-ninth president of the United States. Harding and his future wife, Florence, designed the Queen Anne Style house in 1890, a year before their marriage. They were married there and lived there for 30 years before his election to the presidency.

===Harding Memorial (Harding Tomb)===

The Harding Memorial, as it was called by thousands of people, including schoolchildren who donated to its construction fund, is the burial location (tomb) of the 29th President of the United States, Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding. Later referred to as the Harding Tomb, it is located at the southeast corner of Vernon Heights Boulevard and Delaware Avenue. Construction began in 1926 and was finished in early 1927, the Greek temple structure is built of white marble. Designed by Henry Hornbostel, Eric Fisher Wood and Edward Mellon, the structure is 103 feet in diameter and 53 feet in height. The open design honors the Hardings&#x27; wishes that they be buried outside.

===Hotel Harding (The Harding Centre)===
Constructed in 1924, the Hotel Harding was developed to provide lodging and fine dining for the expected post-White House visitors of President Harding. It was hoped by local entrepreneurs that the hotel would provide lodging for Warren G. Harding&#x27;s visitors who came to Marion after his presidency. It was located close to Union Station, the city&#x27;s main rail station. The building is no longer used as a hotel. Renovated in 2005, the building is now an apartment style community for all, and as residence for OSUM students. Its lobby has been restored to much the same condition as the original.

===Marion Cemetery===

Merchant Family Memorial (The Rotating Ball). Marion Cemetery is the home to the Merchant family grave marker, known for its unintended movements. The marker consists of a large grey granite pedestal capped by a two-ton granite sphere four feet in diameter. The sphere moves on its base a 1/4 to a 1/2 inch every year, as measured by the distance traveled by the unpolished spot from where it was mated to the pedestal. While the movement of the sphere is thought to be facilitated by freeze-thaw cycles, earth tremors, or trapped air or water under the base, there has been no conclusive explanation for patterns that the sphere seems to follow. The movements of the sphere have been documented by numerous news outlets and it has been featured in Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not (September 29, 1927). This has also been documented in Frank Edwards&#x27; book, &quot;Strange World&quot;, from an edition in the early to mid sixties. There are several web pages on the internet concerning this tombstone.

The Receiving Vault. The Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault is a funerary structure in the main cemetery of Marion, Ohio, United States. Constructed in the 1870s, this receiving vault originally fulfilled the normal purposes of such structures, but it gained prominence as the semipermanent resting place of Marion&#x27;s most prominent citizen, U.S. President Warren G. Harding.

==Sports==
The Oorang Indians, a traveling NFL team based in nearby LaRue, played their only true &quot;home&quot; game in Marion in 1923.

Marion was home to numerous minor league baseball teams between 1900 and 1951, including the Marion Senators, Marion Presidents, Marion Cardinals and Marion Cubs. Future U.S. President Warren G. Harding was a part owner of the Marion Diggers, who played as members of the Class D level Ohio State League from 1908 to 1912.

Marion has been home to numerous individual and team high school state championships. In the early 1980s, Tina Kneisley was a national and world roller skating champion in pairs and ladies freestyle, and Scott Duncan was a WUSA National Champion in wrestling.

<text>Chippewa Lake (formerly Chippewa-on-the-Lake) is a village in Medina County, Ohio, United States. It is located on Chippewa Lake, a natural inland lake in Ohio. The village was incorporated in 1920. The population was 654 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Chippewa Lake took its name from the Ojibwe tribe of Native Americans.

In the 1880s, Oscar Townsend and the Cleveland, Lorain, &amp; Wheeling Railroad developed a vacation resort, eventually called Chippewa Lake Park, on the banks of Chippewa Lake. The Great Depression and extinction of interurban rail service crippled the park, but in 1937, Parker Beach purchased the resort. In 1978, after more than 100 years of operation, Chippewa Lake Park was shut down.

In 2008, scenes for the horror film &quot;Closed For the Season&quot; (released in 2010) were shot at the abandoned amusement park, using many of its decrepit attractions as backgrounds.

A large estate that was originally part of Townsend&#x27;s empire in town remains intact today, and has operated for decades as The Oaks Lodge restaurant. The restaurant is a popular event space; its lakeside gazebo is often used for weddings.

<text>Medina ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Medina County, Ohio, United States. The population was 26,094 at the 2020 census. It lies about south of Cleveland and west of Akron within the Cleveland metropolitan area.

==History==
Medina was founded on November 30, 1818, as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was originally named Mecca, but an unincorporated community in Ohio already had that name, so the name was changed. Both Mecca and Medina are Saudi Arabian cities particularly significant in Islam.

Most early residents were farmers. In the 1830s, the community&#x27;s growth was aided by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which helped transport agricultural products to markets. On January 31, 1835, Medina was incorporated as a village and as the county seat of Medina County. By 1855, the town&#x27;s quarries were producing over $200,000 worth of stone per year. In 1857, many of the canal workers started a strike for higher wages; the striking workers were fired, and the four workers who started it were jailed in Albion, Ohio.

In 1835, two enslaved women and two Native Americans arrived in Medina by stagecoach. One of the enslaved women was the child of then-vice presidential candidate Richard Mentor Johnson and Julia Chinn. The next day, Johnson&#x27;s nephew arrived, in pursuit of the women, saying that he owned them both, they had escaped, and they had stolen a $1,000 bank check. The women were arrested and charged with stealing. Three local attorneys volunteered to represent them in court. The women were then released to Johnson&#x27;s nephew to stand trial in Kentucky. Afterward, one of the Native Americans said that the women had asked for help escaping enslavement and their terrible treatment by their owners. It was later found that the alleged theft was a lie in order to make sure the Ohio court returned them to their owners.

Medina attorney Charles Olcott invented self-ballasting iron ships and received a patent in 1835. Olcott was originally from Connecticut and had been a student at Yale College when he came up with the early prototypes for his invention. He was later a proponent of building long-distance railroad lines across Ohio.

In 1869, Amos Root founded the A.I. Root Company in Medina as a manufacturer of beehives and beekeeping equipment, and the town became a center for beehive manufacturing. The Root Company had 97 workers in 1886, making it the town&#x27;s largest employer.

A disastrous fire hit the village in 1848, destroying the entire business district. With no facilities for extinguishing fires, the residents attempted to put out the fire using a bucket brigade, but to no avail, as the fire burned for four hours. None of the town&#x27;s 1,159 residents died in the fire, but the townspeople failed to budget for the needed firefighting equipment. In 1870, another large fire, which started in a wooden building with a barbershop, destroyed 45 buildings—all but two blocks of the business district—and nearly wiped out the town. Even after the second calamitous fire struck, the town still had not organized a fire department beyond a bucket brigade. In 1877, after repeated dire warnings, the Council finally authorized the issuance of $3,000 worth of bonds to purchase a fire engine.

After the disastrous fire in 1870, much of the Medina Square, including the Town Hall and Engine House, was rebuilt under the supervision of onetime mayor and banker Harrison Gray Blake, who owned the Phoenix Building in the same city block. It took almost ten years to replace the buildings on Medina Square, hence their common Victorian style. Medina Square is now a recognized historic district, covering a nine-block area surrounding Uptown Park. The Community Design Committee and the Historic Preservation Board preserve the city&#x27;s historic look and feel.

In 1950, Medina had over 5,000 residents, and on May 6, 1952, it was chartered as a city.

==Geography==
Medina includes parts of Lafayette Township, Medina Township, Montville Township and York Township in Medina County.

<text>Awakenings is a 1990 American biographical drama film written by Steven Zaillian, directed by Penny Marshall, and starring Robert De Niro, Robin Williams, Julie Kavner, Ruth Nelson, John Heard, Penelope Ann Miller, Peter Stormare and Max von Sydow. It is based on Oliver Sacks&#x27;s 1973 nonfiction memoir of the same title. The film tells the story of the fictional neurologist Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Williams), whose character is based on Sacks. 

In 1969, Sayer discovers the beneficial effects of the drug -DOPA and administers the drug to catatonic patients who survived the 1919–1930 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. The patients - among them the focal character Leonard Lowe (De Niro) - are awakened after decades and must therefore try to acclimate to life in a new and unfamiliar time.

Produced by Walter Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, who first encountered Sacks&#x27;s book as undergraduates at Yale University. Released on 12 December 1990, Awakenings was a critical and commercial success, earning $108.7 million on a $29 million budget. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (De Niro), and Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Plot==
In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of the Bronx. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1919–1930 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients&#x27; respective catatonic states. Actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their name, and enjoying human touch, each have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Patient Leonard Lowe seems to remain unmoved, but Sayer learns that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board.

After attending a lecture at a conference on the drug -DOPA and its success for patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Sayer believes that the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results; Leonard completely &quot;awakens&quot; from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors, so that all the catatonic patients can receive the -DOPA medication and gain &quot;awakenings&quot; to reality and the present.

Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life, and becomes romantically interested in Paula, the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard begins to chafe at the restrictions placed on him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. As Leonard becomes more agitated, Sayer notices that a number of facial and body tics begin to manifest, which Leonard has difficulty controlling.

Although Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of -DOPA with this group of patients, they soon learn that it is a temporary result. As the first to &quot;awaken&quot;, Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of &quot;awakening&quot;. Leonard&#x27;s tics gradually grow more prominent, and he starts to shuffle as he walks. All the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. Leonard soon begins to have full body spasms and can hardly move. He tolerates the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, with the hope that he would someday contribute to research that may help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him, and has a last lunch with Paula, at which he tells her that he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him. For this short period of time, his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard soon returns to his catatonic state. The other patients&#x27; fears are similarly realized, as each eventually returns to catatonia, no matter how much their -DOPA dosages are increased.

Sayer tells a group of hospital grant donors that, although the &quot;awakening&quot; did not last, another kind — one of learning to appreciate and live life — occurred. For example, he overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar invitation from her. The nurses treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula visits Leonard. Sayer and Leonard continue to communicate with the Ouija board.

==Production==
===Casting===
On September 15, 1989, Liz Smith reported that those being considered for the role of Leonard Lowe&#x27;s mother were Kaye Ballard, Shelley Winters and Anne Jackson; not quite three weeks later, &quot;Newsday&quot; named Nancy Marchand as the leading contender. In January 1990 — more than three quarters of the way through the film&#x27;s four-month shooting schedule — the matter was seemingly resolved, when the February 1990 issue of &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine published a widely cited story, belatedly informing fans that, not only had Winters gotten the role, she had been targeted at De Niro&#x27;s request, and had been cast by displaying her Oscar awards (for the benefit of veteran casting director, Bonnie Timmermann).
Despite Liz Smith&#x27;s, &quot;Newsday&quot;&#x27;s and &quot;Premiere&quot;&#x27;s seemingly definitive reports (which, minus any mention of the specific film being discussed, would be periodically reiterated and ultimately embellished in subsequent years), the film was released in December 1990, featuring neither Winters (whose early dismissal evidently resulted from continuing attempts to pull rank on director Penny Marshall) nor any of the other previously publicized candidates (nor at least two others, Jo Van Fleet and Teresa Wright, identified in subsequent accounts), but rather the then-85-year-old Group Theater alumnus, Ruth Nelson, giving a well-received performance in what would be her final feature film. &quot;As Leonard&#x27;s mother,&quot; wrote &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; critic, Julie Salamon, &quot;Nelson achieves a wrenching beauty that stands out even among these exceptional actors doing exceptional things.&quot; In her 2012 memoir, Penny Marshall recalled:
===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Awakenings&quot; began on October 16, 1989, at the Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn, New York, which was operating, and lasted until February 16, 1990. According to Williams, actual patients were used in the filming of the movie. In addition to Kingsboro, sequences were filmed at the New York Botanical Garden, Julia Richman High School, the Casa Galicia, and Park Slope, Brooklyn.

==Reception==
&quot;Awakenings&quot; was released theatrically on December 12, 1990, with an opening weekend gross of $417,076, opening in second place, behind &quot;Home Alone&quot;&#x27;s ninth weekend, with $8,306,532. It went on to gross $52.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $56.6 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $108.7 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Awakenings&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 82% of 38 film critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.6/10. Its consensus states: &quot;Elevated by some of Robin Williams&#x27;[s] finest non-comedic work and a strong performance from Robert De Niro, &quot;Awakenings&quot; skirts the edges of melodrama, then soars above it.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score from reviews of mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 18 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a rating of four stars out of four, writing,
Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the film&#x27;s performances, citing,
Oliver Sacks, the author of the memoir on which the film is based, &quot;was pleased with a great deal of [the film]&quot;, explaining,
Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the film&#x27;s tragic aspects did not live up to the strength in its humor, saying,

Similarly, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded her review by stating,
===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including: the Academy Award for Best Picture, the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the Academy Award for Best Actor (Robert De Niro). Robin Williams was also nominated at the 48th Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama.

<doc id="129604" wikidata="Q1908489" url="?curid=129604" title="Pomeroy, Ohio">
<text>Pomeroy ( ) is a village in and the county seat of Meigs County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River about south of Athens. The population was 1,573 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pomeroy was founded in 1804 and named for landowner Samuel Pomeroy. The village was incorporated in 1840, and designated county seat in 1841.

===Settlement and economic development ===

The earliest history of Pomeroy begins with the arrival of Samuel Ervin at what is now Kerr’s Run in 1806. In 1821 Josiah Dill opened a tavern there and Nial Nye in 1826 operated a tavern, mill and wharf-boat. 

In 1830 Samuel Wyllys Pomeroy of Massachusetts, arriving by boat from Cincinnati enjoyed the view from the Nye tavern, and the wild turkey, turtle and Ohio River fish. After viewing his coal land purchased in Massachusetts in 1804, and the fertile fields of the county he deemed it “a good healthy place to live, and with proper management a bright industrial future.”

He established the Pomeroy Son’s Company and sent his son-in-law Valentine B. Horton, to develop coal and other industrial possibilities. 

Horton developed the mines, persuaded eastern settlers and those from Germany, Ireland, and Wales to come to Pomeroy to mine the coal; instituted modern methods in mining; developed the transportation of coal by the river, building the first coal barges and in 1836 the first boat (Condor) which was fired by coal instead of wood.

He brought about the incorporation of the village in 1841, and through political maneuvering the removal of the county court from Chester to Pomeroy in the same year. 

When salt was discovered in deep wells near the river (1848) he developed the industry, using the local coal to process the salt. Excelsior Salt Co., among many, opened during that period and continued in business until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency forced its closing because of high Sulphur coal smoke in the air and the brine polluting the river. 

By 1870 Pomeroy, with a population of 5,000, was a prosperous industrial town. River traffic was heavy. There were steel mills, machine shops, a brewery, an organ factory, a buggy &amp; wagon factory, copper shops, tanneries, cobbler shops, jewelry stores, bake shops, meat markets, blacksmith shops, furniture factories, boat builders, millinery shops, monument works, flour mills, livery stables, clothing and grocery stores. A newspaper was published in 1843, the telegraph line came in 1848 and the railroad in 1886: the horse-powered ferry to Mason, WV in 1854 and the steam ferry in 1847. There were doctors, dentists and lawyers. 

The early 20th century was the time of greatest prosperity for Meigs County and likewise Pomeroy. Production of salt, chemicals and coal and their derivatives was at its peak. WWI brought a demand for coal. The Ebersbach family assumed coal production where Horton and others left off; also, as machinery. After the strikes of the 1920s and the depression of the 1930s both coal and salt businesses began to wane, labor problems were great, and salt became more accessible elsewhere. 

During WWII and after the building of the bridge across the Ohio River and the TNT plant in West Virginia, there was a sudden and temporary boom in prosperity, but when the war was over, coal and salt production was not resumed. Any condition which affected the region affected the county seat. The population began to decrease and has continued to do so until recent years. Railroads have ceased operation into the Bend and this adversely affected business.
=== Schools ===

During the late 1880s, a school was built in the oldest part of town in Kerr’s Run. The school was known as the “Kerr’s Run Colored School”. The school educates children from the first to eighth grade, including James Edwin Campbell and James McHenry Jones, first and third presidents of what is now West Virginia State University. The school remained in operation from the late 1880s through the early 1900s. 

After Campbell and Jones had completed 8th grade, they went on to complete their secondary education at Pomeroy Academy. They became the first 1882 (Jones) and in 1884 the second (Campbell) people of color to graduate from Pomeroy Academy, while segregation still plagued the United States. 

In 1876, The Pomeroy Academy stood next to the Episcopal Church, and still later became the Pomeroy High School. Pomeroy Academies&#x27; first graduating class consisted of six students. In 1914 a new building was erected and served as the Senior High Building through 1967. In 1929 a Junior High School was built nearby.
In 1920 there were four grade schools, Viz, Sugar Run, Central, Coalport and Kerr’s Run, and all were integrated schools. Later Rutland, Middleport, and Pomeroy were consolidated as Meigs High School at Rock Springs.
=== Churches ===
Churches were established as people came to the county, and in Pomeroy included German and Welsh; also, two churches for black people, one at Kerr’s Run, the other on Lincoln Hill. The original buildings have all been removed and new edifices built, and several new denominations have been added. 
=== Natural disasters ===
Fires and floods were, and still are, a frequent enemy in Pomeroy. All the old wooden buildings were destroyed by fires of 1851, 1856, 1884, and 1927. Another in 1976 took the entire Red Anchor store, which had been in existence since the late 1800s. The floods of 1884, 1913, and 1937 were most disastrous.
=== Other attributes ===
The Pomeroy, Ohio McDonald&#x27;s location was one of the last two McDonald&#x27;s locations in the world that still served pizza. This location served its final pizza on August 31, 2017. McDonald&#x27;s phased out pizzas at its stores in the late 1990s.

The courthouse has the distinction of being mentioned in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe or Not!&quot; because there is a ground-floor entrance to each of its three stories. It also served as a temporary jail for more than 200 of Morgan’s Raid after their capture in the Battle of Buffington Island.

Pomeroy is mentioned in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s&quot; a second time for not having any cross streets.

<text>Fort Recovery is a village in Mercer County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,501 at the 2020 census. The village is near the location of Fort Recovery, first established in 1793 under orders from General Anthony Wayne. The town is located near the headwaters of the Wabash River.

==History==
Two significant battles of the Northwest Indian War took place at Fort Recovery. At the time, Ohio was claimed and populated by Native American nations, and conflict broke out when the young United States established settlements north of the Ohio River. In 1791, Northwest Territory governor Arthur St. Clair led a campaign north from Fort Washington to pacify the Western Confederacy at Kekionga. Instead, the United States force was destroyed in the early morning of November 4. St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat remains the greatest loss by the United States Army to a Native American force.

As a direct result of the Native American victory, the Legion of the United States was founded and placed under the command of General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne. In late 1793, Wayne led 300 men to the site of St. Clair&#x27;s defeat and deliberately had Fort Recovery built there. On December 25, they identified the site due to the large amount of unburied remains. Private George Will wrote that to set up camp, the unit had to move bones to make space for their beds. On June 30 of the following year, a large Native American force and a few British officers conducted the Siege of Fort Recovery. Although the Legion suffered high casualties, they were able to maintain control of the fort, in part because they had recovered cannons lost by St. Clair in 1791. Wayne used Fort Recovery as a staging ground for advances into the territory. He ultimately defeated the Native American confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794. In 1795, confederacy representatives signed the Treaty of Greenville, which ceded control of most of the modern state of Ohio, using Fort Recovery as a reference point for the border between Native American and United States territories.

In 1818, a Virginia soldier who fought at the battle of St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat returned to the area in search of silver he left by a standing oak tree. The soldier remained in the area for an unknown amount of time and was later found dead in the woods. In 1852, a local resident struck metal with a grubbing hoe. The metal was iron bands encasing a small wooden box, and 900 Spanish doubloons were found, valued at $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars).

In September 1851, the town organized Bone Burying Day, to inter the remains of bones that had been discovered from the battles at that location.

==Geography==
Fort Recovery is located at .

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Fort Recovery has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Rockford is a village in Mercer County, Ohio, United States. The village is on the St. Mary&#x27;s River near the center of the western Ohio border 12 miles Northwest of Celina. The population was 1,051 at the 2020 census.

The village was founded in 1815 by French-Indian trader Anthony Madore, and was originally named Shanesville.

== Name ==

===Anthony Shane===
Anthony Shane, born &quot;Antoine Chene&quot;, was a French-Indian trader who lived with his wife in a double-log cabin north of the current area of Rockford. He ran a trading post, and was given a large tract of land known as the Shanes Grant for his role as a scout for General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s army. The grant consisted of north of the town and at the town site.

On June 23, 1820, Shane filed his plot to the town of Shanesville, which then comprised 42 lots on the south side of the river. Shane lived in Shanesville until 1832, when acting as a government agent, he accompanied the Shawnee Indians to Kansas. It is not known if he ever returned to Shanesville.

=== Changes ===
Shanesville was renamed Shane&#x27;s Crossing, and eventually renamed again to Rockford by Post Office Department decree.

==History==
Prior to European colonisation, the high ground adjacent to St. Marys River at Rockford was used as a camping ground and village site for Native American tribes. Artefacts including weapons and tools have been found on the site.

Early traders, trappers and adventurers used the St. Marys River as a thoroughfare, and frequented trails along the banks of the river. Most notable of these is the Piqua-Fort Wayne Trail linking the Great Lakes to the Ohio River, which crossed to the north bank at Rockford.

During the Indian Wars of the late 18th century, many armies transited Rockhold, most notably General Josiah Harmar en route to his defeat at Kekionga. General Anthony Wayne built Fort Adams in the area of Rockford in the early August 1794, as a temporary relay station and supply depot. Fort Adams was initially garrisoned with 100 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Underhill. Fort Adams was abandoned in 1796, and is now an archaeological preserve operated by The Archaeological Conservancy. There are no physical remains of the fort.

The earliest records of Rockford originate from French-Indian trader Anthony Madore, who operated a trading post to the north of the current town, on the southern bank of the St. Marys River. It is not known how long Madore owned the post, but he died around 1815.

During the War of 1812, General William Henry Harrison camped in Rockford en route to fight the British and Indian coalition. He was joined at the camp by 200 mounted Ohio volunteers and 800 foot soldiers.

<text>St. Henry or Saint Henry is a village in Mercer County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,596 at the 2020 census.

==History==
St. Henry was laid out in 1837 by Johann Heinrich Römer (1805–1874). It laid in a tract of land sold to him by his brother Franz on July 7, 1837. The tract was surveyed on July 7, the town was platted on July 13, and the plat was recorded on July 15. July 13 is the feast of St. Henry. At the center of the village is St. Henry&#x27;s Catholic Church. Completed in 1897, the church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="129618" wikidata="Q93315" url="?curid=129618" title="Cyanobacteria">
<text>Cyanobacteria () are a group of autotrophic gram-negative bacteria of the phylum Cyanobacteriota that can obtain biological energy via oxygenic photosynthesis. The name &quot;cyanobacteria&quot; () refers to their bluish green (cyan) color, which forms the basis of cyanobacteria&#x27;s informal common name, blue-green algae, although as prokaryotes they are not scientifically classified as algae.

Cyanobacteria are probably the most numerous taxon to have ever existed on Earth and the first organisms known to have produced oxygen, having appeared in the middle Archean eon and apparently originated in a freshwater or terrestrial environment. Their photopigments can absorb the red- and blue-spectrum frequencies of sunlight (thus reflecting a greenish color) to split water molecules into hydrogen ions and oxygen. The hydrogen ions are used to react with carbon dioxide to produce complex organic compounds such as carbohydrates (a process known as carbon fixation), and the oxygen is released as a byproduct. By continuously producing and releasing oxygen over billions of years, cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early Earth&#x27;s anoxic, weakly reducing prebiotic atmosphere, into an oxidizing one with free gaseous oxygen (which previously would have been immediately removed by various surface reductants), resulting in the Great Oxidation Event and the &quot;rusting of the Earth&quot; during the early Proterozoic, dramatically changing the composition of life forms on Earth. The subsequent adaptation of early single-celled organisms to survive in oxygenous environments likely had led to endosymbiosis between anaerobes and aerobes, and hence the evolution of eukaryotes during the Paleoproterozoic.

Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments such as various forms of chlorophyll, carotenoids, phycobilins to convert the photonic energy in sunlight to chemical energy. Unlike heterotrophic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed. Photoautotrophic eukaryotes such as red algae, green algae and plants perform photosynthesis in chlorophyllic organelles that are thought to have their ancestry in cyanobacteria, acquired long ago via endosymbiosis. These endosymbiont cyanobacteria in eukaryotes then evolved and differentiated into specialized organelles such as chloroplasts, chromoplasts, etioplasts, and leucoplasts, collectively known as plastids.

Sericytochromatia, the proposed name of the paraphyletic and most basal group, is the ancestor of both the non-photosynthetic group Melainabacteria and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also called Oxyphotobacteria.

The cyanobacteria &quot;Synechocystis&quot; and &quot;Cyanothece&quot; are important model organisms with potential applications in biotechnology for bioethanol production, food colorings, as a source of human and animal food, dietary supplements and raw materials. Cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins known as cyanotoxins that can cause harmful health effects in humans and animals.

== Overview ==
Cyanobacteria are a very large and diverse phylum of photosynthetic prokaryotes. They are defined by their unique combination of pigments and their ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. They often live in colonial aggregates that can take on a multitude of forms. Of particular interest are the filamentous species, which often dominate the upper layers of microbial mats found in extreme environments such as hot springs, hypersaline water, deserts and the polar regions, but are also widely distributed in more mundane environments as well. They are evolutionarily optimized for environmental conditions of low oxygen. Some species are nitrogen-fixing and live in a wide variety of moist soils and water, either freely or in a symbiotic relationship with plants or lichen-forming fungi (as in the lichen genus &quot;Peltigera&quot;). 

Cyanobacteria are globally widespread photosynthetic prokaryotes and are major contributors to global biogeochemical cycles. They are the only oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes, and prosper in diverse and extreme habitats. They are among the oldest organisms on Earth with fossil records dating back at least 2.1 billion years. Since then, cyanobacteria have been essential players in the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems. Planktonic cyanobacteria are a fundamental component of marine food webs and are major contributors to global carbon and nitrogen fluxes. Some cyanobacteria form harmful algal blooms causing the disruption of aquatic ecosystem services and intoxication of wildlife and humans by the production of powerful toxins (cyanotoxins) such as microcystins, saxitoxin, and cylindrospermopsin. Nowadays, cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious threat to aquatic environments and public health, and are increasing in frequency and magnitude globally.

Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in marine environments and play important roles as primary producers. They are part of the marine phytoplankton, which currently contributes almost half of the Earth&#x27;s total primary production. About 25% of the global marine primary production is contributed by cyanobacteria.

Within the cyanobacteria, only a few lineages colonized the open ocean: &quot;Crocosphaera&quot; and relatives, cyanobacterium UCYN-A, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot;, as well as &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and &quot;Synechococcus&quot;. From these lineages, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are particularly important because they exert a control on primary productivity and the export of organic carbon to the deep ocean, by converting nitrogen gas into ammonium, which is later used to make amino acids and proteins. Marine picocyanobacteria (&quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and &quot;Synechococcus&quot;) numerically dominate most phytoplankton assemblages in modern oceans, contributing importantly to primary productivity. While some planktonic cyanobacteria are unicellular and free living cells (e.g., &quot;Crocosphaera&quot;, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, &quot;Synechococcus&quot;); others have established symbiotic relationships with haptophyte algae, such as coccolithophores. Amongst the filamentous forms, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; are free-living and form aggregates. However, filamentous heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria (e.g., &quot;Richelia&quot;, &quot;Calothrix&quot;) are found in association with diatoms such as &quot;Hemiaulus&quot;, &quot;Rhizosolenia&quot; and &quot;Chaetoceros&quot;.

Marine cyanobacteria include the smallest known photosynthetic organisms. The smallest of all, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across. In terms of numbers of individuals, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is possibly the most plentiful genus on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater can contain 100,000 cells of this genus or more. Worldwide there are estimated to be several octillion (1027, a billion billion billion) individuals. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is ubiquitous between latitudes 40°N and 40°S, and dominates in the oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) regions of the oceans. The bacterium accounts for about 20% of the oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

== Morphology ==


Cyanobacteria are variable in morphology, ranging from unicellular and filamentous to colonial forms. Filamentous forms exhibit functional cell differentiation such as heterocysts (for nitrogen fixation), akinetes (resting stage cells), and hormogonia (reproductive, motile filaments). These, together with the intercellular connections they possess, are considered the first signs of multicellularity.

Many cyanobacteria form motile filaments of cells, called hormogonia, that travel away from the main biomass to bud and form new colonies elsewhere. The cells in a hormogonium are often thinner than in the vegetative state, and the cells on either end of the motile chain may be tapered. To break away from the parent colony, a hormogonium often must tear apart a weaker cell in a filament, called a necridium.

Some filamentous species can differentiate into several different cell types: 
* Vegetative cells – the normal, photosynthetic cells that are formed under favorable growing conditions
* Akinetes – climate-resistant spores that may form when environmental conditions become harsh 
* Thick-walled heterocysts – which contain the enzyme nitrogenase vital for nitrogen fixation in an anaerobic environment due to its sensitivity to oxygen.

Each individual cell (each single cyanobacterium) typically has a thick, gelatinous cell wall. They lack flagella, but hormogonia of some species can move about by gliding along surfaces. Many of the multicellular filamentous forms of &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; are capable of a waving motion; the filament oscillates back and forth. In water columns, some cyanobacteria float by forming gas vesicles, as in archaea. These vesicles are not organelles as such. They are not bounded by lipid membranes, but by a protein sheath.

== Nitrogen fixation ==
Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen in anaerobic conditions by means of specialized cells called heterocysts. Heterocysts may also form under the appropriate environmental conditions (anoxic) when fixed nitrogen is scarce. Heterocyst-forming species are specialized for nitrogen fixation and are able to fix nitrogen gas into ammonia (), nitrites () or nitrates (), which can be absorbed by plants and converted to protein and nucleic acids (atmospheric nitrogen is not bioavailable to plants, except for those having endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, especially the family Fabaceae, among 
others). Nitrogen fixation commonly occurs on a cycle of nitrogen fixation during the night because photosynthesis can inhibit nitrogen fixation.

Free-living cyanobacteria are present in the water of rice paddies, and cyanobacteria can be found growing as epiphytes on the surfaces of the green alga, &quot;Chara&quot;, where they may fix nitrogen. Cyanobacteria such as &quot;Anabaena&quot; (a symbiont of the aquatic fern &quot;Azolla&quot;) can provide rice plantations with biofertilizer.

== Photosynthesis ==

=== Carbon fixation ===
The thylakoids of cyanobacteria use the energy of sunlight to drive photosynthesis, a process where the energy of light is used to synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Because they are aquatic organisms, they typically employ several strategies which are collectively known as a &quot; concentrating mechanism&quot; to aid in the acquisition of inorganic carbon ( or bicarbonate). Among the more specific strategies is the widespread prevalence of the bacterial microcompartments known as carboxysomes, which co-operate with active transporters of CO2 and bicarbonate, in order to accumulate bicarbonate into the cytoplasm of the cell. Carboxysomes are icosahedral structures composed of hexameric shell proteins that assemble into cage-like structures that can be several hundreds of nanometres in diameter. It is believed that these structures tether the -fixing enzyme, RuBisCO, to the interior of the shell, as well as the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, using metabolic channeling to enhance the local concentrations and thus increase the efficiency of the RuBisCO enzyme.

=== Electron transport ===
In contrast to purple bacteria and other bacteria performing anoxygenic photosynthesis, thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria are not continuous with the plasma membrane but are separate compartments. The photosynthetic machinery is embedded in the thylakoid membranes, with phycobilisomes acting as light-harvesting antennae attached to the membrane, giving the green pigmentation observed (with wavelengths from 450 nm to 660 nm) in most cyanobacteria.

While most of the high-energy electrons derived from water are used by the cyanobacterial cells for their own needs, a fraction of these electrons may be donated to the external environment via electrogenic activity.

==== Respiration ====
Respiration in cyanobacteria can occur in the thylakoid membrane alongside photosynthesis, with their photosynthetic electron transport sharing the same compartment as the components of respiratory electron transport. While the goal of photosynthesis is to store energy by building carbohydrates from CO2, respiration is the reverse of this, with carbohydrates turned back into CO2 accompanying energy release.

Cyanobacteria appear to separate these two processes with their plasma membrane containing only components of the respiratory chain, while the thylakoid membrane hosts an interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chain. Cyanobacteria use electrons from succinate dehydrogenase rather than from NADPH for respiration.

Cyanobacteria only respire during the night (or in the dark) because the facilities used for electron transport are used in reverse for photosynthesis while in the light.

==== Electron transport chain ====
Many cyanobacteria are able to reduce nitrogen and carbon dioxide under aerobic conditions, a fact that may be responsible for their evolutionary and ecological success. The water-oxidizing photosynthesis is accomplished by coupling the activity of photosystem (PS) II and I (Z-scheme). In contrast to green sulfur bacteria which only use one photosystem, the use of water as an electron donor is energetically demanding, requiring two photosystems.

Attached to the thylakoid membrane, phycobilisomes act as light-harvesting antennae for the photosystems. The phycobilisome components (phycobiliproteins) are responsible for the blue-green pigmentation of most cyanobacteria. The variations on this theme are due mainly to carotenoids and phycoerythrins that give the cells their red-brownish coloration. In some cyanobacteria, the color of light influences the composition of the phycobilisomes. In green light, the cells accumulate more phycoerythrin, which absorbs green light, whereas in red light they produce more phycocyanin which absorbs red. Thus, these bacteria can change from brick-red to bright blue-green depending on whether they are exposed to green light or to red light. This process of &quot;complementary chromatic adaptation&quot; is a way for the cells to maximize the use of available light for photosynthesis.

A few genera lack phycobilisomes and have chlorophyll b instead (&quot;Prochloron&quot;, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, &quot;Prochlorothrix&quot;). These were originally grouped together as the prochlorophytes or chloroxybacteria, but appear to have developed in several different lines of cyanobacteria. For this reason, they are now considered as part of the cyanobacterial group.

==== Metabolism ====
In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria.

Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (&quot;Azolla&quot;), angiosperms (&quot;Gunnera&quot;), etc. The carbon metabolism of cyanobacteria include the incomplete Krebs cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis.

There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).
== Ecology ==
Cyanobacteria can be found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic habitat – oceans, fresh water, damp soil, temporarily moistened rocks in deserts, bare rock and soil, and even Antarctic rocks. They can occur as planktonic cells or form phototrophic biofilms. They are found inside stones and shells (in endolithic ecosystems). A few are endosymbionts in lichens, plants, various protists, or sponges and provide energy for the host. Some live in the fur of sloths, providing a form of camouflage.

Aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms that can form in both freshwater and marine environments. The blooms can have the appearance of blue-green paint or scum. These blooms can be toxic, and frequently lead to the closure of recreational waters when spotted. Marine bacteriophages are significant parasites of unicellular marine cyanobacteria.

Cyanobacterial growth is favoured in ponds and lakes where waters are calm and have little turbulent mixing. Their lifecycles are disrupted when the water naturally or artificially mixes from churning currents caused by the flowing water of streams or the churning water of fountains. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favoured at higher temperatures which enable &quot;Microcystis&quot; species to outcompete diatoms and green algae, and potentially allow development of toxins.

Based on environmental trends, models and observations suggest cyanobacteria will likely increase their dominance in aquatic environments. This can lead to serious consequences, particularly the contamination of sources of drinking water. Researchers including Linda Lawton at Robert Gordon University, have developed techniques to study these. Cyanobacteria can interfere with water treatment in various ways, primarily by plugging filters (often large beds of sand and similar media) and by producing cyanotoxins, which have the potential to cause serious illness if consumed. Consequences may also lie within fisheries and waste management practices. Anthropogenic eutrophication, rising temperatures, vertical stratification and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide are contributors to cyanobacteria increasing dominance of aquatic ecosystems.

Cyanobacteria have been found to play an important role in terrestrial habitats and organism communities. It has been widely reported that cyanobacteria soil crusts help to stabilize soil to prevent erosion and retain water. An example of a cyanobacterial species that does so is &quot;Microcoleus vaginatus&quot;. &quot;M. vaginatus&quot; stabilizes soil using a polysaccharide sheath that binds to sand particles and absorbs water. &quot;M. vaginatus&quot; also makes a significant contribution to the cohesion of biological soil crust.

Some of these organisms contribute significantly to global ecology and the oxygen cycle. The tiny marine cyanobacterium &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; was discovered in 1986 and accounts for more than half of the photosynthesis of the open ocean. Circadian rhythms were once thought to only exist in eukaryotic cells but many cyanobacteria display a bacterial circadian rhythm.

&quot;Cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful group of microorganisms on earth. They are the most genetically diverse; they occupy a broad range of habitats across all latitudes, widespread in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems, and they are found in the most extreme niches such as hot springs, salt works, and hypersaline bays. Photoautotrophic, oxygen-producing cyanobacteria created the conditions in the planet&#x27;s early atmosphere that directed the evolution of aerobic metabolism and eukaryotic photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria fulfill vital ecological functions in the world&#x27;s oceans, being important contributors to global carbon and nitrogen budgets.&quot; – Stewart and Falconer
=== Cyanobionts ===

Some cyanobacteria, the so-called cyanobionts (cyanobacterial symbionts), have a symbiotic relationship with other organisms, both unicellular and multicellular. As illustrated on the right, there are many examples of cyanobacteria interacting symbiotically with land plants. Cyanobacteria can enter the plant through the stomata and colonize the intercellular space, forming loops and intracellular coils. &quot;Anabaena&quot; spp. colonize the roots of wheat and cotton plants. &quot;Calothrix&quot; sp. has also been found on the root system of wheat. Monocots, such as wheat and rice, have been colonised by &quot;Nostoc&quot; spp., In 1991, Ganther and others isolated diverse heterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, including &quot;Nostoc&quot;, &quot;Anabaena&quot; and &quot;Cylindrospermum&quot;, from plant root and soil. Assessment of wheat seedling roots revealed two types of association patterns: loose colonization of root hair by &quot;Anabaena&quot; and tight colonization of the root surface within a restricted zone by &quot;Nostoc&quot;.



The relationships between cyanobionts (cyanobacterial symbionts) and protistan hosts are particularly noteworthy, as some nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (diazotrophs) play an important role in primary production, especially in nitrogen-limited oligotrophic oceans. Cyanobacteria, mostly pico-sized &quot;Synechococcus&quot; and &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, are ubiquitously distributed and are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth, accounting for a quarter of all carbon fixed in marine ecosystems. In contrast to free-living marine cyanobacteria, some cyanobionts are known to be responsible for nitrogen fixation rather than carbon fixation in the host. However, the physiological functions of most cyanobionts remain unknown. Cyanobionts have been found in numerous protist groups, including dinoflagellates, tintinnids, radiolarians, amoebae, diatoms, and haptophytes. Among these cyanobionts, little is known regarding the nature (e.g., genetic diversity, host or cyanobiont specificity, and cyanobiont seasonality) of the symbiosis involved, particularly in relation to dinoflagellate host.

=== Collective behaviour ===


Some cyanobacteria – even single-celled ones – show striking collective behaviours and form colonies (or blooms) that can float on water and have important ecological roles. For instance, billions of years ago, communities of marine Paleoproterozoic cyanobacteria could have helped create the biosphere as we know it by burying carbon compounds and allowing the initial build-up of oxygen in the atmosphere. On the other hand, toxic cyanobacterial blooms are an increasing issue for society, as their toxins can be harmful to animals. Extreme blooms can also deplete water of oxygen and reduce the penetration of sunlight and visibility, thereby compromising the feeding and mating behaviour of light-reliant species.

As shown in the diagram on the right, bacteria can stay in suspension as individual cells, adhere collectively to surfaces to form biofilms, passively sediment, or flocculate to form suspended aggregates. Cyanobacteria are able to produce sulphated polysaccharides (yellow haze surrounding clumps of cells) that enable them to form floating aggregates. In 2021, Maeda et al. discovered that oxygen produced by cyanobacteria becomes trapped in the network of polysaccharides and cells, enabling the microorganisms to form buoyant blooms. It is thought that specific protein fibres known as pili (represented as lines radiating from the cells) may act as an additional way to link cells to each other or onto surfaces. Some cyanobacteria also use sophisticated intracellular gas vesicles as floatation aids.



The diagram on the left above shows a proposed model of microbial distribution, spatial organization, carbon and O2 cycling in clumps and adjacent areas. (a) Clumps contain denser cyanobacterial filaments and heterotrophic microbes. The initial differences in density depend on cyanobacterial motility and can be established over short timescales. Darker blue color outside of the clump indicates higher oxygen concentrations in areas adjacent to clumps. Oxic media increase the reversal frequencies of any filaments that begin to leave the clumps, thereby reducing the net migration away from the clump. This enables the persistence of the initial clumps over short timescales; (b) Spatial coupling between photosynthesis and respiration in clumps. Oxygen produced by cyanobacteria diffuses into the overlying medium or is used for aerobic respiration. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) diffuses into the clump from the overlying medium and is also produced within the clump by respiration. In oxic solutions, high O2 concentrations reduce the efficiency of CO2 fixation and result in the excretion of glycolate. Under these conditions, clumping can be beneficial to cyanobacteria if it stimulates the retention of carbon and the assimilation of inorganic carbon by cyanobacteria within clumps. This effect appears to promote the accumulation of particulate organic carbon (cells, sheaths and heterotrophic organisms) in clumps.

It has been unclear why and how cyanobacteria form communities. Aggregation must divert resources away from the core business of making more cyanobacteria, as it generally involves the production of copious quantities of extracellular material. In addition, cells in the centre of dense aggregates can also suffer from both shading and shortage of nutrients. So, what advantage does this communal life bring for cyanobacteria?

New insights into how cyanobacteria form blooms have come from a 2021 study on the cyanobacterium &quot;Synechocystis&quot;. These use a set of genes that regulate the production and export of sulphated polysaccharides, chains of sugar molecules modified with sulphate groups that can often be found in marine algae and animal tissue. Many bacteria generate extracellular polysaccharides, but sulphated ones have only been seen in cyanobacteria. In &quot;Synechocystis&quot; these sulphated polysaccharide help the cyanobacterium form buoyant aggregates by trapping oxygen bubbles in the slimy web of cells and polysaccharides.

Previous studies on &quot;Synechocystis&quot; have shown type IV pili, which decorate the surface of cyanobacteria, also play a role in forming blooms. These retractable and adhesive protein fibres are important for motility, adhesion to substrates and DNA uptake. The formation of blooms may require both type IV pili and Synechan – for example, the pili may help to export the polysaccharide outside the cell. Indeed, the activity of these protein fibres may be connected to the production of extracellular polysaccharides in filamentous cyanobacteria. A more obvious answer would be that pili help to build the aggregates by binding the cells with each other or with the extracellular polysaccharide. As with other kinds of bacteria, certain components of the pili may allow cyanobacteria from the same species to recognise each other and make initial contacts, which are then stabilised by building a mass of extracellular polysaccharide.

The bubble flotation mechanism identified by Maeda et al. joins a range of known strategies that enable cyanobacteria to control their buoyancy, such as using gas vesicles or accumulating carbohydrate ballasts. Type IV pili on their own could also control the position of marine cyanobacteria in the water column by regulating viscous drag. Extracellular polysaccharide appears to be a multipurpose asset for cyanobacteria, from floatation device to food storage, defence mechanism and mobility aid.

=== Cellular death ===

One of the most critical processes determining cyanobacterial eco-physiology is cellular death. Evidence supports the existence of controlled cellular demise in cyanobacteria, and various forms of cell death have been described as a response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, cell death research in cyanobacteria is a relatively young field and understanding of the underlying mechanisms and molecular machinery underpinning this fundamental process remains largely elusive. However, reports on cell death of marine and freshwater cyanobacteria indicate this process has major implications for the ecology of microbial communities/ Different forms of cell demise have been observed in cyanobacteria under several stressful conditions, and cell death has been suggested to play a key role in developmental processes, such as akinete and heterocyst differentiation, as well as strategy for population survival.

=== Cyanophages ===

Cyanophages are viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages can be found in both freshwater and marine environments. Marine and freshwater cyanophages have icosahedral heads, which contain double-stranded DNA, attached to a tail by connector proteins. The size of the head and tail vary among species of cyanophages. 
Cyanophages, like other bacteriophages, rely on Brownian motion to collide with bacteria, and then use receptor binding proteins to recognize cell surface proteins, which leads to adherence. Viruses with contractile tails then rely on receptors found on their tails to recognize highly conserved proteins on the surface of the host cell.

Cyanophages infect a wide range of cyanobacteria and are key regulators of the cyanobacterial populations in aquatic environments, and may aid in the prevention of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater and marine ecosystems. These blooms can pose a danger to humans and other animals, particularly in eutrophic freshwater lakes. Infection by these viruses is highly prevalent in cells belonging to &quot;Synechococcus&quot; spp. in marine environments, where up to 5% of cells belonging to marine cyanobacterial cells have been reported to contain mature phage particles.

The first cyanophage, LPP-1, was discovered in 1963. Cyanophages are classified within the bacteriophage families &quot;Myoviridae&quot; (e.g. AS-1, N-1), &quot;Podoviridae&quot; (e.g. LPP-1) and &quot;Siphoviridae&quot; (e.g. S-1).

== Movement ==

It has long been known that filamentous cyanobacteria perform surface motions, and that these movements result from type IV pili. Additionally, &quot;Synechococcus&quot;, a marine cyanobacteria, is known to swim at a speed of 25 μm/s by a mechanism different to that of bacterial flagella. Formation of waves on the cyanobacteria surface is thought to push surrounding water backwards. Cells are known to be motile by a gliding method and a novel uncharacterized, non-phototactic swimming method that does not involve flagellar motion.

Many species of cyanobacteria are capable of gliding. Gliding is a form of cell movement that differs from crawling or swimming in that it does not rely on any obvious external organ or change in cell shape and it occurs only in the presence of a substrate. Gliding in filamentous cyanobacteria appears to be powered by a &quot;slime jet&quot; mechanism, in which the cells extrude a gel that expands quickly as it hydrates providing a propulsion force, although some unicellular cyanobacteria use type IV pili for gliding.

Cyanobacteria have strict light requirements. Too little light can result in insufficient energy production, and in some species may cause the cells to resort to heterotrophic respiration. Too much light can inhibit the cells, decrease photosynthesis efficiency and cause damage by bleaching. UV radiation is especially deadly for cyanobacteria, with normal solar levels being significantly detrimental for these microorganisms in some cases.

Filamentous cyanobacteria that live in microbial mats often migrate vertically and horizontally within the mat in order to find an optimal niche that balances their light requirements for photosynthesis against their sensitivity to photodamage. For example, the filamentous cyanobacteria &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; sp. and &quot;Spirulina subsalsa&quot; found in the hypersaline benthic mats of Guerrero Negro, Mexico migrate downwards into the lower layers during the day in order to escape the intense sunlight and then rise to the surface at dusk. In contrast, the population of &quot;Microcoleus chthonoplastes&quot; found in hypersaline mats in Camargue, France migrate to the upper layer of the mat during the day and are spread homogeneously through the mat at night. An in vitro experiment using &quot;Phormidium uncinatum&quot; also demonstrated this species&#x27; tendency to migrate in order to avoid damaging radiation. These migrations are usually the result of some sort of photomovement, although other forms of taxis can also play a role.

Photomovement – the modulation of cell movement as a function of the incident light – is employed by the cyanobacteria as a means to find optimal light conditions in their environment. There are three types of photomovement: photokinesis, phototaxis and photophobic responses.

Photokinetic microorganisms modulate their gliding speed according to the incident light intensity. For example, the speed with which &quot;Phormidium autumnale&quot; glides increases linearly with the incident light intensity.

Phototactic microorganisms move according to the direction of the light within the environment, such that positively phototactic species will tend to move roughly parallel to the light and towards the light source. Species such as &quot;Phormidium uncinatum&quot; cannot steer directly towards the light, but rely on random collisions to orient themselves in the right direction, after which they tend to move more towards the light source. Others, such as &quot;Anabaena variabilis&quot;, can steer by bending the trichome.

Finally, photophobic microorganisms respond to spatial and temporal light gradients. A step-up photophobic reaction occurs when an organism enters a brighter area field from a darker one and then reverses direction, thus avoiding the bright light. The opposite reaction, called a step-down reaction, occurs when an organism enters a dark area from a bright area and then reverses direction, thus remaining in the light.

== Evolution ==

=== Earth history ===

Stromatolites are layered biochemical accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilms (microbial mats) of microorganisms, especially cyanobacteria.

Cyanobacteria likely first evolved in a freshwater environment. During the Precambrian, stromatolite communities of microorganisms grew in most marine and non-marine environments in the photic zone. After the Cambrian explosion of marine animals, grazing on the stromatolite mats by herbivores greatly reduced the occurrence of the stromatolites in marine environments. Since then, they are found mostly in hypersaline conditions where grazing invertebrates cannot live (e.g. Shark Bay, Western Australia). Stromatolites provide ancient records of life on Earth by fossil remains which date from 3.5 Ga ago. The oldest undisputed evidence of cyanobacteria is dated to be 2.1 Ga ago, but there is some evidence for them as far back as 2.7 Ga ago. Cyanobacteria might have also emerged 3.5 Ga ago. Oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere remained around or below 0.001% of today&#x27;s level until 2.4 Ga ago (the Great Oxygenation Event). The rise in oxygen may have caused a fall in the concentration of atmospheric methane, and triggered the Huronian glaciation from around 2.4 to 2.1 Ga ago. In this way, cyanobacteria may have killed off most of the other bacteria of the time.

Oncolites are sedimentary structures composed of oncoids, which are layered structures formed by cyanobacterial growth. Oncolites are similar to stromatolites, but instead of forming columns, they form approximately spherical structures that were not attached to the underlying substrate as they formed. The oncoids often form around a central nucleus, such as a shell fragment, and a calcium carbonate structure is deposited by encrusting microbes. Oncolites are indicators of warm waters in the photic zone, but are also known in contemporary freshwater environments. These structures rarely exceed 10 cm in diameter.

One former classification scheme of cyanobacterial fossils divided them into the porostromata and the spongiostromata. These are now recognized as form taxa and considered taxonomically obsolete; however, some authors have advocated for the terms remaining informally to describe form and structure of bacterial fossils.

=== Origin of photosynthesis ===
Oxygenic photosynthesis only evolved once (in prokaryotic cyanobacteria), and all photosynthetic eukaryotes (including all plants and algae) have acquired this ability from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria or their endosymbiont hosts. In other words, all the oxygen that makes the atmosphere breathable for aerobic organisms originally comes from cyanobacteria or their plastid descendants.

Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers throughout the latter half of the Archean eon and most of the Proterozoic eon, in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. However, their population is argued to have varied considerably across this eon. Archaeplastids such as green and red algae eventually surpassed cyanobacteria as major primary producers on continental shelves near the end of the Neoproterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–65 Ma) radiations of secondary photoautotrophs such as dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.

=== Origin of chloroplasts ===
Primary chloroplasts are cell organelles found in some eukaryotic lineages, where they are specialized in performing photosynthesis. They are considered to have evolved from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. After some years of debate, it is now generally accepted that the three major groups of primary endosymbiotic eukaryotes (i.e. green plants, red algae and glaucophytes) form one large monophyletic group called Archaeplastida, which evolved after one unique endosymbiotic event.

The morphological similarity between chloroplasts and cyanobacteria was first reported by German botanist Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper in the 19th century Chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae, thus paving the way for Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski to suggest in 1905 the symbiogenic origin of the plastid. Lynn Margulis brought this hypothesis back to attention more than 60 years later but the idea did not become fully accepted until supplementary data started to accumulate. The cyanobacterial origin of plastids is now supported by various pieces of phylogenetic, genomic, biochemical and structural evidence. The description of another independent and more recent primary endosymbiosis event between a cyanobacterium and a separate eukaryote lineage (the rhizarian &quot;Paulinella chromatophora&quot;) also gives credibility to the endosymbiotic origin of the plastids.
In addition to this primary endosymbiosis, many eukaryotic lineages have been subject to secondary or even tertiary endosymbiotic events, that is the &quot;Matryoshka-like&quot; engulfment by a eukaryote of another plastid-bearing eukaryote.

Chloroplasts have many similarities with cyanobacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosomes, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts still possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those in cyanobacteria. DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR hypothesis proposes this co-location is required for redox regulation.

=== Origin of marine planktonic cyanobacteria ===


Cyanobacteria have fundamentally transformed the geochemistry of the planet. Multiple lines of geochemical evidence support the occurrence of intervals of profound global environmental change at the beginning and end of the Proterozoic (2,500–542 Mya).
 While it is widely accepted that the presence of molecular oxygen in the early fossil record was the result of cyanobacteria activity, little is known about how cyanobacteria evolution (e.g., habitat preference) may have contributed to changes in biogeochemical cycles through Earth history. Geochemical evidence has indicated that there was a first step-increase in the oxygenation of the Earth&#x27;s surface, which is known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), in the early Paleoproterozoic (2,500–1,600 Mya). A second but much steeper increase in oxygen levels, known as the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE), occurred at around 800 to 500 Mya. Recent chromium isotope data point to low levels of atmospheric oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s surface during the mid-Proterozoic, which is consistent with the late evolution of marine planktonic cyanobacteria during the Cryogenian; both types of evidence help explain the late emergence and diversification of animals.

Understanding the evolution of planktonic cyanobacteria is important because their origin fundamentally transformed the nitrogen and carbon cycles towards the end of the Pre-Cambrian. It remains unclear, however, what evolutionary events led to the emergence of open-ocean planktonic forms within cyanobacteria and how these events relate to geochemical evidence during the Pre-Cambrian. So far, it seems that ocean geochemistry (e.g., euxinic conditions during the early- to mid-Proterozoic) and nutrient availability likely contributed to the apparent delay in diversification and widespread colonization of open ocean environments by planktonic cyanobacteria during the Neoproterozoic.
== Genetics ==
Cyanobacteria are capable of natural genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation is the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the direct uptake and incorporation of exogenous DNA from its surroundings. For bacterial transformation to take place, the recipient bacteria must be in a state of competence, which may occur in nature as a response to conditions such as starvation, high cell density or exposure to DNA damaging agents. In chromosomal transformation, homologous transforming DNA can be integrated into the recipient genome by homologous recombination, and this process appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage.

=== DNA repair ===
Cyanobacteria are challenged by environmental stresses and internally generated reactive oxygen species that cause DNA damage. Cyanobacteria possess numerous &quot;E. coli&quot;-like DNA repair genes. Several DNA repair genes are highly conserved in cyanobacteria, even in small genomes, suggesting that core DNA repair processes such as recombinational repair, nucleotide excision repair and methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair are common among cyanobacteria.

== Classification ==
=== Phylogeny ===
=== Taxonomy ===
Historically, bacteria were first classified as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, which along with the Schizophyceae (blue-green algae/Cyanobacteria) formed the phylum Schizophyta, then in the phylum Monera in the kingdom Protista by Haeckel in 1866, comprising &quot;Protogens, Protamaeba, Vampyrella, Protomonae&quot;, and &quot;Vibrio&quot;, but not &quot;Nostoc&quot; and other cyanobacteria, which were classified with algae, later reclassified as the &quot;Prokaryotes&quot; by Chatton.

The cyanobacteria were traditionally classified by morphology into five sections, referred to by the numerals I–V. The first three – Chroococcales, Pleurocapsales, and Oscillatoriales – are not supported by phylogenetic studies. The latter two – Nostocales and Stigonematales – are monophyletic as a unit, and make up the heterocystous cyanobacteria.

The members of Chroococales are unicellular and usually aggregate in colonies. The classic taxonomic criterion has been the cell morphology and the plane of cell division. In Pleurocapsales, the cells have the ability to form internal spores (baeocytes). The rest of the sections include filamentous species. In Oscillatoriales, the cells are uniseriately arranged and do not form specialized cells (akinetes and heterocysts). In Nostocales and Stigonematales, the cells have the ability to develop heterocysts in certain conditions. Stigonematales, unlike Nostocales, include species with truly branched trichomes.

Most taxa included in the phylum or division Cyanobacteria have not yet been validly published under &quot;The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes&quot; (ICNP) and are instead validly published under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. These exceptions are validly published under ICNP:
*The families Prochloraceae and Prochlorotrichaceae
*The genera &quot;Halospirulina, Planktothricoides, Prochlorococcus, Prochloron&quot;, and &quot;Prochlorothrix&quot;

Formerly, some bacteria, like &quot;Beggiatoa&quot;, were thought to be colorless Cyanobacteria.

The currently accepted taxonomy as of 2025 is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

=== Biotechnology ===

The unicellular cyanobacterium &quot;Synechocystis&quot; sp. PCC6803 was the third prokaryote and first photosynthetic organism whose genome was completely sequenced. It continues to be an important model organism. &quot;Crocosphaera subtropica&quot; ATCC 51142 is an important diazotrophic model organism. The smallest genomes of a photosynthetic organism have been found in &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; spp. (1.7 Mb) and the largest in &quot;Nostoc punctiforme&quot; (9 Mb). Those of &quot;Calothrix&quot; spp. are estimated at 12–15 Mb, as large as yeast.

Recent research has suggested the potential application of cyanobacteria to the generation of renewable energy by directly converting sunlight into electricity. Internal photosynthetic pathways can be coupled to chemical mediators that transfer electrons to external electrodes. In the shorter term, efforts are underway to commercialize algae-based fuels such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. Cyanobacteria have been also engineered to produce ethanol and experiments have shown that when one or two CBB genes are being over expressed, the yield can be even higher.

Cyanobacteria may possess the ability to produce substances that could one day serve as anti-inflammatory agents and combat bacterial infections in humans. Cyanobacteria&#x27;s photosynthetic output of sugar and oxygen has been demonstrated to have therapeutic value in rats with heart attacks. While cyanobacteria can naturally produce various secondary metabolites, they can serve as advantageous hosts for plant-derived metabolites production owing to biotechnological advances in systems biology and synthetic biology.

Spirulina&#x27;s extracted blue color is used as a natural food coloring.

Researchers from several space agencies argue that cyanobacteria could be used for producing goods for human consumption in future crewed outposts on Mars, by transforming materials available on this planet.

=== Human nutrition ===

Some cyanobacteria are sold as food, notably &quot;Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina), Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Klamath Lake AFA)&quot;, and others.

Some microalgae contain substances of high biological value, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, pigments, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Edible blue-green algae reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-κB pathway in macrophages and splenocytes. Sulfate polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and even antiviral activity against HIV, herpes, and hepatitis.

=== Health risks ===

Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins.

Specific toxins include anatoxin-a, guanitoxin, aplysiatoxin, cyanopeptolin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, nodularin R (from &quot;Nodularia&quot;), neosaxitoxin, and saxitoxin. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks, and research by Linda Lawton, FRSE at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen and collaborators has 30 years of examining the phenomenon and methods of improving water safety.

Recent studies suggest that significant exposure to high levels of cyanobacteria producing toxins such as BMAA can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). People living within half a mile of cyanobacterially contaminated lakes have had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing ALS than the rest of the population; people around New Hampshire&#x27;s Lake Mascoma had an up to 25 times greater risk of ALS than the expected incidence. BMAA from desert crusts found throughout Qatar might have contributed to higher rates of ALS in Gulf War veterans.

=== Chemical control ===
Several chemicals can eliminate cyanobacterial blooms from smaller water-based systems such as swimming pools. They include calcium hypochlorite, copper sulphate, Cupricide (chelated copper), and simazine. The calcium hypochlorite amount needed varies depending on the cyanobacteria bloom, and treatment is needed periodically. According to the Department of Agriculture Australia, a rate of 12 g of 70% material in 1000 L of water is often effective to treat a bloom. Copper sulfate is also used commonly, but no longer recommended by the Australian Department of Agriculture, as it kills livestock, crustaceans, and fish. Cupricide is a chelated copper product that eliminates blooms with lower toxicity risks than copper sulfate. Dosage recommendations vary from 190 mL to 4.8 L per 1000 m2. Ferric alum treatments at the rate of 50 mg/L will reduce algae blooms. Simazine, which is also a herbicide, will continue to kill blooms for several days after an application. Simazine is marketed at different strengths (25, 50, and 90%), the recommended amount needed for one cubic meter of water per product is 25% product 8 mL; 50% product 4 mL; or 90% product 2.2 mL.

=== Climate change ===
Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea.

Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development.

The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus &quot;Microcystis&quot; to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments. &quot;Microcystis&quot; spp. take up CO2 and and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms.

<text>Ghost is a 1990 American supernatural romance film directed by Jerry Zucker, written by Bruce Joel Rubin, and starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, Tony Goldwyn, Vincent Schiavelli, and Rick Aviles. It focuses on Sam Wheat (Swayze), a murdered banker, whose ghost sets out to save his girlfriend, Molly Jensen (Moore), from the person who killed him – through the help of the psychic Oda Mae Brown (Goldberg).

&quot;Ghost&quot; was theatrically released on July 13, 1990, to commercial success, grossing $505 million against a budget of $22–23 million and emerging as the highest-grossing film of 1990 and at the time of its release, was the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The film was a sleeper hit, which unexpectedly outperformed several blockbuster action films released during that summer. Its success extended to the home video market, and it was the most rented film of 1991 in the United States. The film initially received mixed reviews from critics, with praise going towards the score and performances of the cast. 

&quot;Ghost&quot; earned five nominations at the 63rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, and winning Best Supporting Actress for Goldberg and Best Original Screenplay for Rubin.

==Plot==
Banker Sam Wheat and his artist girlfriend Molly Jensen move into a Manhattan loft with the help of Sam&#x27;s best friend and co-worker Carl Bruner. One night, the couple are attacked on the street by a mugger, and though Sam appears to chase him away, he returns to a devastated Molly cradling his bloodied corpse and realizes he has died. A bright beam of light shines down on Sam, but he stays with Molly and the light disappears.

As a ghost, a despondent Sam remains by Molly&#x27;s side, but is unable to interact with the physical world, and other ghosts he encounters are unhelpful. Sometime later, the mugger breaks into their apartment. Molly returns unexpectedly and Sam scares her cat, which can see him, causing it to attack the mugger, who flees. While pursuing the mugger, Sam is attacked by a violent ghost on the subway train who can touch physical objects. Sam follows the mugger back to his apartment, learning his name, Willie Lopez, and that Sam was deliberately targeted.

Sam later encounters Oda Mae Brown, a charlatan psychic medium, but he realizes she can hear him and demands she help him warn Molly. Though reluctant to help, Oda Mae agrees after Sam keeps her awake with his singing. Despite her intimate knowledge of Sam&#x27;s and Molly&#x27;s relationship, Oda Mae struggles to convince Molly the afterlife is real until Sam has Oda Mae say &quot;ditto&quot;, his response whenever Molly said she loved him. Molly tells the police and Carl about Willie, but the police dismiss the story and disclose Oda Mae&#x27;s extensive history of fraud, leaving Molly disheartened.

Meanwhile, Sam follows Carl and learns that he hired Willie to rob Sam of his book of bank passwords. Carl needs the passwords to launder $4million in drug money through an account held by the fictional &quot;Rita Miller&quot; for his criminal employers. He breaks into Molly&#x27;s apartment, takes the book, and later attempts to seduce her until an enraged Sam inadvertently knocks over a picture frame. Sam returns to the subway and convinces the violent ghost to teach him to focus his emotions and reliably interact with the physical world.

Sam visits Oda Mae, who has become popular with ghosts trying to contact the living, and convinces her to pose as Rita Miller to withdraw the drug money, which she reluctantly donates to charity; Molly witnesses the transaction while visiting the bank. As Carl panics over the missing money and death threats from its owners, Sam uses his abilities to torment him. Carl visits Molly to discuss the haunting and she unwittingly reveals Oda Mae withdrew the money. While Molly is upstairs, Sam attacks Carl until he threatens to murder Molly if the money is not returned that night. Carl and Willie travel to confront Oda Mae, but Sam warns her to hide before terrorizing Willie, causing him to run into a road and be struck by a car. Shadowy figures appear and drag Willie&#x27;s screaming ghost away.

Oda Mae and Sam return to Molly&#x27;s apartment, where he levitates a penny to convince her he is truly present. After Molly calls the police to report Carl, Oda Mae allows Sam to possess her so he can dance with Molly. However, the possession leaves him weakened and unable to help when Carl breaks into the apartment. Carl takes Molly hostage and demands the money but Sam recovers in time to attack him. In a panic, Carl swings a suspended metal hook towards Sam and tries to escape through a window, but the hook swings back and shatters the window pane, causing a large shard of glass to impale and kill him. Sam watches as the shadowy figures drag Carl away.

As Sam checks on Molly and Oda Mae, the beam of light returns, allowing them both to see and hear him. Sam thanks Oda Mae for all her help and shares a kiss with Molly, telling her he loves her. She responds, &quot;ditto&quot;, before Sam walks into the light.

==Production==
===Background and filming===

&quot;Ghost&quot; was the first film Jerry Zucker directed on his own, as well as his first dramatic film. He had previously been part of the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker directing team, known for their parody films. Zucker stated that his decision to direct &quot;Ghost&quot; was not made to distance himself from comedies or to mark a new chapter in his career, but he was merely &quot;just looking for a good film to direct.&quot; When screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin learned that Zucker was to direct the film and wanted to make changes to his script, he was apprehensive, as he wanted Miloš Forman or Stanley Kubrick to direct and feared Zucker would turn his script into a comedy. However, Rubin changed his mind and warmed up after dining with Zucker and being impressed by how &quot;deeply philosophical&quot; he was.

Harrison Ford, Michael J. Fox, Paul Hogan, Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Kline, Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise were considered for the role of Sam Wheat. Bruce Willis turned the role of Sam Wheat down as he did not understand the script and later called himself a &quot;knucklehead&quot; for declining. Similarly, Fox thought the film wouldn&#x27;t work, and, in hindsight, regretted turning the role down. Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman were considered for the role of Molly Jensen. Tina Turner, Patti LaBelle, and Oprah Winfrey were either considered or auditioned for the role of Oda Mae Brown. Zucker initially was not interested in casting Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae, but Swayze advocated for her to be cast.

Zucker credited arguments from radio host Dennis Prager with deciding to &quot;lighten&quot; Rubin&#x27;s original script with a moral message. Rubin noted that he &quot;wanted to tell a ghost story from the ghost&#x27;s perspective&quot;: &quot;One day, I was watching a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which begins with the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father saying, ‘Revenge my death,’&quot; he recalled. &quot;I thought, ‘Wow, let&#x27;s transpose that into the 20th century; it&#x27;d be an interesting story.’ And the idea hit me.&quot;

Filming for &quot;Ghost&quot; began shooting in July 1989. Many of the interior scenes were shot at Paramount in Los Angeles. The interior of Sam and Molly&#x27;s loft is a reproduction of the home and studio of artist Michele Oka Doner, built from plans she provided because she declined to allow filming in her loft. It was reconstructed in an unused loft nearby in her Soho neighborhood and featured many of the same details as the actual loft, such as radiators around columns, open stairs and a house-shaped enclosure for the refrigerator. Filming of the apartment took place at 102 Prince Street, lower Manhattan. The exterior scenes were shot in New York City, particularly in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Soho, and Wall Street, for about five weeks. The film features about 100 special effects shots.
Demi Moore&#x27;s famous &#x27;boy cut&#x27; in the movie was designed by Manhattan hair stylist John Sahag; &quot;Us Weekly&quot; declared Moore &quot;the only woman since Audrey Hepburn who has been able to carry off such a hairdo and still look like a woman.&quot;

The final scene used digital video effects. Originally it was meant to show Patrick Swayze kissing Demi Moore before walking up a mylar platform toward a bluescreen with grips in the shot. VFX supervisor Richard Edlund didn&#x27;t think the audience would buy it, and used Quantel’s “Harry” video-compositing system to combine the workprint with Swayze with elements that had been shot on an Oxberry animation stand and things like an endoscope of Christmas tinsel.

=== Music ===

The music for &quot;Ghost&quot; was written by veteran French composer Maurice Jarre, whose work was nominated for the 1990 Academy Award for Best Original Score (won by John Barry for &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;). The soundtrack also featured the 1955 song &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, composed by Alex North with lyrics by Hy Zaret. In &quot;Ghost&quot;, the song appears both in instrumental and vocal form, the latter being the version recorded by Bobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers in 1965.

The soundtrack album was issued worldwide on Milan Records, but licensed to Varèse Sarabande in North America. It was reissued with two extra tracks in 1995, and later as part of Milan&#x27;s &quot;Silver Screen Edition&quot; series with the extra tracks and an interview with Maurice Jarre.

==Release==
Ghost was originally scheduled to be released on July 27, 1990, but its release date was brought forward two weeks early to July 13, 1990. The film became an unexpected box-office success, grossing $505.7 million on a budget of between $22–23 million. The film debuted at number 2 behind &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; during its first weekend, before topping the box office during its second weekend. 
The film would routinely hold the number 2 and number 1 box office spots for two months, and would also remain in the top five until November 1990.

It was the highest-grossing film of the year 1990. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 51.46 million tickets in the US. It spent eight consecutive weeks at number one at the UK box office and became the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK surpassing &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; with a gross of £23.3 million. That record would last for three years before getting surpassed by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in 1993. It also spent six consecutive weeks atop the Australian box office. It was also the highest-grossing film in Indonesia at the time with a gross of $3.6 million and the highest-grossing foreign film in the Philippines. Together with &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, the film would also saw then-married couple Demi Moore, who starred in &quot;Ghost&quot;, and Bruce Willis, who starred in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, have two respective films which they starred in occupy the number 1 and number 2 spots at the box office, a feat which would not be accomplished again for such couples until 2024.

The film was released on video and LaserDisc in the United States on March 21, 1991, and sold a record 646,000 videos for rental, breaking the record set by &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, and a record 66,040 LaserDiscs. It was the top video rental of 1991 in the United States, and generated a gross of $40 million for Paramount. The video went on sale in the fall and generated sales of $25 million.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Ghost&quot; has an approval rating of based on professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Ghost&quot; offers viewers a poignant romance while blending elements of comedy, horror, and mystery, all adding up to one of the more enduringly watchable hits of its era.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned &quot;Ghost&quot; a score of 52 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Ghost&quot; two-and-a-half out of four stars in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, regarding the film as &quot;no worse an offender than most ghost movies, I suppose. It assumes that even after death we devote most of our attention to unfinished business here on Earth, and that danger to a loved one is more important to a ghost than the infinity it now inhabits.&quot; He was also critical of the film&#x27;s &quot;obligatory action climax&quot;, the &quot;ridiculous visitation from the demons of hell&quot;, the &quot;slow study&quot; of the Molly character, and the &quot;single best scene&quot; in which Sam overtakes Oda Mae&#x27;s body to caress Molly: &quot;In strict logic, this should involve us seeing Goldberg kissing Moore, but of course the movie compromises and shows us Swayze holding her - too bad, because the logical version would actually have been more spiritual and moving.&quot;

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, despite finding the ending too sentimental, praised the film as &quot;a zippy pastiche that somehow manages to seem fresh even though it&#x27;s built entirely out of borrowed parts.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called the film &quot;an odd creation – at times nearly smothering in arty somberness, at others veering into good, wacky fun.&quot; Goldberg received considerable praise for her performance. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin comments &quot;Ms. Goldberg plays the character&#x27;s amazement, irritation and great gift for back talk to the hilt. This is one of those rare occasions on which the uncategorizable Ms. Goldberg has found a film role that really suits her, and she makes the most of it.&quot; Even some critics who gave negative reviews of &quot;Ghost&quot; extended praise to Goldberg&#x27;s work in the film.

===Accolades===
* In 2002, the film ranked #96 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions.

==Legacy==
The pottery wheel scene became widely known, and has been cited as &quot;one of the most iconic moments of &#x27;90s cinema.&quot; It has also been parodied frequently, such as in &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; (of which Jerry Zucker served as an executive producer; it was directed by his brother David Zucker), the short British animated film &quot;Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot; and US TV series &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

The film inspired a musical stage version, &quot;Ghost: The Musical&quot;. The show had its world premiere in Manchester, UK, in March 2011 before transferring to London from June 2011 and having its premiere on July 19, 2011. On November 13, 2010, Paramount and Shochiku released a Japanese remake of &quot;Ghost&quot;, titled . The remake stars Nanako Matsushima, South Korean actor Song Seung-heon, and veteran actress Kirin Kiki. In this film, the ghost is a woman, played by Matsushima.

On January 17, 2023, it was revealed by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that Channing Tatum and his company, Free Association, acquired the rights to the film from Paramount. Tatum announced plans to produce, and star in, a remake of the film, with himself cast in Swayze&#x27;s role.

The 2023 BET+ original film &quot;The Reading&quot; pays tribute with an Easter egg, naming a minor character &quot;Oda M. Brown&quot;.
