==History==
Shadyside had its start in 1879 when the railroad was extended to that point. The town site was platted in 1901. The village was named after a local tree-lined farm.

On the evening of June 14, 1990, three to six inches (76 mm) of rain fell in less than two hours, in the ridges to the west, creating a flash flood in the Shadyside area which caused twenty-six fatalities and destroyed or damaged many buildings. Flooding occurred along Pipe Creek, Wegee Creek, and Cumberland Run. Witnesses reported seeing a &quot;wall of water&quot; ten to thirty feet high moving downstream. Communications issues experienced during the response to the flood, because the county&#x27;s fire departments operated on two different frequencies, contributed to the state&#x27;s decision to build an interoperable statewide radio system.

South of Shadyside was the location of the R.E. Burger Power Station. The coal fired power plant generated electricity from 1944 to 2011.

<text>Higginsport is a village in Lewis Township, Brown County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 213 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Col. Robert Higgins was a Revolutionary War officer who had received of land in Brown County, Ohio for his service to his country. He and his family first moved onto the land in 1799, building a small crude cabin near what is now Higginsport. On September 1, 1804, Higgins started surveying a new community named White Haven on his land, and that same month it was platted and recorded in Williamsburg. The community never grew, and after a number of years, was abandoned. On February 28, 1816, Higgins again replatted the community, this time with 114 lots, and renamed it Higginsport. The street layout mostly followed the original White Haven lines. Higgins also donated a small cemetery (his wife the first person buried here) to the town, as well as land in the center of town for a public park, and about on the edge of town called White Oak Bottom. The first church was organized in 1818, and by 1819, there were 6 cabins here and a population of 6, but the community was growing. In 1828, a small store opened, which was expanded in 1832. In 1835, the first brick house was built in town, by Jesse Dugan, then owner of the store. Located at the corner of Water and Brown Streets, it was still standing in 2013. The Higgingsport Post Office was established on January 24, 1829, with a Mr. Roberts, the town tailor, as Post Master. Two more stores were opened in town in 1835 and 1839.

In 1880, the population was 862, and as of 1883, the community was described as a &quot;thriving village&quot;, containing in total five general stores, one clothing store, two drug stores, two tin shops, one hardware store, four fancy stores, one tobacco store, several grocery stores, two blacksmiths, one wagon-maker, one tavern, a grist mill, a distillery, five doctors, and two hotels.

White burley tobacco was first grown near Higginsport in 1864 from seed brought from Kentucky, and by the 1880s, the local economy was largely based on it. In 1883, there were seventeen tobacco warehouses and 32 different tobacco buyers, shipping approx. 2 million pounds annually down the Ohio River to New Orleans.

Two centuries of fires and floods have taken their toll on the communities original homes and businesses along the river front.

<text>Ripley is a village in Union Township, Brown County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River 50 miles southeast of Cincinnati. The population was 1,591 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Colonel James Poage, a veteran of the American Revolution, arrived in the free state of Ohio from Staunton, Virginia in 1804 to claim the he had been granted in what was called the Virginia Military District. Poage was among a large group of veterans who received land grants in what was first organized as the Northwest Territory north of the Ohio River for their service in the American Revolutionary War, and freed the people that they had enslaved when they settled there. Poage and his family laid out the town of Staunton in 1812; it was renamed in 1816 to honor General Eleazar Wheelock Ripley, an American officer of the War of 1812.

Given its location on the river, Ripley became a destination for slaves escaping from slavery in Kentucky on the other side. Both black and white residents developed a network, making Ripley an early stop on the Underground Railroad, to help slaves escape north to freedom. A number of prominent abolitionists lived in the town in the 19th century, mainly on Front Street near the river. John Rankin moved from Kentucky to Ripley in 1822 and later built a house on Liberty Hill overlooking the town, the river, and the Kentucky shore. From there, he signaled escaping slaves with a lantern on a flagpole and provided them shelter. The house is now known as the John Rankin House, and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Rankin was also the minister at the Ripley Presbyterian Church for twenty-four years.

<text>Hamilton is a city in and the county seat of Butler County, Ohio, United States. Located north of Cincinnati along the Great Miami River, Hamilton is the second-most populous city in the Cincinnati metropolitan area and the tenth-most populous city in Ohio. The population was 63,399 at the 2020 census. Most of the city is served by the Hamilton City School District.

==History==
===Fort Hamilton===

Hamilton originated as Fort Hamilton, named to honor Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. The fort was constructed in September through October 1791 by General Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory. It was the first of several built north from Fort Washington into Indian territory. The fort was built to serve as a supply station for the troops of St. Clair during his campaign in the Northwest Indian War. Later, it was used by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne. It was located upstream from the mouth of the Great Miami River, where the river is shallow during normal flow and easily forded on its gravelly bottom by men, animals, and wagons. In 1792, the fort was enlarged with a stable area by General Wayne. The fort was abandoned in 1796 after the signing of the Treaty of Greenville.

===Settlement and growth===
A settlement grew up around Fort Hamilton and was platted as Fairfield in 1794. By 1800, Hamilton was becoming an agricultural and regional trading town. The town was platted, government was seated, and the town named by 1803.

Hamilton was first incorporated by act of the Ohio General Assembly in 1810, but lost its status in 1815 for failure to hold elections. It was reincorporated in 1827 with Rossville, the community across the Great Miami River in St. Clair Township. The two places severed their connection in 1831 only to be rejoined in 1854. Designated the county seat, this became a city in 1857. On March 14, 1867, Hamilton withdrew from the townships of Fairfield and St. Clair to form a &quot;paper township&quot;, but the city government is dominant.

On the afternoon of September 17, 1859, Abraham Lincoln arrived at the Hamilton Station (the station is on the city&#x27;s Historic Preservation list). He gave a campaign speech in support of his fellow Republican, William Dennison, who was running for Ohio governor. Lincoln&#x27;s speech concentrated on popular sovereignty. He began: &quot;This beautiful and far-famed Miami Valley is the garden spot of the world&quot;. It was during this campaign that the relatively unknown Lincoln was first mentioned as a possible presidential contender.

====Hamilton Hydraulic====

The Hamilton Hydraulic, also called the Hamilton &amp; Rossville Hydraulic, was a system devised to supply water power to shops and mills; it spurred one of Hamilton&#x27;s greatest periods of industrial and population growth from 1840 to 1860. Specially built canals and natural reservoirs brought water from the Great Miami River north of Hamilton into the town as a source of power for future industries.

The hydraulic began about north of Hamilton on the river, where a dam was built to divert water into the system. Nearby, two reservoirs stored water for the hydraulic, whose main canal continued south along North Fifth Street to present Market Street. There it took a sharp west turn to the river at the present intersection of Market Street and North Monument Avenue, between the former Hamilton Municipal Building and the present Courtyard by Marriott. The first water passed through the system in January 1845. As the water flowed through the canal, it turned millstones in the hydraulic. The project had been a risky one because there were no shops along its course to use the power when the company was organized in 1842, but the gamble paid off. Several small industries were built on the hydraulic in the 1840s. One was the Beckett Paper Company, established in 1848, the oldest paper mill west of the Allegheny Mountains.

The hydraulic remained a principal source of power for Hamilton industries through the 1870s when stationary steam engines became practical and affordable. Later, most of the hydraulic canal was covered and/or filled. The hydraulic attracted auto manufacturer Henry Ford to Hamilton after World War I, when he sought a site for a tractor factory. Ford built a plant—which soon converted to producing auto parts—at the north end of North Fifth Street so it could take advantage of power provided by a branch of the hydraulic.

===Industrialization===

By the mid-19th century, Hamilton had developed as a significant manufacturing city. Its early products were often machines and equipment used to process the region&#x27;s farm produce, such as steam engines, hay cutters, reapers, and threshers. Other production included machine tools, house hardware, saws for mills, paper, paper making machinery, carriages, guns, whiskey, beer, woolen goods, and myriad and diverse output made from metal, grain, and cloth.

By the early 20th century, the town was a heavy-manufacturing center for vaults and safes, machine tools, cans for vegetables, paper, paper-making machinery, locomotives, frogs and switches for railroads, steam engines, diesel engines, foundry products, printing presses, and automobile parts. During the two World Wars, its factories manufactured war materiel, Liberty ship engines, and gun lathes. Manufacturers used coke to feed furnaces. Its by-product, gas, fueled street lights. The Great Miami River valley, in which Hamilton was located, had become an industrial giant.

The Butler County Courthouse, constructed between 1885 and 1889, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its monumental architecture. The city has three historic districts: Dayton Lane, German Village, and Rossville. Like Cincinnati, Hamilton attracted many German and Italian immigrants from the mid-19th century on, whose influence was expressed in culture, food, and architecture. Hamilton also had a Jewish community; with increased immigration by Eastern European Jews, they founded Beth Israel Synagogue in 1901 as an Orthodox alternative to Hamilton&#x27;s Reform synagogue, which had been founded by German Jews in the 1880s, when nearby Cincinnati was a center of Reform Judaism in the United States. At the time around 250 Jewish families lived in Hamilton.

===1913 flood===

Geographic and geological evidence shows that floods have occurred throughout the valley since prehistoric times. Since European-American settlement, diaries, anecdotes, folk tales, letters, and official records have provided documentation of relatively common severe floods in 1814, 1828, 1832, 1847, 1866, 1883, 1897, 1898, and 1907.

In March 1913, the greatest flood occurred in Hamilton. Heavy rain fell over the entire watershed, and the ground was frozen as well as saturated from previous lighter rains. This resulted in a high rate of run-off from the rain: an estimated 90% flowed directly into the streams, creeks, and rivers. Between 9 and 11 inches (23 to 28 cm) of rain fell over five days, March 25 to 29, 1913. An amount equivalent to about 30 days&#x27; discharge of water over Niagara Falls flowed through the Miami Valley during the ensuing flood. In the Great Miami River Valley, 360 persons died, about 200 of whom were from Hamilton. Some drowned, some were washed away and never found, others died from various diseases and complications, and some committed suicide because of severe losses. Damage in the valley was calculated at $100 million, the equivalent of $2 billion in 21st-century value. The flood waters were so powerful that within two hours they destroyed all four of Hamilton&#x27;s bridges: Black Street, High-Main Street, Columbia, and the CH&amp;D railroad.

In Hamilton, the flood waters rose with unexpected and frightening suddenness, reaching over 3 to 8 feet in depth in downtown, and up to 18 feet in the North End, along Fifth Street and through South Hamilton Crossing. The waters spread from D Street on the west to what is now Erie Highway on the east. The waters&#x27; rise was so swift that many people were trapped in the upper floors of businesses and houses. In some cases, people had to escape to their attics, and then break through the roof as the waters rose even higher. Temperatures hovered near freezing. The water current varied, but in constricted locations it raced at more than 20 miles per hour. Dead people, more than 1,000 drowned horses, other drowned livestock and pets, and sewage tainted the water. Nearly one-third of Hamilton&#x27;s population (10,000 of 35,000) was left homeless and displaced. Thousands of houses were destroyed by the flood; afterward, many were too damaged to repair had to be demolished by city workers.

Following the 1913 flood, residents realized that the only way to prevent future flooding was to deal with protection on a watershed basis. Citizens from all the major cities in the Miami Valley—Piqua, Troy, Dayton, Carlisle, Franklin, Miamisburg, Middletown, and Hamilton—gathered together to find a solution and worked with legislative representatives to draft enabling legislation to create the Miami Conservancy District. The legislation was passed by the state and signed into law by Governor James Cox. The Miami Conservancy District withstood several legal challenges, and by 1915 it hired an engineering staff to develop plans for valley-long channel improvements, levees, and storage basins to temporarily retain excessive rains. The system was designed to withstand rains and flows that would be up to 40% greater than those of the 1913 flood. It was completed in 1923. Since then, the system has retained excess water more than 1,000 times, thereby preventing flooding. The Miami Conservancy District was the first of its kind in the nation and has been an example of flood control protection. It is unique for having been developed, built, and supported financially just by those who benefit. The Miami Conservancy District is financially supported by an assessment on each property that was affected by the 1913 flood, related to the present value of the property because it is not at risk of flooding. All the other areas within the District are assessed because they benefit by reducing or eliminating danger to infrastructure, commerce, and transportation.

===20th century to present===

In the 1920s, many Chicago gangsters established second homes in Hamilton. This gave Hamilton the nickname &quot;Little Chicago&quot;. Some of these men appeared to have invested in what became an active district of gambling and prostitution. During World War II, the military declared the entire city off-limits to its enlisted personnel because of its numerous gambling and prostitution establishments. Madame Freeze&#x27;s and the long row of prostitution houses along Wood Street (now called Pershing Avenue) were notorious among soldiers. Factories in Hamilton converted their operations to support the war effort, manufacturing military supplies, such as tank turrets, Liberty ship and submarine engines, and machined and stamped metal parts.

With the 1950s came the construction of the new interstate highway, I-75, part of the nationwide system. It bypassed Hamilton after a decision made to reduce traffic through the city. As a result, businesses were drawn to areas outside Hamilton with easier access to I-75. Until 1999, when the Butler County Veterans Highway was built, Hamilton was the second-largest city in the United States without direct interstate access.

In the late 20th century, industrial restructuring in heavy manufacturing resulted in widespread loss of jobs in older industrial cities, as operations were merged, relocated, and finally moved offshore. Like other Rust Belt cities in the northern tier, Hamilton has struggled to develop a new economy after such wide-scale changes, but it has retained more of its population than many such cities. In addition, since the late 20th century it has attracted new immigrants, primarily from Mexico and Central America.

On March 30, 1975, Easter Sunday, James Ruppert murdered 11 family members in his mother&#x27;s house at 635 Minor Avenue in Hamilton, in what is referred to as the &quot;Easter Sunday Massacre&quot;. The murders shocked the town of Hamilton and the entire country. This was the deadliest shooting inside a private residence in American history.

 On May 28, 1986, as part of a plan to increase publicity about Hamilton and boost its revitalization, the City Council voted 5 to 1 in favor of adding an exclamation point to the city&#x27;s name, similar to the popular musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Thus, Hamilton officially became Hamilton!. While at the time used extensively in the city&#x27;s documents, letterheads, business cards and on local signage, the United States Board on Geographic Names did not include the exclamation point; nor did Rand McNally maps. The exclamation point is generally no longer used. It is not in use on the Hamilton municipal website.

In 2009 and 2015, the city won the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting Awards for best-tasting municipal water for the United States; and in 2010, the gold medal for the best tasting water in the world. They also placed 3rd (2nd best in America) in 2014, 2017, and 2018; and 5th in 2022.

==Arts and culture==

Hamilton has three designated Historic Districts: Dayton Lane, German Village, and Rossville. The industrial city is seeking to revitalize through the arts; it declared itself the &quot;City of Sculpture&quot; in 2000. That initiative has since attracted many sculpture installations to the city, which founded the Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park.

===Library system===
The Lane Public Library is located in an architecturally significant building in the heart of German Village. Built in 1866 by local philanthropist Robert Clark Lane, the library building has since been improved by six separate renovations and expansion projects. Lane donated the first collection of materials to the library, approximately 3,000 books. Today, the collection numbers over 123,000. It has a local history room, which also has materials related to genealogy. The library also features the Lane Libraries Community Technology Center, located on the ground floor of the historic Robinson-Schwenn Building in downtown Hamilton.

==Sports==
Hamilton was home to minor league baseball in 1884, 1889, 1911 and 1913, as the Hamilton Mechanics played as members of the Ohio State League.

The Hamilton Joes are a collegiate summer baseball team that competes in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, which is one of eight leagues formed under the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. The club was named after Cincinnati Reds baseball player and broadcaster Joe Nuxhall. The Joes inaugural season was in 2009. They won the GLSCL championship in 2010 and 2016. There have been 40 former Joes drafted or signed into professional baseball.

West Side Little League has also won the state championship 19 times since 1988 in the majors division.

==Government==

Hamilton City Council consists of seven members who are elected in non-partisan elections at staggered intervals and serve four-year terms. They elect a mayor within the council, and together select and appoint a professional city manager to operate the city. Operating as the legislative branch of the city, the Council provides policy direction to the City Manager. The judge of the municipal court is also an elected official. The City Manager operates as chief executive officer, directing a workforce of more than 675 permanent employees and a $400+ million budget. The city also maintains a Public Safety Director for the city, responsible for police protection, staffed by more than 110 full-time professionals, and fire protection, staffed by more than 110 full-time fire fighters.

The current mayor of Hamilton is Patrick Moeller and the city manager is Joshua Smith.

The city&#x27;s council-manager government was established in 1926, based then on election by proportional representation with a single transferable vote. This system was developed to try to meet the rapidly changing needs of cities with their growing immigrant populations. &quot;The PR STV ballot allows voters to rank order their choices in either at-large or multimember district elections. With each ballot ultimately counting toward the election of one candidate, voters&#x27; preferences can be transferred to second or subsequent choices if their most preferred candidate is already elected or has no chance of election, thus maximizing the proportion of effective votes and permitting minorities to win their share of seats.&quot;

Hamilton was one of several major Ohio cities that adopted the single transferable vote form of elections in the early 20th century; Ashtabula was the first in 1915. This system was considered more progressive than plurality voting, with winner take all, and the at-large election system found in some cities, which also benefited the majority and generally succeeded in preventing minorities from gaining office. Use of single transferable vote resulted in more minorities, including women, being able to enter politics and attain positions on city councils which they likely otherwise would not have gained in at-large voting. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a significant minority is that representing 5% or more of the population.

The success of single transferable vote nationally led to a political backlash from bosses and parties that lost power. In Hamilton, opponents mounted numerous campaigns to repeal the charter, finally succeeding after four failed referendums in 12 years. Since the city of Hamilton returned to plurality voting, the African-American minority has less frequently been able to win seats on the council. In 2015, however, city council members include two women (white) and an African-American man; other members are white males.

==Education==

Hamilton is served by the Hamilton City School District, which operates Hamilton High School. The district has underway a major $200 million capital program including the construction of eight elementary schools, a freshman school, two completely renovated middle schools, and an upgraded high school with two new gyms, a new media center, six new classrooms and a new cafeteria. In 2002, President George W. Bush visited Hamilton and signed the No Child Left Behind Act into law at Hamilton High School.

The Talawanda City School District and Talawanda High School in Oxford, Ohio serves a small portion of the city. The Ross Local School District and Ross High School operate outside the city proper, serving a small portion of the city and surrounding rural area.

Father Stephen T. Badin High School, a private Catholic high school of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, and several Catholic elementary schools (St. Ann Catholic School, St. Peter in Chains School, St. Joseph Consolidated School, Sacred Heart of Jesus School and Queen of Peace School), serve the city and surrounding area. Richard Allen Schools, a charter school system, has a campus in Hamilton: Richard Allen Academy.

Miami University, based in Oxford, Ohio, has a regional campus in Hamilton. Miami University Hamilton opened in 1968 and now has more than 5,000 students.

==Transportation==
Hamilton station is currently unused. It previously serviced passenger trains to Detroit (until 1971), Chicago, Washington, and New York City (until 2005).

The Butler County Regional Transit Authority provides bus service in the city with connections to Middletown, Oxford, as well as Springdale, where riders can transfer to the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority, which serves greater Cincinnati.

==History==
The United Coke and Gas Company built a number of Otto-Hoffman type coke ovens circa 1905 for the Hamilton Otto Coke Company. The coke plant covered about with a battery of 120 coke ovens, thus New Miami was referred to as Coke Otto. The property was purchased in 1937 by The American Rolling Mill Company which changed its name to ARMCO in 1948. The company is now AK Steel Holdings in Middletown, Ohio. One of Armco&#x27;s best-known products may be the crash barriers installed around many auto-racing tracks, particularly in Formula One. These barriers are commonly called &quot;Armco&quot;. New Miami was incorporated as a village in 1929.

Around January 2013, New Miami entered into a contract with Optotraffic to fit the village with speed cameras around US-127. Those caught speeding in the area of the village would be force to pay a fee of ninety-five dollars, but would not result in points being added to their driver&#x27;s license. By February 2014, the camera system that was in place was stopped by a Butler County Judge. At the time, the village had reported that it had received at least one million dollars during the period the system was up. In December 2015, the village created a new system with Blue Line Solutions to allow officers to use the otherwise automatic speed cameras, which went into full effect in February 2016 with some modifications.

A lawsuit, &quot;Barrow v. Village of New Miami&quot; took place from 2014 to 2017 that would eventually force New Miami to pay back the close to two million the village received from the fines and the over one million that was paid to Optotraffic over the approximately forty-five thousand citations that were issued during the program.

<text>Miami International Airport is the primary international airport serving Miami and its surrounding metropolitan area, in the U.S. state of Florida. It hosts over 1,000 daily flights to 185 domestic and international destinations, including most countries in Latin America. The airport is in an unincorporated area in Miami-Dade County, west-northwest of downtown Miami, in metropolitan Miami, adjacent to the cities of Miami and Miami Springs, and the village of Virginia Gardens. Nearby cities include Hialeah, Doral, and the census-designated place of Fontainebleau.

In 2021, Miami International Airport became the busiest international cargo airport in the U.S. and the busiest U.S. gateway for international passengers, surpassing John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. As of 2021, it is the 10th busiest airport in the U.S. with 17,500,096 passengers for the year. It is Florida&#x27;s busiest airport by total aircraft operations, total cargo traffic and total passenger traffic. The airport is American Airlines&#x27; third-largest hub and serves as its primary gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean. Miami also serves as a focus city for Avianca, Frontier Airlines, and LATAM, both for passengers and cargo operations.

Miami International Airport covers . It is South Florida&#x27;s main airport for long-haul international flights and a hub for the Southeastern United States with passenger and cargo flights to cities throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is the largest gateway between the U.S. and Latin America and the Caribbean and one of the largest airline hubs in the nation.

== History ==

In June of 1928 Pan American Airways acquired 116 acres of land on NW 36th Street for the purpose of building a privately owned and operated international airport in Miami, Florida. The establishment of a commercial airport and of regularly scheduled international passenger airline service by Pan Am was a transformative event for the City of Miami. By September of 1928, Pan Am had begun to operate regularly scheduled Air Mail service between Miami and Havana. On January 9, 1929, Pan American Airport, also known as Pan American Field, was officially dedicated at a ceremony attended by thousands of residents and celebrities such as Amelia Earhart, who saw in the new airport the promise of a bright new future in international aviation for Miami. It was the first mainland airport in the United States to have international port of entry facilities. The passenger terminal building, designed by Delano &amp; Aldrich of NYC, was the most advanced and luxurious in the country. Three hangars, two on the east and one on the west, provided housing and maintenance facilities for Pan Am&#x27;s fleet of Sikorsky amphibian and Fokker aircraft. During the first few years of its operation, from late 1928 until late 1930, it was from this busy airport that Pan American Airways historically pioneered U.S. international passenger aviation, inaugurating regularly scheduled Air Mail and passenger airline service from the U.S. to the West Indies, Caribbean, and Central and South America. In the 1930s Pan American leased space at its airport to Eastern Airlines. Eastern officially took up residence at the 36th Street Airport in August of 1935. In 1940, Intercontinent Corporation, owned by William Pawley, built an aircraft manufacturing plant on land acquired immediately east of Pan American Field. The City and County, eager to encourage the growth of an aircraft manufacturing industry in Miami, agreed to finance and build runways and ground facilities at the Intercontinent plant, including an east-west runway that extended from Le Jeune Road as far west as Pan American Field, where it intersected with Pan Am&#x27;s east-west runway. National Airlines, which had been operating in Miami at Miami&#x27;s city-owned Municipal Airport since 1937, moved to the 36th Street Airport in 1942. National used a terminal on LeJeune Road, across the street from the airport and would stop traffic on the road in order to taxi aircraft to and from its terminal. Miami Army Airfield opened in 1943 on 1400 acres of land acquired during World War II to the south of Pan American Field. The two airfields were listed in some directories as a single facility. 

Following World War II, the Dade County Port Authority embarked on a long-planned airport expansion in order to meet Miami&#x27;s increasing commercial aviation needs. In December 1945, the County acquired Pan Am’s N.W. 36th Street airport which thus ended any distinct identity of Pan American Field. It also acquired Intercontinent&#x27;s former holdings, which were leased to Eastern Airlines, and changed the name of the newly expanded airport to Miami International Airport. Pan American&#x27;s former NW 36th Street terminal building continued to serve as the hub for the new Miami International Airport. Between 1945 and 1950, the Port Authority cobbled together thousands more acres adjacent to and south of the airport, including the Army’s former air base; the Seaboard Air Line Railroad property; and additional parcels, with the intention of meeting Miami’s future aviation needs. The result was a County-owned, Miami International Airport based at NW 36th Street that by 1948 had grown to 2500 acres. The former domed-roofed Pan Am terminal building was extensively remodeled and enlarged, the words “Miami International Airport” now curving across its façade. The new airport was officially dedicated January 4, 1950. United States Air Force Reserve troop carrier and rescue squadrons also operated from the airport from 1949 through 1959, when the last unit relocated to nearby Homestead Air Force Base (now Homestead Air Reserve Base). In the late 1940s, Pan Am and Eastern also expanded their bases at MIA on NW 36th Street, which made the airport the world&#x27;s largest commercial aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility at the time. 
In the 1950s, a continuing boom in postwar passenger aviation soon stretched even the County’s expanded airport to capacity. Scheduled airlines had outstripped ships, trains and buses to become the state’s as well as the nation’s largest carriers of interstate and international traffic. Delta had joined Pan Am, Eastern and National to become MIA&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; carriers and the airport also served a host of smaller scheduled and non-scheduled airlines. A new jet age loomed. Plans for an entirely new airport, to be built from scratch on land south and east of the existing facility were set in motion. On February 1, 1959, after years of planning and construction, Miami&#x27;s brand-new Miami International Airport was formally inaugurated at 20th Street, on what was dubbed Wilcox Field in honor of the Port Authority attorney who had been instrumental in bringing the project to completion. No longer needed, the former domed-roofed terminal building on NW 36th Street was torn down in November 1962. This part of MIA along NW 36th Street is known today as MIA&#x27;s north field. 

When it was dedicated in 1959, MIA&#x27;s new 20th Street Terminal was the largest central airport terminal in the world, with five concourses (Concourses C-G) and a 270-room hotel. In 1961, the terminal was expanded with the addition of a sixth concourse (Concourse H) on the south side, which was the first concourse at the airport to include jetways. By 1965, the original five concourses were renovated with jetways added to them. 

The 20th Street Terminal was expanded in the 1970s. Parking garages were added just east of the terminal and Concourse B opened on the north side of the terminal in 1973 to accommodate the expansion of Eastern Air Lines. In 1977, Concourse E&#x27;s satellite terminal opened. The satellite was originally connected with shuttle buses, though a people mover was built to connect the satellite in 1980.

Nonstop flights to Chicago and Newark started in late 1946, but nonstops didn&#x27;t reach west beyond St. Louis and New Orleans until January 1962. Nonstop transatlantic flights to Europe began in 1970. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Air Florida had a hub at MIA, with a nonstop flight to London, England which it acquired from National upon the latter&#x27;s merger with Pan Am. Air Florida ceased operations in 1982 after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90. British Airways flew a Concorde SST (supersonic transport) triweekly between Miami and London via Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., from 1984 to 1991.

The terminal was further expanded in the 1980s. The original Concourses D and E were rebuilt early in the decade and Concourses B and F were expanded. Pedestrian bridges with moving walkways were built in 1985 connecting the parking garages with the third level of the terminal. Within the next few years, the moving walkway system on the third level was expanded to run along the full length of the terminal.

After former Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman became president of Eastern Air Lines in 1975, he moved Eastern&#x27;s headquarters from Rockefeller Center in New York City to Building 16 in the northeast corner of MIA, Eastern&#x27;s maintenance base. Eastern remained one of the largest employers in the Miami metropolitan area until ongoing labor union unrest, coupled with the airline&#x27;s acquisition by Texas Air in 1986, ultimately forced the airline into bankruptcy in 1989. Eastern operated out of Concourses B through D on the north side of the terminal, where American&#x27;s Concourse D stands today. Concourse E was the home for most international carriers, while Pan Am operated out of Concourses E and F.

=== American Airlines hub ===

Amid Eastern&#x27;s turmoil, American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall sought a new hub in order to utilize new aircraft which AA had on order. AA studies indicated that Delta Air Lines would provide strong competition on most routes from Eastern&#x27;s hub at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, but that MIA had many key routes only served by Eastern. American Airlines announced that it would establish a base at MIA in August 1988. Lorenzo considered selling Eastern&#x27;s profitable Latin America routes to AA as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization of Eastern in early 1989 but backed out in a last-ditch effort to rebuild the MIA hub. The effort quickly proved futile, and American Airlines purchased the routes (including the route authority between Miami and London then held by Eastern sister company Continental Airlines) in a liquidation of Eastern which was completed in 1990. Later in the 1990s, American transferred more employees and equipment to MIA from its failed domestic hubs at Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh–Durham, North Carolina. The hub grew from 34 daily departures in 1989 to 157 in 1990, 190 in 1992, and a peak of 301 in 1995, including long-haul flights to Europe and South America. Today Miami is American&#x27;s largest air freight hub and is the main connecting point in the airline&#x27;s north–south international route network.

In December 1992, South African Airways launched flights to Johannesburg via Cape Town using a Boeing 747. The company&#x27;s codeshare agreement with American Airlines supported the route. The carrier later decided to codeshare with Delta Air Lines instead, which operated a hub in Atlanta. Consequently, South African replaced its Miami service with a flight to Atlanta in January 2000.

Concourse A was built on the northeast side of the terminal in 1995, and Concourse H was rebuilt in 1997. Concourse J was built in August 2007 along with an expansion of the terminal on the south side.

American began the development of the current North Terminal in the 1990s. Concourses B and C were demolished as part of the project with Concourse A becoming the eastern end of the expanded Concourse D. Although the terminal was originally scheduled to be completed in 2004, numerous delays arose in the construction process, and Miami-Dade County took over control of the project in 2005, at which time the project had a budget of $2.85 billion. The terminal was ultimately completed in 2011 and included Skytrain, an automated people mover system, as well as a wing for American Eagle commuter flights.

=== Other hub operations ===
Pan Am was acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1991, but filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Its remaining international routes from Miami to Europe and Latin America were sold to United Airlines for $135 million as part of Pan Am&#x27;s emergency liquidation that December. United&#x27;s Latin American hub offered 24 daily departures in the summer of 1992, growing to 36 daily departures to 21 destinations in the summer of 1994, but returned to 24 daily departures in the summer of 1995 and never expanded further. United ended flights from Miami to South America, and shut down its Miami crew base, in May 2004, reallocating most Miami resources to its main hub in O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago. United ceased all mainline service to Miami in 2005 with the introduction of its low-cost product Ted.

Iberia also established a Miami hub in 1992, positioning a fleet of DC-9 aircraft at MIA to serve destinations in Central America and the Caribbean. The hub took advantage of rights granted under the 1991 bilateral aviation agreement between the United States and Spain. During the 1990s, the airport had sterile international-to-international transit facilities in Concourse D (American, British, and Alitalia) and Concourse F (Iberia and four Central American carriers), and there were plans to establish a sterile corridor for international connecting passengers between six concourses. However, the September 11, 2001, attacks made it necessary for many foreigners to obtain a visa in order to transit the United States, and as a result, United Airlines and Iberia closed their hubs in 2004.

=== Future ===
MIA is projected to process 77 million passengers and 4 million tons of freight annually by 2040. To meet such a demand, the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners approved a $5 billion improvement plan to take place over 15 years and concluding in 2035. The comprehensive plan includes concourse optimization, construction of two on-site luxury hotels, the demolition of Concourse G, and expansion of the airport&#x27;s cargo capacity.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
Miami International Airport contains three terminals (North, Central, and South) and six concourses for a total of 131 gates. With the exception of Concourse G, all concourses contain gates to access U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities.

*Concourse D contains 51 gates. The eastern section opened in 1995 as Concourse A, and the other parts opened in March 2013.
*Concourse E contains 18 gates. Opened throughout the early 1960s, the satellite terminal opened in 1974.
*Concourse F contains 19 gates. Opened in the 1970s.
*Concourse G contains 14 gates. Opened in the mid-1960s.
*Concourse H contains 13 gates. Opened in March 1998.
*Concourse J contains 15 gates. Opened in August 2007.

American operates three Admirals Clubs and one Flagship Lounge across Concourses D &amp; E. Numerous other lounges exist across the airport as well, including an American Express Centurion Lounge located in Concourse D. The North Terminal (Concourse D) is for the exclusive use of American Airlines. The Central Terminal (Concourses E, F, and G) has varied uses; Concourse E is mainly used by American and its Oneworld partner airlines along with some Caribbean and Latin American airlines, and E&#x27;s satellite terminal has a gate that can accommodate an Airbus A380. Concourses F and G are used by non-AA domestic and Canadian carriers and flights. The South Terminal (Concourses H and J) is the main non-Oneworld international terminal. Concourse H is largely used by Delta and non-Oneworld international carriers that send narrowbody planes largely from Central and the northern parts of South America, and some widebody flights; and Concourse J is used by most non-Oneworld international carriers that send widebody planes and is the main terminal at MIA for non-Oneworld trans-continental flights. Concourse J also has one gate that can accommodate an A380.

===Ground transportation===

Miami International Airport offers the MIA Mover, a free people mover system to transfer passengers between MIA terminals and the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC) that opened to the public on September 9, 2011. The MIC provides direct access from the airport to ground transportation (shuttle/bus/rail) as well as the Rental Car Center. A Metrorail station opened at the MIC on July 28, 2012; a Tri-Rail station followed on April 5, 2015. Plans for Amtrak to operate a station at the MIC have been cancelled since it was discovered that the platform built for the service was too short for Amtrak trains. The platform now sits empty and closed, with no trains stopping at it.

The rental car center consolidates airport car rental operations at the MIC.

Miami International Airport has direct public transit service to Miami-Dade Transit&#x27;s Metrorail and Metrobus networks; Greyhound Bus Lines and to the Tri-Rail commuter rail system. Metrorail operates the Orange Line train from Miami International Airport to destinations such as Downtown, Brickell, Health District, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, Dadeland, Hialeah, South Miami, and Wynwood. It takes approximately 15 minutes to get from the airport to Downtown.

Miami-Dade Transit operates an Airport Flyer bus that connects MIA directly to South Beach.

MIA is served directly by Tri-Rail, Miami&#x27;s commuter rail system. The station opened on April 5, 2015. Tri-Rail connects MIA to northern Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. Tri-Rail directly serves points north such as Boca Raton, Deerfield Beach, Delray Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Pompano Beach and West Palm Beach.

===Cargo yard===
MIA has a number of air cargo facilities. The largest cargo complex is located on the west side of the airport, inside the triangle formed by Runways 12/30 and 9/27. Cargo carriers such as LATAM Cargo, Atlas Air, Amerijet International, and DHL operate from this area. The largest privately owned facility is the Centurion Cargo complex in the northeast corner of the airport, with over of warehouse space. FedEx and UPS operate their own facilities in the northwest corner of the airport, off of 36th Street. In addition to its large passenger terminal in Concourse D, American Airlines operates a maintenance base to the east of Concourse D, centered around a semicircular hangar originally used by National Airlines which can accommodate three widebody aircraft.

<text>Seven Mile is a village in Butler County, Ohio, United States. The population was 712 at the 2020 census.

Seven Mile is served by Edgewood Local School District. Seven Mile Elementary School is the only school located within the village limits.

==History==
On October 6, 1791, 2,200 troops marched to the area and encamped in the bottom on the east side of the creek. The area was then called Seven Mile after the creek name. The Indian name for Seven Mile Creek was Watamaw, meaning shining water.

Seven Mile was laid out on a turnpike in 1841. It took its name from nearby Sevenmile Creek. Seven Mile was incorporated as a village in 1875.

In 1905, Seven Mile contained a hotel, a harness shop, a tin shop, meat store, and a mill. The village was spared during the Great Dayton Flood due to the elevated railroad grade separating it from Sevenmile Creek.

At the turn of the 20th century, the village celebrated a peculiar type of parade called the &quot;Rag&#x27;n Fads&quot; where all the children dressed up in the most tattered clothes they owned, according to the April 6, 1901, issue of &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

After a 2016 Ohio law legalized marijuana for medicinal uses to treat 21 ailments, including cancer, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder or chronic pain, Seven Mile was chosen as a site for one of only two dispensary locations within Butler County. The location was chosen because of its proximity to Ohio 127 and it is centrally located within a region that includes Butler, Darke and Preble counties. The dispensary opened October 24, 2019.

==Geography==
Wetherington is located in northeastern West Chester Township. It surrounds Wetherington Golf and Country Club, and is bordered on its east side by Interstate 75, with access from Exit 22 (Tylersville Road). It is north of downtown Cincinnati.

Wetherington can be accessed from gated entrances at Cincinnati-Dayton and Tylersville Road, or through entrances at Liberty Way. The gates at the entrances were erected in 2002, making Wetherington the largest gated community in south-western Ohio at the time. This privatization was criticized for restricting public access to publicly funded roads, creating a physical boundary between lower and upper class citizens, and for symbolically being contrary to the free and democratic ideals of American society. The ostensible reason for the gate&#x27;s construction was to eliminate heavy traffic from commuters using the neighborhood&#x27;s roads as a shortcut between Cincinnati-Dayton and Tylersville Road.

<text>Caerlaverock (; ) is a civil parish in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.

The parish was historically in Dumfriesshire. The area includes:
* Caerlaverock Castle, a 13th-century castle, located south of Dumfries, Scotland
* Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve, a National Nature Reserve in the Solway Firth, south-west Scotland
* WWT Caerlaverock, a Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust nature reserve, located south of Dumfries, Scotland

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Caerlaverock&quot; is of Brittonic origin. The first part of the name is the element &quot;cajr&quot; meaning &quot;an enclosed, defensible site&quot;, (Welsh &quot;caer&quot;, &quot;fort, city&quot;). The second part of the name may be the personal name &quot;Lïμarch&quot; (Welsh &quot;Llywarch&quot;), or a lost stream-name formed from the adjective &quot;laβar&quot;, &quot;talkative&quot; (Welsh &quot;llafar&quot;, see Afon Llafar), suffixed with &quot;–ǭg&quot;, &quot;having the quality of&quot;, or the adjectival suffix &quot;-īg&quot;. The present form has been influenced by the Scots word &quot;laverock&quot;, &quot;skylark&quot;.

<doc id="128987" wikidata="Q7569" url="?curid=128987" title="Child">
<text>A child () is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. The term may also refer to an unborn human being. In English-speaking countries, the legal definition of &quot;child&quot; generally refers to a minor, in this case as a person younger than the local age of majority (there are exceptions like, for example, the consume and purchase of alcoholic beverage even after said age of majority), regardless of their physical, mental and sexual development as biological adults. Children generally have fewer rights and responsibilities than adults. They are generally classed as unable to make serious decisions. 

&quot;Child&quot; may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age) or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in &quot;a child of nature&quot; or &quot;a child of the Sixties.&quot;

== Biological, legal and social definitions ==

In the biological sciences, a child is usually defined as a person between birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. Legally, the term &quot;child&quot; may refer to anyone below the age of majority or some other age limit.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines &quot;child&quot; as, &quot;A human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.&quot; This is ratified by 192 of 194 member countries. The term &quot;child&quot; may also refer to someone below another legally defined age limit unconnected to the age of majority. In Singapore, for example, a &quot;child&quot; is legally defined as someone under the age of 14 under the &quot;Children and Young Persons Act&quot; whereas the age of majority is 21. In U.S. Immigration Law, a child refers to anyone who is under the age of 21.

Some English definitions of the word &quot;child&quot; include the fetus (sometimes termed &quot;the unborn&quot;). In many cultures, a child is considered an adult after undergoing a rite of passage, which may or may not correspond to the time of puberty.

Children generally have fewer rights than adults and are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must always be under the care of a responsible adult or child custody, whether their parents divorce or not. 

== Developmental stages of childhood ==
=== Early childhood ===


Early childhood follows the infancy stage and begins with toddlerhood when the child begins speaking or taking steps independently. While toddlerhood ends around age 3 when the child becomes less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs, early childhood continues approximately until the age of 5 or 6. However, according to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, early childhood also includes infancy. At this stage children are learning through observing, experimenting and communicating with others. Adults supervise and support the development process of the child, which then will lead to the child&#x27;s autonomy. Also during this stage, a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers. The children also start preschool and kindergarten at this age: and hence their social lives.

=== Middle childhood ===
Middle childhood begins at around age 7, and ends at around age 9 or 10. Together, early and middle childhood are called formative years. In this middle period, children develop socially and mentally. They are at a stage where they make new friends and gain new skills, which will enable them to become more independent and enhance their individuality.
During middle childhood, children enter the school years, where they are presented with a different setting than they are used to. This new setting creates new challenges and faces for children. Upon the entrance of school, mental disorders that would normally not be noticed come to light. Many of these disorders include: autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. Special education, least restrictive environment, response to intervention and individualized education plans are all specialized plans to help children with disabilities.

Middle childhood is the time when children begin to understand responsibility and are beginning to be shaped by their peers and parents. Chores and more responsible decisions come at this time, as do social comparison and social play. During social play, children learn from and teach each other, often through observation.

=== Late childhood ===

Preadolescence is a stage of human development following early childhood and preceding adolescence. Preadolescence is commonly defined as ages 9–12, ending with the major onset of puberty, with markers such as menarche, spermarche, and the peak of height velocity occurring. These changes usually occur between ages 11 and 14. It may also be defined as the 2-year period before the major onset of puberty. Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and anxieties. Preadolescent children have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: &#x27;the most &quot;sensible&quot; stage of development...the child is a much &quot;less emotional being&quot; now.&#x27; Preadolescents may well view human relationships differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of authority figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of self-identity, and to have increased feelings of independence: &#x27;may feel an individual, no longer &quot;just one of the family.&quot;&#x27;

== Developmental stages post-childhood ==
=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence is usually determined to be between the onset of puberty and legal adulthood: mostly corresponding to the teenage years (13–19). However, puberty usually begins before the teenage years (10—11 for girls and 11—12 for boys). Although biologically a child is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, adolescents are legally considered children, as they tend to lack adult rights and are still required to attend compulsory schooling in many cultures, though this varies. The onset of adolescence brings about various physical, psychological and behavioral changes. The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function, and even within a single nation-state or culture there may be different ages at which an individual is considered to be mature enough to be entrusted by society with certain tasks.

== History ==
During the European Renaissance, artistic depictions of children increased dramatically, which did not have much effect on the social attitude toward children, however.

The French historian Philippe Ariès argued that during the 1600s, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe, however other historians like Nicholas Orme have challenged this view and argued that childhood has been seen as a separate stage since at least the medieval period. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. The English philosopher John Locke was particularly influential in defining this new attitude towards children, especially with regard to his theory of the tabula rasa, which considered the mind at birth to be a &quot;blank slate&quot;. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank, and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. During the early period of capitalism, the rise of a large, commercial middle class, mainly in the Protestant countries of the Dutch Republic and England, brought about a new family ideology centred around the upbringing of children. Puritanism stressed the importance of individual salvation and concern for the spiritual welfare of children.

The modern notion of childhood with its own autonomy and goals began to emerge during the 18th-century Enlightenment and the Romantic period that followed it. Jean Jacques Rousseau formulated the romantic attitude towards children in his famous 1762 novel &quot;&quot;. Building on the ideas of John Locke and other 17th-century thinkers, Jean-Jaques Rousseau described childhood as a brief period of sanctuary before people encounter the perils and hardships of adulthood. Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; extensive children portraiture demonstrated the new enlightened attitudes toward young children. His 1788 painting &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; emphasizes the innocence and natural grace of the posing child and soon became a public favourite.

The idea of childhood as a locus of divinity, purity, and innocence is further expounded upon in William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood&quot;, the imagery of which he &quot;fashioned from a complex mix of pastoral aesthetics, pantheistic views of divinity, and an idea of spiritual purity based on an Edenic notion of pastoral innocence infused with Neoplatonic notions of reincarnation&quot;. This Romantic conception of childhood, historian Margaret Reeves suggests, has a longer history than generally recognized, with its roots traceable to similarly imaginative constructions of childhood circulating, for example, in the neo-platonic poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Henry Vaughan (e.g., &quot;The Retreate&quot;, 1650; &quot;Childe-hood&quot;, 1655). Such views contrasted with the stridently didactic, Calvinist views of infant depravity.

With the onset of industrialisation in England in 1760, the divergence between high-minded romantic ideals of childhood and the reality of the growing magnitude of child exploitation in the workplace, became increasingly apparent. By the late 18th century, British children were specially employed in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay. As the century wore on, the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for poor children and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of simplicity and innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children.

British reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward, bolstered by the horrific descriptions of London street life by Charles Dickens. The campaign eventually led to the Factory Acts, which mitigated the exploitation of children at the workplace

=== Modern concepts of childhood ===

The modern attitude to children emerged by the late 19th century; the Victorian middle and upper classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child – an attitude that has remained dominant in Western societies ever since. The genre of children&#x27;s literature took off, with a proliferation of humorous, child-oriented books attuned to the child&#x27;s imagination. Lewis Carroll&#x27;s fantasy &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first &quot;English masterpiece written for children&quot;, its publication opened the &quot;First Golden Age&quot; of children&#x27;s literature.

The latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools.

The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun, happiness, and imagination. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.
The Boy Scouts was founded by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in 1908, which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities.

In the 20th century, Philippe Ariès, a French historian specializing in medieval history, suggested that childhood was not a natural phenomenon, but a creation of society in his 1960 book &quot;Centuries of Childhood&quot;. In 1961 he published a study of paintings, gravestones, furniture, and school records, finding that before the 17th century, children were represented as mini-adults.

In 1966, the American philosopher George Boas published the book &quot;The Cult of Childhood&quot;. Since then, historians have increasingly researched childhood in past times.

In 2006, Hugh Cunningham published the book &quot;Invention of Childhood&quot;, looking at British childhood from the year 1000, the Middle Ages, to what he refers to as the Post War Period of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

Childhood evolves and changes as lifestyles change and adult expectations alter. In the modern era, many adults believe that children should not have any worries or work, as life should be happy and trouble-free. Childhood is seen as a mixture of simplicity, innocence, happiness, fun, imagination, and wonder. It is thought of as a time of playing, learning, socializing, exploring, and worrying in a world without much adult interference.

A &quot;loss of innocence&quot; is a common concept, and is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a child&#x27;s life that widens their awareness of evil, pain or the world around them. This theme is demonstrated in the novels &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The fictional character Peter Pan was the embodiment of a childhood that never ends.

== Healthy childhoods ==
=== Role of parents ===
=== Children&#x27;s health ===

Children&#x27;s health includes the physical, mental and social well-being of children. Maintaining children&#x27;s health implies offering them healthy foods, insuring they get enough sleep and exercise, and protecting their safety. Children in certain parts of the world often suffer from malnutrition, which is often associated with other conditions, such diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

=== Child protection ===

Child protection, according to UNICEF, refers to &quot;preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and abuse against children – including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage&quot;. The
Convention on the Rights of the Child protects the fundamental rights of children.

=== Play ===
Play is essential to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children. It offers children opportunities for physical (running, jumping, climbing, etc.), intellectual (social skills, community norms, ethics and general knowledge) and emotional development (empathy, compassion, and friendships). Unstructured play encourages creativity and imagination. Playing and interacting with other children, as well as some adults, provides opportunities for friendships, social interactions, conflicts and resolutions. However, adults tend to (often mistakenly) assume that virtually all children&#x27;s social activities can be understood as &quot;play&quot; and, furthermore, that children&#x27;s play activities do not involve much skill or effort.

It is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles, sometimes in conjunction with other children or adult caregivers. Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, to resolve conflicts, and to learn self-advocacy skills. However, when play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them. This is especially true in developing creativity, leadership, and group skills.

Play is considered to be very important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as a right of every child. Children who are being raised in a hurried and pressured style may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play.

The initiation of play in a classroom setting allows teachers and students to interact through playfulness associated with a learning experience. Therefore, playfulness aids the interactions between adults and children in a learning environment. “Playful Structure” means to combine informal learning with formal learning to produce an effective learning experience for children at a young age.

Even though play is considered to be the most important to optimal child development, the environment affects their play and therefore their development. Poor children confront widespread environmental inequities as they experience less social support, and their parents are less responsive and more authoritarian. Children from low income families are less likely to have access to books and computers which would enhance their development.

=== Street culture ===

Children&#x27;s street culture refers to the cumulative culture created by young children and is sometimes referred to as their &quot;secret world&quot;. It is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve. It is strongest in urban working class industrial districts where children are traditionally free to play out in the streets for long periods without supervision. It is invented and largely sustained by children themselves with little adult interference.

Young children&#x27;s street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and pavements, and along routes that venture out into local parks, playgrounds, scrub and wasteland, and to local shops. It often imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings, kerbs, street objects, etc.). Children designate specific areas that serve as informal meeting and relaxation places (see: Sobel, 2001). An urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep &#x27;spirit of place&#x27; meanings in to children. Since the advent of indoor distractions such as video games, and television, concerns have been expressed about the vitality – or even the survival – of children&#x27;s street culture.

== Geographies of childhood ==
The geographies of childhood involves how (adult) society perceives the idea of childhood, the many ways adult attitudes and behaviors affect children&#x27;s lives, including the environment which surrounds children and its implications.

The geographies of childhood is similar in some respects to children&#x27;s geographies which examines the places and spaces in which children live.

=== Nature deficit disorder ===

Nature Deficit Disorder, a term coined by Richard Louv in his 2005 book &quot;Last Child in the Woods,&quot; refers to the trend in the United States and Canada towards less time for outdoor play, resulting in a wide range of behavioral problems.

With increasing use of cellphones, computers, video games and television, children have more reasons to stay inside rather than outdoors exploring. “The average American child spends 44 hours a week with electronic media”. Research in 2007 has drawn a correlation between the declining number of National Park visits in the U.S. and increasing consumption of electronic media by children. The media has accelerated the trend for children&#x27;s nature disconnection by deemphasizing views of nature, as in Disney films.

==Age of responsibility==

The age at which children are considered responsible for their society-bound actions (e. g. marriage, voting, etc.) has also changed over time, and this is reflected in the way they are treated in courts of law. In Roman times, children were regarded as not culpable for crimes, a position later adopted by the Church. In the 19th century, children younger than seven years old were believed incapable of crime. Children from the age of seven forward were considered responsible for their actions. Therefore, they could face criminal charges, be sent to adult prison, and be punished like adults by whipping, branding or hanging. However, courts at the time would consider the offender&#x27;s age when deliberating sentencing. Minimum employment age and marriage age also vary. The age limit of voluntary/involuntary military service is also disputed at the international level.

==Education==

Education, in the general sense, refers to the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and preparing intellectually for mature life. Formal education most often takes place through schooling. A right to education has been recognized by some governments. At the global level, Article 13 of the United Nations&#x27; 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognizes the right of everyone to an education. Education is compulsory in most places up to a certain age, but attendance at school may not be, with alternative options such as home-schooling or e-learning being recognized as valid forms of education in certain jurisdictions.

Children in some countries (especially in parts of Africa and Asia) are often kept out of school, or attend only for short periods. Data from UNICEF indicate that in 2011, 57 million children were out of school; and more than 20% of African children have never attended primary school or have left without completing primary education. According to a UN report, warfare is preventing 28 million children worldwide from receiving an education, due to the risk of sexual violence and attacks in schools. Other factors that keep children out of school include poverty, child labor, social attitudes, and long distances to school.

==Attitudes toward children==
 Social attitudes toward children differ around the world in various cultures and change over time. A 1988 study on European attitudes toward the centrality of children found that Italy was more child-centric and the Netherlands less child-centric, with other countries, such as Austria, Great Britain, Ireland and West Germany falling in between.

=== Child marriage ===
In 2013, child marriage rates of female children under the age of 18 reached 75% in Niger, 68% in Central African Republic and Chad, 66% in Bangladesh, and 47% in India. According to a 2019 UNICEF report on child marriage, 37% of females were married before the age of 18 in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by South Asia at 30%. Lower levels were found in Latin America and Caribbean (25%), the Middle East and North Africa (18%), and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (11%), while rates in Western Europe and North America were minimal. Child marriage is more prevalent with girls, but also involves boys. A 2018 study in the journal Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies found that, worldwide, 4.5% of males are married before age 18, with the Central African Republic having the highest average rate at 27.9%.

=== Fertility and number of children per woman ===
Before contraception became widely available in the 20th century, women had little choice other than abstinence or having often many children. In fact, current population growth concerns have only become possible with drastically reduced child mortality and sustained fertility. In 2017 the global total fertility rate was estimated to be 2.37 children per woman, adding about 80 million people to the world population per year. In order to measure the total number of children, scientists often prefer the completed cohort fertility at age 50 years (CCF50). Although the number of children is also influenced by cultural norms, religion, peer pressure and other social factors, the CCF50 appears to be most heavily dependent on the educational level of women, ranging from 5–8 children in women without education to less than 2 in women with 12 or more years of education.

== Issues ==

===Emergencies and conflicts===

Emergencies and conflicts pose detrimental risks to the health, safety, and well-being of children. There are many different kinds of conflicts and emergencies, e.g. wars and natural disasters. As of 2010 approximately 13 million children are displaced by armed conflicts and violence around the world. Where violent conflicts are the norm, the lives of young children are significantly disrupted and their families have great difficulty in offering the sensitive and consistent care that young children need for their healthy development. Studies on the effect of emergencies and conflict on the physical and mental health of children between birth and 8 years old show that where the disaster is natural, the rate of PTSD occurs in anywhere from 3 to 87 percent of affected children. However, rates of PTSD for children living in chronic conflict conditions varies from 15 to 50 percent.

=== Child protection ===
=== Child abuse and child labor ===
Protection of children from abuse is considered an important contemporary goal. This includes protecting children from exploitation such as child labor, child trafficking and child selling, child sexual abuse, including child prostitution and child pornography, military use of children, and child laundering in illegal adoptions. There exist several international instruments for these purposes, such as:
* Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention
* Minimum Age Convention, 1973
* Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography
* Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse
* Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict
* Hague Adoption Convention

=== Climate change ===
== Health ==

===Child mortality===
During the early 17th century in England, about two-thirds of all children died before the age of four. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. This has continued in England, and in the 21st century child mortality rates have fallen across the world. About 12.6 million under-five infants died worldwide in 1990, which declined to 6.6 million in 2012. The infant mortality rate dropped from 90 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990, to 48 in 2012. The highest average infant mortality rates are in sub-Saharan Africa, at 98 deaths per 1,000 live births – over double the world&#x27;s average.

<text>St. Paris or Saint Paris is a village in Champaign County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,882 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area where St. Paris now stands was originally inhabited by Native Americans. The first white settlers arrived in 1797 and the village was founded in Johnson Township in 1831 by David Huffman, who originally named it New Paris, after the French capital city of Paris. Upon learning that another town in Ohio already had that name, he changed the name to St. Paris.

In 1846 and 1847 the Columbus and Piqua Railroad was built along the southern boundary of the village, greatly increasing its advantages compared to other communities in the surrounding area. After reorganization, when the Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad between Columbus, Ohio, and Union City, Indiana opened on March 25, 1859, the local station was the most efficient transport option for area agricultural products and travellers. The railroad operated as part of the Bee Line, eventually becoming part of the Pennsylvania Railroad and then Conrail before abandonment in 1983.

St. Paris was incorporated as a village in 1858. The village increased in area, and now straddles to boundary between Johnson Township and Jackson Township.

One of the houses in the village, known as the &quot;Monitor House&quot;, has been declared a historic site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="128992" wikidata="Q1762816" url="?curid=128992" title="Urbana, Ohio">
<text>Urbana is a city in and the county seat of Champaign County, Ohio, United States, about northeast of Dayton and west of Columbus. The population was 11,115 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Urbana micropolitan area. Urbana was laid out in 1805, and for a time in 1812 was the headquarters of the Northwestern army during the War of 1812. It is the burial place of the explorer and soldier Simon Kenton. The city was home to Urbana University and Curry Normal and Industrial Institute, a school for African American students.

==History==
Champaign County was formed on February 20, 1805, following the American Revolution and the Northwest Indian War. Colonel William Ward, a Virginian who had settled in the Mad River Valley with Simon Kenton in 1799, purchased 160 acres which he considered the logical and most acceptable site for Champaign&#x27;s county seat. He approached the county commissioners with a proposition to locate the seat of the new county on this tract. Ward suggested that site to divided into 212 lots and 22 out-lots, half of which, selected alternately, were to be given to the county and while Ward would retain the remainder. Ward also offered two lots for a cemetery and a tract for the public square. The county commissioners approved the proposal, and Ward, with Joseph C. Vance, entered into a written agreement on October 11, 1805. Ward and Vance named the new county seat, Urbana.

The origin of the name &#x27;Urbana&#x27; is unclear; however, it is thought that Ward and Vance used the Latin word &quot;&#x27;urbs&quot;&#x27;, which means city. Antrim provides the following theory: &quot;It is said by some that Mr. Ward named the town from the word &quot;Urbanity&quot;, but I think it is quite likely he named it from an old Roman custom of dividing their people into different classes – one class, the Plebeians, and this again divided into two classes – &quot;Plebs Rustica&quot; and &quot;Plebs&quot; &quot;Urbana&quot;. The &quot;Plebs Rustica&quot; lived in the rural districts and were farmers, while the &quot;Plebs Urbana&quot; lived in villages and were mechanics and artisans.&quot; Others feel that Ward and Vance chose to name it from a town in Virginia, possibly Urbanna, but this seems unlikely. Urbanna means &#x27;City of Anne&#x27; and was named for the English queen. It is more likely that two Revolutionary War veterans would turn to Latin rather than honor their former foe. A review in 1939 shows that of the 12 cities in the United States named &quot;Urbana&quot;, the city in Ohio was the first.

When Ward delegated Vance to survey the site, there were no platted towns between Detroit and Springfield to use as a model. Nevertheless, Vance and Ward planned Urbana systematically. They provided for an ample public square, and laid the streets in an orderly pattern with no deviations for bogs and swamps.

By 1833, Urbana contained a courthouse and jail, one printing office, a church, a market house, nine mercantile stores, and 120 houses.

On June 4, 1897, residents of Urbana formed a lynch mob and fought their way into the town jail to remove Charles Mitchell, a black man who was suspect in the killing of a white. Crowds of men had been forming for more than a day. The mob hanged Mitchell in the courtyard of the courthouse in the middle of the night. Trying to protect him, Sheriff McCain had summoned the state militia, led by Captain Leonard. After the mob fired into the jail, the militia returned at least five shots, killing Harry Bell, one of the white mob, and wounding others. When the lynch mob gained entry after 2:30 am, the sheriff withdrew militia forces to an upper floor in retreat.

On June 21, 2009, a skatepark was added to Urbana&#x27;s Melvin Miller Park. In November 2013, Damian Prendergast, who was a local skateboarder, died from germ cell cancer. Following his death, his high school class raised $700 and support to dedicate the skatepark in Damian&#x27;s name.

==History==
North Hampton was platted in 1829. A post office called North Hampton has been in operation since 1839.

In 1969, North Hampton earned a place in rock and roll lore when confusion of the town&#x27;s name with that of Northampton Township, Ohio caused the rock group Vanilla Fudge to arrive at North Hampton for a rock concert instead of the Blossom Amphitheater. After learning that they were nearly 200 miles from the concert venue (near Cleveland), the band then charted a plane to fly them to the gig and arrived four hours late. Vocalist Mark Stein told a reporter later, &quot;You understand, man, that the promoter kept telling our agent about Blossom Center in Northampton Township. Only we were up in Montreal, and looking at a map to find the place and sure enough — there&#x27;s this town, North Hampton, near Dayton somewhere. We figured, that&#x27;s a weird place for a concert, but if that&#x27;s where peoples&#x27; heads are at in Ohio, fine — that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll wail.&quot;

North Hampton is a well-known speed trap throughout Ohio. The village was one of the municipalities with the highest speeding citation numbers in the state in 2019.

<text>Springfield is a city in and the county seat of Clark County, Ohio, United States. The municipality is located in southwestern Ohio and is situated on the Mad River, Buck Creek, and Beaver Creek, about west of Columbus and northeast of Dayton. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 58,662, while the Springfield metropolitan area had a population of 136,001 residents.

Springfield is home to Wittenberg University, a liberal arts college, and Clark State College, a community college. The Little Miami Scenic Trail, a paved rail-trail that is nearly long, extends from the Buck Creek Scenic Trail head in Springfield south to Newtown, Ohio. Buck Creek State Park and its Clarence J. Brown reservoir are located at the city limits.

==History==
===Before European settlement===

The original pre-contact inhabitants of Springfield were the Shawnee people.

During the 18th century, the Ohio Country saw warfare, waves of migration and displacement, and imposition of claims by rivaling colonial powers France and Britain. With the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the British became the sole European claimants of the region.

The area was home to the major Shawnee village in the region, called Peckuwe or Piqua. It belonged to the Shawnee septs (sub-clans) of Pekowi and Kispoko and had a population of about 3,000. It stood at 39° 54.5′ N, 83° 54.68′ W, less than four miles southwest of the current city of Springfield and less than six miles from its center.

During the Western theater of the American Revolutionary War, the area saw a major battle that pitted the Americans against the Shawnee and their indigenous allies. The Shawnees had formed an alliance with the British and the Lenape, the Wyandot, and the Mingo, refugees from warfare and displacements elsewhere, and had been raiding into Kentucky with the aim of driving out American settlers. On August 8, 1780, Piqua was attacked by American soldiers under the command of General George Rogers Clark. It was a ferocious battle that ended with the destruction of the Shawnee village and the exodus of its inhabitants. Clark&#x27;s men spent two days burning as much as 500 acres of corn surrounding the village.

Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief and warrior who later took part in the war of resistance against the U.S. and its expansionist settlement policy, lived in Piqua from 1777 until 1780.

The Springfield area was officially ceded to the United States by the Shawnee and their indigenous allies under the Treaty of Greenville on 1795, six years before the city was founded.

===Early settlement===
Springfield was founded in 1801 by European-American James Demint, a former teamster from Kentucky who named it for Springfield, Massachusetts. When Clark County was created in 1818 from parts of Champaign, Madison, and Greene counties, Springfield was chosen by the legislature over the village of New Boston as the county seat, winning by two votes.

Early growth in Springfield was stimulated by federal construction of the National Road, which was extended to the city in 1838. For about a decade thereafter, Springfield served as the western terminus while politicians wrangled over its future route. Representatives of Dayton and Eaton wanted the road to veer south after Springfield, but President Andrew Jackson, who took office in 1829, decided to push the road straight west to Richmond, Indiana.

===Industrial development===
During the mid-and-late 19th century, the manufacturing industry began to flourish in Springfield. Industrialists included Oliver S. Kelly, James Leffel, P. P. Mast, Benjamin H. Warder, and Asa S. Bushnell, who built the self-named Bushnell Building. Springfield became known as &quot;The Champion City&quot;, a reference to the Champion Farm Equipment brand.
Champion was manufactured by the Warder, Bushnell &amp; Glessner Company, absorbed into International Harvester in 1902.

International Harvester, a manufacturer of farm machinery and later trucks, became the leading local industry after 1856, when Springfield native William Whiteley invented a self-raking reaper and mower. In 1877, P. P. Mast started &quot;Farm &amp; Fireside&quot; magazine to promote the products of his agricultural equipment company. His publishing company, known as Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick, eventually developed as the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, best known for publishing &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly.&quot; International Harvester and Crowell-Collier Publishing would be the city&#x27;s major employers throughout most of the next century.

In 1894, The Kelly Springfield Tire Company was founded in the city. Harry Aubrey Toulmin, Sr., patent attorney to the Wright Brothers, wrote the 1904 patent to their invention of the airplane at the Bushnell Building, eventually granted to the brothers in 1906.

At the turn of the 20th century, Springfield became known as the &quot;Home City&quot;. It was a period of high activity by fraternal organizations, and such lodges as the Masonic Lodge, Knights of Pythias, and Odd Fellows built homes for orphans and aged members of their orders.
That same year, A.B. Graham, then the superintendent of schools for Springfield Township in Clark County, established a &quot;Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Agricultural Club&quot;. About 85 children, 10 to 15 years of age, attended the first meeting on January 15, 1902, in Springfield, in the basement of the Clark County Courthouse. This was the start of what would soon be called the &quot;4-H Club&quot;; it expanded to become a nationwide organization at a time when agriculture was a mainstay of the economy in many regions. The first projects included food preservation, gardening, and elementary agriculture. Today, a historical marker exists at the Clark County courthouse, and the Library of Congress officially recognized the birthplace in 2023.

On March 7, 1904, over a thousand white residents formed a lynch mob, stormed the jail, and removed prisoner Richard Dixon, a black man accused of killing police officer Charles B. Collis. Dixon was shot to death and then hanged from a pole on the corner of Fountain and Main Street, where the mob shot his body numerous times. From there, the mob rioted through the town, destroying and burning much of the black area. The events were covered by national newspapers and provoked outrage. On February 26, 1906, an altercation between a white man and a black man resulted in another riot. The rioters burned down much of the Levee, a predominantly black neighborhood located in a flood-prone area near the river. Nearly 100 people were left homeless. The final riot took place in 1921. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 14 people were killed during the unrest.

From 1916 to 1926, 10 automobile companies operated in Springfield. Among them were the Bramwell, Brenning, Foos, Frayer-Miller, Kelly Steam, Russell-Springfield, and Westcott. The Westcott, known as &quot;the car built to last&quot;, was a six-cylinder four-door sedan manufactured by Burton J. Westcott of the Westcott Motor Car Company.
In 1908, Westcott and his wife Orpha commissioned architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design their home at 1340 East High Street. The Westcott House, a sprawling two-story stucco and concrete house, has all the features of Wright&#x27;s &quot;prairie style&quot;, including horizontal lines, low-pitched roof, and broad eaves. Wright became world-renowned, and this is his only prairie-style house in the state of Ohio. In 2000, the property was purchased by the Chicago-based Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. As part of a prearranged plan, the house was sold to the Westcott House Foundation, a newly formed group that managed an extensive 5-year, $5.8 million restoration, completed in October 2005. The house is now open to the public for guided tours.

===Late 20th century to present===

Crowell-Collier Publishing, a longtime pillar of local employment, closed its magazines in 1957 and sold its Springfield printing plant. The city population peaked at more than 82,000 in the 1960 census.

In 1966, Robert C. Henry was appointed by the city commission as mayor, making him the first black mayor of an Ohio city.

In 1983, &quot;Newsweek&quot; called Springfield one of America&#x27;s &quot;dream cities&quot;. But the issue, which marked the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary issue, concluded that &quot;The American Dream&quot; was in decline.

The decline in manufacturing and other blue-collar industries in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries hit Springfield especially hard. In 2011, Gallup called Springfield the &quot;unhappiest city&quot; in the country. Its 27% decrease in median income between 1999 and 2014 was the largest of any metropolitan area in the country. By 2020, the population had declined to 58,662, down more than one-quarter from its peak.

By the mid-2010s, city leaders began revitalization of the downtown area, including residential housing, a parking garage and demolition of decayed structures. New downtown structures built since 2000 include the Ohio Valley Surgical Hospital, Springfield Regional Medical Center, Mother Stewart&#x27;s Brewing Company, and the Chiller Ice Arena. As of 2018, the economic recovery enjoyed by larger cities since the Great Recession had not included Springfield, despite efforts by local politicians and business organizations.

In 2021, the Upper Valley Mall, which had operated as the city&#x27;s retail hub since 1971, permanently closed.

====Immigrant influx====
In 2014, the city began the &quot;Welcome Springfield&quot; initiative to attract immigrants in an attempt to improve the local economy. About four years later, Haitian immigrants fleeing their country&#x27;s deepening crisis began to arrive.

By 2024, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian immigrants had settled in the city. The vast majority later received temporary protected status, which allows them to work without the fear of deportation, due to the crisis in Haiti. Many were drawn by jobs with Springfield&#x27;s growing manufacturing sector, which includes companies such as Topre, Silfex, and McGregor Metal.

The influx of Haitians triggered an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment among existing residents. In August 2023, tensions were aggravated when an improperly licensed Haitian driver crashed into a school bus, killing one child and injuring 23 others. In mid-2024, local politicians asked for federal assistance to fund an unexpected increased use of city services and to help with housing issues caused by the population increase. Community organizations have hired significant numbers of Haitian Creole translators.

==== National attention ====
In 2024, the city drew international attention over baseless claims about local Haitian immigrants, leading to dozens of bomb threats that forced school evacuations, government office closures, and other disruptions. On August 26, police received a report of Haitians stealing geese, for which neither law enforcement officials nor the Ohio Department of Natural Resources found any evidence or suspects. Soon thereafter, a rumor about Haitian immigrants abducting and eating pets in Springfield went viral. Springfield authorities debunked the rumor.

The claims were amplified by JD Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio and Republican vice-president, other Republican politicians, and right-wing commentators. On September 10, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump amplified the claims during his presidential debate with Kamala Harris. Over the following week, Trump repeated and embellished his lies, adding a vow to mass-deport &quot;migrants&quot; from Springfield. Meanwhile, unknown perpetrators began making dozens of bomb threats to Springfield schools, city officials and employees, and municipal offices, forcing several days of evacuations, lockdowns, closures, and cancellations. Five schools were evacuated during their school days, and two more closed for a day. City Hall and several municipal and county buildings were closed for one or more days. Two hospitals were locked down for part of a day. Two local colleges moved classes online for one or more days. The episode drew national and international attention to Springfield.

Haitian Americans in Springfield have faced race-based attacks due to these claims. After Donald Trump won the 2024 United States presidential election, some Haitians expressed an interest in moving out of Springfield.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The Clarence J. Brown Reservoir is located on the northeast outskirts of Springfield.

The per capita income for the city was $16,660. 16.9% of the population and 13.5% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 23.9% of those under the age of 18 and 9.6% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

===2020 census===

In 2015, Springfield&#x27;s violent crime reached a 14-year high, but this rate has since decreased.

==Economy==
Springfield has a notably weakened economy due to many factors, but a key cause for degradation of the economy in Springfield has been the decline in manufacturing jobs. Between 1999 and 2014, Springfield saw the median income decrease by 27 percent, compared to just 8 percent across the country. In the 1990s, Springfield lost 22,000 blue collar jobs, which were the backbone of the city economy. Today, Springfield largely relies on healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, leisure, education, financial institutions, and retail for employment.

==Government==

Wittenberg has more than 150 campus organizations, which include ten national fraternities and sororities. The WUSO radio station is operated on the campus.

The city is also home to Clark State College, which offers associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The Springfield and Clark County Technical Education Program opened in 1962 and began to offer technical training for residents of Springfield and surrounding communities, and was chartered as the Clark County Technical Institute on February 18, 1966, Ohio&#x27;s first technical college sanctioned by the Ohio Board of Regents.

The Clark County Public Library operates three public libraries within the city of Springfield.

<text>Amelia is an unincorporated community and former village in Pierce and Batavia townships in Clermont County, Ohio, United States. The population was 12,575 at the 2020 census. Amelia incorporated in 1900. In November 2019, residents voted to dissolve the village over the imposition of a local income tax. Amelia was by far the most populous village in state history to be dissolved and the first to be partitioned between two townships.

==History==
Amelia was not officially platted. The area was originally called Milltown, later shortened to Milton. However, when a post office was established in 1836, there was already a Milton Post Office in the state. Various accounts state that the post office was named Amelia after Amelia Bowdoin, a well known and popular tollkeeper on the Ohio Turnpike (present-day State Route 125). Her home is now known as the Amelia Bowdoin House and stands at 94 West Main Street, across the street from its original location. However, there is no census record of an Amelia Bowdoin; Amelia may have been a corruption of the name of Armilla Bodin, the wife of a tollkeeper. Amelia was incorporated as a village on December 20, 1900.

Amelia&#x27;s population rose from 4,801 in the 2010 census to an estimated 5,009 in 2018. Under state law, the village would have been required to become a city after it posted a population over 5,000 in the 2020 census. In preparation for becoming a city, it adopted a charter in November 2017, though the change in status was not reflected in the Ohio Secretary of State&#x27;s roster of municipalities. Among other changes, becoming a city would have protected Amelia from dissolution.

===Dissolution===
In 2008, Amelia Village Council proposed a one-percent income tax to cover maintenance of Ohio State Route 125 within the village. In response to the proposal, Amelia Residents for Fiscal Responsibility gathered a petition to dissolve the village into Pierce and Batavia townships. The Clermont County Board of Elections initially rejected the petition after invalidating many of the signatures, but the group succeeded in adding the initiative to a May 5, 2009, special election. Amelia survived the election by a margin of 865 to 401.

On February 5, 2018, the council unanimously adopted the proposed one-percent income tax in an emergency ordinance, without the usual three readings, to meet a deadline imposed by the Regional Income Tax Authority. The tax went into effect on July 1, 2018, making Amelia the last village in Clermont County to impose an income tax after cuts to the state&#x27;s local government fund and one of more than 600 cities and villages in Ohio that tax income. Former councilmember Renee Gerber subsequently led a petition drive for dissolution. A June 29 council meeting became heated over the tax and dissolution campaign.

On November 5, 2019, residents voted to dissolve the village by a margin of 843 to 479. Amelia was split between Pierce and Batavia townships along State Route 125. Newtonsville residents voted for dissolution the same day. Dissolution took effect at 10:00 AM on November 25, 2019, when the election results were certified. Gerber was elected to serve as the village&#x27;s final mayor during a yearlong transition period under the oversight of the Ohio State Auditor, but upon the auditor&#x27;s advice, Hart was retained to carry out the village&#x27;s remaining administrative responsibilities. Amelia residents will continue to pay the one-percent income tax until at least $ in debt is paid off. Amelia was by far the most populous village in state history to be dissolved and the first to be partitioned between two townships.

<text>Mount Carmel is a census-designated place (CDP) in Union Township, Clermont County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,828 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Mt. Carmel is one of the oldest communities in Union Township. In 1788 surveyor John Obannon and his team came in this mostly unsettled area to prepare for building and developing new homes and businesses. It was mostly inhabited by Revolutionary War soldiers. Their property was basically payment for fighting the battles through the Ohio Land Grant. This could have included several hundred acres.

A pioneer from New Jersey, John Rose who was one of the first to settle there in 1796, is actually considered the father of Mt. Carmel. The only historical sign of his presence today is a very small graveyard where he is buried, going down Rose Hill entering Hamilton County. According to one historian, Rose may have picked the name from the Bible.

The Catawba grape industry was a thriving business in the Ohio River Valley because it was hearty enough to withstand the harsh Ohio winters, Farmers in the Mt. Carmel and surrounding area took advantage of this and grape arbors were popping up throughout Union Township contributing to the distinction of the state leading the country in wine production by 1860.

A post office was established in 1887 however it was being built outside the village limits so East Mt Carmel was created so it could take advantage of the benefits. After a few years though the post office was redesignated as Summerside, Ohio. By the twentieth century the Summerside and the nearby Glen Este post offices were both closed and were moved to Newtown, farther west. Recently the Newtown office closed and now the closest post office is on Nagel Road in Anderson Township.

<text>New Richmond, also known as New Richmond on the Ohio, is a village in Ohio and Pierce townships in Clermont County, Ohio, United States, founded in 1814, along the Ohio River. The population was 2,727 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
New Richmond is located within Ohio Township, with the exception of the Beckjord Power Station, which lies within Pierce Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==
New Richmond was once the largest and most flourishing village in Clermont County. Located along the banks of the Ohio River, it had a superior location about twenty miles east and south of Cincinnati.

Present-day New Richmond was surveyed on June 3, 1778, consisting of Robert Beal&#x27;s survey No. 847 (purchased by Gen. William Lytle and sold to Thomas Ashburn in 1813) and David Jackson&#x27;s survey No. 1539 (purchased by Jacob Light in 1804). Light laid out the village on September 19–22, 1814, reportedly with the help of his nephew, who suggested the name of his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. In February 1816, Ashburn platted the village of Susanna (named for his second wife) adjoining the upper east side of New Richmond. Among the principal features of Susanna was a large promenade along the Ohio River which still exists today as Captain Ernest Wagner Park.

In 1817, the Ohio General Assembly formed Brown County out of Clermont County&#x27;s eastern half, leaving Clermont County&#x27;s courthouse in Williamsburgh at the far eastern edge of the county. In 1823, despite opposition in Williamsburgh, the General Assembly moved the county seat to New Richmond. No courthouse was ever built there; only a year later, a central location for the county seat was found in Batavia.

Although New Richmond and Susanna complimented each other, the General Assembly passed an act on January 11, 1828, that merged them as the Village of New Richmond.

In 1833, New Richmond contained one gristmill, one saw mill, two carding machines, ten stores, two churches, and 120 residential houses.

The residents of New Richmond took an early stance against slavery. The abolitionist James G. Birney began publishing &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; in New Richmond until moving it to Cincinnati in 1836.

New Richmond was a busy hub of steamboat building with names such as &quot;Allegheny&quot;, &quot;Zephyr&quot;, Lancasters &quot;No. 1&quot;, &quot;No. 2&quot;, &quot;No. 3&quot;, and &quot;No. 4&quot;, &quot;William Tell&quot;, and &quot;Clermont&quot;.

Most of New Richmond lies on the floodplain of the Ohio River, making it vulnerable to severe flooding. Some of the first recorded floods occurred in 1898, 1907, and 1913. In the Great Flood of 1937, the worst natural disaster in New Richmond&#x27;s history, the village lost 250 homes out of 415 total. Floods in 1955, 1964, 1967, 1997 and 2018 again devastated the village. The March 1997 flood sent of floodwaters &quot;the color of coffee with milk&quot; up Center Street and into the homes of about two-thirds of the village&#x27;s population of 2,500. Houses were found covered in &quot;several feet of river slime&quot;, and the New Richmond School District closed for at least a week. Residents relied on personal boats for transportation between rooftops or for evacuation. Governor George Voinovich visited New Richmond High School, which was being used as a Red Cross shelter for flood victims.

On March 2, 2011, the Clermont County Commissioners denied a petition by New Richmond to withdraw from Ohio township by forming a paper township.

<text>Newtonsville is an unincorporated community and former village in Clermont County, Ohio, United States. The population was 392 at the 2010 census. In 2019, residents voted to dissolve the village.

==History==
Newtonsville was platted on March 30, 1838, by Stephen Whitaker and Cornelius Washburn. A post office called Newtonsville has been in operation since 1847. In the 19th century, the village was home to a gristmill and chair factory. The village gradually lost business after World War I.

In 2016, the Ohio State Auditor placed the village in a state of fiscal caution due to poor bookkeeping. Despite levying a one-percent income tax, Newtonsville ran a deficit of $112,000 by 2019, prompting the auditor to declare a state of fiscal emergency in the village. On November 5, 2019, residents passed an initiative to dissolve the village and return it to Wayne Township by a margin of 53 to 46. Amelia residents voted for dissolution the same day. Dissolution took effect at 10:00 AM on November 25, 2019, when the election results were certified. A transition process up to a year long was overseen by the Ohio State Auditor.

<text>Neubrandenburg (, Low German &quot;Niegenbramborg&quot;, both lit. &quot;New Brandenburg&quot;) is a city in the southeast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is located on the shore of a lake called Tollensesee and forms the urban centre of the Mecklenburg Lakeland.

The city is famous for its rich medieval heritage of Brick Gothic architecture, including the world&#x27;s best preserved defensive wall of this style as well as a Concert Church (Saint Mary), the home venue of the Neubrandenburg Philharmonic. It is part of the European Route of Brick Gothic, a route which leads through seven countries along the Baltic Sea coast. Neubrandenburg is nicknamed for its four medieval city gates - &quot;Stadt der Vier Tore&quot; (&quot;City of Four Gates&quot;).

Since 2011, Neubrandenburg has been the capital of the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district. It is the third-largest city and one of the main urban centres of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The city is an economical node of northeastern Germany, featuring one of the highest national ranks in employment density and GDP per capita. The closest greater urban areas are the regiopolis of Rostock and the metropolises of Szczecin, Berlin and Hamburg. Since 1991, Neubrandenburg has hosted a University of Applied Sciences that offers international exchanges, guest programs and study programs.

==History==

The region had been left largely empty during the Migration Period and was re-settled by Slavs who then formed the Veleti, starting in the 7th century. Frankish and Saxon influence increased since the late 8th century but suffered several setbacks. After final subjugation by the Saxons in the mid-12th century, German colonisation greatly intensified after 1200. The first Christian monks in the area were Premonstratensians at Broda Abbey, a monastery by the lakeshore (about 1240). The foundation of the city known as of Neubrandenburg took place in 1248, when the Margrave of Brandenburg decided to build a settlement in the northern part of his fief, naming it after the older city of Brandenburg further south. In 1292, the city and the surrounding area became part of Mecklenburg.

The city flourished as a trade centre until the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48), when this position was lost due to incessant warfare. During the dramatic advance of the Swedish army of Gustavus Adolphus into Germany, the city was garrisoned by Swedes, but it was retaken by Imperial Catholic League forces in 1631. During this campaign, it was widely reported that the Catholic forces killed many of the Swedish and Scottish soldiers while they were surrendering. Later, according to the Scottish soldier of fortune Robert Munro, 18th Baron of Foulis, when the Swedes themselves adopted a &quot;no prisoners&quot; policy, they would cut short any pleas for mercy with the cry of &quot;New Brandenburg!&quot;. The city, therefore, played an unconscious role in the escalation of brutality of one of history&#x27;s most brutal wars.

Neubrandenburg was one of two &quot;Vorderstädte&quot; (lit. primary cities) of the duchy of Mecklenburg, i.e. it represented the interests of the cities and towns at the regional assembly (the &quot;Landtag&quot; or diet). From 1701 to 1934, it formed a part of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a small, primarily rural, and socio-economically backward state of northeastern Germany, being its largest or second-largest city (closely tied with Neustrelitz, the capital). From 1856 to 1863, Fritz Reuter, the most successful author of Low German literature and one of the best-sold German authors of the 19th century, lived here. In 1864, Neubrandenburg was connected to Berlin by railway, and developed some modest industry, mostly connected with the needs of the predominant agricultural sector of the region.

Under Nazism, an airbase was built at nearby Trollenhagen and a facility for torpedo trials was established in Lake Tollense. The city&#x27;s rural situation far from any borders shielded it from air attacks for some time. During the Second World War, two German prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs of various nationalities were located in Fünfeichen within the city limits: the large Stalag II-A and the adjacent Oflag II-E/67 for officers. The same site was operated from 1945 to 1948 as special NKVD-camp Nr. 9. The town was also the location of a forced labour camp for Sinti and Romani people. In 1945, a few days before the end of the Second World War, 80% of the old town was burned down by the Red Army in a great fire that destroyed, inter alia, City Hall (incl. most of the Municipal Archives), the Grand Ducal Palace (incl. the Municipal Arts Collections) and St. Mary&#x27;s Church. About 600 people committed suicide in fear of or as a result of the Soviet advance. 

After the war, within the newly-founded Socialist GDR (East Germany), the city centre was slowly rebuilt in the 1950s and 60s in a simplified neoclassicist and neo-Renaissance style. Large numbers of refugees from Germany&#x27;s former eastern territories and from Czechoslovakia were resettled in the city. Neubrandenburg was designated the centre of a &quot;Bezirk&quot;, the highest tier of administrative divisions in East Germany, in 1952. As such, the city was supposed to embody the vision of a &quot;Socialist city&quot; and was to be greatly expanded and industrialised. Population increased from about 20,000 at war&#x27;s end to about 90,000 in the late 1980s. Large panel-type housing estates were built in several parts of the city. The demolished market square area was reshaped by the &quot;Haus der Kultur und Bildung&quot; (House of Culture and Education), a Socialist-style civic centre, complemented by a 56 m highrise. Brigitte Reimann, a prominent GDR writer whose works deal with the attempt at building a Socialist society, spent her last years (1968-1973) in the city.

As in all of East Germany, the reunification of Germany in 1990 brought an improvement of political and social freedoms but also a deep socio-economic crisis with large-scale unemployment and emigration. The population sharply dropped, stabilising at about 65,000 people (2023), with some of those losses, however, just going to surrounding bedroom communities. The economic situation finally slowly improved, many historical buildings were renovated, e.g. St. Mary&#x27;s Church that was refurbished as a concert hall. The University of Applied Sciences was founded in 1991, focusing on social work, health, agriculture and food industry. After 1990, Neubrandenburg lost its position as a &quot;Bezirk&quot; centre and remained an autonomous district-level city (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) within the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In 2011, it emerged as the capital of a huge new district Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, the largest in Germany, with an area slightly more than half that of its former &quot;Bezirk&quot;.

Neubrandenburg has preserved its medieval city wall in its entirety. The wall, 7 m high with a perimeter of 2.3 km, has four Brick Gothic city gates, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries. Of these, one of the most impressive is the &quot;Stargarder Tor&quot; (pictured), with its characteristic gable-like shape and the filigree tracery and rosettes on the outer defence side.

Another place of interest is the Brick Gothic Marienkirche (Church of the Virgin Mary or St. Mary&#x27;s Church, &quot;Konzertkirche&quot;), completed 1298. The church was nearly destroyed in 1945, but it was restored in 1975 and now houses a concert hall (opened 2001).

The tallest highrise in the city is the 56 m tower of the Haus der Kultur und Bildung (HKB, House of Culture &amp; Education), opened in 1965. Its slender appearance has earned it the nickname &quot;Kulturfinger&quot; (&quot;culture finger&quot;).

Other attractions include Neubrandenburg Regional Museum.

==Education==
* Hochschule Neubrandenburg (&quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot;)
* Three large secondary schools

==Sports==
Neubrandenburg is known as city of sports (&quot;Sportstadt&quot;). The city is famous for being home to various Olympic medal winners and talents in sports, especially in canoeing (Andreas Dittmer, Martin Hollstein), discus throwing and shotputting (Astrid Kumbernuss, Ralf Bartels, Franka Dietzsch) and running (Katrin Krabbe). Neubrandenburg was the location of both of the world record throws in Discus, by Jürgen Schult in 1986 and by Gabriele Reinsch in 1988. The &quot;Jahnstadion&quot;, the &quot;Jahnsportforum&quot; stadium, the &quot;Stadthalle&quot; and adjacent sport parks offer vast options for large sport and culture events. The city is also home to a dedicated sports elite school, the &quot;Sportgymnasium Neubrandenburg&quot;.

The Günter Harder Stadion was a multi purpose stadium that existed from 1949 to circa 1996. It hosted football and motorcycle speedway and held qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1964 and 1965.

==Economy==
In the early 1950s, the city became home to a number of U.S. Department of Defense facilities, most notably the Clinton County Air Force Base. Following its closure in 1971, the economy of the city hovered in recession for more than a decade. After a number of small attempts to reuse the abandoned air force base, Airborne Express purchased the facility in 1979 for $850,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million spent to construct it. During the next 24 years, Airborne invested more than $250 million to build a hub for its national delivery network, including new sort centers, a runway, aircraft hangars, machine shops, flight simulators, a state of art control tower, and a modern administration building to accommodate an estimated 6,000 employees and its fleet of 125 DC-8, DC-9 and Boeing 767 aircraft.

In 2003, Airborne Express reorganized and ABX Air, Inc., was created. ABX Air is a contract freight forwarding business whose primary customer is DHL, one of the world&#x27;s largest international shipping firms. ABX&#x27;s parent company, Air Transport Services Group, is based in Wilmington. Owned by the Deutsche Post WorldNet, a German holding company, DHL consolidated its US flight and sorting hub operations in Wilmington in 2005. Restructuring in May 2008 resulted in eight thousand layoffs, and six months later the Wilmington hub was closed, resulting in another eight thousand layoffs.

The facility closed in July 2009, and DHL moved to a much smaller sorting operation at the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport. Wilmington&#x27;s airport hosts a comparatively smaller Maintenance Repair and Overhaul venture, along with Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, employing several hundred employees under the auspices of the ABX Air parent company, ATSG (Air Transport Services Group).

On July 16, 2009, the Wilmington City Council voted unanimously to establish Wilmington as a &quot;Green Enterprise Zone&quot;. The legislation will facilitate green economic development by creating financial incentives for the creation of green collar jobs. The City Council passed the measure in response to an economic grassroots movement initiated in October 2008 by two Wilmington High School graduates, Mark Rembert and Taylor Stuckert, aided by Pure Blue Energy, LLC a consulting firm out of North Carolina. Wilmington is the first city in the United States to pass such a law.

The AZEK Company has its main manufacturing plant in Wilmington, and produces composite decking and railing systems under the TimberTech &amp; AZEK brands. In 2018, with the Green Enterprise Zone initiative in place, the AZEK Company opened a state-of-the-art polyethylene recycling plant in Wilmington Airpark which recycles post-industrial and post-consumer polyethylene and PVC, and makes it into raw material for TimberTech decking.

Wilmington is also home to CMH Regional Health System, a regional health provider. From its base of operations at Clinton Memorial Hospital, the non-profit corporation has established health clinics in almost a dozen satellite locations in Southwestern Ohio. In 2007, CMH opened the Foster J. Boyd, MD, Regional Cancer Center in Wilmington, providing cancer treatment services for patients throughout Southwest Ohio. The hospital in Wilmington has 95 staffed beds, and employed nearly 1000 people as of fiscal year 2006. The hospital also offers a six-bed Intensive Care Unit, a dedicated Emergency Room (with an average of over 30,000 visits from 2004–2006), an Obstetrics Unit (with 725 births in FY 2006), Surgical services (6,356 surgical procedures and 1,184 endoscopies FY 2006), Medical-Telemetry care, Medical-Surgical and Pediatric care, Physical Rehabilitation, Nuclear Medicine and CT services, and a Sleep Study center, amongst other various professional services at the hospital. RegionalCare Hospital Partners of Brentwood, Tennessee, purchased Clinton Memorial Hospital on November 30, 2010. The total sale price after adjustments was $82,137,477.

In addition to air freight services and medical services, the city of Wilmington also competes in the truck freight industry, serving as corporate home to R+L Carriers, a trucking and shipping company located off of the intersection between U.S. 68 and I-71 north of Wilmington.

==Arts and culture==

Wilmington is situated within one hour driving distance to Dayton, Cincinnati, and Columbus. In the mid 1990s, the annual Banana Split Festival was started to commemorate the town&#x27;s alleged creation of the famous treat in Wilmington in 1907. In addition, each year the city hosts the Clinton County Corn Festival, which pays homage to the agricultural tradition of the county. In 2007, a new festival, the Hometown Holidazzle, was started, taking place in the late fall. Aside from the annual events, Wilmington played host to a festival each year that a new &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book was released. Thousands would gather in downtown Wilmington at the Books &#x27;N&#x27; More bookstore and surrounding businesses to celebrate each release.

Located in the downtown business district is the historic Murphy Theatre, which can be seen in the film &quot;Lost In Yonkers&quot;, part of which was filmed in the city in the early 1990s. It is also the setting of Michael Moore&#x27;s 2016 documentary film, &quot;Michael Moore in TrumpLand&quot;. The Murphy Theater stages productions throughout the year from various acts and ensembles as well as staging musicals and plays from neighboring school districts in the county. More recently, the Murphy is home to free screenings of classic movies, sponsored by a community group. The Murphy Theatre saw the marriage of actor John Ritter and wife Amy Yasbeck on September 18, 1999, with the marquee simply stating &quot;Congratulations John and Amy.&quot; Nearby in downtown Wilmington is the historic General Denver Hotel, which is named in honor of General James W. Denver, founder of the city of Denver, Colorado. General James Denver is also buried in Wilmington.

In addition, two college campuses are located in the city. Most notable is the campus of Wilmington College, a Quaker established college that dates from the nineteenth century, which focuses on liberal arts education with themes of global peace and understanding and majors in agriculture, education, athletic training, and small business. Southern State Community College operates its North Campus in Wilmington, with other campuses in Washington Court House, Hillsboro, and Sardinia, with primary focus on transfer credits and health sciences, such as Nursing and Medical Assisting and Respiratory Therapy, as well as a Practical Nursing.

<text>Calcutta is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in St. Clair Township, Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,941 at the 2020 census. Historically a rural town, Calcutta developed in the late 20th century as businesses from neighboring East Liverpool moved into larger shopping centers clustered around Ohio State Route 170.

==History==
The first permanent settlement in the area was in 1792 or 1793, by hunter John Quinn. Calcutta was laid out in 1810 as West Union. It had also been called Foulkstown after William Foulks, who built the first brick house there, as well as Nineveh, after the Biblical city of the same name. Finally, it was renamed after the Indian city of Kolkata, formerly Anglicized as Calcutta. A post office called Calcutta was established in 1838, and remained in operation until 1913.

==Geography==
Calcutta is located near the center of St. Clair Township in southeastern Columbiana County. The Calcutta CDP extends southwest as far as the U.S. Route 30 expressway, and east and north as far Little Beaver Creek, touching the Pennsylvania state line where the creek crosses the border briefly. The CDP is bordered by Longs Run, a tributary of Little Beaver Creek, on the northwest. To the southwest of Calcutta, across US 30, is the CDP of Glenmoor. The city of East Liverpool is to the south via St. Clair Avenue.

The following highways pass through Calcutta:
* U.S. Route 30
* State Route 11
* State Route 170

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Calcutta CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.11%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 3,491 people, 1,417 households, and 1,025 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 1,473 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.51% White, 0.17% African American, 0.06% Native American, 0.72% Asian, 0.09% from other races, and 0.46% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.66% of the population.

There were 1,417 households, out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.2% were married couples living together, 7.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.6% were non-families. 25.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 2.84.

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 20.6% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 23.7% from 25 to 44, 27.4% from 45 to 64, and 22.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females there were 86.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $36,194, and the median income for a family was $45,750. Males had a median income of $41,077 versus $21,352 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $19,536. About 3.0% of families and 8.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.1% of those under age 18 and 9.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
Since Calcutta is unincorporated, it does not have a government of its own. Governance is deflected to St. Clair Township, which also governs the community of Glenmoor, Ohio and the surrounding rural area. The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Education==
Children in Calcutta are served by the Beaver Local School District. The current schools serving Calcutta are:
* Beaver Local Elementary School – grades K-4
* Beaver Local Middle School – grades 5-8
* Beaver Local High School – grades 9-12

<text>East Liverpool is a city in southeastern Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 9,958 at the 2020 census. It lies along the Ohio River at the intersection of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia about from both Pittsburgh and Youngstown. The city is most notable for its pottery industry, which was at one time the largest in the US.

==History==

Native American petroglyphs exist in the area surrounding East Liverpool, including on Babbs Island and near the Little Beaver Creek. Before the arrival of European Americans, Mingo, Lenape, and Wyandot peoples lived in the area until the Battle of Fallen Timbers led to the Ohio Country&#x27;s settlement. The Public Land Survey System of the United States was established by Congressional legislation in 1785 in order to provide an orderly mechanism for opening the Northwest Territory for settlement. The ordinance directed the Geographer of the United States, Thomas Hutchins, to survey an initial east–west base line. Hutchins began in 1786, using as his starting point a stake on north bank of the Ohio River placed by a 1785 survey team from Virginia and Pennsylvania to fix their common north–south boundary. Hutchins&#x27; work, completed in 1787, established the Seven Ranges. This survey is believed to be &quot;the first mathematically designed system and nationally conducted cadastral survey in any modern country.&quot;

East Liverpool traces its founding to 1798 when Irish immigrant Thomas Fawcett purchased 1,100 acres of land along the Ohio River in what was then Jefferson County. In 1802, he platted the town of St. Clair, named for Governor Arthur St. Clair of the Northwest Territory. It was called Fawcettstown for a time, before being renamed Liverpool in 1816, after Liverpool, England. Over its first few decades, a grist mill, multiple stores, and wharves opened in the town. The first schoolhouse opened in 1820, and the first religious center opened in 1834 when an Episcopal Church was established on a 4th Street site provided by town developers. Liverpool was incorporated as East Liverpool in 1834 to avoid confusion with Liverpool Township, Medina County, Ohio.

Although Pittsburgh-based entrepreneurs invested in the town, it was smaller during this period than the nearby towns of New Lisbon and Wellsville. The arrival of English potter James Bennett in 1839 brought the establishment of the first bottle kiln site in East Liverpool, launching the town&#x27;s largest industry and bringing in multiple waves of Western European immigration throughout the late 19th century. By 1880, East Liverpool had grown to be the largest city in the county. In 1905, the first city hospital opened.

Another large employer outside of that industry was the Crucible Steel Company in nearby Midland, Pennsylvania. As of 1914, East Liverpool was served by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. On October 22, 1934, local police and FBI agents led by Melvin Purvis shot and killed notorious bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd in a cornfield north of town after Floyd fled East Liverpool, and his body was returned to the town for embalming.
The western downtown area was cleared in the 1960s to make way for the 4-lane expansion of Ohio State Route 11. The city reached its peak population of more than 26,000 in 1970, but its pottery industry had already begun to decline by the mid-1960s. As with other industries, production moved to developing countries where labor costs were cheaper. This cost many jobs and, ultimately, population in the Upper Ohio Valley area, as people moved away in search of work. Many of the city&#x27;s downtown businesses withdrew to strip malls in nearby Calcutta or left the area outright.

In 1963, a toxic waste incinerator was erected at an S. H. Bell Company warehouse in East Liverpool. Local investors believed the incinerator could be an alternative to the declining ceramics industry. In 2008, concerns were raised about toxic particles affecting East Liverpool residents&#x27; health, particularly manganese, which was found in high concentrations. East Liverpool residents were found to have higher than normal levels of manganese, cadmium, and lead in their blood, and the community was considered to be in a health crisis due to the presence of these toxic elements. Government agencies worked with S. H. Bell to decrease the toxic metals being released into the surrounding air and land, and from 2006 to 2013 air quality improved. In 2014, hazardous and toxic particles in air quality assessments increased. Activism to reduce the toxic waste began. In 2005, the EPA declared the area surrounding the incinerator a &quot;potential environmental justice area&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, the city renovated its downtown district. To improve its urban design, it installed Depression-era lightposts, developed a new center called Devon&#x27;s Diamond, and reconstructed the old high school&#x27;s clock tower. In 2010, East Liverpool lost its position as the most populous city in the county to Salem after 130 years and was later withdrawn from being a principal city in the micropolitan area.

===Pottery industry===

The potteries of East Liverpool became the national center of ceramic toilet and table wares, with 85 firms operating at one time or another making two-thirds of the national output from 1880 to 1950. East Liverpool&#x27;s pottery district encompasses East Liverpool and the surrounding towns of Wellsville, Ohio, and Chester and Newell, West Virginia, directly across the Ohio River. In 1887, East Liverpool had 21 general ware potteries that employed 2,558 operatives. By 1923 the 17 firms had 7,000 employees and operated 270 kilns, with $25,000,000 in annual output.

Englishman James Bennett established the industry in 1839, making use of good transportation and rich local clays. It quickly became the community&#x27;s leading industry. East Liverpool became known as &quot;The Crockery City.&quot; Potters from Staffordshire, England, began pouring into East Liverpool, attracted by higher wages and the prospect of land ownership. By 1879, there were 24 potteries in East Liverpool, nearly all operated by English immigrants. As late as 1900, East Liverpool remained &quot;essentially a transplanted potting town of Englishmen&quot;. Until the turn of the century about 85% percent of the population could trace its heritage to England. After the English, the second largest ethnic group in East Liverpool were German settlers. From 1870 to 1890, the city more than doubled in population each decade as it attracted new industrial workers with the growth of the pottery industry. By 1910, its population exceeded 20,000. At various times, some of the largest potteries included the East Liverpool Pottery, Knowles, Taylor &amp; Knowles; Taylor, Smith &amp; Taylor; The Hall China Company, and Homer Laughlin China Company.

Of these potteries, two continue to operate in the area: the American Mug &amp; Stein Company and the Fiesta Tableware Company, formerly Homer Laughlin. In the mid-19th century, East Liverpool also produced most of the yellowware pottery used in the United States. Among the most famous of East Liverpool&#x27;s ceramics was the porcelain known as Lotus Ware. Produced by Knowles, Taylor &amp; Knowles in the 1890s, this Moorish- and Persian-influenced artware swept the competition at the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago. The Museum of Ceramics in downtown East Liverpool has the world&#x27;s largest public display of Lotus Ware.

Holly Black&#x27;s ceramic-themed novel &quot;Doll Bones&quot; is set in East Liverpool due to its history in the industry.

Due to being the home of a large industry with many wealthy business owners, 16 different properties and three historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in addition to the Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey, the only National Historic Landmark in Columbiana County.

The Diamond Historic District is at the one-sided traffic diamond between Market Street and East Sixth Street. The area is triangular, bounded by three roads. Buildings at the Diamond date back to 1884. The East Fifth Street Historic District consists of three blocks of downtown East Liverpool along East Fifth street between Market Street and Broadway, listed due to its examples of Neoclassical architecture. East Liverpool Downtown Historic District covers the whole of downtown in 22 acres, and is noted for its Italianate and Second Empire architecture as well as its prominence as a commercial center in East Liverpool&#x27;s history.

Many historic properties in East Liverpool were the homesteads of prominent business owners throughout the late 19th century. These include the Cassius Clark Thompson House (1876), Ikirt House (1888), Homer Laughlin House (1882), Godwin-Knowles House (1890), and the Richard L. Cawood Residence (1923), all of unique architectural styles.

<text>East Palestine ( ) is a village in northeastern Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,761 at the 2020 census. Located on the state&#x27;s border with Pennsylvania, East Palestine is about south of Youngstown and northwest of Pittsburgh.

The city was home to industries in ceramics and tire manufacturing from the 1870s until the mid-1960s. East Palestine is located along the Norfolk Southern Railway and has a freight train station. On February 3, 2023, the village was near the site of a major train derailment that spilled vinyl chloride and triggered significant evacuations in the jurisdiction.

==History==

East Palestine was platted in 1828 by Thomas McCalla and William Grate, initially known as Mechanicsburg. In 1833, it was renamed after the Middle Eastern region of Palestine. The name was changed as part of a religious nomenclature in the area, including communities such as Enon Valley, Medina, New Galilee and Salem. However, Palestine, Ohio, was already an incorporated community in the western part of the state, so the town was incorporated as East Palestine in 1875. Having reached a population of 5,000, East Palestine operated as a statutory city from 1920 until 2011 when it reverted to village status because of declining population.

By the 1920s, railroad facilities of the city consisted of the four-track Pennsylvania Railroad system. Switches from the within one mile of the corporation limits connected with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and New York Central Railroad. The city&#x27;s leading industries were the manufacture of pottery by the W. S. George Pottery Company and automobile tires by the Edwin C. McGraw Tire Company. However, factories also existed that produced steel tanks, foundry work, electrical refractories, food products, electric wiring devices, wooden ventilators, fireproofing material, synthetic ice, and lumber. Around this time, East Palestine began to start an economy in orcharding, which still survives today. Large storage and preserving facilities made East Palestine the leading city for orchards in the area.

East Palestine became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 2004.

Beginning in October 2022, the East Palestine Fire Department began rolling out a new emergency response system based on the &quot;MyID&quot; digital health identity platform. A community information session was held on January 29, 2023, with 60 participants signed up for the program.

=== 2023 train derailment ===

On February 3, 2023, an explosion and fire occurred following the derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying hazardous chemicals on the eastern end of town. A state of emergency was declared by the village council on February 4. An evacuation area was extended by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on February 6 to allow for &quot;a controlled release of vinyl chloride&quot; and burning it in a nearby trench. Some residents subsequently started a class-action lawsuit against Norfolk Southern, citing new respiratory issues and unknown environmental impacts. Contamination remained in many homes &amp; buildings closest to the train wreckage for over a year according to the residents of East Palestine. Plus, residents, clean-up workers and bystanders were chemically exposed prompting breathing problems and other upper-respiratory health symptoms that were similar to those found in the first responders of the 9/11 event in New York City.

<text>Hanoverton is a village in western Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 354 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Hanoverton was laid out in 1813 by Quaker abolitionist James Craig, and incorporated as a village in 1836. Hanoverton experienced growth in the 1830s by the building of the Sandy and Beaver Canal through the town, reaching a peak population in the late decade of around 2,000 inhabitants. Growth slowed into the 1840s, and by the 1852 completion of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad the canal was no longer profitable and the town declined.

Hanoverton played a part in the Underground Railroad. An underground passage connected George Sloan&#x27;s &quot;Brick Row&quot; with his brother-in-law Dr. James Robertson&#x27;s home across the street, where runaway slaves were taken to a secret room. The Spread Eagle Tavern also was connected to a secret tunnel. In 1977 a 23-acre area of Hanoverton was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Hanoverton Canal Town District. The district is noted for canal-era architecture which is largely unchanged since construction in the mid-1800s.

More recently, the town has hosted various political speakers, including Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney, John McCain, and JD Vance at the Spread Eagle Tavern.

<text>Leetonia is a village in northern Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,833 at the 2020 census. It is about south of Youngstown.

==History==
The Village of Leetonia was founded in 1869, following the American Civil War. Leetonia was named for William Lee of Randolph, New York. Lee was one of the founders of the Leetonia Iron and Coal Company which was laid out in the village in 1866-1867.

===Cherry Valley Coke Ovens===
Leetonia is home to one of the few remaining Beehive oven sites in America. In the early 1860s, Irish businessman William Lee discovered rich deposits of coal, ore and lime under the soil of today&#x27;s Leetonia. Lee began to buy the surrounding land and established the company &quot;The Leetonia Coal &amp; Iron Company&quot; which consisted of a coal mine, coke ovens, and a blast furnace. This company jumped into the iron and coal industry and soon turned the area into a thriving company town. The area went from housing three families in 1864 to 1,800 people by 1869 when it was incorporated.

The coke production was the main operation of the company. Leetonia Coal &amp; Iron would mine the surrounding areas for coal and then cart coal by the tons into the coke ovens on rails above the ovens. The workers would then shovel the coal into the coke ovens to cook. This would purify the coal into a purer product of coal called coke which was then shipped off to the iron mills to be used in smelting iron. Coke has a much higher temperature point than regular coal so it was preferred for use in the mills.

Each coke oven is about 12 feet in diameter and 6 to 7 feet in height with the capacity to hold two to three tons of coal each. While still using 100 ovens, Leetonia Coal &amp; Iron would process 250 tons of coal into coke per day. However, in 1873, the company was bought out and renamed &quot;The Cherry Valley Iron and Coal Company&quot;, who expanded operations and eventually had over 200 coke ovens and 4 blast furnaces; processing much more coal than ever before. Financial troubles hit the company during the Great Depression and the ovens were closed permanently.

The site was donated to the village of Leetonia for a park in 1982, and, in 1986, the village council appointed a commission to transform the area into a park.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

One of the features of the downtown district is steep streets, heading north out of the village. The railroad tracks of the Norfolk Southern go through the village heading east and west.

<text>Lisbon is the county seat of Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,597 at the 2020 census. Lying along the Little Beaver Creek, the village is located southwest of Youngstown.

==History==

Lisbon was platted on February 16, 1803, by Baptist minister Lewis Kinney, originally named New Lisbon after Lisbon, Portugal. The village was incorporated under a special act of legislature on February 7, 1825.

Initially known for its iron and whiskey production, New Lisbon became an economic hub of many sorts into the Industrial Revolution, and one of the largest towns on the Sandy and Beaver Canal. During this time, the village claimed the county&#x27;s first bank, the Columbiana Bank of New Lisbon; its first insurance company, and the first Ohio newspaper, &quot;The Ohio Patriot&quot;, founded by an Alsatian immigrant, William D. Lepper.

Lisbon has the distinction of being the northernmost western town involved in military actions during the American Civil War. Confederate Army general John Hunt Morgan surrendered to New Lisbon militia forces in nearby West Point at the end of Morgan&#x27;s Raid into Ohio. 

After the failure of the canal, the town had to wait until the late 1860s to receive railroad access once the Niles and New Lisbon Railroad opened. It and the later Pittsburgh, Marion &amp; Chicago Railway helped bring industry to the area, including the porcelain manufacturing R. Thomas and Sons Company. The village was renamed Lisbon in 1895. 

In 1900, the modern drinking straw was invented and patented in Lisbon.

In 1899, Jacob L. Beilhart founded the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community to practice his newly developed beliefs, in Lisbon. Its goal was to &quot;teach mankind how to apply the truths taught by Jesus Christ,&quot; which included a rejection of jealousy and materialism. The commune only attracted about a dozen residents, mostly from outside the area. However, views against marriage and promoting free love were not accepted well in Lisbon, and the group left for Chicago in late 1904.

Lisbon became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 1981.

==Geography==
Lisbon is located at (40.773874, -80.767553).

The following highways pass through Lisbon:

The school&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Blue Devils. In 1995, the Lisbon Blue Devils boys football team won the OHSAA Division V State Championship against Mariemont High School, the only such championship in football to be held by a Columbiana County school.

The Columbiana County Career and Technical Center is immediately south of city limits.

<doc id="129051" wikidata="Q919402" url="?curid=129051" title="Salem, Ohio">
<text>Salem is a city in northern Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 11,915 at the 2020 census. It extends into southern Mahoning County and is the principal city of the Salem micropolitan area. Salem was founded by Quakers in 1806 and played a key role in the abolitionist movement as a hub of the Underground Railroad. Once an industrial town, Salem is now a commuter town and regional economic center, home to Allegheny Wesleyan College and Kent State University at Salem.

==History==

Salem was founded by a New Jersey clockmaker, Zadok Street, and a Pennsylvanian potter, John Straughan, in 1806. The city was named after Salem, New Jersey, Street&#x27;s native community. The name Salem itself is a biblical derivative of Jerusalem in the Middle East, which means &quot;city of peace&quot;. The city&#x27;s early settlers included the Religious Society of Friends, also known as Quakers, which the local school district&#x27;s sports teams honor by referring to themselves collectively as the Salem Quakers. Salem was incorporated in 1830.

Radio DJ Alan Freed was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Salem. While working at a radio station in Cleveland, he coined the phrase &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

Advantageously located between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, Salem thrived on an industrial-based economy. For several decades, Salem&#x27;s largest corporations included American Standard Brands, Eljer, Mullins Manufacturing, Deming Pump, and Salem China. Today, American Standard, a Fresh Mark, Inc meat production facility, and several tool-and-die manufacturers remain.

===Reform efforts===
Salem was a center for reform activity in several ways. &quot;The Anti-Slavery Bugle&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper, was published in Salem beginning in 1845. A local group of the Progressive Friends, an association of Quakers who separated from the main body partly to be freer to work for such causes as abolitionism and women&#x27;s rights, formed in Salem in 1849. The local school board at that time was composed entirely of abolitionists.

Salem was the site of an annual conference, the Anti-Slavery Fair, whose purpose was to raise money for anti-slavery activities.

In April 1850, Salem hosted the first Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Ohio, the third such convention in the United States. (The first was the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848; the second was the Rochester Convention two weeks later.) The Salem Convention was the first of these conventions to be organized on a statewide basis. All the convention officers were women. Men were not allowed to vote, sit on the platform, or speak during the convention. The male spectators were supportive, however, and when the convention was over, they created an organization of their own and endorsed the actions of the women&#x27;s convention.

==Geography==
Salem is located about southwest of Youngstown, east of Canton, and southeast of Cleveland. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land. Salem is the largest incorporated place by area in Columbiana County.

The city is mostly surrounded by unincorporated Perry Township. Salem has annexed portions of Perry Township. Several acres of Salem Township and Green Township were annexed into the city limits in 2000 and 2001. Other actions to spur economic development undertaken around the same time annexed specific land: in 1999, of Salem Township were granted police and fire protection, snow removal service, and other city services.

<text>Wellsville is a village in Columbiana County, Ohio, United States. The population was 3,113 at the 2020 census. In its heyday, notable industries in Wellsville included shipping via the Ohio River and Pennsylvania Railroad, as well as pottery and ceramics manufacturing.

==History==
===Early history and establishment===
In 1770, George Washington with his friend and personal surveyor, William Crawford, embarked on a journey down the Ohio River from Pittsburgh for the purpose of viewing lands to be apportioned among soldiers who had served in the French and Indian War. They are reported to have surveyed the Wellsville area, just north of Yellow Creek in 1770, and it was noted in his journal that it was good bottom land.

The Yellow Creek Massacre occurred near Wellsville in 1774. A group of Virginian settlers killed the relatives of a prominent Iroquois leader, Logan, who was camped on Yellow Creek. Logan took revenge, resulting in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War.

James Clark and William Wells first settled in the area in 1795. Although they had to leave for a while due to Native American attacks in the area, they returned between 1797 and 1800. Wellsville was founded in 1797 by William Wells, a Pennsylvanian, and former justice of the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio. Wellsville&#x27;s first school and church were also established before 1800. A barn built in 1807 by the Aten family was moved to Hale Farm and Village in Bath, Ohio.

===19th century to present===
In 1814, a turnpike road was built to Lisbon, and in 1816, a post office was established with John J. Feehan serving as postmaster. In the 1820s, the first Methodist Episcopal Church was organized by Rev. John Callahan in the house of William Wells. This is supposed to be the first Methodist Episcopal Church organized in Ohio. Shortly thereafter, Joseph Wells founded the Methodist Protestant Church.

Wellsville finally took shape around 1823, when William Wells recorded that lots had been laid out for planned settlement. The initial site was bounded by the current Third and Fifth Streets, between Riverside Avenue and Commerce Street (although at the time they had different names.) In 1836, a foundry was opened to make steamboat machinery. It later became known as the Stevenson Company, and produced brick-making machinery. It still exists today as a fabrication and machine shop.

Wellsville was incorporated as a village in 1848. In 1852, the Cleveland &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad (later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad) built a track from Hanover, Ohio, to Wellsville, and in 1856, it built a track from Wellsville to Rochester, Pennsylvania.

On February 14, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, on his way to his first inauguration, spoke to a large gathering in front of the Whitacre House, a hotel, in Wellsville. On July 26, 1863, Confederate States Army General John Hunt Morgan and several hundred of his soldiers surrendered to pursuing Union forces after Morgan&#x27;s Raid ended in nearby West Point, and were held in Wellsville before being shipped to the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus. Morgan&#x27;s Raid was the northernmost advance of Confederate troops during the Civil War. At this time, Ohio State Route 45 was known as the Warren-Ashtabula Turnpike, which ran from Wellsville to Lake Erie. It was an important part of the Underground Railroad.

During the 1896 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan addressed a crowd in Wellsville from the back of a train. Bryan was the first candidate to successfully embrace &quot;whistle stop&quot; campaigning, harnessing the power of a young rail network to reach masses of voters.

The 1936 flooding of the Ohio River resulted in the construction of a flood wall. In 1951, his only year of varsity basketball at Wellsville, Bevo Francis scored 776 points in 25 games for an average of nearly 32 points per game. In the process, he led his team to a stunning 19–1 regular-season record and a berth in the state playoffs. He was a unanimous all-state performer. In 1986, the 1870 Episcopal Church of the Ascension and Manse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Coshocton contains Roscoe Village, a restored town of the canal era, located next to the former Ohio and Erie Canal. A heritage tourist attraction, it showcases the area&#x27;s unique canal history. The city was developed on the site of a former Lenape village established in the late 1770s by bands who had migrated from the East under European oppression. Coshocton is the principal city of the Coshocton micropolitan area.

==History==
The Lenape sympathetic to the new United States stayed near Coshocton. White Eyes, then leader of the Lenape people, signed the Treaty of Fort Pitt of 1778, by which the Lenape hoped to secure their safety during the War, and he promised scouts and support to the rebel colonists.

In retaliation for frontier raids by hostile Lenape and British, Colonel Daniel Brodhead of the Continental Army ignored the treaty. After indiscriminately raiding and destroying the peaceful Moravian Christian Lenape settlement of Indaochaic also known as Lichtenau, he attacked and destroyed the Lenape at Coshocton in April 1781.

Coshocton was originally called Tuscarawas by American colonists, after the river, and under the latter name was laid out in 1802. The young town was renamed Coshocton when it was designated county seat by the legislature in 1811.
