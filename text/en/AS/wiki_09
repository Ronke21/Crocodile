<text>Lynbrook is a village in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 20,438 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area currently known as Lynbrook has had other names, including Rechquaakie (originally), Parson&#x27;s Corners, and Bloomfield. It was later named Pearsall&#x27;s Corners, after Mr. Pearsall&#x27;s General Store, because this store became a famous stagecoach stop for travelers coming from New York City to Long Island. Alternatively, it was called &quot;Five Corners&quot; because the stagecoach stop was at the crossing of Hempstead Avenue, Merrick Road, and Broadway. It became known as Lynbrook in 1894 and the village was incorporated in 1911. The name &quot;Lynbrook&quot; is derived by dividing &quot;Brooklyn&quot; into its syllables and transposing them, a tribute to the original home of many of the town&#x27;s turn-of-the-century residents.

Since 1912, Lynbrook has been served by the Lynbrook Police Department. The Chief of the Department is Brian Palladino. Since 1879, the Lynbrook Volunteer Fire Department has served Lynbrook. The department has six firehouses around Lynbrook. The Chief of the Department is Christopher Ambrosio. Lynbrook is also served by its own Department of Public Works, which provides sanitation management. The superintendent is Phil Healey.

In 2008, three houses in Lynbrook were listed on the National Register of Historic Places: House at 251 Rocklyn Avenue, House at 474 Ocean Avenue, and House at 73 Grove Street. The Rockville Cemetery was listed in 2015.

<text>Malverne is a village in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 8,514 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Malverne was originally settled by the Rockaway Indians at an unknown point in history, with the current Ocean Avenue serving as an Indian path. Western settlements can be dated back to the 1700s, when the Abrams, Bedell and Pearsall families first settled and began farming the area.

Norwood, as it was originally known, formed a movement to become an incorporated village in the early 1920s. This area originally consisted of the communities of North Lynbrook and Malverne Park Oaks. It is widely believed that residents of the now Malverne Park Oaks area did not wish to become part of the new village and therefore requested not to be included. North Lynbrook was believed to be removed from the borders by then New York Lieutenant Governor Jeremiah Wood, who lived in that area at that time and did not wish to be in an incorporated village.

A vote was taken and voters decided to form an incorporated village by an overwhelming majority.

The spelling of the name was originally Malvern, minus the &quot;e&quot; as in the English connection. When the Long Island Rail Road started service to Malvern they spelled the name Malverne, with the &quot;e&quot;. Although Malvern attempted to fix the error, the village changed the name to Malverne, as so many people thought the name was spelled with the &quot;e&quot;. The last farm in Malverne, Crossroads Farm at Grossman&#x27;s was acquired by Nassau County and continues to operate as the last working farm in the village.

The name was changed from Norwood to Malverne because a Village of Norwood already existed in upstate New York. The name Malverne originates from Malvern, England. Alfred Wagg, the main developers from the Amsterdam Development and Land Corporation, had visited Malvern and liked the name.

Malverne&#x27;s incorporation was finalized on April 13, 1921; however, it had been acting as a village since October 1920.

Malverne was originally made up of many different communities (under one incorporated village). The communities were mostly made up of the original farmer of that area and those he sold his land to. While it is no longer viewed the same way, some of the neighborhood names can be found in the street names.

The village&#x27;s growth has been credited to two major events – the selling of farmland for development and the Long Island Rail Road. The Amsterdam Development Corporation is responsible for the building of many of the homes in the village. Today, there are over 3000 homes in the village.

Today, many of its residents commute to New York City via the two Long Island Rail Road stations in the village – Malverne and Westwood, both located on the West Hempstead Branch. After a three-year hiatus, weekend train service was restored to the branch in November 2014.

The mayor appoints a deputy mayor to act in their absence. They also appoint liaisons and/or commissioners to each department in the village. The office of mayor was originally called president.

Malverne is a &quot;full service&quot; municipality with nearly all government services provided by the village itself. The Village hosts its own Police Department, Volunteer Fire Department (Norwood Hook, Ladder &amp; Hose Company), Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Police Reserve, Department of Public Works, Emergency Management Commission, Public Library, Youth Board, and village television station – MalverneTV.

===Safety record===
Recent studies have found that Malverne is considered to be one of the safest communities in both the state and country. A report based on 2012 statistics place the village the second-safest in New York, behind only Briarcliff Manor.

===Finances===
In 2009, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s gave Malverne an AA+ credit bond rating, one of the highest ratings the financial institution gives out.

While designated as one area, it is actually made up of three different, smaller communities: Malverne Park, Malverne Oaks South, and Malverne Oaks North.

When the Incorporated Village of Malverne was seeking to become an incorporated village in 1920, the residents from this area did not wish to become part of the new village and therefore remained a hamlet under the Town of Hempstead.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The Malverne Park section of the hamlet is more closely associated with the Village of Malverne as it falls within its fire and school districts as well as the Malverne ZIP code (11565).

The Malverne Oaks North and South sections of the hamlet, meanwhile, are linked more with West Hempstead for similar districting reasons and due to using a West Hempstead ZIP code (11552).

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 470 people, 175 households, and 145 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 175 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 90.64% White, 3.62% African American, 4.26% Asian, 1.28% from other races, and 0.21% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.45% of the population.

There were 175 households, out of which 34.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.0% were married couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.6% were non-families. 13.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.69 and the average family size was 2.94.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 22.8% under the age of 18, 4.5% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 30.2% from 45 to 64, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.1 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $91,208, and the median income for a family was $91,597. Males had a median income of $56,786 versus $31,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $34,379. None of the population or families were below the poverty line.

== Education ==
Malverne Park Oaks is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Malverne Union Free School District and the West Hempstead Union Free School District. As such, children who reside within the hamlet and attend public schools go to school in one of these two districts, depending on where they reside within Malverne Park Oaks.

== Transportation ==
The Southern State Parkway travels through and serves the hamlet, along its northern border.

<doc id="126744" wikidata="Q286148" url="?curid=126744" title="Manhasset, New York">
<text>Manhasset is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered the anchor community of the Greater Manhasset area. The population was 8,176 at the time of the 2020 census.

As with other unincorporated communities in New York, its local affairs are administered by the town in which it is located, the Town of North Hempstead, whose town hall is in Manhasset, making the hamlet the town seat.

==Etymology==
The name Manhasset was adopted for the community in 1840. It is most likely the anglicized rendition of the name of a nearby Native American tribe whose name translates to &quot;the island neighborhood&quot;.

==History==

The Matinecock had a village on Manhasset Bay. These Native Americans called the area Sint Sink, meaning &quot;place of small stones&quot;. They made wampum from oyster shells. In 1623, the area was claimed by the Dutch West India Company and they began forcing English settlers to leave in 1640. A 1643 land purchase made it possible for English settlers to return to Cow Neck (the peninsula where present-day Port Washington, Manhasset, and surrounding villages are located.).

Manhasset Bay was previously known as Schout&#x27;s Bay (a schout being roughly the Dutch equivalent of a sheriff), Martin Garretson&#x27;s Bay (Martin Garretson was the Schout at one point), and later Cow Bay or Cow Harbor. Cow Neck was so called because it offered good grazing land. By 1659, there were over 300 cows and 5 mi (8 km) fence separating Cow Neck from the areas to the south. The settlers came to an agreement that each of them could have one cow on the neck for each section of fence the individual had constructed. The area was more formally divided among the settlers when the fence was removed in 1677. Manhasset took on the name Little Cow Neck, Port Washington was known as Upper Cow Neck.

During the American Revolution, Little Cow Neck suffered at the hands of the British. Many structures and properties, such as the 1719 Quaker Meeting House were burned, seized or damaged. The Town of North Hempstead separated from the Town of Hempstead in 1784 because the South, inhabited mainly by Church of England people, was loyal to the king. The Northern communities and villages, dominated by Yankee Congregationalists supported independence.

In 1801, it cost two cents to travel between Roslyn and Spinney Hill on the North Hempstead Turnpike, the newly opened toll road (now Northern Boulevard).

The Manhasset name was adopted in 1840 and comes from the native word &quot;Manhanset&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;the island neighborhood&quot;. Dairy farming was still a major endeavor, but the oyster industry was also on the rise. In 1898, the Long Island Railroad arrived, bringing with it wealthy New Yorkers looking for country homes with easy transportation to more urban areas of New York City. Manhasset Valley and Spinney Hill attracted a number of skilled workers and immigrant families.

The North Hempstead Town Hall opened in Manhasset on Plandome Road in 1907. Town councilmen had previously been meeting in Roslyn taverns after North Hempstead split away from Hempstead in 1775.

The Manhasset Valley School, originally built to serve the children of the help on the local Gold Coast Estates, eventually came to serve Manhasset&#x27;s African American community, and was closed in the 1960s by a desegregation lawsuit. It is still standing and is currently used as a community center. The centrally located but antiquated Plandome Road School was demolished in the early 1970s, having been replaced by the new Shelter Rock Elementary School in North Hills by 1969. Currently, Mary Jane Davies Green sits on the site of the old school.

Manhasset is served by the Nassau County Police Department, with the Sixth Precinct station house located on Community Drive, just south of Northern Boulevard. RMPs 608 and 616 are the cars assigned to patrol duties in Manhasset. In 2005, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article ranked Manhasset as the best town for raising a family in the New York metropolitan area. The Manhasset area, settled by 1680, grew quickly after it began being served by the Long Island Rail Road in 1898. The LIRR provides access to New York City via the Manhasset station with an approximately 40 minute commute to Penn Station or Grand Central. Express trains, which run during rush hour, make the trip in less than 30 minutes. The hamlet of Manhasset is located 19.5 miles (29.2 km) away from midtown Manhattan.

In the 2010s and 2020s, talks have been restarted to connect the businesses on Plandome Road to sanitary sewers operated by the Great Neck Water Pollution Control District. These proposals have been discussed for decades but historically had been met with opposition, ultimately killing some of the earlier plans.

=== Failed incorporation attempts ===
There have been several unsuccessful attempts over the years – especially throughout the 1940s – for some or all of the unincorporated areas of Manhasset to incorporate as villages. The most recent proposal to incorporate the hamlet took place in 2016.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.24%, is water.

=== Topography ===
Like the rest of Long Island&#x27;s North Shore, Manhasset is situated on a terminal moraine, which is named the Harbor Hill Moraine. This moraine was formed by glaciers during the Wisconsin Glacial Episode, and is named for Harbor Hill in Roslyn; Harbor Hill is the highest geographic point in Nassau County.

=== Greater Manhasset area ===
In addition to the unincorporated areas of Manhasset proper (Bayview, the Strathmores (North and South Strathmore, Strathmore Village, and Strathmore–Vanderbilt), Shorehaven, Terrace Manor, Manhasset Park, Manhasset Gardens, and Norgate), the Greater Manhasset area also includes three incorporated villages: Munsey Park, Plandome, and Plandome Heights; and parts of three others: Flower Hill, Plandome Manor, and North Hills.

== Economy ==

The Americana Manhasset mall opened in 1956, and is located on Manhasset&#x27;s Miracle Mile.

The commercial center of Manhasset is situated around the railroad station on Plandome Road, where the LIRR connects directly into Manhattan for a 37-minute commute. The area has bakeries, pizzerias, delis, bars, coffee shops, and a movie theater. Centralized in town is a small park and a gazebo. The community&#x27;s public library is located one block east of Plandome Road, on the corner of Onderdonk Avenue and Northern Boulevard, adjacent to the historic Quaker Meeting House.

Prior to the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s arrival, the commercial center of Manhasset was located in the Manhasset Valley (near the present-day Manhasset Valley Park), along Manhasset Bay.

The North American headquarters of Sabena was located in a office building in Manhasset. In April 2002, Knightsbridge Properties Corp. bought the building for $4.9 million. Due to the bankruptcies of Sabena and Swissair, the real estate deal took over a year to finish. During that month the building was 30% occupied. Sabena was scheduled to move out of the building on May 10, 2002. The buyer planned to spend an additional $2 million to convert the building into a multi-tenant, Class A office and medical facility.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 8,080 people and 2,744 households residing in the census-designated place (CDP) which covers 2.38 square miles. The population density was . According to the 2018 American Community Survey, the racial makeup of the CDP is estimated to be 72.5% white (65.1 non-Hispanic white), 13.8% Asian, 8.6% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.0% Pacific Islander, and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.9% of the population.

There were 2,744 households, out of which 38.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.6% were married couples living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.2% were non-families. 20.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.80 and the average family size was 3.28. The population was spread out, with 23.9% under the age of 18 and 19.2% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $133,456, and the median income for a family was $180,086. The per capita income in the CDP was $72,973. 5.5% of the population and 4.0% of families were below the poverty line. 6.3% of people under 18 years of age and 4.6% of people 65 and older had incomes below the poverty line.

<text>Manhasset Hills is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 3,649 at the time of the 2020 census. Neighboring communities include Herricks, North Hills, North New Hyde Park, and Lake Success.

== History ==
By the late 1950s, much of the land in Manhasset Hills had been developed by developers. One of the last major developments to be built was the Cherrywood Homes development, which was built on a 24-acre tract by Barney and Martin Spiegel. The development was built with 88 split-level houses designed by A.H. Salkowitz, and was constructed on one of the last remaining major undeveloped tracts of land available in Manhasset Hills.

In the 1980s and 1990s, roughly 1,000 Manhasset Hills residents attempted to prevent the State of New York from placing a group home in their neighborhood for people with mental disabilities. Many were concerned that their property values would decrease because of the group home&#x27;s presence, and attempted to change a law in order to prevent the home from being established. The residents were successful in preventing the group home from being established in their community, and the home was instead established in nearby New Hyde Park.

The Long Island Motor Parkway used to run along the northern border of the hamlet.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

== Economy ==

<text>Manorhaven is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Port Washington area, which is anchored by Port Washington. The population was 6,956 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Manorhaven is located on the Cow Neck Peninsula, within the Town of North Hempstead.

== History ==
Manorhaven was incorporated as a village in 1930, after news was spread that Port Washington was planning on incorporating itself as a city. The majority of residents in what would ultimately become the Village of Manorhaven wished to retain home rule, leading to a push to incorporate and a referendum on the matter being held that year; the majority of the prospective village&#x27;s voters approved of the proposal by voting in favor of it, thus officially establishing Manorhaven as an incorporated village.

In 1931, one year after the Manorhaven incorporated, the village proposed annexing the territory which would eventually become the Village of Port Washington North. Manorhaven&#x27;s annexation bid was unsuccessful due to the residents in what would ultimately become Port Washington North preferring to incorporate as a separate village; Port Washington North ultimately incorporated as its own village one year later, in 1932.

Between 1939 and 1940, Manhasset Bay was used as the New York base of Pan American World Airways&#x27; transatlantic Boeing 314 flights, prior to the opening of LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s Marine Air Terminal, with the airport&#x27;s hangars and terminal located within Manorhaven, at Toms Point on Manhasset Isle, near the southern edge of the village; the facility was subsequently used by Grumman, following the Marine Air Terminal&#x27;s opening. Although the seaplane hangars at Toms Point were eventually demolished, the seaplane base is still in use, with the airport&#x27;s current iteration being activated in 1948.

In 1948, Manorhaven residents and officials debated whether to join the Port Washington Police District, and for the Port Washington Police to subsequently take over police operations in the village from the Nassau County Police Department. The proposal was rejected by residents, with the majority of village voters opting for the village remain under the Nassau County Police Department&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In 1982, the Village of Manorhaven annexed approximately from unincorporated Port Washington.

In 1984, Manorhaven residents and officials again debated whether the village should join the Port Washington Police District. If approved, the Port Washington Police District would have taken over the police services within the village from the Nassau County Police Department. Proponents felt that the Port Washington Police District would be able to better serve the needs of the village, while opponents expressed concerns over potential tax increases. Ultimately, the village, once again, decided to remain under the jurisdiction of the NCPD.

In 2022, Manorhaven Boulevard underwent a major rehabilitation and beautification project, carried out by Nassau County in collaboration with the Village of Manorhaven.

on June 20, 2023, the village&#x27;s former Deputy Mayor Vincent Costa was defeated by one vote, after being accused of official misconduct.

<doc id="126747" wikidata="Q954079" url="?curid=126747" title="Massapequa, New York">
<text>Massapequa (, ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population of the CDP was 21,355 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The name &quot;Massapequa&quot; or historically &quot;Marsapeague&quot; means “great water land”.

The first occupants were a band of Algonquian speakers, the Massapequa People, one of the &quot;13 tribes of Long Island&quot;, a sub-group of the Lenape people. At first, most of the Massapequa People were friendly and helpful to the Europeans, but then, around 1658, merchants from the Town of Oyster tricked Chief Tackapausha into selling the land. He tried to rectify this misunderstanding, but remained unsuccessful.

In 1670 (35 years after the Europeans initially settled there), only a few Native Americans were left on the Island.

At the time of the second World War, the population was about 3,000, and most worked in agriculture, or at nearby aircraft manufacturing plants.

In 1953, the last remains of a fort of the Massapequa, an archeological site, was covered up by a real estate developer; it is now a National Register-listed United States National Historic Landmark.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.20%, is water.

Massapequa and nearby places with &quot;Massapequa&quot; in their names are sometimes collectively called &quot;the Massapequas&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Massapequa has a temperate climate that is very similar to other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and cold winters, but the Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. However, severe thunderstorms are not uncommon, especially when they approach the island from the mainland (Bronx, Westchester and Connecticut) in the northwest. In the wintertime, temperatures are warmer than areas further inland (especially in the night and early morning hours), often causing a snowstorm further inland to fall as rain on the island. However, measurable snowfalls every winter, and in many winters one or more intense storms called Nor&#x27;easters may occasionally produce blizzard conditions with snowfalls of 1–2 feet (30–60 cm) and near-hurricane-force winds. On average, 28&quot; of snow falls each winter in Massapequa. Long Island temperatures also vary from west to east, with the western part of the island warmer on most occasions than the east. This is due to two factors; one because the western part is closer to the mainland and the other is the western part is more developed causing what is known as the urban heat island effect.

This climate is classified as hot-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfa&quot;) which borders upon a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) on the coast. Average monthly temperatures in the central CDP range from 31.4 °F in January to 74.3 °F in July.

On August 25, 2006, a small F0 tornado struck Massapequa.

On Monday, October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated much of Massapequa – especially south of Merrick Road, where surging flood waters rose both along the shore and along the numerous canals that run a mile inland. Schools were closed for several days and weeks. Many residents remained without power for weeks after the storm because of downed power lines. Hundreds of houses and buildings sustained major flood damage and had to be gutted and renovated during the ensuing year.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 22,652 people, 7,417 households, and 6,297 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 7,514 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.42% White, 0.17% African American, 0.02% Native American, 1.27% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.37% from other races, and 0.73% from two or more races. 2.59% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Because it has large Italian and Jewish communities, the town is sometimes referred to as &quot;matzah pizza&quot;.
There were 7,417 households, out of which 38.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.4% were married couples living together, 8.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.1% were non-families. Of all households, 12.5% were made up of individuals, and 6.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.05 and the average family size was 3.33.
In the CDP, the population was spread, with 25.6% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 24.7% from 45 to 64, and 14.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years . For every 100 females, there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.0 males.
The median income for a household in the CDP was $107,181, and the median income for a family was $116,266. Males had a median income of $78,859 versus $57,016 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $42,169. 2.9% of the population and 1.6% of families were below the poverty line.
Due to the sizable Jewish and Italian populations long associated with the area, Massapequa is frequently referred to as &quot;Matzah-Pizza.&quot;

==Education==
Massapequa residents originally attended schools in neighboring towns. Even after the creation of the Massapequa Union Free School District (also known as MSD) appropriately aged students were often sent to schools such as Amityville Memorial High School because a high school in Massapequa did not exist. At first students were only went to Amityville, but after 1953 they were given the option of attending schools in towns like Freeport and Baldwin and at Willington Mepham High School in Bellmore.

MSD constructed their first modern multi-room building in the mid 1920s. It was built on Massapequa Avenue, which is why it received the name &quot;Massapequa Avenue School&quot;. After the construction of Massapequa High School in 1955 this original school was renamed to &quot;Fairfield School&quot; to avoid confusion with the similar names.

<text>Massapequa Park is an incorporated village located within the southern portion of the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York. The population was 17,109 at the time of the 2020 census.

The areas south and east of the village borders are considered the hamlet of Massapequa because they are under the jurisdiction of the Town of Oyster Bay rather than the village. The hamlet shares the same zip code, fire department and school district as the village.

==History==
The village located on the South Shore of Long Island shares the early Native American history of Massapequa. Then in the 19th century, families of German descent relocated from Brooklyn to what is now Massapequa Park, and the community which was formed was known as Wurtenberg or Stadtwurtemburg. The main attraction and center of activity was the Woodcastle Hotel, a rooming house built in 1868 on Front Street next to the fire department as a summer resort. It was destroyed by fire in 1952 and replaced by houses.

In 1928, &quot;The New York Times ran&quot; ads for Massapequa Park, a development built by a real estate firm owned by Michael J. Brady, Frank Cryan, and Peter Colleran. The three Irish-Americans described their project as having a bit of Old Erin; the area between Sunrise Highway and Merrick Road still has mostly Irish street names.

In 1931, Massapequa Park was incorporated as a village to ensure control of land use and other issues. Several dozen kit houses from Sears Roebuck were built in two different areas of the village. These include some of the largest model kit houses offered by Sears.

The village once had its own airport, the Fitzmaurice Flying Field, named in 1929 for James Fitzmaurice, one of a crew of three to be the first to fly a plane from east to west across the Atlantic (Baldonnel, Ireland to Greenly Island in Labrador, Canada). An estimated 100,000 people came to the dedication of the field on Spruce Street. The field was used by private planes.

The field was eventually closed and became the home for the athletic fields of the 4M Club, a popular youth athletic program founded by Larry Neusse, and supported by a wide range of local residents. Today the site is home to McKenna Elementary School (which used to be a junior high school) and the Nassau County Police Academy (which used to be Hawthorn Elementary School).

The Village of Massapequa Park owns and operates three parks main: Brady Park, Colleran Park, and Mansfield Park. It also owns and maintains several memorials and associated parks which are located throughout the village.

==Education==
The village is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Massapequa Union Free School District.

During the 1960s, 1970s and much of the 1980s the Massapequa School District had seven elementary schools (Carman Road, East Lake, Birch Lane, Fairfield, Unqua, Hawthorn, Lockhart), two junior high schools (McKenna and Ames) and two high schools (Massapequa and Alfred G. Berner).

In 1987, the Massapequa school district restructured the district by leasing Carmans Road elementary to Nassau BOCES and Hawthorne Elementary to the Nassau County Police Academy. John P. McKenna Jr. High School was converted to an elementary school, while Alfred G. Berner became the new junior high, later becoming a middle school. J. Lewis Ames Jr. High School is no longer a middle school, but a &quot;9th Grade Center&quot;– the Ames Campus of Massapequa High School. The northern section of the village and hamlet are served by the Farmingdale School District.

== Transportation ==
The Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Massapequa Park station on the Babylon Branch is located in the village.

<text>Deathrock (or death rock) is a rock music subgenre that merges punk rock and post-punk with gothic and glam rock visuals and elements of horror film scores. Often overlapping with, and sometimes considered a subgenre of, gothic rock, the genre was pioneered by bands from the early 1980s Los Angeles punk scene, including Christian Death, Kommunity FK, 45 Grave and the Super Heroines. By the middle of the decade, the genre had begun to interact with the United Kingdom&#x27;s gothic rock scene, leading to the formation of English deathrock bands like Sex Gang Children and Alien Sex Fiend. However, soon after the genre declined in popularity, and its name largely fell out of use. In the late 1990s, a revival of the genre began, in which groups like Bloody Dead and Sexy, the Phantom Limbs and Tragic Black expanded the scope of the genre to include elements of psychobilly, electronic body music and futurepop.

==Characteristics==

Deathrock songs usually incorporate a driving, repetitive rhythm section; the drums and bass guitar laying the foundation within a  time signature while the guitars either play simple chords or effects-driven leads to create atmosphere. Chorus effects, such as those produced by the Boss CE-2 pedal, are commonly used by deathrock guitarists to create a wider and more haunting tone. The use of lyrics can vary, but are typically introspective and surreal, and deal with the dark themes of isolation, gloom, disillusionment, loss, life, death, etc.; as can the style, varying from harsh and dark to upbeat, melodic, and tongue-in-cheek. Deathrock lyrics and other musical stylistic elements often incorporate the themes of campy horror and sci-fi films. Despite the similar-sounding name, deathrock has no connection to death metal, which is a subgenre of heavy metal.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;deathrock&quot; was first used in the 1950s to describe a thematically related genre of rock and roll, which began in 1958 with Jody Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Endless Sleep&quot; and ended in 1964 with J. Frank Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Last Kiss&quot;. The term was also applied to the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;. These songs about dead teenagers were noted for their morbid yet romantic view of death, spoken word bridges, and sound effects. In 1974, the term &quot;deathrock&quot; was used by Gene Grier to describe the same phenomenon in rock music.

The term later re-emerged to describe the sound of various West Coast punk bands. It most likely came from one of three sources: Rozz Williams, the founding member of Christian Death, to describe the sound of his band; the music press, reusing the 1950s term to describe an emerging subgenre of punk; and/or Nick Zedd&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;They Eat Scum&quot;, which featured a fictitious cannibalistic &quot;deathrock&quot; punk band called &quot;Suzy Putrid and the Mental Deficients.&quot;

==History==
===Predecessors (1950s–1970s)===
The earliest influences for some deathrock acts can be traced to the horror-themed novelty rock and roll acts of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers and Zacherle with &quot;Monster Mash&quot;; Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins with &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;; Screaming Lord Sutch &amp; the Savages with &quot;Murder in the Graveyard&quot;; and Don Hinson and the Rigormorticians with &quot;Riboflavin-Flavored Non-Carbonated Poly-Unsaturated Blood&quot;. Contemporarily, the 1979 single &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; by British post-punk group Bauhaus was one of the major influences amongst the early deathrock scene. Other influences included the Doors, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, the Cramps, Black Sabbath and the Damned.

The Los Angeles punk rock scene began in the mid to late 1970s, with groups like the Runaways, the Weirdos and the Germs. Within this scene the Gun Club&#x27;s grim take on heavily blues indebted punk was a notable Los Angeles precursor. The Flesh Eaters too took a macabre take on early LA punk, by merging the sound with lyrics influenced by Edgar Allan Poe, the Beat Generation and Catholicism. Furthermore, T.S.O.L. were a defining group in the scene who briefly embraced gothic and deathrock elements.

===Origins (early 1980s)===

At the beginning of the 1980s, deathrock merged as an offshoot of the Los Angeles punk rock scene, differentiating itself through its greater emphasis on horror. According to a 2006 article by &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, one popular theory as to the reason for this split was the 1980 suicide of Germs vocalist Darby Crash. According to this interpretation, Crash&#x27;s death led to a period of mourning amongst many of those in the scene and eventually to a fascination with the macabre. Nonetheless, amongst this splinter bands began to form merging the sounds of Los Angeles punk rock with these darker elements to create deathrock. The most prominent of these groups were Christian Death, 45 Grave, Super Heroines and Kommunity FK. Tracks by several of these acts were featured on 1981&#x27;s &quot;Hell Comes to Your House&quot; compilation LP, which represented an early attempt to collect and promote local artists on the cutting edge of this new, darker version of L.A. punk. The bands generally performed and congregated at the Anti-Club, a club night in Hollywood that would change venues every few weeks; the O.N. Klub, located in Silver Lake, also frequently hosted deathrock acts throughout the genre&#x27;s inceptual period. Outside of this scene, Theatre of Ice from Fallon, Nevada independently created a sound which some sources have considered as pioneering deathrock.

During this time, deathrock bands often performed alongside both hardcore punk and new wave bands. However, deathrock bands were not generally viewed as their own distinct genre, instead being seen as darker punk bands or sometimes even conflated with horror punk.

===Developments (mid–to late 1980s)===
During the mid–1980s, the United States&#x27; deathrock scene became increasingly connected to the United Kingdom&#x27;s gothic rock scene, a genre which journalist James Greene described as &quot;very much in line&quot; with deathrock. This cross-pollination was particularly influenced by the Gun Club&#x27;s European tour in 1983, and Christian Death&#x27;s tour in 1984.

By 1984, Christian Death had departed from their early deathrock sound in favour of the gothic rock of &quot;Catastrophe Ballet&quot;, while the sound of deathrock had begun to be embraced by English bands including Sex Gang Children and Alien Sex Fiend. Furthermore, the sound spread to bands in the anarcho-punk scene, influencing the sound of Rudimentary Peni and Part 1. By the time that the Sisters of Mercy gained widespread success in the scene, the term &quot;deathrock&quot; had predominantly fallen out of use and the style was viewed as simply a subgenre of gothic rock.

===Decline and revivals (1990s–present)===

The mid-1990s marked a third wave of gothic rock, as the music drifted its furthest from the original punk and post-punk sound by incorporating many elements of the industrial music scene at the time (which itself had moved away from experimental noise and into a more dance-rock oriented sound) and the more repetitive and electronic sounds of electronic body music. Some clubs have even entirely removed deathrock and first-generation gothic rock from their setlists.

Halloween 1998 saw the launch of Release the Bats, a monthly goth and deathrock club night in Long Beach, California. During its run time it became southern California&#x27;s most frequented goth night and Long Beach&#x27;s longest running club night, launching the careers of deathrock bands like Mephisto Walz. The success of the club caused many other deathrock club nights to be established in the following years. This, along with the rise of online music piracy led to the increased popularity of older deathrock bands and establishment of new, international deathrock groups, like Bloody Dead and Sexy, commencing the first deathrock revival. During this period groups like the Phantom Limbs and Black Ice began to merge deathrock with elements of no wave and synthpunk. Many groups from this period, most notably Tragic Black, began to make use of an aesthetic heavily inspired by Batcave fashion. This era was mostly based online, through websites including deathrock.com, post-punk.com, MySpace and LiveJournal. Furthermore, it embraced a broader spectrum of influences, including psychobilly, electronic body music and futurepop.

During the 2010s, deathrock&#x27;s influence was revived, in the form of the dark punk and G-beat styles. In these genres, bands including Deathcharge, Cemetery, Lost Tribe and Christ vs Warhol, merged deathrock into hardcore punk and D-beat templates. Furthermore, during this time, bands such as Devil Master emerged, who merge the genre with black metal, and Gatecreeper who incorporate the genre&#x27;s influence into death metal.

<text>Munsey Park is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Manhasset area, which is anchored by Manhasset. The population was 2,809 at the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Munsey Park is located entirely within the Town of North Hempstead, and has been recognized as a Tree City USA since 1983.

== History ==
=== Development and early years (1920s) ===
Munsey Park was first developed in the 1920s, on North Shore land previously owned by wealthy publisher Frank Andrew Munsey (1854–1925), as a commuter town and &quot;model, restricted community&quot;, taking advantage of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Manhasset station, located immediately to the west of the development. The land on which the planned community now stands on was bequeathed by Munsey to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1925.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art sold the portion of the estate south of Northern Boulevard (NY 25A); that area would eventually become part of Strathmore. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Museum of Art retained ownership of the portion of Munsey&#x27;s estate north of Northern Boulevard, and, with help from the Hassett Realty Company, developed the planned community on the land under the leadership of museum president Robert W. DeForest.

It was developed featuring Colonial-style houses and streets named for American artists. Much of the original landscaping in the planned community was designed by the Olmsted Brothers.

In 1928, Munsey Park&#x27;s first model home opened. Like many of the other earliest homes to be constructed in the planned community, it was built in Section &quot;A&quot; – located at the western end of the development; Section &quot;A&quot; was the first section of Munsey Park to be constructed.

The name of the community was originally to be Munsey Meadows – but this name was changed to Munsey Park; it is named in honor of Frank Munsey.

=== Push for incorporation (1929–1930) ===
On January 27, 1930, Munsey Park residents voted 155-to-3 to incorporate their community as a village with its own municipal government and zoning ability; the incorporation would be made official 20 days after the vote.

Residents incorporated after learning about the creation of a sewer district serving Greater Manhasset in 1929; the proposal led to a significant amount of concern amongst many of the locals, who were opposed to sewering the area.

=== Village of Munsey Park (1930 – present) ===
Following the vote to incorporate Munsey Park as a village, the Village of Munsey Park held its first village election on March 1, 1930; this election saw residents of Munsey Park vote for the village&#x27;s first elected officials. Herman Block was elected to serve as the village&#x27;s first Mayor.

One of the first decisions made by the village&#x27;s elected officials was to leave the Manhasset Sewer District – much to the delight of many village residents – in addition to a decision to leave the Manhasset Parking District.

In 1931, the Munsey Park Shopping Center opened at the northwestern corner of Northern Boulevard and Manhasset Woods Road; it was designed to conform to the architecture of the homes within the village.

On May 30, 1932, the 18-hole Munsey Park Golf Club opened at the eastern end of the village. Operated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the club closed on March 1, 1937, as a result of poor revenue and profits, in addition to rising deficits. The former club&#x27;s land was subsequently redeveloped as additional housing – in addition to a business area at the former club&#x27;s clubhouse, which was already zoned for commercial use.

Much of the residential development on the site of the former golf course was developed by the Callan Brothers.

In the late 1930s, the Manhasset Union Free School District built the Munsey Park Elementary School within the village. It was built to address the overcrowding in the district&#x27;s existing schools which had from the large development boom in the Manhasset area and the resulting influx of residents – including in Munsey Park.

In May 1942, the Congregational Church of Manhasset purchased of land in Munsey Park, along the north side of Northern Boulevard. On this land, it would erect a large church building. The church&#x27;s groundbreaking occurred on May 12, 1948, and it was completed the next year, in 1949. The Church of Our Savior, Lutheran, broke ground across Copley Road that same year, and was completed in 1950.

In 1956, New York City-based department store Bonwit Teller announced that it would erect a department store in Munsey Park, in the business area which had formerly been part of the Munsey Park Golf Club. The building was designed by Lanthrop Douglass and Charles Anderson, and the store opened in 1957.

On December 8, 1974, Munsey Park Village Hall opened. Located at 1777 Northern Boulevard at the southern end of Munsey Park, the structure was built to conform to the style of residential homes in the village, and was erected on land which it had purchased back in 1950.

In 1983, Munsey Park was designated as a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation for the first time.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, developers planned turning the Munsey Park Plaza shopping center at the village&#x27;s southeast corner into a luxury shopping mall; this shopping center included Munsey Park&#x27;s Bonwit Teller branch, which opened in 1957 and closed in 1990. The proposed shopping mall on the site would have featured two floors, multiple exterior designs, and a parking garage with three levels. The proposal, which was first made in 1988, was rejected by the village. After Munsey Park&#x27;s rejection of the plans, the developers filed a lawsuit against the village. Ultimately, the lawsuit was unsuccessful, and the mall was never built; the property was eventually purchased in 1992 by TH Associates, which rehabilitated it and secured a new tenant for the former Bonwit Teller space.

In 2008, the Village of Munsey Park was ranked as the 13th (tied) Wealthiest Town in America by BusinessWeek.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it being land.

Munsey Park, in its entirety, uses the Manhasset 11030 postal code and is served by the Manhasset Post Office.

=== Topography ===
Like the rest of Long Island&#x27;s North Shore, Munsey Park is situated on a terminal moraine, which is named the Harbor Hill Moraine. This moraine was formed by glaciers during the Wisconsin Glacial Episode, and is named for Harbor Hill in Roslyn; Harbor Hill is the highest geographic point in Nassau County.

=== Drainage ===
Munsey Park is split between two minor drainage areas: Leeds Pond and Whitney Pond. These two drainage areas are sub-watersheds of the larger Manhasset Bay Watershed, which in turn is part of the larger Long Island Sound/Atlantic Ocean Watershed, which covers all of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.

== Economy ==
Munsey Park is a bedroom community of the City of New York, which is how the community was originally envisioned as being by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As such, a significant number of Munsey Park residents commute to/from New York for work.

The village itself is predominantly residential in character, with the heavy majority of lots within the village being zoned for single-family homes. The only businesses within Munsey Park are at three shopping centers along the north side of Northern Boulevard; these are the only areas of the Village zoned for commercial use. The largest of the shopping centers in Munsey Park – Munsey Park Plaza – is located at the southeast corner of the village and houses tenants including Whole Foods and Benihana; it has also previously housed a Bonwit Teller and a Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Developers unsuccessfully proposed rebuilding the shopping center as a luxury shopping mall in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

When originally planned, the intersection of Manhasset Woods Road and Park Avenue was to contain businesses, as well as near Locust Place (now Munsey Place); these plans were eventually amended in favor of additional single-family homes.

By the second half of the 20th century, New Cassel had become home to a growing number of Haitian and Latino families.

When the adjacent village of Westbury incorporated in 1932, New Cassel chose not to be absorbed over fears that taxes would rise. As such, it would remain an unincorporated hamlet directly governed by the Town of North Hempstead in Manhasset.

<text>New Hyde Park is a village in the Towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. It is the anchor community of the Greater New Hyde Park area. The population was 10,257 at the time of the 2020 census. The village is currently most prominently known as the headquarters of Northwell Health.

==History==
Thomas Dongan, the fourth royal governor of New York, was granted an 800-acre parcel of land in 1683 that included New Hyde Park. It was known as &quot;Dongan&#x27;s Farm.&quot; Dongan built a mansion on what is now Lakeville Road. In 1691, Dongan fled to New England and then Ireland, as King James II and his Catholic forces failed to regain power in England and Ireland.

In 1715, Dongan&#x27;s estate was sold to George Clarke (who was Secretary of the Province of New York). He named it Hyde Park in honor of his wife, Ann Hyde. Clarke sold the property in 1783 and in the early 19th century it was parceled up and sold as farm land. Raising cattle was a chief agricultural enterprise from Dongan&#x27;s time until the mid-19th century, when cattle farming in the expanding American West forced the farmers into other pursuits.

When a post office opened in 1871, the name was changed from Hyde Park to New Hyde Park to avoid confusion with the Hyde Park in the Hudson Valley.

The village was incorporated in 1927, after the majority of residents voted in favor of doing so. The northern, unincorporated part of New Hyde Park was home to several notable events: Shelter Rock, deposited during the last glacial period and marking the southern extent of that event; in 1908, the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway (later known as the Old Motor Parkway), the first limited access highway in the world and used for auto racing; from 1946 to 1947, home to the United Nations at the Sperry Gyroscope building on Marcus Avenue.

<text>North Hempstead (officially known as the Town of North Hempstead) is one of three towns in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 237,639 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the 7th largest city or town in New York by population.

==History==
The area was first settled by Europeans around 1643 and became part of the town of Hempstead. During the American Revolution the southern part of Hempstead was primarily Tory, while the northern part, having been settled by Yankees, supported the revolution. Following the war, the Town of North Hempstead was split off from Hempstead in 1784.

North Hempstead became more affluent with the opening of the Long Island Rail Road through to Great Neck, and the inauguration of steamboat service from Manhattan in 1836.

The Town of North Hempstead is made up of 30 incorporated villages that claimed the right to set zoning restrictions to protect their rights and resources. No new villages have been created in the Town of North Hempstead since 1932, and prospective villages were further discouraged from incorporating when the county charter was revised in 1936, which denied zoning powers to future villages in the county.

<text>North Hills is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 5,464 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The glacial action that formed much of Long Island deposited Shelter Rock in what is now North Hills approximately 11,000 years ago. The Matinecock had a village in the area. Farming developed in North Hills in the middle part of the 17th century. Around this time a long fence was built along the road later known as Northern Boulevard, to the north of North Hills. The lands of the Cow Neck Peninsula enclosed by the fence (present day Manhasset and Port Washington) were used for grazing.

During the 19th Century, one of the largest farms in the area was owned by Isaac Underhill Willets.

The village was incorporated in 1929 as a tax haven to prevent the Town of North Hempstead (seated in nearby Manhasset) from raising taxes on the property, as well as to gain and maintain home rule powers. The name North Hills was chosen due to how the village is located in the northern part of Nassau County and because the terrain is very hilly in the area.

In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, North Hills proposed rezoning and downzoning large portions of the village as part of a master plan. The plan was to downzone and rezone for multiple uses, including for condominiums and cluster residences, a shopping center, and commercial and office buildings. Additionally, the rezoning would allow for buildings to be constructed as high as .

The plan was extremely controversial as the downzoning of large estates included the estates of some village officials and their families, and it was believed that the officials were looking to downzone their properties for their own, personal benefit; it was also pointed out that the plans would have a severe, negative impact on neighboring communities, and that the village&#x27;s planning board was bypassed when drafting the plan. This caused the Village Board of adjacent Roslyn Estates to send telegrams to Governor Hugh Carey and Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz in 1977, asking them to investigate the matter, citing &quot;possible impeachable offenses&quot; from the officials in North Hills.

The master plan was rejected by the Nassau County Planning Commission twice – first in 1970 and then again in 1980 after revisions were made. Then, after several more modifications were made, it was approved in March 1980.

On May 16, 1983, North Hills dedicated Lowell H. Kane Park. The park, which is owned and operated by North Hills, is named after Lowell H. Kane – a former mayor of North Hills.

=== Deepdale Country Club controversy ===
As the general housing situation of the village of North Hills is private, gated community style living, there is little communal activity. In the 2000s, after being ranked as one of the wealthiest communities in the United States, the Mayor of North Hills decided that acquiring the Deepdale Golf Club through eminent domain for the exclusive use of residents would make the village a better place, and that it would raise home values. Deepdale, which is located on the grounds of the former estate of Joseph P. Grace, served the village with legal papers, claiming that they were abusing government power by trying to close a country club for residents only. After much dispute in and out of court, the case eventually dissolved, leaving the club in the hands of its members.

<text>Oceanside is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the southern part of the town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 32,109 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Originally known as South Bay, the English government established a township there in 1674 called Christian Hook, basing the name on the predominant religious affiliation of colonists in the area. Land development proceeded rapidly, and oyster sales took their place as a dominant force, with the local business &quot;Mott&#x27;s Landing&quot; becoming a favorite place to buy oysters.

In the nineteenth century, the town residents decided that &quot;Oceanville&quot; sounded better than &quot;Christian Hook&quot;: it was &quot;Oceanville Oysters&quot; that sold, and in 1864, the new name became official. However, there was already an Oceanville in New York, so &quot;Ocean Side&quot;, as two words, was adopted as the town&#x27;s name in 1890 (this despite it not actually fronting the Atlantic Ocean, which is located a few miles to the south. It is separated from the ocean by Reynolds Channel and other marsh islands, as well as the Long Beach Barrier Island).

The Oceanside Fire Department was established in 1902. Columbia Engine Co. #1, an old firehouse, still exists, and is located at the southwest corner of the triangle where Lincoln Avenue meets Long Beach Road.

In the 1900s, the town began rapidly expanding south, building over swamps and marshes and dramatically increasing the size of the town from a small port to a large hamlet. In 1918, the name was condensed to &quot;Oceanside&quot;.

Nathan&#x27;s Famous opened its second restaurant on June 4, 1959, on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, taking over the site of the once-popular Roadside Rest, which had opened several decades before and had offered live entertainment and dancing on a large dance floor as well as Nathan&#x27;s-type frankfurters and locally caught seafood. There was a large Nathan&#x27;s building with play areas and a big open dining room that had a stage. Shows were family events. The building was razed in 1976, and a strip mall was built in its place. A modern Nathan&#x27;s franchise subsequently opened on a small section of the original property, at the corner of Long Beach Road and Windsor Parkway. In 2016, Nathan&#x27;s moved to a smaller location on Long Beach Road.

Oceanside, New York, was a part of the post-World War II housing boom, with even more land being built over with houses and as a result, the town began to resemble Levittown. More schools were built as well as massive houses and a public park on the swampland. Because of this, Oceanside became more vulnerable to floods and natural disasters. This was proven in 2012, when Oceanside saw its worst natural disaster when Hurricane Sandy hit the area. The storm completely flooded the southern portion of the town with areas as far north as Nathan&#x27;s reporting waves of water rushing down streets. Sandy also knocked out power for nearly two weeks after a substation in the nearby town of Island Park exploded. Oceanside was one of the many towns upset with the slow response from the Long Island Power Authority and held a rally because of it. As of 2019, Oceanside still has many who are dealing with the consequences of Sandy, and some have begun leaving, with the value of houses remaining high. Flooding in low-lying areas would be much more common.

In 2014, after years of speculation and lack of business, Nathan&#x27;s announced it was moving to a smaller location on the corner of Long Beach Road and Merle Avenue (near the former Chwatsky&#x27;s). This move was greeted with controversy as many feared that the traffic from deliveries would interfere with the traffic headed to the school during weekdays. Eventually, the Town of Hempstead approved this move and The original building was officially closed on January 4, 2015. The third Nathan&#x27;s opened in early 2015, and was built as a throwback to both the first and second locations as well as having a contemporary feel to the interior.
In 2016, a massive blizzard slammed into the island and dumped nearly 2 feet of snow, and flooded many of the towns around it and some portions of the town closest to the channel.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.38%, is water.

Oceanside has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and average monthly temperatures in the village centre range from 32.1 °F in January to 74.8 °F in July. The local hardiness zone is 7b.

The town was built over swampland spanning from the early 1900s to the late 1970s. Most of the town before this, was a small sea port near the more established villages of Rockville Centre, Baldwin, and East Rockaway. The area of the town increased exponentially and its population would boom to nearly 30,000 people by the end of the 1990s.

== Transportation ==

=== Road ===
Long Beach Road, Oceanside Road, Lawson Boulevard, and Atlantic Avenue are some of the main roads in Oceanside. Other roads such as Brower Avenue and Waukena Avenue, which were built as residential streets, also carry major traffic. Sunrise Highway (NY 27) is located along the Northern border of the hamlet, with Rockville Centre and Baldwin. Merrick Road briefly passes through near South Nassau Communities Hospital.

=== Rail ===
The Long Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road passes through the west side of Oceanside, with the Oceanside station being at Weidner Avenue and Lawson Boulevard. The Oceanside train stop is the 3rd train station south on the Long Beach line. The travel time from the Oceanside train station to Penn Station is approximately 40 minutes. In the northern part of Oceanside, many commuters use either the nearby Rockville Centre Station or the Baldwin Station on the Babylon Branch.

=== Bus ===
The Nassau Inter-County Express passes through Oceanside with the n4 and n15 routes. The n36 served Oceanside until 2017, and the n16 also served Oceanside until 2012, but saw its route shortened due to budget cuts. There is presently no bus headed for the Oceanside LIRR nor are there plans for this.

<text>Old Bethpage is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located on Long Island in the Town of Oyster Bay, Nassau County, New York, United States. The population of the CDP was 5,283 at the 2020 United States Census. It is served by the Old Bethpage Post Office, ZIP code 11804.

Old Bethpage and its neighboring hamlet, Plainview, share a school system, library, fire department and water district. Law enforcement for the community is provided by the Nassau County Police Department&#x27;s Eighth Precinct.

==History==

In 1695, Thomas Powell bought about from local Indian tribes, including the Marsapeque, Matinecoc, and Sacatogue, for 140 English pounds. This land, which includes modern Bethpage, East Farmingdale, Farmingdale, Old Bethpage, Plainedge, Plainview, South Farmingdale, and part of Melville, is known as the &quot;Bethpage Purchase&quot; and is approximately east to west and north to south.

Powell called his land Bethphage, because it was situated between two other places on Long Island, Jericho and Jerusalem, just as the biblical town of Bethphage (meaning &quot;house of figs&quot;) was situated between Jericho and Jerusalem. The Long Island place formerly called Jerusalem is known as Wantagh and Island Trees, while the placename Jericho is unaltered. Over time, &quot;Bethpage&quot; was spelled without the second &quot;H&quot;. Powell&#x27;s 14 children divided his purchase and it evolved into several farming communities. The one in this mostly central part of the purchase retained the name &quot;Bethpage&quot;.

A railroad spur completed in 1873, named the Bethpage Branch of the &quot;Central Railroad of Long Island&quot;, ran to a brickworks which had opened in the 1860s on what became Battle Row and Bethpage-Sweet Hollow Road. The railway was built to transport bricks for the construction of Alexander Stewart&#x27;s Garden City.
For a few years, regularly scheduled passenger traffic also appeared in timetables, with the station named Bethpage. The line was abandoned in 1942. Remnants of a locomotive turntable can be found in the woods of Bethpage State Park on the east side of Round Swamp Road. The brickyard continued operating until 1981, with different sections known as Bethpage Brickworks, Queens County Brick Manufacturing Company, Post Brick Company, and (after Nassau County split from Queens County in 1899) Nassau Brick Company. The pitted terrain at the brickworks was used in investigations by Grumman for digital mapping of Earth.

In 1908, William Kissam Vanderbilt II began construction of the Long Island Motor Parkway, one of the country&#x27;s first highways. Eventually stretching from Queens to Lake Ronkonkoma, New York, a portion of the parkway ran through Old Bethpage. Street names such as &quot;Vanderbilt Lane&quot;, &quot;Motor Parkway&quot; and &quot;Toll Place&quot; serve as reminders. Segments of the old roadbed and some bridges can still be seen, including Battle Row Campground, Bethpage State Park, and the Old Bethpage Village Restoration.

In 1932, under the auspices of Long Island State Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, Bethpage State Park was opened. The park and its is almost entirely within the hamlet of Old Bethpage. In 1936, the adjacent hamlet of Central Park changed its name to Bethpage. Following the name change, the hamlet originally called Bethpage resisted suggestions that it merge with the new Bethpage, and got approval from the post office to change its name to &quot;Old Bethpage&quot;, though it did not have its own post office until 1965. Bethpage State Park retained its name, leading some to mistakenly believe that the park is located mostly in Bethpage.
Old Bethpage was home to at least two grand estates, the Benjamin Franklin Yoakum Estate and the Taliaferro Estate.
* The former estate of railroad tycoon Benjamin F. Yoakum included land in both Old Bethpage and the Lenox Hills neighborhood of Farmingdale Village. It was this estate that was transformed into Bethpage State Park.
* The Taliaferro Estate is the site of Country Pointe Plainview, located between the split of Old Country Road and Round Swamp Road, and was once home to the Nassau County Sanitarium, a tuberculosis ward. The sanitarium was authorized by the Nassau County Board of Supervisors in 1930, and was completed in the early part of the same decade. As tuberculosis was brought under control, the complex of Georgian style buildings was closed in the 1960s. Following its closure, the facility was given over to mixed use, including the establishment of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in 1976, and a branch of the Cornell Cooperative Extension. In 1999, Charles Wang, founder of Computer Associates purchased the property from the county for $23 million. Included in the purchase was 1535 Old Country Road, which housed the corporate offices of the New York Islanders and New York Dragons, both of which were owned by Wang. In addition, the building was home to the Wang-created Plainview Chinese Cultural Center. In 2015, the Oyster Bay board voted to approve a condominium on the same grounds. The land is known as Country Pointe Plainview and is maintained by Jericho-based Beechwood Homes; the property consists mostly of senior condos and retail space.

In 1960, responding to Nassau County&#x27;s rapid suburban expansion, the county announced the development of the Nassau County Fire Service Academy. Located on Winding Road, the academy provides training to all Nassau County fire departments.

==Arts and culture==
Old Bethpage is home to the Old Bethpage Village Restoration. Opened in 1963 on a former Powell family farm, the restoration is an authentic recreation of a mid-19th century Long Island village. The complex includes farmhouses, a blacksmith, general store, cobbler, school house and churches, all of which were moved to the site from other locations on Long Island and then restored to period condition. In 2009, the Restoration became one of six Nassau County museums slated to be closed as a result of the county&#x27;s impending budget shortfall. However, as a result of strong public opposition, the museum was announced to remain open on April 1, 2009.

Old Bethpage was home to one movie theater, located in the Tru-Value Shopping Center. This theater initially showed first or second run movies. However, in the 1970s it began to show pornographic movies until community protests forced the theater to revert to its original general commercial offerings. The theater eventually closed and remained vacant for a number of years until it was reopened as a live action theater known as the Plaza Playhouse. The Playhouse remained in Old Bethpage until June 2010, when it moved to a new strip mall on Old Country Road. The space is now vacant.

==Sports==
For children, there are multiple leagues and organizations they can join. For baseball, they can join the Plainview Little League, and for basketball, the Plainview Police Activity League (PAL).

Old Bethpage also has had two schoolbuildings in the past. One was constructed in 1825 north of the current elementary school in Old Bethpage, and one two room school house named the Little Red Schoolhouse. This building, which stood until the 1970s, was located on Schoolhouse Road, just off of Round Swamp Road. The building was torn down and the property developed into several houses.

<text>Old Westbury is a village in the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 4,671 at the 2010 census.

The Incorporated Village of Old Westbury is one of the wealthiest villages in the country as well as the second-richest zip code in the New York State, topped only by Harrison in Westchester County. In 2007, &quot;Business Week&quot; dubbed Old Westbury as New York&#x27;s most expensive suburb. Old Westbury Gardens has been recognized as one of the three best public gardens in the world by Four Seasons Hotels magazine.

== History ==
Westbury was founded by Edmond Titus, and was later joined by Henry Willis, one of the first English settlers. Westbury had been a Quaker community of isolated farms until the railroad came in 1836. After the Civil War, the New York elite discovered that the rich, well-wooded flat countryside of the Hempstead Plains was a place to raise horses, and to hunt foxes and play polo at the Meadow Brook Polo Club.

The Village of Old Westbury was incorporated in 1924, separating itself from Westbury, the adjacent area that housed many of the families of the construction and building staffs for the Old Westbury mansions. The &quot;Old&quot; part of Old Westbury&#x27;s name reflects the community&#x27;s need for its postal address to be different from the Westbury in Cayuga County, as per postal requirements (it had been using a postal address of North Hempstead for this reason); residents did this when they wanted a local post office ca. 1841, and when they incorporated Old Westbury as a village, they felt that it would be confusing for the village name and post office name to be different from one another. The Village of Westbury, located adjacent to Old Westbury, adopted that designation when it incorporated in 1932 as Cayuga County&#x27;s Westbury&#x27;s name was no longer being used.

The area was originally known as Wallage, which is related to a Native American term roughly meaning &quot;ditch&quot; or &quot;hole.&quot; By February 1663, it was known as Wood Edge, and by October 1675 it was known as &quot;the Plains edge&quot; or simply Plainedge. The name Westbury began to be used for the area around 1683. The name Westbury was chosen by Henry Willis, who named it after Westbury, Wiltshire, his hometown in England.

Westbury House was the residence of Henry Phipps&#x27; eldest son, John Shaffer Phipps. Today, the property is operated as Old Westbury Gardens. Robert Low Bacon built &#x27;Old Acres&#x27; in the style of an Italian villa. Other landowners were Thomas Hitchcock and his family, Harry Payne Whitney and his wife the former Gertrude Vanderbilt, founder of New York&#x27;s Whitney Museum, at Apple Green (formerly a Mott house), Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, whose estate is now subdivided into the Old Westbury Country Club and New York Institute of Technology. The architect Thomas Hastings built a modest house for himself, &#x27;Bagatelle&#x27;, in 1908. A. Conger Goodyear, then president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City had a house built in 1938 by famed architect Edward Durell Stone, who also destined the building for Conger&#x27;s museum. In 2003, the A. Conger Goodyear House was added to the National Register of Historic Places to protect the structure from being demolished to subdivide the expensive land surrounding it. The estate of Robert Winthrop, an investment banker and member of the Dudley–Winthrop family, for whom Winthrop-University Hospital was named, has been similarly preserved. Part of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s estate and her sculpture studio has been preserved and maintained by one of her grandchildren, Pamela Tower LeBoutillier.

During World War II, a 187-foot-high tower at the present-day Old Westbury Golf &amp; Country Club, aided the military during World War II as a lookout to spot enemy aircraft. Originally built as the water tower for the Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Residence, it now serves as the club&#x27;s focal point.

When Robert Moses was planning the Northern State Parkway, the powers of Old Westbury forced him to re-site it five miles (8 km) to the south. Once the parkway was completed, many residents found it to not be the eyesore they had been anticipating and regretted making their commutes more inconvenient than necessary. In the 1950s, the state purchased land from Charles E. Wilson, a former president of General Motors who needed to sell off his Old Westbury estate to pull himself out of financial crisis and relocate to the nation&#x27;s capital to serve in President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s cabinet. The land, which runs along an edge of the village, was used for the Long Island Expressway.

== Wealth ==
According to &quot;Bloomberg/Businessweek&quot;, as of 2011, Old Westbury was the second &quot;richest&quot; town in the United States, trailing behind only Palm Beach, Florida. The magazine previously dubbed the town &quot;New York&#x27;s wealthiest suburb.&quot;

Based on a study done by &quot;Bloomberg&quot; in 2015, the average household income in the village was greater than $640,000.

In 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot;, having done a study of &quot;America&#x27;s Millionaire Capitals&quot;, found that the average net worth of Old Westbury households was $19.6 million and with an average annual income of $1.2 million. The controlled study included only households with incomes greater than $200,000, which excluded only residents that are living in college dormitories and the staff of homeowners.

The village is famous for being the seat of many of New York&#x27;s (and America&#x27;s) wealthiest families, including the Phippses, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Webbs, Du Ponts, Winthrops, Mortimers, Belmonts and Huttons. While many of these older families—the founding members of the social elite and those that emerged during the gilded age—still count members as Old Westbury residents, the village has also maintained a substantial set of industrialists, businessmen, collectors, athletes and entertainers.

The Old Westbury Fund is a hedge fund that is named after the town.

When &quot;Forbes&quot; asked billionaire investor Steven Schonfeld what the &quot;wisest investment&quot; he ever made was, his answer was &quot;Old Westbury land&quot;.

<text>Plainedge (previously known as Turkeyville) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) on the South Shore in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 9,517 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Plainedge was originally acquired from Marsapeque Indian chiefs Sowwamacus, Wm Choppy, Soureekenny, Wamassum, Sascomoma and Ruampass land as part of the Bethpage Purchase of 1687 by Thomas Powell of the Huntington settlement. At the time, initial purchases from various settlers would occupy the &quot;Plain Edge District&quot; within various districts. The first of note came in 1690, through the efforts of eighteen joint ventures, with the purchase of the &quot;West Neck&quot; that occupied the western arena of Plainedge. In 1694, William Frost purchased all land south of Boundary Avenue, which was gifted to him by Indians Chippie, Maomie and Seruckon. There was still a remainder of land yet to be obtained, however. Through the efforts of Powell, the &quot;Rim of the Woods Purchase&quot; of 1699 acquired the remaining land in the northern section of Plainedge (Boundary Avenue, north to Old Motor Parkway, and Hicksville Road east to Cedar Drive).

The earliest developments of Plainedge past these purchases would manifest through the efforts of landowners and their African slaves. In the late eighteenth century to early nineteenth century, landowners would facilitate and oversee the development of roads, highways, and offices. Meanwhile, in the Township of Oyster Bay, slaves would tend to agriculture, tailoring, and whaling. As for the females, they were the designated homemakers, whose duties pertained to cooking, cleaning, and raising the children. These practices would persist until 1817, when New York legislators enforced the gradual emancipation within the next ten years. By 1823, slavery had fully ceased in Plainedge.

Plainedge would continue to flourish as a hotbed for agriculture. Amidst the Civil War and World War I, residents were relied upon to farm cabbages, cucumbers, and potatoes. Towards the middle of the twentieth century, these industries would slowly cease operations as a blight fell upon the soil, and the State Department of Agriculture placed agricultural restrictions against areas with the presence of Golden Nematodes.

Historian Richard Winsche notes that the &quot;Plain Edge&quot; area was alternatively called &quot;Turkeyville&quot; in the early 1800s, with the area becoming known for its thriving poultry farms; particularly, the inhabitants and their efficiency to raise turkeys. By 1845, with official maps being drafted for school districting, &quot;Turkeyville&quot; fell out of use. The current name, &quot;Plainedge&quot;, is of English origin and stems from the geographical description of the Hempstead Plains edge, which stemmed from Massapequa to Westbury.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Plainedge is located approximately 30 miles (50 km) east of Midtown Manhattan and 13 miles (20 km) east of the Queens border. It is bound by Bethpage to the north, Farmingdale and South Farmingdale to the east, North Massapequa to the south, and Levittown to the west.

Because Plainedge is not incorporated as an official town within Nassau County, residents are served by the Bethpage (11714), Massapequa (11758), Seaford (11783), Farmingdale (11735), and Levittown (11756) Post Offices.

<text>Plainview is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of Oyster Bay in east central Nassau County, New York, United States. The population of the CDP was 27,100. The Plainview post office has the ZIP code 11803.

Plainview and its neighboring hamlet, Old Bethpage, share a school system, library, fire department, and water district. Law enforcement for the communities is provided by the Nassau County Police Department&#x27;s Second and eighth Precincts.

==History==
Plainview&#x27;s origins date to 1648, when Robert Williams, a settler from Wales, bought land in the area. The land was considered desirable for farming because of a small pond named the Moscopas by local Native Americans, meaning &quot;hole of dirt and water&quot;. The remainder of the land in the area was purchased by Thomas Powell in 1695 as part of the Bethpage Purchase. The name &quot;Mannatto Hill&quot; had already appeared on the 1695 deed of the Bethpage Purchase, and the settlement came to be called &quot;Manetto Hill&quot;. &quot;Manitou&quot; was the Native American word either for &quot;god&quot; or for &quot;spirit&quot;.

The 1837 arrival of the Long Island Rail Road to nearby Hicksville brought a boom to local farming. In 1885, residents of Manetto Hill petitioned the United States Postal Service for a local post office, but were turned down because, according to several accounts, a similar name was already in use upstate. The hamlet was then named &quot;Plainview&quot;, for the view of the Hempstead Plains from the top of the Manetto Hills.

Plainview remained a farming community, famous for growing cucumbers for the huge Heinz pickle factories located in nearby Farmingdale and Hicksville. In the early 1900s blight destroyed the cucumber crop and many farmers switched to potatoes. After World War II, a potato blight combined with the desire of many returning GIs to leave New York City for the more rural Long Island, convinced many farmers to sell their property, leading to massive development in the area, giving rise to so-called suburban sprawl. Between 1950 and 1960, the hamlet grew from a population of 1,155 to more than 35,000. Most of the available land was developed during this period or otherwise designated as parkland. While overall development declined it did continue sporadically as smaller remaining parcels of land were also developed. In recent years, some of the few large remaining parcels have given way to gated communities, which are in contrast to most housing in the area. Some of these developments include &quot;The Hamlet on Olde Oyster Bay&quot; and &quot;The Seasons at Plainview&quot;, a residential community focused on over age 55 residents and first time home buyers.

==Geography==

Plainview is located at (40.779911, -73.479483).

The racial makeup of the CDP was 74.8% White, 19.9% Asian, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.6% of the population. Plainview, like many other places in northern Nassau County has historically had a large Jewish population, and in recent years has exhibited exorbitant growth in its East Asian population.

There were 8,963 households, out of which 36.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.0% were married couples living together. 16.3% of all households were made up of individuals living alone, and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.87 and the average family size was 3.24. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 25.1% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 26.0% from 25 to 44, 26.5% from 45 to 64, and 17.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.4 males.

===Library===
The Plainview Library was first established in 1956 in the Jamaica Avenue School, and later opened as a separate facility in the Morton Village Shopping Center in 1958. Significant increases in population caused the library to outgrow this space. In March 1962, voters approved a $711,000 bond issue to pay for the purchase of a nearly three-acre parcel of land and development of a new library building directly across the street from Morton Village. Two years later, the library moved into its new facilities. Since its construction, the building has had two major expansions to better serve the community&#x27;s needs, including increased audio/visual and internet demands. In 2005, a 236-seat auditorium was built, and expanded Family Center and Media Center areas were added. In 2014, library space was added from funds received previously from the New York State Dormitory Authority.
The new space was updated and redesigned with additional study rooms/public meeting areas, along with self-checkout stations, an integrated Media Area and a new Technology Department. The Plainview-Old Bethpage Library is honored to be recognized by &quot;Library Journal&quot; as a &quot;5 Star Library&quot; for the past five years.

===Mid Island Y-JCC===
The Mid Island Y-Jewish Community Center, which opened in 1956, serves residents of Plainview, Old Bethpage, Syosset and surrounding areas.

==Parks==
Plainview has numerous community parks tucked in between homes. Its primary park is the Plainview-Old Bethpage Community Park, located on Washington Avenue. Opened in 1960, this park features an Olympic size pool, a children&#x27;s pool, baseball/softball fields, tennis courts, racquetball/handball courts, basketball courts, a newly built children&#x27;s recreation playground, and trails through its woods. The woods spans from the park to the commercial hub and also to smaller community parks in the residential areas of Pal Street. During the summer, the park runs a concession stand. Parks in Plainview are administered by either the Nassau County Department of Parks, Recreation and Museums or the Town of Oyster Bay. In addition, the town is home to a nature preserve called the Manetto Hills Park. This undeveloped parkland was formerly known as the Shattuck Estate.

Borella Fields, located on Plainview Road, is another large community park. It has three baseball fields, a soccer field and a large playground.

==Estates==
Plainview was home to several grand Gold Coast estates.

* The Schwarzenbach Estate. Robert Schwarzenbach was a very successful textile manufacturer, who purchased an estate on Manetto Hill. The house was demolished long ago to make way for homes, however, one outbuilding still exists. It is located in the Manetto Hills Shopping Center. This building, originally the home provided to the estate&#x27;s gardener, operated for many years as Malarkey&#x27;s Tavern. The building presently houses a veterinarian&#x27;s office. In addition, until the 1990s, a second building was still standing. This building, which had been the estate&#x27;s chicken coop, was converted into a residence, where the gardener mentioned above eventually moved with his wife. It was located on Manetto Hill Road, just across from Nick Place.
*The Shattuck Estate. The Shattuck Estate was purchased by successful New York City attorney, Edwin Paul Shattuck, who lived there until he died in the 1960s. He was a member of the Shattuck family which owned the Frank G. Shattuck Company. The company operated, among other things, a restaurant chain known as Schrafft Foods. Mr. Shattuck was personal attorney for President Herbert Hoover. They were best friends and died within three days of each other. The property, which totals approximately , was almost developed in the 1970s until community activists forced the county to purchase the property and leave it as a nature preserve. It is located on Washington Avenue and has no signage to indicate its presence. The property&#x27;s main house was demolished in September 2013. A portion of the property now houses the AHRC&#x27;s Helen Kaplan Project, a program for developmentally disabled adults.
* The property known as the Nassau County Office Complex, located between the split of Old Country Road and Round Swamp Road, was once home to the Nassau County Sanitarium, a tuberculosis ward. Built on the Taliaferro Estate, primarily in Old Bethpage, the sanitarium was authorized by the Nassau County Board of Supervisors in 1930, and was completed in the early part of the same decade. As tuberculosis was brought under control, the complex of Georgian style buildings was closed in the 1960s. Following its closure, the facility was given over to mixed use, including the establishment of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in 1976 and a branch of the Cornell Cooperative Extension. In 1999, Charles Wang, founder of Computer Associates purchased the property from the county for $23 million. Included in the purchase was 1535 Old Country Road, which at one point housed the corporate offices of the New York Islanders and New York Dragons, both of which were owned by Wang. In addition, the building was home to the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center, an organization founded by Wang. Currently, the site is the home of Country Pointe at Plainview, which mainly hosts senior condos and retail space.

==Media==

===Television===
The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television station, WLIW, channel 21, formerly broadcast from Plainview at studios located on Channel 21 Drive. Although the studios still remain at this address, the station now shares transmission facilities with WNET on top of One World Trade Center in New York City.

===Movies===
Until the 1980s, there were several movie theaters in the community. The multiplexes built in Hicksville and Commack drew patrons away from the local theaters which were subsequently converted, primarily, to office or retail use.

* Century&#x27;s Morton Village, Morton Village Shopping Center. This theater, located at the western end of the shopping center, was converted to retail space with office space above. It is named for the Morton Village development north and south of the strip mall.
** Beginning in 1976, the theater began pinning their ticket price to the year and lowered their ticket price to 7 cents. The price was raised a penny a year until their 1984 closure. It was widely referred to as &quot;the 76 cent movie theater&quot; until it closed.
** During his 1984 Presidential run, Walter Mondale made a campaign stop in the parking lot of the Morton Village Shopping Center immediately adjacent to the theater.
* Old Country Theater. Located west of the intersection of Old Country and Plainview Roads, immediately west of the Shell gas station. Initially a single screen theater, it was converted into a twin. After its closure, the building was converted to an office building, housing mostly medical offices.
* RKO Plainview Twin. This movie theater was located behind the Plainview Centre on South Oyster Bay Road. This building was converted (and expanded) into today&#x27;s Shoprite.
* The Plainview, A Century Theater. This theater was located on the west side of South Oyster Bay Road (facing what is now the Plainview Centre, noted above) next to the Donut Man and, therefore is actually in Hicksville as South Oyster Bay Road is the boundary line between two hamlets. It was converted into an office building, housing mostly medical offices.

===Radio===
Plainview is home to WPOB 88.5 FM, the local radio station located in the Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School. The school shares the same frequency as Syosset High School&#x27;s WKWZ station.

<text>Plandome is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is one of the three villages which comprise the area of Cow Neck known as the Plandomes, and it is also considered part of the Greater Manhasset area, which is anchored by Manhasset. The population was 1,448 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Plandome was ranked fifth on Forbes&#x27; 10 most affluent U.S. communities list in 2009.

==History==

=== Pre-incorporation (pre-colonization – 1910) ===
The location of what is now the Village of Plandome was originally inhabited by Matinecock Native Americans. These Native American inhabitants called the area Sint Sink, meaning &quot;place of small stones.&quot; 

During the 17th century, Dutch and English colonists began to settle the area, with fishing in Manhasset Bay and farming serving as a major industries. In 1623, Cow Neck was claimed by the Dutch West India Company, and they began forcing English settlers to leave in 1640. A land purchase in 1643 made it possible for English settlers to return to Cow Neck. This era saw members of prominent colonial families settle on the peninsula, including members of the Mitchill, Nicolls, and Willets families. The Mitchill family, which settled in the area in 1694, owned a significant portion of the land which would eventually become the village – as did the George Willets, of the Willets family, which has long had a large presence on Cow Neck and across Long Island. 

The Great Neck and Port Washington Railroad, a subsidiary of the Long Island Rail Road, built what is today known as the Port Washington Branch through the community in 1898; Plandome became a flag stop until the opening of the permanent Plandome station in 1909. This new station would also house the community&#x27;s U.S. Post Office, which would service all portions of what are now the Village of Plandome and Village of Plandome Manor – in addition to a portion of what is now the Village of Flower Hill.

During the first few years of the 20th century, four friends – all young men residing in New York City – purchased approximately of the property owned by the Mitchill family. They founded the Plandome Land Company, through which they subsequently developed vast swaths of the land with single-family homes, centered around Plandome Village Green and a large Tudor building which would eventually become Plandome Village Hall.

=== Village of Plandome (1911 – present) ===

The Village of Plandome was incorporated in 1911 as the Plandome Land Company began to develop land, though some homes, farmhouses, and mills had been built in the area in prior decades. Plandome, like the surrounding villages – Plandome Manor and Plandome Heights, derives its name from the Latin &quot;Planus Domus&quot;, meaning plain, or level home.

In 1913, the village established the Plandome Fire Department – a municipal fire department exclusively serving the village.

In 1943, the Plandome Post Office, which had operated as an independent branch up until that point, merged with the Manhasset Post Office. As part of the merger, the Plandome Post Office would continue to operate, but it would be reclassified as a branch of the Manhasset Post Office, thereby allowing the facility to remain in operation while enabling the residents of Plandome to receive home delivery services from the post office.

In January 1987, the original Plandome LIRR station house and the Plandome Post Office within it burned down in an arson attack executed by vandals. It was subsequently rebuilt – in addition to having its platform lengthened and refurbished – by 1990; the Plandome Post Office would also be rebuilt within the structure – this time in its own, dedicated space on the ground floor, beneath the station&#x27;s waiting room.
In the early 1990s, the Reconstructionist Synagogue of the North Shore moved to Plandome from nearby Roslyn Estates; it moved to a property formerly used as a church by the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the North Shore, which itself was moving to a new location in Manhasset.

The Village of Plandome celebrated its centennial in 2011.

In 2019, former Village Trustee Thomas S. Minutillo was elected as Mayor through a write-in campaign. He was subsequently succeeded by former Village Trustee John “Jake” Kurkjian in 2023.

=== Landmarks ===
The Willets Farmhouse – for centuries a prominent structure in the area – was built circa 1810, by brewer George Willets of the Willets family of Cow Neck. The Almeron and Olive Smith House at 50 South Drive is dated to 1907 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

<text>Plandome Heights is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Manhasset area, which is anchored by Manhasset. The population was 1,009 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Duke family owned large portions of Plandome Heights in the early 20th century.

Prior to incorporating, the residents in the original part of Plandome Heights (the western and central portions) had unsuccessfully petitioned for neighboring Plandome to annex their area. This resulted in residents deciding to incorporate following Plandome&#x27;s refusal, and Plandome Heights officially became a village on June 11, 1929.

<text>Plandome Manor is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The majority of the village is considered part of the Greater Manhasset area, which is anchored by Manhasset. The easternmost part of the village is more closely associated with Port Washington. The population was 793 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Plandome Manor is in the Town of North Hempstead, and is the northernmost of the three Plandomes.

==History==
The Village of Plandome Manor incorporated in 1931. Like the villages of Plandome and Plandome Heights to its south, Plandome Manor derives its name from the Latin &#x27;Planus Domus&#x27;, meaning plain, or level home. The manor house of Matthias Nicoll who was an early mayor of New York City and among the first generation of the Nicoll family on Long Island, was a wood-frame home built in the 1670s, and one of the first homesteads in this area of Cow Neck, the namesake of the Cow Neck Peninsula (also known as the Manhasset/Port Washington Peninsula). The manor itself was torn down in 1998 and replaced with another estate.

Author Frances H. Burnett, author of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, built her home, Fairseat, in Plandome Park in 1908, and lived there until her death in 1924. Burnett&#x27;s son, Vivian, and his wife Constance, had erected a home nearby on Bayview Road after their marriage. Following Frances Burnett&#x27;s death, her nephew, publisher Archer P. Fahnestock moved into Fairseat, but the home burned down leaving only the stucco carriage house and garden intact. In 1940, Fahnestock sold it to Leroy Grumman.

<text>Point Lookout is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 1,527 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is mostly made up of residential homes, with several small businesses on Lido Boulevard. The town is surrounded on three sides by water. Today, Point Lookout has become a popular location for summer residences. Among its inhabitants, it is commonly referred to as &quot;PLO&quot;.

==Geography==

Point Lookout is located at the east end of Long Beach Barrier Island. It is adjacent to Lido Beach, which in turn abuts the city of Long Beach, to the west. Point Lookout covers a total area of , all land.

Long Beach Barrier Island, which lies between Reynolds Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, was originally formed by glacial deposits and includes a variety of bays, dunes, ponds, marshes, and ocean shoreline, which supports a complex ecosystem that includes a wide variety of flora and fauna. Jones Inlet separates it from Jones Beach Island.

==Demographics==

At the time of the 2020 census and the 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the total population was 1,527 people and 556 estimated households. The population density was . There were 855 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 93.06% White, 0.52% African American, 1.18% Asian, 0.79% from other races, and 4.45% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.06% of the population.

Out of 556 households, 11.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.5% were married couples living together, 35.6% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 20.9% had a male householder with no spouse present. The average family size was 2.65.

==History==

Point Lookout&#x27;s first known inhabitants were Merrick (Meroke) Native Americans, a tribe of the Algonquin people. The first European settlers in Point Lookout were Dutch, who arrived in the 1640s, followed by the English, in the 1660s.

In 1906, Senator William Reynolds of Brooklyn led a consortium that purchased the entire barrier island. In 1918, Nassau By the Sea was nearly wiped out by fire. In the 1920s, Senator Reynolds established Point Lookout Inc., which brought in concrete streets and divided the community into small plots which were sold to families for approximately $2,500 a parcel, giving rise to the Point Lookout community. Those bungalows that had not burned in Nassau By the Sea, as well as others from other marsh islands, were moved to Point Lookout and can be seen around the community today. The barrier beach on which Point Lookout sits has been, in one incarnation or another, there for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The first mention of Point Lookout begins to appear in the mid-19th century, as a location for whalers, and as a dangerous spot for ships. A United States Life-Saving Service Station was established at Point Lookout in 1872; ironically, it was due to the tragic wreck of the ship &quot;Mexico&quot; on January 2, 1837, that a U.S. Life Saving Station was created; the service remained there until farmers grew salt hay on the marshes that stretch behind the site.

A series of hotel and seasonal bungalows was built, as was a seasonal railroad connecting Point Lookout to Long Beach, but nearly all these structures were destroyed over time by either winter storms or fire. During the summer months ferries from the Woodcleft Canal in Freeport brought hundreds of day-trippers to Point Lookout&#x27;s beaches, and for those who lived in Point Lookout, or in the small community to the east called Nassau By the Sea, the barrier island was a paradise.

During the fall and winter of 2018, with the beach undergoing construction, the Pavilion was torn down. 

Point Lookout has small homes, densely packed into very small plots, and does not have sanitary or storm sewers.

==Places of worship==
Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church is located at 75 Parkside Drive, Point Lookout, NY 11561.

Point Lookout Community Church is located at 60 Freeport Avenue, Point Lookout, NY 11569.

Point Lookout is served by the Point Lookout-Lido Fire Department, founded in 1931. It is located at 102 Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout, NY 11569.

==Postal services==
The Point Lookout post office is located at 110 Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout, NY 11569-9700. There are no mail delivery services in Point Lookout.

==Notable residents==

<text>Port Washington is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) on the Cow Neck Peninsula in the Town of North Hempstead, in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York. The hamlet is the anchor community of the Greater Port Washington area. The population was 16,753 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Much of the Port Washington area was settled by colonists in 1644, after they purchased land from the people of the Matinecock Nation.

In the 1870s, Port Washington became an important sand-mining town; it had the largest sandbank east of the Mississippi River and easy barge access to Manhattan. Some 140 million cubic yards of local sand were used for concrete for skyscrapers in New York City (including the Empire State and Chrysler buildings), in addition to the New York City Subway. In 1998, the sand mines were redeveloped as Harbor Links – a golf course for North Hempstead residents.

In 1930, Port Washington tried to incorporate itself as a city, which would have had the same boundaries as the Port Washington Union Free School District – excluding Sands Point, which had already incorporated itself as a village several years prior. This plan ultimately failed when the bill was killed after Baxter Estates, Flower Hill, and Manorhaven incorporated themselves as villages in order to retain home rule over their respective areas.

The Port Washington Post Office – commissioned by the United States Government as part of the New Deal – opened in 1935.

In the late 1930s, prior to the opening of the Marine Air Terminal at LaGuardia Airport, Port Washington was Pan-American World Airways&#x27; New York base for their Yankee Clipper Boeing B-314 flying boats; the waters of Manhasset Bay were ideal for flying boat operations. Common destinations served included London, Southampton (UK), the Azores, and Bermuda.

==Geography==

<text>Port Washington North is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Port Washington area, which is anchored by Port Washington. The population was 3,160 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Port Washington North is located on the Cow Neck Peninsula, within the Town of North Hempstead.

== History ==
The area now consisting of the Port Washington North was initially settled by European colonists in 1644, after they purchased land from the people of the Matinecock Nation.

Port Washington North incorporated in 1932 after residents of the area unanimously voted in favor of incorporating on July 6 of that year. Its first Mayor, John Cocks, led the movement to incorporate; he was elected on August 2, 1932.

In 1931, one year prior to the incorporation of Port Washington North as a village, the adjacent village, Manorhaven, unsuccessfully attempted to annex the area. Manorhaven&#x27;s annexation bid was unsuccessful due to how the residents in what would ultimately become Port Washington North preferred to incorporate as a separate village.

In 1953, an uninhabited area occupied by a sand mine, located along Cow Neck Road, was annexed by the village.

By the late 1950s, the Colonial Sand and Gravel Company began selling tracts of their land to developers. In 1959, approval was given by the village for developers to begin constructing the first section of Port Washington North&#x27;s Soundview Village subdivision.

In 1982, the Village of Port Washington North celebrated its 50th anniversary.

<text>Rockville Centre, commonly abbreviated as RVC, is an incorporated village located in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 26,016 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The site of Rockville Centre has been occupied by humans for thousands of years. Generally speaking, the people of the prehistoric Woodlands period East River culture are believed to have been the Algonkian-speaking ancestors of the historical Indian tribes of western Long Island. The historical territory of their Lenape descendants, the Canarsie, Recouwacky (Rockaway), Matinecock and Massapequa, included present-day western Long Island&#x27;s Queens and Nassau Counties.

By the year 1643, there were roughly thirteen Algonquin bands (then referred to as tribes) living east of the Dutch-English settlements: the four or so Lenape chieftaincies in western Long Island, and Metoac descendants of the prehistoric Woodlands period Windsor culture living on eastern Long Island, considered by some to be branches of the Pequot: Merrick, Nissequoge, Secatoag, Seatauket, Patchoag, Poosepatuck (also called Uncachogee), Corchaug, Shinnecock, Manhansett (also called Manhasset), and Montaukett.

Imported diseases had decimated the natives in 16th century. While disease was still a major factor during the decades of the 17th century, native mortality in western Long Island due to disease was similar to that of the settlers. Most Lenape were pushed out of their homeland by expanding European colonies; the colonies received many emigrants while the Munsee-speaking Indian communities did not. Their dire situation was exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.

The Reckouakie tribe (the Reckonhacky chieftaincy) had left their original land in present-day Rockaway and its surroundings in Queens County to Dutch Governor Kieft in 1640 because he wanted it for better defense of New Netherlands. Most settled to the east in what was to become Rockville Centre on the traditional land of the Matinecock (or of the Massapequa), with whom they had ties of kinship. Dutch and English settlers declared the 1639 treaty meant no Indians would remain in western Long Island (so they could sell it to emigrants), in contrast to the exact terms of the treaty which meant the Native Americans were willing to share the usufruct of unoccupied land, with the Dutch leadership having eminent domain superior to their sachem&#x27;s eminent domain. This led to many conflicts, then four years of open warfare. The Reckonhacky / Rockaway were party to a peace treaty dated May 24, 1645, following the devastation of Indian communities by Dutch soldiers. Violent expropriation dislocated them with the arrival of additional Dutch and English settlers.

The hamlet was named &quot;Rockville Centre&quot; in 1849, after local Methodist preacher and community leader Mordecai &quot;Rock&quot; Smith. It was incorporated as a village in 1893. Rockville Centre emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as a commuter town connected to New York by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). In 1915, the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; went so far as to declare that Rockville Centre was a place in which &quot;the average mortal could live happily.&quot;

Like many Long Island communities at the time, Rockville Centre&#x27;s population included a considerable number of supporters of the Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s. When the white supremacist organization placed a wreath at the town&#x27;s memorial to its war dead in 1923, the American Legion removed it in protest, but the village police received so many calls of complaint in response that they were forced to replace the wreath. In the late 1960s, the village of Rockville Centre received a stinging rebuke for its failure to maintain public housing units primarily inhabited by African-Americans. A report from Nassau County&#x27;s Human Rights Commission stated Rockville Centre was &quot;at best indifferent to, if not actually in favor of, Negro removal.&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. visited Rockville Centre in 1968, where he addressed a large audience at South Side Junior High School on March 26, 1968.

In the early 1940s, Rockville Centre annexed the Mercy Medical Center property; the annexation saw the village&#x27;s total area expand by .

On February 17, 1950, two LIRR trains collided near Rockville Centre station, killing 32 and injuring more than 80.

The Rockville Centre Post Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

==History==
The community is named for former President Theodore Roosevelt, but was also known as Greenwich and Rum Point for a time before that.

==Education==

The majority of Roosevelt is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Roosevelt Union Free School District. However, small portions of the hamlet&#x27;s southwestern and southeastern corners are located within the boundaries of (and thus served by) the Baldwin Union Free School District and the Freeport Union Free School District, respectively. As such, children who reside within Roosevelt and attend public schools go to school in one of these three districts depending on where they live within the hamlet.

Additionally, the portion of the Meadowbrook State Parkway within the hamlet is located within the Merrick UFSD, the North Merrick UFSD, and the Bellmore–Merrick Central High School District. However, no homes in the hamlet are located in these areas.

<doc id="126781" wikidata="Q2039075" url="?curid=126781" title="Roslyn, New York">
<text>Roslyn ( ) is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is the Greater Roslyn area&#x27;s anchor community. The population was 2,988 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Roslyn was initially settled by colonists in the year 1643. It was originally called Hempstead Harbor, but its name was changed to Roslyn in 1844 due to postal confusion regarding all the other &quot;Hempsteads&quot; scattered about Long Island. The name &quot;Roslyn&quot; was selected as the new name, as its location in a valley reminded officials of Roslin, Scotland.

In 1931, Gerry Park – a large park in the center of the village – opened.

Roslyn was incorporated as a village on January 11, 1932. Its first Mayor was Albertson W. Hicks, who was unanimously elected two days later, on January 13.

In the late 1940s, the 217-unit Roslyn Gardens co-op development was built. Located off of Warner Avenue, it was built in part with funding from Title 608 of the Federal Housing Administration and was the first major rental housing development built in the New York area under Title 608&#x27;s then-new provisions. The complex was designed by architects Max M. Simon and T. E. Merrill.

On January 3, 1950, the William Cullen Bryant Viaduct opened to traffic. Built as part of the Roslyn Bypass – a realignment of New York State Route 25A within the Village of Flower Hill and the Village of Roslyn, the bridge&#x27;s completion provided a bypass of Roslyn and alleviated a severe traffic bottleneck along Old Northern Boulevard through the community. Its construction required the demolition of the original Bryant Library, which subsequently operated out of temporary locations until relocating to its current home – the Roslyn War Memorial Building – in 1952.

The former Rubel estate in the village was developed as the Roslyn Pines subdivision in the 1950s, consisting of roughly 102 homes.

The Ellen E. Ward Memorial Clock Tower in Roslyn was designed by Lamb and Rich, and was completed in 1895. It was sold to the Village of Roslyn by the Town of North Hempstead for $1 for its centennial in 1995.

Also taking place in 1995 was the opening of the Village of Roslyn&#x27;s current Village Hall on Old Northern Boulevard.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and 1.56% is water.

=== Topography ===
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Geological Survey, the highest point in Roslyn is located near Piper Court, at approximately , and the lowest point is Hempstead Harbor, which is at sea level.

=== Drainage ===
Roslyn is split between two minor drainage areas: Hempstead Harbor (part of the Hempstead Harbor Watershed) and Mill River (part of the Mill River Watershed). According to the Köppen climate classification, the majority of Roslyn is within the Hempstead Harbor Watershed, meaning water in those areas drains north to Hempstead Harbor and ultimately into the Long Island Sound. Meanwhile, the southwestern edge of the village is within the Mill River Watershed, meaning water in that area drains south to the Mill River and ultimately into Hewlett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

Additionally, all of Roslyn is located within the larger Long Island Sound/Atlantic Ocean Watershed.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Roslyn has a Humid subtropical climate (type Cfa) with cool, wet winters and hot, humid summers. Precipitation is uniform throughout the year, with slight spring and fall peaks.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===

==== Road ====
The William Cullen Bryant Viaduct (carrying New York State Route 25A) passes through – and serves as a bypass of – Roslyn. Prior to the opening of the Bryant Viaduct, NY 25A traveled through the heart of the village&#x27;s downtown (along Old Northern Boulevard) and was notorious for its traffic jams in the area.

Other major roads located either partially or wholly within the village include Bryant Avenue, East Broadway, Layton Street, Main Street, Mineola Avenue, Mott Avenue, Old Northern Boulevard, Railroad Avenue, Roslyn Road, Tower Place, Walbridge Lane, Warner Avenue, West Shore Road, and Wittes Lane.

==== Rail ====
Although no train station is currently located within village limits, the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Roslyn station used to be located on the Roslyn–Roslyn Heights border. It is now located completely within Roslyn Heights – just north of said border. This station, served by the LIRR&#x27;s Oyster Bay Branch, is the nearest station to the village.

Furthermore, the Oyster Bay Branch forms much of the village&#x27;s eastern border.

==== Bus ====
Roslyn is served by six Nassau Inter-County Express bus routes: the n20H, the n20X, the n21, the n23, the n40X, and the Port Washington Shuttle.

=== Utilities ===

==== Natural gas ====
National Grid USA provides natural gas to homes and businesses that are hooked up to natural gas lines in Roslyn.

==== Power ====
PSEG Long Island provides power to all homes and businesses within Roslyn.

==== Water ====

Roslyn is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Roslyn Water District, which provides the entirety of Roslyn with water.

==== Sewage ====
The Village of Roslyn has a sanitary sewer system. The sewage from the Village&#x27;s sewer system is pumped to and is treated by the Nassau County Sewage District&#x27;s Cedar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant via the East Hills Interceptor line, which connects the village&#x27;s system with Nassau County&#x27;s and the treatment plant on the South Shore.

Prior to having the sanitary waste treated by Nassau County&#x27;s facilities, the village&#x27;s sewer system expelled the sanitary sewage locally into Hempstead Harbor, contributing to water pollution problems.

<text>Roslyn Estates is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. The population was 1,318 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==

=== Before the village (pre-colonization – 1931) ===
The area where Roslyn Estates is located was originally inhabited by the Matinecock Native Americans. European colonists started to settle in the area in the 17th century – specifically settlers of Dutch and English heritage. From that point until the early 20th century, much of what is now the Village of Roslyn Estates consisted of farmland and estates.

Around 1908, the land was purchased by developer Dean Alvord, who also developed Prospect Park South in Brooklyn and Belle Terre in Port Jefferson. On this land, Alvord would create the planned, residential community which today forms the Village of Roslyn Estates, under the name &quot;Roslyn Estates, Incorporated&quot;. It was nicknamed &quot;The Eden of Long Island&quot; when originally developed, due to the community&#x27;s design and setting.

In 1911, the community&#x27;s civic association, known as the Association of Roslyn Estates, was formed. As of 2024, it is the oldest active civic association in Nassau County.

=== Village of Roslyn Estates (1931 – present) ===
In 1931, residents decided to try incorporating Roslyn Estates as a village, due to the fact that the community&#x27;s original deed restrictions were set to expire around that time. Their efforts to incorporate were successful, and the Village of Roslyn Estates was incorporated on June 8, 1931.

In the mid-1950s, a housing development, known as Homes in Roslyn Estates, was constructed in the village, and sponsored by builders Edward Fineberg and Arthur Bandes and consisting of 60 ranch and split-level homes designed by architect Stanley J. Shaftel.

In 1972, Roslyn Estates Village Hall was built. It was designed by John A. Grammas on land given to the village by the firm of Saul Sokolov, Inc., which had developed that section of Roslyn Estates several years prior.

In 1974, Mayor Robert D. Zucker attempted to have the boundaries of the Manhasset Park District redrawn to include the village after the district added an additional 260 parking spaces to the commuter parking fields at the Manhasset Long Island Rail Road station. Zucker stated that many Roslyn Estates residents preferred the Manhasset station over the closer Roslyn station due to the fact that service to/from Pennsylvania Station on the Port Washington Branch is direct, whereas a change at Jamaica is required on the Oyster Bay Branch. By having the district boundaries redrawn to include the village, Roslyn Estates residents would have the ability to be guaranteed a parking space at the Manhasset station for commuting to/from Manhattan. Officials from both the Town of North Hempstead and the Manhasset Park District – as well as Manhasset residents – lamented the idea, given that Roslyn Estates is not part of the Greater Manhasset area, and felt that the needs of Greater Manhasset should be paramount for the Manhasset Park District. The proposal was ultimately denied.

Roslyn Estates celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1981.

=== Etymology ===
The name of Roslyn Estates was taken directly from the name which was used by the community&#x27;s original development group, Roslyn Estates, Incorporated. The &quot;Roslyn&quot; part of its name is shared with Roslyn, Roslyn Harbor, and Roslyn Heights, and ultimately can be traced back to when the name &quot;Roslyn&quot; was chosen for that village, which was chosen because the geography in Roslyn reminded officials of the geography of Roslin, Scotland.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

=== Topography ===

<text>Roslyn Harbor is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. The population was 1,067 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Roslyn Harbor is located mostly in the Town of North Hempstead with small sections in the Town of Oyster Bay.

== History ==
Prior to the European powers colonizing Long Island, the area was inhabited by the Matinecock Native Americans. The European powers began to settle in and colonize the area during the 17th century; many of the area&#x27;s first settlers from Europe were Dutch and English.

In the 19th century, many wealthy individuals from New York City began to erect large country estates on Long Island&#x27;s Gold Coast – including many in what is now the Village of Roslyn Harbor.

Roslyn Harbor incorporated as a village on October 17, 1931, as a result of the residents wishing to make their own zoning codes and other laws under the Municipal Home Rule Law. At the time, the majority of Roslyn Harbor consisted of a few large estates.

=== Etymology ===
The &quot;Roslyn&quot; part of Roslyn Harbor&#x27;s name is shared with Roslyn, Roslyn Estates, and Roslyn Heights, and ultimately can be traced back to when the name &quot;Roslyn&quot; was chosen for that village, as the geography in Roslyn reminded officials of the geography of Roslin, Scotland. The &quot;Harbor&quot; part of the name reflects its proximity to Hempstead Harbor. The name was chosen during the incorporation movement.

An earlier proposed name was Roslyn Hills, due to its hilly location, proximity to Roslyn, and because the Long Island Rail Road advertised the area as the &quot;Switzerland of Long Island.&quot; The &quot;Hills&quot; was substituted with &quot;Harbor&quot; after concerns were expressed that it could be mixed up with Roslyn Heights.

Prior to incorporating, the area was generally considered part of Roslyn (which wouldn&#x27;t incorporate until 1932), and before that name was chosen for the area in 1844, it was known as Hempstead Harbor.

<text>Roslyn Heights is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. The population was 6,747 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Roslyn Heights saw a major economic boom in the 1860s, shortly after the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Oyster Bay Branch was built through and opened in the area.

Starting in 1892, corporation was started to develop the northwestern section of the hamlet. Members of this development corporation included lawyers, bankers, and developers. This development, which was named Roslyn Highlands, was largely unsuccessful. Eventually, the western portion of the proposed Roslyn Highlands development was developed using the name of Roslyn Highlands while the eastern part was developed using the name of Roslyn Heights. These names were used for the respective sections until the whole area became known as Roslyn Heights in the late 1920s.

On July 18, 1913, the Roslyn Heights Post Office opened. It moved to its present location at 66 Mineola Avenue in 1967, with the dedication ceremony taking place on Sunday, July 30, 1967.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the area of Roslyn Heights south of the Northern State Parkway known as Roslyn Country Club proposed incorporating itself as a village, citing the desire for home rule the first time in the 1950s and their dissatisfaction with Nassau County&#x27;s plans to widen Roslyn Road the second time in the 1960s. These proposals were ultimately unsuccessful, and all of Roslyn Heights remains an unincorporated hamlet within and directly governed by the Town of North Hempstead to this day.

A major urban renewal project also took place in the northeastern part of the hamlet during the 20th Century – specifically the area around the Roslyn Long Island Rail Road station known as Roslyn Plaza. The Roslyn Plaza Urban Renewal Project began in the early 1970s and the final phase broke ground in 1983. This project was carried out by the Town of North Hempstead.

Historically, like many other parts of the Greater Roslyn area, what is now known as Roslyn Heights was known as Hempstead Harbor until that name was changed to Roslyn in the 1840s.

=== Etymology ===
The &quot;Roslyn&quot; part of the hamlet&#x27;s name is shared with Roslyn, Roslyn Estates, and Roslyn Harbor, and ultimately can be traced back to when the name &quot;Roslyn&quot; was chosen for that village, as the geography in Roslyn reminded officials of the geography of Roslin, Scotland. The &quot;Heights&quot; part of its name reflects the name of the portion of the area developed using the name Roslyn Heights, which is ultimately the name which the Roslyn Heights Post Office opted to use when it was established in 1913.

<text>Russell Gardens is a village on the Great Neck Peninsula in the Town of North Hempstead, in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 978 at the 2020 census.

The area was proposed to become part of neighboring Thomaston in that village&#x27;s original incorporation plans – but residents objected and decided instead to incorporate Russell Gardens as a separate village that same year.

== History ==
Russell Gardens was originally developed by Francis H. Knighton, who had previously played a small role in the Rickert–Finlay Realty Company, which developed the nearby community of Kensington. The land was largely pastoral, and games of polo were often played in the open fields.

The majority of the 135-acre (55 ha) area now encompassing the village was originally part of the estate of Captain Frederick Russell. The estate had previously been owned by the Schenck family and subsequently by the Haviland family. Other areas were purchased from Arthur Cushman, as well as from others. After purchasing the land, Knighton quickly started to develop it, and chose to name his development after Captain Russel by naming it Russell Gardens; the name would become Russell Gardens, Incorporated when Knighton opted to incorporate the syndicate which had been assisting him in the financing of his endeavors.

The group would continue developing the community, laying out streets, utilities, and parkland. They opted to place all of the community&#x27;s wiring underground and had landscaper J.J. Levinson landscape for the community.

In 1931, around the same time when neighboring Thomaston proposed incorporating itself and potentially taking in this development as part of their village, the residents felt that in order to maintain the character of their community, it would be imperative for them to incorporate Russell Gardens as a separate village in order to create and pass their own zoning ordinances. Subsequently, the majority of Russell Gardens residents ultimately voted in favor of incorporation that year, and Russell Gardens officially became its own incorporated village on September 23, 1931.

In 1981, Russell Gardens established its own Village Justice Court; its establishment allowed for the village to begin handling traffic- and municipal code-related issues locally.

<text>Saddle Rock is a village on the Great Neck Peninsula in the Town of North Hempstead, in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 989 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The area now consisting of the Village of Saddle Rock was, like the rest of the Great Neck Peninsula, originally inhabited by the Matinecock Native Americans. The first European settlers arrived in the area during the 17th century. The Village of Saddle Rock is so named for an offshore boulder that gives the appearance of a saddle, first noted on a map in 1658, during these early years of European settlement.

The village is also home to a historic mill. Officially known as the Saddle Rock Grist Mill, it was built circa 1700 and is located inside a small cove that opens onto Little Neck Bay off Long Island Sound. The mill is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is the oldest continually operating tidal grist mill in the United States. The mill is now owned and operated by Nassau County as a working museum open to the public. The mill has been restored to its mid-19th-century appearance and is located on Grist Mill Lane.

The first Mayor of Saddle Rock was Roswell Eldridge, who was appointed &quot;Acting Mayor&quot; after he had incorporated his own private estate as the Village of Saddle Rock in 1911.

In 1926, Eldridge&#x27;s wife, Louise Udall Skidmore Eldridge, officially became the first female Mayor of Saddle Rock, and reportedly the first female Mayor in the state of New York. Louise Eldridge served as Mayor from 1926 until her death in 1947. She was also the last private individual to own the grist mill.

In the summer of 1946, the County of Nassau began work on closing the Old Mill Pond Brook and placed it into a boxed-in culvert. Residents had requested for Nassau to place the brook into a culvert since 1943, and cited that the brook often caused road washouts and basement floods.

== In popular culture ==
In F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), Sands Point (Port Washington/Manhasset/Cow Neck) was referred to as &quot;East Egg&quot;. East Egg (Port Washington/Manhasset/Cow Neck) residents inherited their fortunes and were more highly respected than the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; in newer &quot;West Egg&quot; (Great Neck/Kings Point), because Sands Point had &quot;old money&quot;. The story&#x27;s fictional Buchanans lived in the western part of Sands Point. Reports incorrectly suggest that Fitzgerald – while he was a guest at the mansion of Herbert Bayard Swope on Hoffstot Lane, at Prospect Point in Sands Point – used the site and its parties as his inspiration for the fictional Buchanan home in East Egg. The home may have served as one of the many inspirations, as Fitzgerald did likely visit it during his time living in Great Neck (1922–24), but not as a guest of Swope&#x27;s. Fitzgerald left Great Neck for Paris in 1924, prior to Swope&#x27;s purchase of that mansion. The likely story with regard to Swope is that Fitzgerald and his good friend Ring Lardner would observe many parties held at the home Swope was residing in during the time Fitzgerald was actually living in the area. This Swope residence was adjacent to Lardner&#x27;s home on Shore Road in Great Neck, and is no longer extant, though Lardner&#x27;s mansion is still standing.

Another Sands Point mansion, situated next to the Sands Point Light and across a shallow bay from Prospect Point, was Beacon Towers. Scholars believe it served as one of the many inspirations for Jay Gatsby&#x27;s mansion in the novel, though Gatsby lived on the eastern side of Kings Point, in the book. The extravagant Gothic-style residence was built by Alva Belmont, formerly Alva Vanderbilt, in 1918. It was demolished in 1945.

<text>Seaford is a census-designated place in the town of Hempstead, Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 15,251 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and 0.38% is water.

==History==
The original settlers of Seaford were the Marsapeaques, a Native American Indian tribe. They called the area &quot;Great Water Land.&quot;

European settlement began with the arrival of Captain John Seaman, a native of Seaford, East Sussex, in England. After obtaining the patent for the area, Seaman oversaw the creation of Jerusalem South, the first European name given to the town which was to become Seaford. It was also widely referred to as Seaman&#x27;s Neck.

During the 19th century, as villages across Long Island started to grow (due to the creation of the Long Island Rail Road), the town of Jerusalem South seemed to be unaffected. In 1868 the town was renamed to the current name of &quot;Seaford&quot;, to honor Captain Seaman&#x27;s hometown in England. During this time, Seaford remained an agriculturally developed area. Over time, the town gained a post office, a church, and a one-room school, established in what would many years later become the first fire house and today as of 1976 serves as the home of the Seaford Historical Museum. Although the town itself was practically unchanged, many New York City residents had discovered that the area was attractive as a summer retreat.

With the creation of Sunrise Highway in 1929, Seaford started to see a large influx of inhabitants. Before 1929, Seaford had approximately 1,200 citizens. Within 25 years, this number would triple.

===Economy===

Cash crops such as corn and wheat were some of the earliest farmed within the Seaford area. Due to easy access to various waterfronts, the attempts to fish and recover oysters were widely seen. At first, this was a hard task considering the layers of land beneath the water. In the mid-19th century, baymen from the Seaford area created a type of small, round-bottomed boat called the &quot;Seaford skiff&quot; that was used for fishing and market gunning (commercial waterfowl hunting).

With the popularity of hunting and fishing came the development of two hotels along Merrick Road: the Sportsman&#x27;s Hotel, where Verity Moving is now located along new Route 135, and the Powell Hotel at Jackson Avenue. Many celebrities came to these hotels to go duck hunting in South Oyster Bay, including New York Yankees Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, as well as brewery and longtime Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert. Local guides, including Nelson Verity and Sheriff Garner Paine (one of Long Island&#x27;s first black officials), would take them to the bay for sport.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 15,791 people, 5,257 households, and 4,200 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 5,358 housing units at an average density of .

== History ==
The Village of South Floral Park was incorporated in November 1925 as the Village of Jamaica Square.

However its name was changed to South Floral Park in 1931 due to confusion with said neighborhood in Queens; the new name was chosen based on the fact that the village is located immediately south of and adjacent to Floral Park.

Residents decided to incorporate their community because they felt that the Town of Hempstead was unable to adequately fulfill the needs of their community, and believed that a more localized government would be able to govern it better.

In 1953, South Floral Park Village Hall was constructed. The building was expanded in 1984 to rehouse the village&#x27;s fire department in a more modern and efficient facility, which was dedicated on October 19, 1986.

<text>Thomaston is a village in eastern Great Neck in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 2,759 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Thomaston officially became a village on October 1, 1931, after the majority of residents voted in favor of incorporation to preserve home rule. Originally, the incorporation proposal included University Gardens and Russell Gardens. However, University Gardens chose not to be included in the proposal and Russell Gardens decided to incorporate itself separately around that time.

The founders of the Incorporated Village of Thomaston were John W. Weight, Hunter L. DeLatour, Ernest A. Gallagher, and Henry A. Singley.

Thomaston Village Hall was constructed in 1971 in order to provide for more efficient government operations and a permanent home for Thomaston&#x27;s government. It was designed by the Great Neck-based architectural firm of Blum &amp; Nerzig.

Prior to Village Hall&#x27;s construction, meetings were typically held in the nearby firehouse and village records were stored in the homes of the Village Clerks.

=== Thomaston&#x27;s name ===
The name Thomaston has been used to describe the area since the middle part of the 19th Century. William R. Grace, a prominent local who would eventually become the Mayor of New York City, acquired a large area of land around the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Great Neck station; the land he acquired included all of present-day Great Neck Plaza. Grace named the area Thomaston after the ancestral home of his wife, Lillian Gilchrist, located in Maine.

At some point, that area&#x27;s name was changed to Great Neck Plaza, which would ultimately stick and become the name that village incorporated under in 1930.

When the area now known as Thomaston decided to incorporate itself as a village the next year, the residents chose to use this name for their new village since members of the Grace family continued to own land in the area.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<text>Cargolux, legally &quot;Cargolux Airlines International S.A.&quot;, is the flag carrier cargo airline of Luxembourg with its headquarters and hub at Luxembourg Airport. With a global network, it is among the largest scheduled all-cargo airlines in the world. Charter flights and third party maintenance are also operated. It has 85 offices in over 50 countries as of 2018, and operates a global trucking network to more than 250 destinations.

==History==
The airline was established in March 1970 by Luxair, the Salen Shipping Group, Loftleiðir, and various private interests in Luxembourg. Einar Olafsson was the airline&#x27;s first employee and CEO. It started operations in May 1970 with one Canadair CL-44 freighter with services from Luxembourg to Hong Kong. Over the next two years, the airline grew, as did its public visibility.

By 1973, Cargolux had five CL-44s and made the leap into the jet age by acquiring a Douglas DC-8. This enabled the company to speed up its cargo deliveries. In 1974, Loftleiðir and Cargolux amalgamated their maintenance and engineering departments, and by 1975, Cargolux enjoyed new facilities consisting of central offices and two hangars.

In 1978, the airline began to take shape into the company it is today. The CL-44s began to be retired and the airline ordered its first Boeing 747s. In that same year it also began flying to other places in Asia, as well as to the United States. In 1979, as the company concluded its first decade, its first Boeing 747s were delivered.

In 1982, China Airlines became the first airline company to sign a strategic alliance with Cargolux.

1983 saw the introduction of the CHAMP (Cargo Handling and Management Planning) computer system and the start of some charter passenger flights for the Hajj pilgrimage.

1984 saw the departure of the last Douglas DC-8 in the fleet and the addition of a third Boeing 747. Lufthansa bought a 24.5% share of the airline in 1987 and Luxair increased its share to 24.53%.

1988 saw the birth of Lion Air, a passenger charter airline established by both Cargolux and Luxair. The airline had two Boeing 747s but Cargolux&#x27;s venture into the passenger charter airline world proved to be an issue with the Luxembourg government and soon Lion Air folded.

Despite that setback, Cargolux made it into the 1990s in proper financial shape. It added two more Boeing 747s in 1990, as a way of celebrating its 20th anniversary, and in 1993, three Boeing 747-400Fs arrived at Luxembourg. In 1995 Cargolux had a year-long celebration of its 25th anniversary and Heiner Wilkens was named CEO and President.

In 1997, Luxair was able to increase its share to 34%, while in September that year Lufthansa sold its 24.5% stake to SAir Logistics; and Swissair Cargo made a cooperation agreement with the Luxembourg company. The following year SAir Logistics increased its share to 33%.

By 1999, Cargolux&#x27;s fleet had reached double figures, with 10 Boeing 747s. In 2000 a route was opened to Seoul, South Korea, and in 2001 Wilkens decided to step down as president and CEO of the air company.

In 2006, Cargolux built a new hangar which can hold two Boeing 747s simultaneously. It houses the maintenance and engineering department, which at the time had over 490 maintenance employees.

In October 2010, Ulrich Ogiermann, the chief executive officer of Cargolux was indicted on suspicion of price-fixing; After pleading guilty, he was sentenced to 13 months in federal prison. In November 2010, Cargolux was fined for price-fixing by the European Commission.

On 8 September 2011, Qatar Airways purchased a 35% share in the company making it the second largest shareholder after Luxair (43.4%). The other shareholders were the Banque et Caisse d&#x27;Epargne de l&#x27;Etat (10.9%) and the Société Nationale de Crédit et d&#x27;Investissement (10.7%). In November 2012 Qatar Airways announced plans to sell its stake after strategic differences with other major shareholders such as whether the interim CEO and CFO, Richard Forson, should become the permanent CEO. Unions had claimed Forson was effectively a Qatar Airways representative after comments he made about relocating maintenance to the Middle East and rumours of plans for aircraft to be re-registered in Qatar. Qatar Airways sold its share to the Government of Luxembourg, which then sold that share to Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment, a Chinese company, for $120 million in 2014. As part of that agreement, Cargolux launched a 
service from Luxembourg to Zhengzhou in Henan. According to the Dutch OSINT platform Datenna, Henan Civil Aviation&#x27;s stake in Cargolux leads to a high risk of state influence on Cargolux by the Chinese government. In 2017, Cargolux entered into a joint venture with Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment to create Henan Cargo Airlines, and holds a 25% stake in the operation.

On 17 September 2011 Cargolux announced that it would not accept the first two Boeing 747-8F aircraft it had ordered, scheduled for delivery within a few days, due to &quot;unresolved contractual issues between Boeing and [the airline]&quot; concerning the aircraft.
After resolving their contractual issues, Boeing handed over the first 747-8F to Cargolux in Everett, Washington on 12 October 2011. The freighter then flew to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and picked up cargo before flying to Luxembourg.

In 2019, Cargolux sponsored a flight for two Beluga whales from China to a marine wildlife sanctuary in Iceland, in partnership with the Sea Life Trust and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation.

Cargo 2000 — an industry group within the International Air Transport Association (IATA) consisting of some 80 major airlines, freight forwarders, ground handling agents, trucking companies and IT providers — announced on 15 March 2012 at its annual general meeting, that Cargolux Airlines International S.A. had gained Cargo 2000 platinum membership status.

In June, 2020, Cargolux and Unilode extended their partnership with a new agreement.

In 2022, Cargolux sold its remaining shares in CHAMP Cargosystems to SITA.

Cargolux inaugurated a new aerial firefighting business unit in 2024, which will operate a fleet of 12 aircraft, three of which have already been delivered. Also in 2024, Cargolux and Norwegian Air Shuttle signed a contract for more than 140,000 tonnes of e-SAF (e-Sustainable Aviation Fuel) to be supplied by Norsk e-Fuel from 2026.

==Accidents and incidents==

*2 December 1970: Canadair CL-44J, aircraft registration &quot;TF-LLG&quot;, crashed on approach to Tejgaon Airport. All four crew members and three people on the ground were killed. Investigators concluded that the gust lock system engaged and locked the controls in flight due to a hydraulic fault.
*1 November 1992: Boeing 747-228F &quot;LX-DCV&quot; was substantially damaged when the outermost right-hand engine was torn away and the engine pylon was pushed through the wing on touchdown at Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX).
*21 January 2010: Boeing 747-4R7F &quot;LX-OCV&quot;, operating as Flight 7933, touched down on the roof of a maintenance van on the active runway at LUX, badly damaging the van and causing minor damage to an aircraft tire. The 747 taxied to the parking area without incident. The accident was attributed to the failure of air traffic control (ATC) to ensure that the maintenance crew had cleared the runway, inadequate coordination between ATC and the airport maintenance department, and the inappropriate decision to perform maintenance on an active runway in low visibility.
