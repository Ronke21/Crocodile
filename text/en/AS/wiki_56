<text>Butler is a city in and the county seat of Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is north of Pittsburgh and part of the Greater Pittsburgh region. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,502.

Butler is named after Major General Richard Butler, who died in the 1791 Battle of the Wabash. Settled in 1803 by John and Samuel Cunningham, it became a borough in 1817 and a city in 1918. Initially populated by Irish and Scottish immigrants, Butler saw a large influx of German settlers in the early 19th century. It contributed to the Steel Belt manufacturing region as home to the Standard Steel Car Company, which produced early all-steel railcars, and the American Bantam Car Company, known for developing the original Willys Jeep.

The Butler Area Public Library, built in 1921, was Pennsylvania&#x27;s last Carnegie library. The city also hosts the Butler Little Theatre, active since 1941, and notable sites such as the Butler County Courthouse and Butler Armory. Annual events include the Bantam Jeep Heritage Festival and the Butler Italian Festival. Though manufacturing jobs declined by the late 1970s, Butler has sought economic revitalization, with key employers including Cleveland-Cliffs, Butler Area School District, and VA Butler Healthcare.

Butler gained international attention in July 2024 after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at the Butler Farm Show Grounds in nearby Connoquenessing Township.

== History ==

Butler was named for Maj. Gen. Richard Butler, who fell at the Battle of the Wabash, also known as St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat, in western Ohio in 1791.

In 1803, John and Samuel Cunningham became the first settlers in the village of Butler. After settling in Butler, the two brothers laid out the community by drawing up plots of land for more incoming settlers. By 1817, the community was incorporated into a borough. The first settlers were of Irish or Scottish descent and were driving westward from Connecticut. In 1802, the German immigrants began arriving, with Detmar Basse settling in Jackson Township in 1802 and founding Zelienople the following year. After George Rapp arrived in 1805 and founded Harmony, larger numbers of settlers followed. John A. Roebling settled Saxonburg in 1832, by which time most of the county was filled with German settlers.

Butler was incorporated into a city in 1918.

The first Butler library originated in 1894 with the Literary Society of Butler in what is now known as the Little Red Schoolhouse. The Butler Area Public Library, built in 1921, was the last Carnegie library to be built in Pennsylvania. In the intervening 27, years the library was independently operated. From 1921 to 1941, the library quadrupled the number of patrons served.

===Rail and automobile===
In the early 1900s, Butler was a &quot;Steel Belt&quot; manufacturing and industrial area. It remains home to a Cleveland Cliffs Butler Works, formerly AK Steel Butler Works. In 1902, the Standard Steel Car Company opened one of its largest railcar manufacturing facilities in Butler, where it manufactured some of the first all-steel rail cars. Standard Steel Car Company merged with Pullman Palace Car Company in 1934, creating Pullman-Standard, a monopoly that was eventually broken by the federal government.

About 2,500 workers produced 60 steel-bed railroad cars per day in 1902. Eastern European immigrants were lured to the area in the early 20th century with the promise of reliable jobs, which offered company housing and a company store. The company constructed a baseball park which was the home of a New York Yankees farm team. The steel workers of Butler made artillery and naval shells during World War II.

The Pullman-Standard plant closed in 1982, but was purchased in 1984 by Trinity Industries. Trinity Industries left the factory in 1993, and the factory was completely demolished in 2005. The site is now occupied by a vacant strip mall, as well as the Butler Transit Authority inter-modal facility. In 2011 the BTA moved a covered hopper rail-car, built in 1974, to the bus terminal in recognition of the former Pullman-Standard plant.

The American Austin Car Company (1929–1941) was headquartered in the area. Later the firm changed its name to American Bantam Car Company. Bantam was an early producer of small fuel-efficient vehicles through the 1930s. In 1940, lead engineer Karl Probst led Bantam design team to create what later was termed the iconic WWII Jeep. Sizeable military contracts eventually went to Willys and Ford, as the Bantam factory had floundered. Today, a controversial monument stands near the courthouse commemorating Bantam&#x27;s &quot;creation of the Jeep&quot;.

Butler is home to one of the early Ford dealerships, established in 1918 and still extant.

At one point, the Rainbow Rubber Company, in the late 1930s, made &quot;Rubrtoy&quot; replicas of Oldsmobiles along with many other rubber toys.

In the 1950s, Butler became one of the first cities to install bells at crosswalks, a common practice today. Pedestrians could cross in either direction.

The city was linked to Pittsburgh via Mars, Pennsylvania, in 1907 by the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway, and to Evans City in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, both interurban trolley lines. The Mars route closed in April 1931, followed by the Evans City line on August 15, 1931, with the trolleys replaced by buses.

===1970s to present===

Like most of the region, by the end of the 1970s, the local economy changed dramatically. Manufacturing virtually ended and well-paying jobs became scarce.

On July 13, 2024, during a 2024 presidential campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds near Butler, Donald Trump was wounded in his right ear from an attempted assassination, during which one audience member was killed and two others severely injured in the gunfire. Thomas Matthew Crooks, the perpetrator, was promptly killed by a Secret Service Counter Assault Team sniper. Trump was swiftly transported to Butler Memorial Hospital and treated there, before being flown out of Pittsburgh International Airport. The incident occurred outside of the Butler city jurisdiction. Nonetheless, Mayor of Butler Bob Dandoy stated that a lot of attention was focused on the city.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Connoquenessing Creek is the only waterway to pass through the city. In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. At the time, the Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges. However, by 2010, due to reduced industry and clean up efforts, the creek&#x27;s health has significantly recovered and has become popular for water-sport activities.

<text>Butler Township is a township in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 17,230 at the 2020 census. The township was first settled by Europeans in 1795. It was established as a township in 1804 and as a first class township in 1922.

==History==

On July 13, 2024, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump took place in Butler Township, in the Butler Farm Show Grounds. At the event, Butler Township police primarily did traffic duties. The majority of the venue is in adjacent Connoquenessing Township, and that township uses the Pennsylvania State Police as its local law enforcement. Therefore the state police agency filled several law enforcement duties during the event instead of the Butler Township police.

==Geography==
Butler Township is located near the center of Butler County and surrounds the city of Butler, the county seat. The township contains the unincorporated communities of Homeacre-Lyndora, Meridian, Meadowood, and Oak Hills, all of which are census-designated places.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.58%, is water.

Connoquenessing Creek, a tributary of the Beaver River, flows to the southwest out of Butler city and crosses the southern part of the township. In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. At the time, the Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges. However, by 2010, due to reduced industry and clean up efforts, the creek&#x27;s health has significantly recovered and has become popular for water-sport activities.

== History ==
Callery was established in 1880, with the post office opening in 1884. Most of the community was lost to a fire in 1892; however, with the area being a major rail hub, many of the structures were rebuilt. The community was incorporated into a borough in 1905.

=== Railroad center ===
Located along the P&amp;W Subdivision, the borough was originally a small whistle stop on the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad. However, by the turn of the 20th century, Callery became a prosperous railroad community with the completion of the Northern Subdivision, which connected with the P&amp;W line in Callery. The Northern Subdivision ran from the junction to the village of Ribold outside of Butler. This new connection turned Callery into a major hub for the B&amp;O Railroad, and for the next three decades it would be called Callery Junction. By the 1930s, a new connection was completed at Eidenau which eliminated the sharp curves and grades to Ribold. Soon after, traffic on the old connection ceased, and Callery Junction was no more. Trains from the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad still pass the small borough today, but the junction has been gone for almost eighty years.

==Chicora meteor==
On June 24, 1938, a meteorite fell in the vicinity of Chicora. Named the &quot;Chicora Meteor&quot;, the meteorite exploded approximately above the Earth&#x27;s surface. Only two fragments of the meteorite were found following initial investigations. They had masses of and , and were discovered some miles (some kilometers) short of the calculated point of impact of the main mass – which is yet to be found. Two more small fragments were found nearby in 1940.

Numerous reports of the Chicora meteor mention that a cow was struck and injured by a falling stone; other accounts say that the cow was killed by the stone.

The meteor was an olivine-hypersthene chondrite. Its remains were split between the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution.

The sound and light of the exploding meteor were initially mistaken for an explosion in the powder magazine at West Winfield, and was described by investigators F. W. Preston, E. P. Henderson and James R. Randolph as comparable in destructive power to the Halifax Explosion of 1917. &quot;If it had landed on Pittsburgh there would have been few survivors,&quot; they stated.

<text>Connoquenessing Township is a township in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,265 at the 2020 census.

==History==

=== Attempted assassination of George Washington ===
Connoquenessing is known as the area in which George Washington was nearly shot by his French Indian guide. On December 27, 1753, just past Murthering Town, a Native American allied with the French (French Indian) joined Washington and Christopher Gist as a guide. The guide&#x27;s behavior grew increasingly suspicious, causing Washington and Gist to become uneasy. As the party approached a clearing, the Indian suddenly stopped, turned towards Washington and Gist, and fired his musket. The shot, taken no more than 15 steps away, narrowly missed both men. They subdued the attacker and released him by 9 o&#x27;clock that evening. They then built a fire as if staying for first light, but Washington and Gist continued on throughout the night on the Venango trail (now part of Franklin Road and Route 528). Almost certain the French Indian would follow their tracks at daybreak, they thought it best to get a head start. A monument pillar stands at the Connoquenessing Municipal building dedicated to this incident.

=== Trolley service ===

The township was linked to Butler, Evans City and Pittsburgh in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. The line closed on June 15, 1931, and the trolleys were replaced by buses.

<text>Cranberry Township is a township in southwestern Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 33,087 as of the 2020 census. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

== History ==
In 1753, George Washington, then 21, was working for the Virginia Colony&#x27;s British governor and hiked through what is now Cranberry Township along the Venango Path. His assignment was to deliver a message to the commander of the rival French Fort LeBoeuf that ordered the French to withdraw from northern Pennsylvania. The commander rejected the order, precipitating the French and Indian War, which the British and their colonies ultimately won but at a cost.

The township&#x27;s name derives from the wild cranberries that were abundant along the banks of Brush Creek prior to the 20th century. For centuries, the cranberries had attracted deer, which, in turn, attracted Native American hunters. However, drought and farming combined to eliminate the township&#x27;s namesake fruit by the 1880s. When the township was originally chartered in 1804, it had a substantially larger area than it has now. In 1854, its boundaries were redrawn, reducing Cranberry from 81 to 25 square miles. Although the Iroquois, the Delaware, and Seneca nations had hunted and fished in the Cranberry area for centuries, the first European settlers, Mathew and William Graham, arrived in 1796. There, the brothers both acquired 200 acres of land that Benjamin Franklin had designated as part of the nation&#x27;s Depreciation Land program, used to pay Revolutionary War soldiers with land, which was abundant, rather than in cash, which was scarce.

Over the following decades, the Graham family and Samuel Duncan, another early settler, opened a tavern, a distillery, a sawmill, and a grist mill. In 1806, Graham began the community&#x27;s first church, the Plains Church, now the Plains United Presbyterian Church, which remains an active congregation. Descendants of the Graham family continue to reside in the community, which is sometimes confused with the homonymous Cranberry Township in Venango County (formerly Fairfield Township, founded 1806), a much smaller community away.

Prior to World War II, Cranberry Township was primarily an agricultural community, without a traditional downtown. Although small stores, taverns, mills and implement-making shops had operated in Cranberry for years, its development did not really accelerate until the Pennsylvania Turnpike&#x27;s western section was completed in 1951, with an exit at Route 19, Cranberry&#x27;s main arterial road, followed by the 1966 opening of I -79, which crossed the Turnpike at the township&#x27;s southern end. With support and encouragement from the nonprofit Cranberry Industrial Development Corporation, formed by the township&#x27;s board of supervisors in the mid-1960s, a local industrial park was created and quickly filled. It was soon followed by other business and light industrial park facilities catering to companies seeking inexpensive land with easy highway access. The 1989 opening of I-279 further accelerated the township&#x27;s growth, shortening the drive time to Downtown Pittsburgh to less than half an hour.

Cranberry Township also contains several smaller, unincorporated census-designated places, including Fernway and Fox Run, neighborhoods whose names continue to appear on some online maps. The Cranberry Township Historical Society, formed in 1984, was created to collect and preserve relics of the community&#x27;s early local history; a permanent display of early artifacts is currently under construction in the township&#x27;s Municipal Center.

As of September 2019, Cranberry Township is a sister city to Haiyang, a county-level city in China.

==Geography==

Ordinances affecting its commercial growth have been enacted under guidance from comprehensive plans adopted by the township&#x27;s board of supervisors in 1977, 1995, and 2009.

Beyond its emergence as a major regional retail and hospitality center, the primary engine of Cranberry&#x27;s local economy has been its growing family of corporate, industrial and research organizations. There are currently around 20,500 jobs in Cranberry. Far more people commute into Cranberry for work than commute from the township to work at jobs elsewhere.

Cranberry is home to major operations of McKesson Automation-Aseynt, PPG Architectural Coatings, Alcoa-Kwaneer, MSA Safety, Gatan, Giant Eagle and Westinghouse Electric Company. It is also the base for a growing number of technology startups as well as for professional, manufacturing, finance, retail and hospitality businesses.

Cranberry&#x27;s largest employer is Westinghouse Electric Company, whose headquarters relocated from Monroeville, Pennsylvania, to Cranberry Woods Business Park in 2009. More than 3,000 people work at the campus at Cranberry; its business is focused on the design, construction, maintenance and decommissioning of nuclear power plants worldwide. Westinghouse was a division of the Toshiba Corporation of Japan until 2018 when it was purchased by Brookfield Business Partners.

In August 2015, the Pittsburgh Penguins and UPMC opened a new hockey practice and sports medicine facility in Cranberry near the PA 228/I-79 interchange. The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex is named for former Penguin and current team co-owner Mario Lemieux.

As of December 2018, Cranberry Township continues to expand with the new additions of restaurants and other store fronts to the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex area along with a new hotel. There are plans to further expand the area with new restaurant developments and new retail space. Outside of the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex area, Cranberry Township has added over 20 new businesses, with more currently under construction.

==Government==
The township&#x27;s policy-making body is its five-member, at-large board of supervisors who are each elected to serve six-year terms. , the composition of the board was entirely Republican:
* Mike Manipole, Chairman (R)
* Bruce Hezlep, Vice Chairman (R)
* Bruce Mazzoni, (R)
* John Skorupan (R)
* Karen Newpol (R)

The township has a full-time police force of 30 officers, a volunteer fire company supported by a dedicated property tax, and an independent Emergency Medical Service organization that coordinates with the township&#x27;s other emergency services. Cranberry is also the local supplier of fresh water and wastewater treatment, both of which are funded by ratepayers. Cranberry owns, maintains and offers programs in three major municipal parks (Cranberry Park, North Boundary Park, and Graham Park) as well as an open-air waterpark and an award-winning 18-hole municipal golf course, Cranberry Highlands. Miracle League of Southwestern Pennsylvania has a ballfield in Graham Park with an adjacent fully accessible playground. Cranberry Public Library operates out of the township&#x27;s Municipal Center building, as do its Early Education Preschool Program, its aerobics programs, and its administrative offices.

== Transportation ==
The north–south Interstate 79 and the east–west Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) both run through Cranberry Township. U.S. Route 19 and Pennsylvania Route 228 are also important arterial roads in the municipality. All four roads are connected by an interchange, a $44.3 million PennDOT/Pennsylvania Turnpike venture, which opened in 2004 to provide direct, non-stop connection between those heavily traveled roads. Access to the northern terminus of Interstate 279, an important artery that serves as a direct expressway to Downtown Pittsburgh from the north, is located south of the township.

During the fall of 2021, the MSA Thruway, a tunnel that connects Interstate 79 to the Cranberry Springs development in Cranberry Township, was finalized. Construction of the $12 million project underneath Route 228 began in May 2020. This new route allows motorists to travel under the north side of Route 228 without any stoplights.

Between 1908 and 1931, Cranberry Township was served by an interurban trolley line to Pittsburgh as well as to points north. No other rail service has ever been available in the township, and no regularly-scheduled transit service is offered there. Today, motorized transportation in Cranberry is provided only by private vehicles.

== History ==
The site that is now Evans City was for a long time a favorite camping ground for Native Americans, who named the creek that ran through it Big Beaver Run, while the French knew it as &quot;Casse-cou-anse&quot; or &quot;Breakneck Creek&quot;, a name adopted by travelers between Fort Duquesne and Fort Machault, and by the English-speaking pioneers of the original township of Connoquenessing. From 1804 to 1836, the location was often called &quot;Boggs&#x27; Mill&quot;, and in later years &quot;Evansburg&quot;, after Thomas B. Evans, who purchased and rebuilt the original Boggs&#x27; Mill. In 1880 it was a little hamlet, credited with a population of 68 people. In 1890, there were 637 persons enumerated in the census, and at the beginning of 1894, it was generally credited with a population of approximately 1,000.

In October 1878, the railroad was completed to Evans City; the first freight to be delivered was a new boiler to replace one which had exploded in the Sutton flouring mill. The bank of Jacob Dambach &amp; Son was in existence. The residence for the pastor of the German Lutheran church, the Henry Young store and other houses were completed, and the new railroad town showed increased signs of business activity. A council appears to have had control of the place at that time, as mention is made of street improvements and of the appointment of Z. T. Weise as chief of police.

The burning question at the time was the location of the railroad depot. Once the location for the depot was chosen, it became a rather famous decision, creating the nation&#x27;s only railway depot that was built over water. Spanning the Breakneck Creek on iron beams for support, the picturesque railway station was an iconic landmark of breathtaking architecture. Due to its age and growing structural instability, and against much popular protest, the station was finally demolished in the early 1980s rather than restored.

Later the school question occupied the attention of the people. Ultimately the schools were placed under the control of the Jackson Township board after a resolution by the Evans City school building committee was withdrawn.

In 1882 Evans City was incorporated as a borough. At the charter election held September 22, of that year, Edward Dambach (son of Jacob Dambach) was chosen burgess.

The first churches of record in the area were as follows:

Amana Baptist Church was organized March 22, 1820. Late in 1881 some 33 members withdrew to form an independent Baptist church.

The United Presbyterian Church was founded about 1837. Services were held in the frame school-building in the old United Presbyterian cemetery, until about 1842, when a brick house of worship was erected. Owing to the age of the old building and its unsafe condition, a new house of worship was considered necessary and the present building was erected. This is a frame house , well furnished, with pastor&#x27;s study, standing on the old church lot on Main Street. It was dedicated in April 1888.

St. Peter&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran is a contemporary of the &quot;German Lutheran and Reformed Congregation&quot;. In 1849 it was known as the &quot;Reformed Church&quot;, then united with the German Lutheran, and so continued until August 2, 1853, when fifteen of the thirty families forming the united congregation held distinct Reformed services in the church built in 1849–1850.

The Presbyterian Church was founded in 1882 out of the Old Plains Church congregation.

St. John&#x27;s United Christian Church was organized in August 1888.

The Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated on October 27, 1889. The old class at Caleb Richmond&#x27;s, in Forward Township, later consolidated with the Brownsdale class, claimed some members from the Breakneck region, as well as did the Duthill class in Cranberry township to form the original members.

The Evans City Cemetery and the borough became popularly known as the place where the 1968 horror film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was filmed. The film&#x27;s director, George A. Romero, also shot his 1973 film &quot;The Crazies&quot; in and around Evans City.

== Economy and environment ==

Seneca Landfill, near Evans City, captures methane, which it converts to renewable natural gas at its on-site methane recovery high-BTU plant, LEGO-V. The landfill produces .34MW of electricity, and enough renewable energy to heat over 3,800 homes per year. This reduces the county&#x27;s methane emissions, and provides an alternative to fracking for shale gas.

== Government ==
Evans City Borough is represented by a municipal government of one Mayor and five Council members. Currently Dean Zinkhann serves as the Mayor of Evans City, and the council consists of the following members: President Cheri Deener, Rob Reppert, Brad Rubinosky, Patty Tumminello-Murphy, Mark Widdersheim, and Lori Brooks.

The Connoquenessing Valley Regional Emergency Management Agency (EMA) is the disaster management agency of the borough.

While early settlers were present in the Fairview area in the late eighteenth century, the streets and lots were laid out in 1830 by William McCleary and Wiliam Hawk.

By 1876, the population had grown to over 1,000 due to the oil boom which occurred in western Pennsylvania after oil was discovered on French Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania. In 1874, C.D. Angell laid out additional streets and lots to the east of present-day Fairview. Due to a declining population going into the 1880s, Angell&#x27;s expansion of Fairview was never realized. In 1880, after a series of misfortunes in the oil market, the population dropped to 333. On March 15, 1882, the Ralston and McQuade Bank on Main Street closed its doors with liabilities amounting to around $250,000 (equivalent to 7.5 million dollars today), affecting over 1,000 customers in the general area. A steady population of around 200-300 people have remained in Fairview Borough since the 1880s.

==History==
In December 1753, George Washington and Christopher Gist came through the area. They were shot at somewhere between present-day Evans City and Ellwood City (the exact location is unknown), through a region above the forks of the Ohio known as Mutheringtown or &quot;Murdering Town&quot;. In 2003, the borough commemorated the event as part of the 250th Anniversary Commemoration of the French and Indian War.
Harmony was founded by the pietist Johann Georg Rapp and his Harmony Society in 1804. George Rapp came to America from Württemberg, Germany, in 1803 in search of land for his followers that was free from the religious persecution they faced in Germany. He was searching for a place for his followers to worship, farm and put into effect Rapp&#x27;s communal religious teachings. In 1804, two groups of Harmonites purchased a tract of land in Butler County.

They formally established the Harmony Society in 1805 and lived in Pennsylvania for about 10 years before selling the Harmony property in 1814 to Abraham Ziegler, a Mennonite, and moving west to Indiana Territory, where they built the town of Harmony on the Wabash River (now New Harmony, Indiana). In 1824, they moved back to Pennsylvania, this time to Economy (now Ambridge). The settlements were economically successful, producing many goods in a clothing factory, a sawmill, a tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. A hotel was also run in Harmony. In Economy, the group aided the construction of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. In 1869, Mennonite craftsmen built the stone wall around the Harmonite cemetery in Harmony with a unique revolving stone door. The society exerted a major influence on the economic development of western Pennsylvania. But since the group chose to adopt celibacy, they eventually died out when John S. and his wife Susanna C. Duss, the last surviving leaders of Harmony Society, died in 1951.

The Mennonite community in Harmony lasted until around 1904, by which time the town was selling more and more individual plots. Still extant is an old Mennonite meeting house on a hill near Harmony that was built in 1825.

Harmony&#x27;s history, particularly that of the Harmony Society, is preserved at the Harmony Museum, operated in the town by Historic Harmony, Inc.

On a hill in Harmony, situated above Connoquenessing Creek sits a &quot;seat&quot; of stone (actually a rock formation). This seat was said to be used by Rapp (Rapp&#x27;s Seat) to watch over the commune and its members in their daily lives. Thanks to local Boy Scout Troop 457 of Zelienople, a set of steps were built leading up to the seat as part of an Eagle Scout project for Christopher Van Arsdale of Harmony.

==Popular culture==
Harmony is the setting for the film &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3D&quot;, but the movie was actually filmed farther east in the boroughs of Ford City and Kittanning.

Harmony appears in the &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; episodes &quot;Tolerance is Extinction - Part 1&quot; and &quot;Tolerance is Extinction - Part 2&quot;. In the series, it is Bastion&#x27;s hometown, whose entire population, including his own mother, was converted by him into Prime Sentinels.

<text>Karns City is a borough that is located in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 209 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
In December 1871, Hugh P. McClymonds and Samuel L. Riddle leased fifteen acres of land to two brothers from the Cooper family. Initially slated to be used as farmland, those plans changed when a reserve of oil was discovered on the land. The first oil well, known as &quot;Shasta,&quot; was established shortly thereafter near the western line of McClymonds&#x27; two hundred and fourteen-acre farm.

On May 29, 1872, S. D. Karns obtained a lease for McClymonds&#x27; entire farm with the hope of increasing the well&#x27;s capacity and profitability. Oil, at that time, was priced at four dollars per barrel. By June, Karns&#x27; well was extracting one hundred and twenty barrels of oil from the ground daily. As more speculators became interested in McClymonds&#x27; property, however, discord arose between competitors; in response, McClymonds sold the entire property, with the except of its farm buildings and fourteen acres of surface land, for $60,000 on June 18 of that same year to Karns, O. G. Emery, John H. Haines, William Parker, and William Thompson. Additional derricks and supporting buildings were quickly erected and oil extraction ramped up even further.

In short order, the few buildings grew to several and then many, with entrepreneurs adding hotels, livery stables, machine shops, residences, and restaurants to turn the small, rural village into a booming town that soon became known as Karns City. In 1872, Ralston McQuaide &amp; Co. opened a banking office that operated until 1880.

The borough of Karns City, which included all of McClymonds&#x27; land and roughly ten acres owned by Riddle, was subsequently incorporated on January 4, 1875.

In 1877, the Pittsburgh, New Castle and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through Overbrook, and had a station built there. In 1882, the name of the community was changed to Mars since the railroad already had a stop with the name &quot;Overbrook&quot;. No one is sure how the name &quot;Mars&quot; came into being. Some say it was Parks&#x27;s wife who enjoyed astronomy, while others believe it was shortened after Samuel Marshall&#x27;s name. On March 6, 1895, Mars was incorporated as a borough.

In 1904, the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway gained permission from Mars to construct its right-of-way through the borough. The line become part of the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway in 1917, being renamed Pittsburgh, Mars and Butler Railway. The line closed in 1931.

The Mars United Presbyterian was founded in 1969 with the merging of two older churches, one under the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the other under the Presbyterian Church (USA). There is also a Lutheran and Methodist church located within the borough. The Woodland Valley Church is one of the newer churches in Mars, and is one of several contemporary churches that have recently started in the Mars/Cranberry area.

In 2011, a representative from The Walt Disney Company invited students from Mars Elementary School to attend the Pittsburgh premiere of &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;, after reading a featured article on the town by msnbc.com. Mars was the only school nationwide invited to the film&#x27;s premiere.

The borough has also been a location for films and television commercials. The 1988 comedy drama film &quot;The Prince of Pennsylvania&quot; and the 1996 comedy film &quot;Kingpin&quot; were filmed throughout the borough. In 2000, a Kraft salad dressing commercial was filmed in downtown.

Canadian musician John Southworth named his first album &quot;Mars, Pennsylvania&quot; after the town, which he had passed through many years earlier on a school trip.

Mars was the inspiration for the fictional town of Athena, Pennsylvania, the setting for the 2015 fictional trilogy, &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s Field&quot;, by local author J. J. Knights.

Mars is home to the popular roadside attraction the Mars &quot;Spaceship&quot; or &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;. It is also home to the Mars Station, one of the last railroad depots still standing from the now defunct Pittsburgh and Western Railroad.

<doc id="131629" wikidata="Q1181312" url="?curid=131629" title="Saxonburg, Pennsylvania">
<text>Saxonburg is a borough in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Greater Pittsburgh area in Western Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1832 by F. Carl Roebling and his younger brother John as a German farming colony. The population of Saxonburg was 1,525 as of the 2010 census.

The city was first named &quot;Germania&quot; and &quot;Sachsenburg&quot; before its name was Anglicized to the present one. After Roebling returned to his engineering career, he developed his innovation of wire rope in a workshop here. He became known for his design of suspension bridges, including the most famous one, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

== History ==
Founded in 1832 by Friedrich Carl Roebling and his younger brother John A. Roebling, the frontier farming community was initially called &quot;Germania&quot;. This was changed to &quot;Sachsenburg&quot; and later anglicized to Saxonburg. Roebling had emigrated with his brother Carl and a group of pioneers from Prussia (Germany) in 1831 to flee political unrest and oppression. (Doubtful quite from the Great Bridge by David McCullogh published 1972 &quot;He was seeking neither religious freedom nor release from the bondage of poverty.His quest was for something else&quot;.) The two men, along with a handful of a larger group who accompanied them on the trans-Atlantic journey, bought of land on October 28, 1831, from Mrs. Sarah Collins.

After a few years, Roebling left farming to return to his career as an engineer. He developed a way to produce wire rope or cable, and used it in several of his projects, beginning with an aqueduct. He produced the wire rope at a workshop on his property in Saxonburg. He designed several suspension bridges, including two in Pittsburgh and one in Philadelphia. His most famous is his Brooklyn Bridge in New York. The Roebling Museum in the borough maintains several artifacts of his notable career.

In November 1920, KDKA radio, regarded as the world&#x27;s first commercial radio station, began broadcasting from East Pittsburgh. Later it located its transmitter in neighboring Clinton Township of Butler County. While the transmitter facility is no longer in Butler County, artifacts of it remain on display at the Saxonburg Museum, co-located with Roebling Park.

Saxonburg&#x27;s radio history continues with an internet-based radio station, saxonburgradio.com. The station, which is privately owned, has served the borough and surrounding southern Butler County with music and local news since October 25, 2015. The station also broadcasts over the air on micropower levels throughout Saxonburg on AM 1620 and FM 100.3 under FCC Part 15 rules.

In 1946, Fred Seitz, head of the physics department at Carnegie Tech, recruited Ed Creutz, Jack Fox, Roger Sutton and Bert Corben to the university to develop an important nuclear physics research program. By June 6, 1946, they had built a leading-edge, 450 MeV proton synchrocyclotron at the Nuclear Research Center near Saxonburg, just south of the city limits. The research program flourished up to the mid-1970s. By then the accelerator had become obsolete and was dismantled. The site was converted to industrial purposes, and is now occupied by II-VI Corporation. As of 1997, only one or two of the original Nuclear Research Center buildings remained intact, including the original laboratory building.

===Murder of Police Chief Adams===
On the afternoon of December 4, 1980, career criminal Donald Eugene Webb was the chief suspect in the murder of the borough police chief Gregory Adams at the Agway in Saxonburg. This was the second homicide in the borough&#x27;s nearly 150-year history and received national attention, especially as Webb was never apprehended. Webb was put on the FBI Most Wanted List, but was never captured. After the FBI found new evidence in her house in 2016, in July 2017, his wife Lillian Webb confessed to hiding her husband for 17 years, and led the FBI and police to his remains buried in the yard of her Massachusetts house. He died in 1999 after a series of strokes, at the approximate age of 68.

The first murder occurred in 1849. Christina Foertsch, sister of Albert and Wilbert Foertsch, killed Adele, Wilbert&#x27;s three-year-old daughter, before killing herself.

===First woman mayor===
In November 2009, Jody Pflueger was elected as mayor as a write-in candidate, defeating the 12-year incumbent. She is both the city&#x27;s first Democratic and first female mayor. While in office, Mayor Pflueger had the position of Police Chief reinstated in the small city. Pflueger was succeeded by Pamela Bauman in 2013, who died in office. William Gillespie was elected in a special election to complete the remainder of Bauman&#x27;s term. As of 2023, Gillespie remains in office.

<text>Zelienople () is a borough in western Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States, north of Pittsburgh. The population was 3,812 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==

Zelienople was named for the eldest daughter of Baron Dettmar Basse (1762–1836), whose chosen name was Zelie (her given name was Fredericka) which she named herself after her favorite doll. Baron Basse arrived in 1802 from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and purchased a tract of of land in Butler and Beaver counties.

He proceeded to lay out a village and build his own private residence, a three-story castle, complete with towers, turrets and battlements, named &quot;The Bassenheim&quot;, which was destroyed by fire on July 29, 1841. At the time, Zelie was betrothed to Philip Louis Passavant, and was still in Germany. Extensive preparations were made by Baron Basse to establish the new home and town in America and prepare it for his daughter&#x27;s arrival in September 1807.

Baron Basse sold of his land to George Rapp, a Bavarian pietist religious leader, who founded the village of Harmony. Baron Basse came to be known as &quot;Dr. Muller&quot;. Whether the title of &quot;Doctor&quot; was given to him due to a knowledge of medicine, or conferred upon him as a degree, is unknown. He was regarded as an intelligent man, and during the Napoleonic era represented Frankfurt as an ambassador to Paris. Basse returned to Germany in 1818, leaving his business to his son-in-law, Philipp Passavant.

Philip Passavant opened the first store in 1807, and managed it for 41 years, until he gave it to his son, C. S. Passavant. By 1826, there were fifty houses in Zelienople, and three churches. The population in 1870 was 387, and in 1890, it had grown to 639. In 1879, the first passenger train arrived to the town, substantially increasing the growth and commerce. In 1880, the American Union Telegraph Company established an office in Zelienople. The Federalists appointed Andrew McClure, a local tavern-keeper, as the first postmaster of Zelienople in the first decade of 1800. Christian Buhl was named the first justice of the peace in 1840.

Early Zelienople commerce supported the local agriculture community, as there was no viable means of transportation. In 1840 Zelienople was incorporated as a borough. In 1878 a railroad was built through Zelienople. From this time there has been moderate expansion of industry, residences, and local government. There has been a volunteer fire department since about 1850. A full-time Borough Manager was hired in 1994. The growth of Pittsburgh to the south, along with the building of Interstate 79, provides a challenge to Zelienople in coping with these changes through the 21st century.

Zelienople was linked to Ellwood City, Evans City and Pittsburgh in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. The line closed on June 15, 1931, and the trolleys were replaced by buses. Zelienople is also known for its historical Eichholtz Building. 

The Eichholtz family played a pivotal role in the development of Zelienople. Arriving from Germany in the 19th century, the family quickly became influential figures, establishing businesses that contributed to the town’s economic growth.

Their entrepreneurial spirit not only fostered commerce but also laid the groundwork for community engagement and local governance. Members of the Eichholtz family participated actively in civic initiatives, enhancing the social fabric of Zelienople and promoting a strong sense of identity among its residents.

==Geography==
Zelienople is located in southwestern Butler County, situated on the south bank of Connoquenessing Creek, in an area that is rich with coal and iron ore. The elevation is above sea level. The borough is bordered by Jackson Township on the north, southeast, and south, and by the borough of Harmony on the northeast. The western border of Zelienople is the Beaver County line.

U.S. Route 19 (Perry Highway) is the main north–south road through the center of town. Interstate 79, running generally parallel to US 19, passes just to the east of the borough, with access from Exits 85, 87, and 88. Via I-79 and I-279 it is south to downtown Pittsburgh. To the north I-79 leads to Erie. Pennsylvania Route 68 runs east from US 19 as East Grandview Avenue and southwest as West Beaver Street. Via PA 68 it is east to Butler, the county seat, and southwest to Rochester on the Ohio River. Routes 288 and 588 lead west from town on West New Castle Street, PA 288 turning northwest to lead to Ellwood City, and PA 588 leading west to Beaver Falls.

==2013 Frew Family shooting==
On Friday, September 27, 2013, a shooting took place in Allegheny Township on Bottom Road around 10 PM. Four people were killed in what was initially reported to be a home invasion. Three people died on scene and a fourth person was taken to UPMC Altoona but died from complications at the hospital. The investigation is ongoing and details are still limited and unclear.

Pennsylvania State Police reports confirmed that the incident started as a home invasion that led to a domestic dispute. The home was on the 600 block of Bottom Road. John Frew Sr. was at home with his wife and adult son, just getting back from going out to dinner when there was a knock at the door. John&#x27;s wife, Roberta Frew, answered the door to find her daughter, Josephine Ruckinger, and her son-in-law standing outside the door. She had enough time to yell &quot;Oh my God, they have guns&quot; before Josephine shot her in the chest, killing her instantly. John Frew Jr. attempted to retrieve a gun from a nearby location when he was shot by Josephine&#x27;s husband, Jeff Ruckinger. John Sr. was able to grab a .22 caliber revolver from a rear bedroom. He then was forced to shoot and kill his daughter and son-in-law. Josephine was transported to UPMC Altoona where she was pronounced dead. John Sr. was injured and taken into police custody for questioning.

Josephine had not contacted her family in quite some time, after fleeing with her then boyfriend. John Sr. stated that he didn&#x27;t recognize Josephine until after she was shot. The motive is unknown and autopsies are ongoing to determine if there were drugs involved or not.

Central-Mainline Serves over 2,000 customers and is named after the &quot;Mainline&quot; of the former Pennsylvania Railroad that proceed through the five municipalities. The railway is now part of the Norfolk Southern system.

==Transportation==
Norfolk Southern operates on the former Pennsylvania Railroad mainline between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. There is a bridge called the Cassandra Overlook Bridge where train watchers can watch trains in a convenient location. This bridge is a single-lane old iron pedestrian bridge that once paralleled the bridge that carried State Route 53 traffic across the railroad. The route was bypassed with the current alignment of Route 53 in 1936. Railfans are most welcome at this location. There is a small motel, the Cassandra Railroad Overlook Motel, in town that welcomes visitors and railfans.

There are no traffic lights in the Borough of Cassandra. Only two streets run through the borough—Main Street, which is a dead-end at both ends, and Portage Street, which runs from State Route 53 to Main Street.

<doc id="131660" wikidata="Q1130655" url="?curid=131660" title="Cresson, Pennsylvania">
<text>Cresson is a borough in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. Cresson is east of Pittsburgh. It is above in elevation. Lumber, coal, and coke yards were industries that had supported the population, which numbered 1,470 in 1910. The borough is part of the Johnstown Metropolitan Statistical Area, although state and local sources list it as part of the Altoona area due to being much closer to that city. The population of Cresson at the 2010 census was 1,711.

The location was named in 1854 as a memorial to philanthropist Elliott Cresson. Railroads, beginning with the Allegheny Portage Railroad, fueled the growth of the area. Many famous Pittsburgh businessmen, including Charles M. Schwab, Andrew Carnegie, and Henry Clay Frick, maintained summer residences in the area.

The borough was incorporated in 1906, along with neighboring Sankertown.

==Geography==
Cresson is located in eastern Cambria County at (40.462631, -78.586319), atop the Eastern Continental Divide, the height of land between the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and the Ohio River valley. The Little Conemaugh River rises in Cresson, flowing southwest to form the Conemaugh River, which in turn flows to the Kiskiminetas River, then the Allegheny River, the Ohio River, and finally the Mississippi. The north side of Cresson, meanwhile, drains north to Clearfield Creek, a tributary of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River, leading to Chesapeake Bay. Blair Gap, at the eastern edge of the Allegheny Plateau and east of town, is the location of the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site, where the first railroad (a portage railway) crossed the Allegheny Mountains.

Cresson is bypassed to the south and east by U.S. Route 22, a four-lane expressway, with access from two exits: Pennsylvania Route 53 (Second Street) on the south, and the Admiral Peary Highway (former US 22) on the east. Altoona is to the northeast via US 22 and Interstate 99, while Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, is to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

==History==
=== Mountainhouse era ===

One of the first buildings in the area which would become Cresson was the Mountainhouse Hotel. The Queen Anne style structure was opened by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1881, sold to the Cresson Springs Co., and demolished in 1916. It was hoped to attract visitors from Pittsburgh and Johnstown looking for clean air and &quot;therapeutic&quot; mineral springs. Although itself unsuccessful, it led to the development of several other hotels, companies, and the town itself.

The area is currently known as the &quot;Mountainhouse Grounds&quot; to local residents and is in the midst of development. Several of the original cottages still stand, including those of Andrew Carnegie and Benjamin Jones.

=== Stereographs of R.A. Bonine ===
Photographer R.A. Bonine of Altoona took several stereographs of the Cresson area, including the Mountainhouse during the 1870-1880s. The following were included in his series &quot;Views Among the Alleghenies&quot;.

<text>The Borough of Ebensburg is a borough and the county seat of Cambria County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is located west of Altoona and surrounded by Cambria Township. It is situated in the Allegheny Mountains at about above sea level. Ebensburg is located in a rich bituminous coal region. In the past, sawmills, tanneries, wool mills, and a foundry operated there. The number of residents in 1900 was 1,574, and in 1910, 1,978. The population was 3,351 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Ending in Ebensburg is the Ghost Town Trail, a rail trail established in 1991 on the right-of-way of the former Ebensburg and Black Lick Railroad. Also of note, next to the old Cambria County Jail, is the Veterans Park of Cambria County honoring the men from Cambria County who fought in the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, Civil War, and the Spanish-American War.

== History ==
Ebensburg originated in November 1796, when Congregational minister Rees Lloyd led a small party of 20 Welsh people from Philadelphia to the lands that Morgan John Rhees had chosen for his colony. They selected an attractive spot in the tops of the Allegheny Mountains and settled what would become Ebensburg. They named it for the minister&#x27;s son Eben Lloyd, who had died in childhood.

Lloyd offered land to the government in exchange for Ebensburg becoming the county seat, which the government accepted. A nearby settlement by the name of Beula, Pennsylvania had sprouted just to the West of town with its own intentions of becoming the county seat. With the decision made, Beula faded into obscurity. All that remains is its old cemetery.

Ebensburg was described in the 1940 Pennsylvania guide as being:

According to the book &quot;Cambria County Pioneers&quot; (1910)&quot;,&quot; a General William Rudolph Smith, son of William Rudolph Smith, and referred to as &quot;Captain&quot; by residents, lived in the town of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania in the 1840s. He raised a Company of men known as the Cambria Guards who would serve in the Mexican–American War, but Smith could not go. He was &quot;universally accepted as an authority in literary matters and upon historical subjects particularly he was a veritable encyclopedia. His literary style was forcible, direct, and elegant.&quot;

The Company he raised would embark to the South in January 1847, becoming Company D of the Second Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers, called the Highlanders, and had &quot;a very pleasant trip&quot; on their way to New Orleans. They did not see combat until August that year as smallpox put the company in quarantine. Shortly after their release, they saw heavy combat at Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. Following this they were encamped at a Monastery until 1848 when they returned to Ebensburg.

Because of its location, Ebensburg became the crossroads of roads heading North and South, and East to West. Some of the highest traffic passed through here during the gold rush in the West of the late 1840s, and beyond.

Because of those travelers to the West, an apartment building situated on the corner of Phaney and East High Streets in town was known as &quot;The California House.&quot; It operated for years as an inn and tavern, and housed thousands of travelers heading West to find their fortunes. A young local boy called William J. Wherry joined a caravan West. He wrote detailed accounts of his journey in the form of letters to his sister, and claimed to have crossed 600 miles of plains alone on his way to California.

But as transport evolved, the railroad became a popular and efficient mode of transportation. Railroads were popular in the nearby town of Cresson, but no main line of railroad ran through Ebensburg. But in 1862, a branch called the &quot;Ebensburg Cresson Rail Road&quot; was built into Ebensburg. Observers said that, although Ebensburg was &quot;industrious and sophisticated in character&quot;, it was not going to be an industrial town given its location and geography.

Ebensburg had some connections to the Underground Railroad before the war. Abraham A. Barker was involved in the national abolitionist movement before arriving in Ebensburg. He moved to town in 1856 to try to profit from its lucrative lumber industry.

Barker lived in a log structure on the North West corner of Locust and High streets. Prior to the Civil War, he assisted a slave brought to him from Bedford on his escape to freedom. The fugitive stayed in his house overnight, and was taken a few miles out of Ebensburg the next morning, hidden under a buffalo robe on a sled. According to many townsfolk, Barker was close friends with Abraham Lincoln. He had attended the Chicago Convention of 1860 to nominate Lincoln for the presidency. Barker was later elected to Congress.

==Civil War==
During the Civil War, men from Ebensburg served in the 133rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry (particularly companies A, B and F). They fought in Allabach&#x27;s brigade (Humphreys&#x27; 3rd Division) at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. In the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862, the 133rd participated in the final charge on Marye&#x27;s Heights, suffering heavy losses. As well, Company A – known as the Cambria Guards – of the 11th Pennsylvania Reserves hailed from Ebensburg and surrounding towns in Cambria County. This company was about 80 men strong, and its captain was Robert Litzinger of Ebensburg. The 11th Pennsylvania Reserves saw action at the Battle of South Mountain, The Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Gettysburg. Particularly on the second day&#x27;s fight at Gettysburg, the 11th participated in a counter-assault down the face of Little Round Top into The Wheatfield to drive out Confederates.

Two Ebensburg men received the Medal of Honor in the Civil War: Thomas Evans of Company D, and James Snedden from Company E of the 54th Pennsylvania. Evans &quot;wrested the colors from a color bearer of a Tennessee regiment [sic], sending the color bearer to the rear.&quot; Evans is buried at Bethel Cemetery in Ebensburg.

==Postwar prosperity==
In the years following the Civil War, Ebensburg flourished, and became a prosperous town. The wealthy built grand homes to flank the streets, their lavish carriages rolled down the roads, and local gentleman formed a debate club that met regularly in lounges in the town.

The mountain town, high in the Alleghenies, attracted Pittsburgh socialites who flocked here to escape the dirty, loud and sickly streets of the industrial city. Locals realized the town&#x27;s allure; entrepreneurs wrote promotional pamphlets extolling the town&#x27;s &quot;many days of bright sunshine, its pure artesian well water, its health giving atmosphere, its splendid surroundings - absolutely free from smoke and dust... the town is remarkably free from the ills which plague so many localities.&quot; This promise of healthy life in the peaks of Ebensburg lured many who could afford so-called &quot;summer cottages&quot; -some were built to a scale akin to mansions. The first wave of tourism was housed in newly built, prominent hotels in grandiose Victorian style that had been developed across town.

The Maple Park Springs Hotel sat on a hill in the Northwest corner of town, on a tract of land known as &quot;Lloyds Grove.&quot; Altoona musician J.W. Leman wrote the &quot;Maple Park March Two-Step&quot; for the hotel. Wealthier townspeople started building their own Victorian homes, and the socialites began to arrive with funds to claim their own slivers of mountain paradise.

Among the new buildings was Ormsby Lodge, owned by the Phillips Family. Built in 1889 by Duncan Phillips, a prominent art collector, the lodge was an 18-room Eastlake style, Victorian &quot;cottage&quot; built on the former Belmont Tract of land. Artist Marjorie Acker Phillips, wife of Duncan Phillips, typically summered with her family at the Ormsby estate.

Another summer cottage was the Bissel Home, which was designed by architect Stanford White, who also designed Madison Square Garden.

David Park of Pittsburgh bought the Maple Park Springs Hotel and built his own mansion in town. The &quot;Johnstown Democrat&quot; wrote of the town around this time &quot;that delightful village&quot; of Ebensburg &quot;In many respects is more attractive than Cresson... and it may be truthfully added that its complement of pretty girls is alone enough to give it enviable fame.&quot;

Residents and visitors&#x27; enjoyment was interrupted in 1889 when they heard news that the city of Johnstown to the south was devastated by a deadly flood after an earthen dam had failed.


In February 1915 most of downtown Ebensburg was burned down 
&quot;by fire which broke out in the pool room of the Mountain House. Every building in the block from the Mountain House to the county court house was destroyed. The loss is estimated between $250,000 and $300,000. The court house was not damaged although the buildings adjoining were destroyed. Fire companies from many northern Cambria towns were summoned to assist the Ebensburg company. The Johnstown city fire department also went to the scene. The buildings destroyed include the fine building of the Cambria Savings and company, several hotels, a livery barn, a bank building and a number of small office buildings. The telephone communications were cut off. The buildings destroyed were thirteen in number. A cigarette dropped in the poolroom the night previous is believed to have started the fire.&quot;

According to &quot;The Indiana Progress&quot;, &quot;Several buildings were dynamited to prevent the spread of the flames.&quot; The lowest cost estimate of losses was $250,000; the equivalent in 2020 of $6,402,920.79.

Despite the fire, a number of historic homes and buildings survived. Townspeople recognized the value of these and defined an historic district, identifying which buildings were of quality that contributed to its fabric. In 2019 the significance of The Ebensburg Historic District was recognized when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The District is bounded roughly by Highland Avenue and West, Sugar, and Triumph streets.

==Art==
Impressionist painter Marjorie Acker Phillips, who had a summer home in Ebensburg known as the Ormsby Lodge, is thought to have drawn inspiration from the nearby countryside for many of her paintings.
==Education==
In the borough of Ebensburg, there are three public and two private schools. The two private schools are Bishop Carroll High School and Holy Name Elementary. The public schools are Cambria High School, Central Cambria Middle School, and Cambria Elementary. The fourth school of the Central Cambria School District is located about west of the borough, off Route 22. At the collegiate level, the Pennsylvania Highland Community College has one of their satellite sites about southwest of the center of town, also off Route 22.

==Geography==
Ebensburg is located in the center of Cambria County at (40.486388, -78.725461).

Three U.S. highways pass through and intersect around Ebensburg: U.S. Route 22 runs along the southern border of the borough, leading east to Hollidaysburg, south of Altoona, and west to Pittsburgh. U.S. Route 219 bypasses the borough to the west, with access from two exits (U.S. 22 and U.S. 422). US 219 leads north to DuBois and south to Somerset.

<text>Gallitzin is a borough in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is bordered by Gallitzin Township and Tunnelhill, all of which sit astride the Eastern continental divide. Tunnel Hill and Gallitzin both are pierced by railroad tunnels shortening the necessary ascent for rails crossing the Allegheny Front onto the Allegheny Plateau which encompasses the towns&#x27; terrains. Topping the gaps of the Allegheny, the area is one of only five major breaks in the Appalachians allowing east–west transportation corridors before the advent of 20th century technologies.

==History==
Dutch traders and trappers friendly to the Susquehannock may have visited the region about 1620, as the town sits atop a mountain pass through which the ancient Amerindian trails (later renamed the Kittanning Path) transited. The plateau atop the escarpment was the domain of the Iroquoian confederations of the Erie people and the Susquehannock peoples, both sharing the byways and hunting lands of the Allegheny Mountains until about the mid-1650s. The Susquehannock and Erie people are known to have traded through the area, one of the few avenues the Erie, who dominated the hunting lands west of the Alleghenies, had to obtain by firearms; though, by all accounts, all the tribes in contact with the numerous Erie were reluctant to trade them firearms. Further, Susquehannocks are quoted to have expected 800 Erie warriors in 1662 to join in their war with the Iroquois. By 1675, both the Susquehannocks and Erie tribes would both fall to rampant multiple-years of epidemic diseases, in combination with the vicious multi-decade internecine territorial bloodletting known as the Beaver Wars, which left the Alleghenies a remote hunting ground of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederation.
By the early 1700s, the Delaware people still living along the eastern seaboard were increasingly treated as bad or worse than slaves, and displaced clear across the breadth of Pennsylvania to beyond the Allegheny Front, where they settled along the rivers of Western Pennsylvania. One of their larger settlements, and closest to the gaps of the Allegheny, was the Amerindian town of Kittanning along the middle reaches of the Allegheny River. These towns would generally ally themselves with the French during the French and Indian War, causing settlers in central Pennsylvania to mount a guard and patrol on the gaps. By the late 1700s, the remnant Seneca and Cayuga that became known as the Ohio Iroquois or Mingo would have ranged the area, especially because they were known to make their towns along defensible hill tops and kept to the uplands. With iron and coal discovered west of the gaps, white settlers began traveling west through the area around the time the American Revolution came to a close. By 1824, the visionary Main Line of Public Works legislation had been debated and signed and the construction of the Allegheny Portage Railroad soon began aiming to connect Pittsburgh and the Ohio Country to Philadelphia by canals. In 1838, this plan was altered to incorporate the rapidly-developing and ever more capable railroad technology. In 1845, the Pennsylvania legislature required the new Pennsylvania Railroad to cross the mountains, and the surveyed route would create Gallitzin, which began life as &#x27;Summit Tunnel&#x27;.

A Railroad town standing west of Altoona, it was first incorporated in 1872, and named for Prince Gallitzin, who founded the Catholic town of Loretto in Cambria County. Coal mining, the Pennsylvania Railroad yard in the town center and the production of coke were important industries. The town still sports an important rail yard with a turning wye for helper engine turnaround and holds two rail tunnels leading east and downward from the yard trackage to the famous PRR Horseshoe Curve, whose upper approaches are within the town.

Gallitzin is listed by the US Census Bureau as part of the Johnstown Metropolitan Statistical Area, although local sources consider it part of the Altoona area, due to being located closer to Altoona than to Johnstown. In 1900, 2,759 people lived in Gallitzin, and by 1910, that number had risen to 3,504 people. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough population was 1,668.

Gallitzin is known for its historic railroad tunnels (Gallitzin Tunnels), which are a minor tourist draw. The scenic Horseshoe Curve and the Allegheny Portage Railroad historic site are also nearby situated in different gaps of the Allegheny.

==Geography==
Gallitzin is located in eastern Cambria County at (40.481816, -78.552336), along the eastern edge of the Allegheny Plateau, a highland area of hills and small streams formed differently from the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians to the east and south of the plateau&#x27;s edge, the Allegheny Ridge in Pennsylvania. Sitting astride the eastern Continental divide along the edge of the Allegheny Front escarpment, the immediate area is lower than other portions of the Appalachian Plateau, so contains several small streams and freshets forming the gaps of the Allegheny Escarpment to the east, where the ground falls away rapidly, forming steep terrain landforms. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Gallitzin has the tenth-highest elevation of towns in Pennsylvania, at .

<text>Johnstown is the largest city in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 18,411 as of the 2020 census. Located east of Pittsburgh, it is the principal city of the Johnstown metropolitan area and had 133,472 residents in 2020. It is also part of the Johnstown–Somerset combined statistical area, which includes both Cambria and Somerset Counties.

==History==

Johnstown was settled in 1770. The city has experienced three major floods in its history. The Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889, occurred after the South Fork Dam collapsed upstream from the city during heavy rains. At least 2,209 people died as a result of the flood and subsequent fire that raged through the debris. Another major flood occurred in 1936. Despite a pledge by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to make the city flood free, and despite subsequent work to do so, another major flood occurred in 1977.

Before becoming an independent town, Windber, Pennsylvania was considered a part of the city.

The city is home to five national historic districts: the Downtown Johnstown Historic District, Cambria City Historic District, Minersville Historic District, Moxham Historic District, and Old Conemaugh Borough Historic District. Individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places are the Grand Army of the Republic Hall, Cambria Iron Company, Cambria Public Library Building, Bridge in Johnstown City, Nathan&#x27;s Department Store, and Johnstown Inclined Railway.

===18th century===
A settlement was established here in 1791 by Joseph Johns, in whose honor it was named, and the place was soon laid out as a town.

===19th century===
Johnstown was formally platted as Conemaugh Old Town in 1800 by the Swiss German immigrant Joseph Johns (born Josef Schantz). The settlement was initially known as &quot;Schantzstadt&quot;, but was soon anglicized to Johnstown. The community incorporated as Conemaugh borough January 12, 1831, but renamed Johnstown on April 14, 1834. From 1834 to 1854, the city was a port and key transfer point along the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal. Johnstown was at the head of the canal&#x27;s western branch, with canal boats having been transported over the mountains via the Allegheny Portage Railroad and refloated here, to continue the trip by water to Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley. Perhaps the most famous passenger who traveled via the canal to visit Johnstown briefly was Charles Dickens in 1842. By 1854, canal transport became redundant with the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which now spanned the state. With the coming of the railroads, the city&#x27;s growth improved. Johnstown became a stop on the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad and was connected with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. The railroads provided large-scale development of the region&#x27;s mineral wealth.

Iron, coal, and steel quickly became central to the town of Johnstown. By 1860, the Cambria Iron Company of Johnstown was the leading steel producer in the United States, outproducing steel giants in Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Through the second half of the 19th century, Johnstown made much of the nation&#x27;s barbed wire. Johnstown prospered from skyrocketing demand in the western United States for barbed wire. Twenty years after its founding, the Cambria Works was a huge enterprise sprawling over in Johnstown and employing 7,000. It owned of valuable mineral lands in a region with a ready supply of iron, coal and limestone.

Floods were almost a yearly event in the valley during the 1880s. On the afternoon of May 30, 1889, following a quiet Memorial Day ceremony and a parade, it began raining in the valley. The next day water filled the streets, and rumors began that a dam holding an artificial lake in the mountains to the northeast might give way. It did, and an estimated 20 million tons of water began spilling into the winding gorge that led to Johnstown some away. The destruction in Johnstown occurred in only about 10 minutes. What had been a thriving steel town with homes, churches, saloons, a library, a railroad station, electric street lights, a roller rink, and two opera houses was buried under mud and debris. Out of a population of approximately 30,000 at the time, at least 2,209 people are known to have perished in the disaster. An infamous site of a major fire during the flood was the old stone Pennsylvania Railroad bridge located where the Stonycreek and Little Conemaugh rivers join to form the Conemaugh River. The bridge still stands today.

The Johnstown flood of 1889 established the American Red Cross as the pre-eminent emergency relief organization in the United States. Founder Clara Barton, then 67, came to Johnstown with 50 doctors and nurses and set up tent hospitals as well as temporary &quot;hotels&quot; for the homeless, and stayed on for five months to coordinate relief efforts.

The mills were back in operation within a month. The Cambria Works grew, and Johnstown became more prosperous than ever. The disaster had not destroyed the community but strengthened it. Later generations would draw on lessons learned in 1889. After the successful merger of six surrounding boroughs, Johnstown became a city on April 7, 1890.

===20th century===

In 1923, Johnstown Mayor Joseph Cauffiel ordered the expulsion of all African-Americans and Mexicans in Johnstown who had lived in Johnstown for less than seven years. The edict was in response to a deadly shootout between Robert Young, a black man, and Johnstown police officers. African-Americans had settled in the Rosedale neighborhood during the Great Migration. Although Cauffiel&#x27;s edict of expulsion was without legal force, some 500 African-Americans fled the city. The Ku Klux Klan burned 12 crosses outside Johnstown in an attempt to intimidate Rosedale&#x27;s Black population. Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot intervened to prevent Cauffiel from enforcing the edict.

In the early 20th century, the population reached 67,000 people. The city&#x27;s first commercial radio station, WJAC, began broadcasts in 1925. The downtown boasted at least five major department stores, including Glosser Brothers, which in the 1950s gave birth to the Gee Bee chain of department stores. However, the St Patrick&#x27;s Day flood of 1936 combined with the gnawing effects of the Great Depression left Johnstown struggling again. Seeking a permanent solution to the flooding problem, Johnstown&#x27;s citizens wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt pleading for federal aid. In August 1938, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers launched a five-year project that gouged, widened, deepened, and moved of river channel in the city, and encased the river banks in concrete and reinforced steel. In a campaign organized by the Chamber of Commerce, thousands of Johnstown&#x27;s citizens wrote to friends and relatives across the country hoping to bring new business to the town.

Professional ice hockey found a home in Johnstown, starting in 1941 with the Johnstown Blue Birds for one season and returning in 1950 with the Johnstown Jets. The Jets later hosted an exhibition game against Maurice Richard and the Montreal Canadiens on November 20, 1951. Newcomers to the town heard little about the tragic past. Johnstown proclaimed itself &quot;flood-free&quot;, a feeling reinforced when Johnstown was virtually the only riverside city in Pennsylvania not to flood during Hurricane Agnes in 1972.

The immediate post-World War II years marked Johnstown&#x27;s peak as a steel maker and fabricator. At its peak, steel provided Johnstowners with more than 13,000 full-time, well-paying jobs. However, increased domestic and foreign competition, coupled with Johnstown&#x27;s relative distance from its primary iron ore source in the western Great Lakes, led to a steady decline in profitability. New capital investment waned. Johnstown&#x27;s mountainous terrain, and the resulting poor layout for the mills&#x27; physical plant strung along of river bottom lands, compounded the problem.

New regulations ordered by the EPA in the 1970s also hit Johnstown, with the aging Cambria plant (now Bethlehem Steel) especially hard. However, with encouragement from the steel company, city leaders organized an association called Johnstown Area Regional Industries (JARI) and, within a year, raised $3 million for industrial development in the area. Bethlehem Steel, which was the major contributor to the fund, committed itself to bringing new steelmaking technologies to Johnstown because they were impressed by the city&#x27;s own efforts to diversify.

Extensive damage from the 1977 flood was heavy and there was talk of the company pulling out. Again, the city won a reprieve from the company&#x27;s top management, which had always regarded the Johnstown works with special affection because of its history and reputation. As the increasing amount of federal environmental regulations became more difficult to comply with and the issues with the aging manufacturing facilities grew more significant, and as steel companies began closing down plants all over the country, by 1982 it looked as if Johnstown had exhausted its appeals. By the early 1990s, Johnstown abandoned most of its steel production, although some limited fabrication work continues.

===21st century===

In 2003, U.S. Census data showed that Johnstown was the least likely city in the United States to attract newcomers; however, what were previously relatively weak opportunities provided by the local manufacturing and service economies have more recently begun to burgeon, attracting outsiders. Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, a Spanish wind energy company, opened its first U.S. wind turbine blade manufacturing facility near here in 2006 which subsequently closed in 2014. Several wind turbines are sited on Babcock Ridge, the &quot;Eastern Continental Divide&quot;, along the eastern edge of Cambria and Somerset counties. Lockheed Martin relocated a facility from Greenville, South Carolina, to Johnstown in 2008. Höganäs AB, a Swedish powdered metals manufacturer operates two plants in the region, one in the Moxham section of the city and also in nearby Hollsopple in Somerset County. Companies like Concurrent Technologies Corporation, DRS Laurel Technologies, ITSI Biosciences, Kongsberg Defense and more throughout the region are in business for themselves. Recent construction in the surrounding region, the downtown, and adjacent Kernville neighborhood—including a new Regional Technology Complex that will house a division of Northrop Grumman, among other tenants—signal the increasing dependence of Johnstown&#x27;s economy on the U.S. government&#x27;s defense budget. The high-tech defense industry is now the main non-health-care staple of the Johnstown economy, with the region pulling in well over $100M annually in federal government contracts, punctuated by one of the premier defense trade shows in the U.S., the annual Showcase for Commerce.

Johnstown remains a regional medical, educational, cultural, and communications center. As in many other locales, health care provides a significant percentage of the employment opportunities in the city. The region is located right in the middle of the &quot;Health Belt&quot;, an area stretching from the Midwest to New England and down the East Coast that has had massive growth in the health care industry. Major health care centers include Memorial Medical Center and Windber Medical Center, the Laurel Highlands Neuro-Rehabilitation Center, and the John P. Murtha Neuroscience and Pain Institute, with its advances in treating wounded veterans, and the Joyce Murtha Breast Care Center&#x27;s focus on early diagnosis and advanced treatment.

The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and Pennsylvania Highlands Community College attract thousands of students to their contiguous campuses in Richland, east of Johnstown. Cambria-Rowe Business College, located in the Moxham section of Johnstown, which offered concentrated career training and had continuously served Johnstown since 1891 closed in 2016 after loss of accreditation. The Pasquerilla Performing Arts Center, a concert/theatrical venue at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, attracts high-quality performers. The Johnstown Symphony Orchestra and the recently formed Johnstown Symphony Chamber Players provide classical music. The Johnstown Concert Ballet, centered in the Historic Cambria City District, provides classical ballet performances and training to the area. The Pasquerilla Convention Center was recently constructed downtown, adjacent to the historic Cambria County War Memorial Arena at 326 Napoleon Street. Point Stadium, a baseball park where Babe Ruth once played, was razed and rebuilt. A zoning ordinance created an artist zone and a traditional neighborhood zone to encourage both artistic endeavors and the old-fashioned &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; enterprises that had difficulty thriving under the previous code. The Bottleworks Ethnic Arts Center offers many exhibitions, events, performances, and classes that celebrate the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the area.

The Johnstown Chiefs ice hockey team played for 22 seasons, the longest period a franchise of the league stayed in one city. The Chiefs were a member team of the ECHL, and played their home games in the Cambria County War Memorial Arena. The Chiefs&#x27; decision to relocate caused a flood of public interest in the sport of hockey. As many as four leagues were interested in having a team in the War Memorial. In the end the city landed a deal with another ECHL team, the Wheeling Nailers, who played parts of two seasons at the War Memorial. A full-time tenant arrived in 2012, when the Johnstown Tomahawks of the junior North American Hockey League began play.

The recently established ART WORKS in Johnstown! houses artist studios in some of the area&#x27;s architecturally significant but underused industrial buildings. The ART WORKS in Johnstown project is projected to be a non-profit LEED-certified green building. The Frank &amp; Sylvia Pasquerilla Heritage Discovery Center opened in 2001 with the permanent exhibit &quot;America: Through Immigrant Eyes&quot;, which tells the story of immigration to the area during the Industrial Revolution. In June 2009, the Heritage Discovery Center opened the Johnstown Children&#x27;s Museum and premiered &quot;The Mystery of Steel&quot;, a film detailing the history of steel in Johnstown. The Bottleworks Ethnic Arts Center, ART WORKS, and the Heritage Discovery Center are located in the historic Cambria City section of town, which boasts a variety of eastern European ethnic churches and social halls. This neighborhood hosted the National Folk Festival for three years in the early 1990s, which expanded into the Flood City Music Festival. Johnstown also hosts the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally during the fourth week of June; the event has attracted motorcyclists from across the Northeast to the city of Johnstown since 1998. Well over 200,000 participants enjoyed the 2008 edition of Thunder in the Valley, and the event continues to grow in size.

Significant efforts have been made to deal with deteriorating housing, brownfields, drug problems, and other issues as population leaves the city limits and concentrates in suburban boroughs and townships. The Johnstown Fire Department has become a leader in developing intercommunication systems among first responders, and is now a national model for ways to avoid the communications problems which faced many first responders during the September 11, 2001 attacks.

A reduction in steel production also reduced coal mining in Pennsylvania, which was important to the Johnstown economy. In 1982, Johnstown&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, Herbert Pfuhl Jr., said that, as a result of the decline, city revenues had fallen approximately 35 percent.

The Johnstown economy later recovered somewhat, largely due to industry around health care and high-tech defense, but was reported to be the third-fastest shrinking city in the U.S. in 2017. Nonetheless, in 2018, Johnstown was ranked 169th among &quot;The Best Small Places For Business And Careers&quot; in the U.S., by &quot;Forbes&quot;.

==In popular culture==

The Bruce Springsteen song &quot;The River&quot; mentions the Johnstown Company: &quot;I got a job working construction, for the Johnstown Company, but lately there ain&#x27;t been much work, on account of the economy.&quot; &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;, another Springsteen song, has the lyrics &quot;as the band played &#x27;Night of the Johnstown Flood&#x27;.&quot;

The 1977 film &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, directed by George Roy Hill and starring Paul Newman, was a parody loosely based on the real-life Johnstown Jets ice hockey team and its North American Hockey League championship in 1976. In the movie, Johnstown was rechristened &quot;Charlestown&quot; and the Jets as the Charlestown Chiefs. The film&#x27;s premiere engendered some local controversy, as some thought Johnstown was portrayed in a less than flattering light. &quot;Slap Shot&quot; has since become the iconic movie about hockey and its foibles. Screenwriter Nancy Dowd would revive the fake town of &quot;Charlestown&quot; in her screenplay for the 1981 punk rock satire &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains&quot;, but the film itself was shot in Canada.

&quot;All the Right Moves&quot;, a high school football drama set in the fictional town of Ampipe and featuring Tom Cruise, Lea Thompson, and Craig T. Nelson, was filmed in the area. Locations seen in the movie include the old Johnstown High School in the Kernville neighborhood, the Carpatho-Russian Citizen&#x27;s Club in East Conemaugh, the Franklin works of Bethlehem Steel, Point Stadium, the Johnstown Cochran Junior High football practice field, and the Johnstown Vo-Tech football locker room.

&quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot;, written and directed by Charles Guggenheim, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, Short Subject in 1989. The film was commissioned by the Johnstown Flood Museum Association, which later reorganized as the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and is shown every hour at the Johnstown Flood Museum.

Mystery novel writer K. C. Constantine fictionalized many elements of Johnstown and its culture as &quot;Rocksburg&quot; in his novels, although the nearby city of Greensburg also provides some of the lore for Rocksburg.

In 2000, Kathleen Cambor published &quot;In Sunlight, In A Beautiful Garden&quot;. The novel followed its characters through the events leading up to and including the 1889 flood. Although the protagonists in the novel were fictional, several historical figures, such as Andrew Mellon, Henry Clay Frick and Daniel Morrell were also depicted in the book.

Author David Morrell had his fictional character &quot;Eliot&quot; recruit two brothers from an orphanage in Johnstown to train as assassins in &quot;The Brotherhood of the Rose&quot;.

Johnstown is featured in &quot;Defenders of Freedom&quot; Volume 1 (2010) and &quot;Defenders of Freedom&quot; Volume 2 (2012). Both are hardcover books, published by the &quot;Williamsport Sun-Gazette&quot;, featuring first person stories of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, military veterans who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In the foreword of each volume, Johnstown native and nationally recognized newspaper publisher Bernard A. Oravec shares stories of his father&#x27;s military police service in Germany and growing up in Johnstown&#x27;s west end during the 1970s.

Author and Johnstown native Robert T. Jeschonek wrote a nonfiction history of the local landmark Glosser Bros. Department Store and its multimillion-dollar parent company in his 2014 book &quot;Long Live Glosser&#x27;s&quot;. Jeschonek also depicted a fictional 1975 tour of the Glosser Brothers Department Store in his 2013 novelette &quot;Christmas at Glosser&#x27;s&quot;. Johnstown is the setting of Jeschonek&#x27;s story &quot;Fear of Rain&quot;, which was nominated for a British Fantasy Award. His mystery novels &quot;Death by Polka&quot; and &quot;The Masked Family&quot; are also set in and around Johnstown.

The 2021 book &quot;Smalltime: The Story of My Family and the Mob&quot;, by Russell Shorto, is the story of organized crime in and around Johnstown, and the connections Shorto&#x27;s family had to the American Mafia. Another book that was published in 2021, &quot;Disastrous Floods and the Demise of Steel in Johnstown&quot;, by Pat Farabaugh, explores the three major floods that hit the city in 1889, 1936 and 1977, as well as the history of the steel and coal industry in the region.

==History==

What is now Nanty Glo borough originated in the 1890s and was called &quot;Glenglade.&quot; By 1896, the community was a lumber camp run by Levi Swanson. It contained houses built on both sides of the southern branch of Blacklick Creek, which forms the border of Blacklick Township on the north side and Jackson Township on the south side.

A post office opened for Glenglade on November 21, 1894, with Merton A. Davis as the first postmaster. Three Davis brothers took turns as postmaster: Merton A., from 1894 until 1900; Montell, 1900 until 1911, and Everett C., 1911–1916. According to oral history, the town name was changed to &quot;Nant-y-glo&quot; during the term of Montell Davis, through the intervention of Levi Swanson. Glenglade became Nant-y-glo on February 20, 1901. Whether the Swansons&#x27; had the small town of the same name in Wales in mind or just thought the melodic-sounding Welsh phrase fit the town is not known. The name of &quot;Blacklick&quot; for the creek that bisects the town and the adjacent township probably means much the same as &quot;brook of coal&quot;, a lick being a common synonym for brook and the &quot;black&quot; referring to outcroppings of coal seams on the stream banks and bed.

By 1899 the huge coal deposits in the settlement had attracted additional settlers, and the Pennsylvania Railroad installed a spur line through the community that year. Commercial mining was initiated in 1896 by Dr. James W. Dunwiddie of Pine Flats, Indiana County, who opened up what was then called Nanty Glo No. 1. Nanty Glo was described in the 1940 Pennsylvania guide as being &quot;a valley coal town wrapped in a mist of sulphurous gas. Four large bituminous coal mines support the town, which was founded in 1888 as a lumber camp. Rows of yellow shacks extend back from the central mine. Some, flanked by mine heaps, cling to the mountain sides.&quot;

Heisley Mine (1915) was by far the largest, most profitable, and longest-lived Nanty Glo mine. It was originally owned and operated by Coleman-Weaver Company as Heisley Mine No. 3 until 1922, when Coleman-Weaver dissolved and partner John Heisley Weaver, a Philadelphia industrialist, acquired sole ownership. Colman-Weaver Company also originally owned the mines in Revloc and Colver and launched the Cambria and Indiana Railroad (C&amp;I), which served most Cambria County mines through most of the 20th century. Weaver also owned the mines in Heilwood, Indiana County, which was renamed from Possum Glory to Heilwood after Weaver&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Heil&quot;, from Heisley. Weaver died in 1934, and his company sold Heisley to Bethlehem Mines in 1948. Bethlehem renamed the mine Monroe Mine No. 131 and later renamed it Bethelehem Mine 31 and moved its main entrance from Nanty Glo to Jackson Township (Leidy Portal). The mine closed in the 1980s.

Other mines in what is now Nanty Glo and their starting dates included Lincoln (1900); Springfield, owned by the Peale, Peacock and Kerr Company (1907); Emma Coal Company (1909); and Webster, later owned by the Pennsylvania Coal &amp; Coke Company, Ivory Hill, and the Warren Colliery. &quot;House coal&quot; mines on a much smaller scale (selling coal by the truckload directly to homeowners for house heating) included Lorraine, Bech, Johnson, Cornely, Dorsch, Yobbagy, and Ebandjieff.

===Schools===
Formal education came to Nanty Glo about 1898 with a school opening on what was then the Jackson side of the settlement. Later, a school was opened on the Blacklick or northerly side of the creek. Over the years, there were numerous one-room school houses, and in 1918 a fourth-class school district was established. The first four-year high school class was graduated in 1925. In 1957 the school district merged with that of nearby Vintondale, and in 1967 Blacklick Township became part of a triple jointure to form the present Blacklick Valley School District. The Blacklick Valley Junior-Senior High School (grades seven through 12) is at 555 Birch Street, Nanty Glo. The Blacklick Valley Elementary Center (pre-kindergarten through grade six) is at 1000 W. Railroad, Nanty Glo.

===Nanty Glo&#x27;s churches, hotels, theaters, industries, media, fire company, and public library===
The first house of worship in Nanty Glo was the Methodist Episcopal Church, now United Methodist, established in 1901. Other places of worship in the community, past and present, include St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic (1902), First Baptist (1913), St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic (1919), Church of God (1920), Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance and Holy Ascension Ukrainian Orthodox (1921), Church of the Brethren (1922) and Church of the Nazarene (1935). In the 1920s, a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, a Finnish Lutheran Church, and a Jewish synagogue were started, all three of which no longer exist.

Over the years, Nanty Glo had several hotels, including the Home, St. James, Commercial, and Jackson. At one time Nanty Glo had three movie houses, two of which have been destroyed by fires. The third, the Liberty, is now being remodeled as the Blacklick Valley&#x27;s historical museum.

In addition to coal mining, Nanty Glo had at various times a chemical works, soft drink bottling plant, plastic factory, and a dress manufacturing firm. All of these industries, along with all of the underground mines, have ceased operation.

Nanty Glo was incorporated as a borough in 1918, taking in parts of Blacklick Township and Jackson Township. After the city of Johnstown, Nanty Glo was the largest municipality in Cambria County, with a population of over 5,000, for most of the 20th century.

===Nanty Glo &quot;Journal&quot;===
Two newspapers have served the borough during its history. In late 1920 or early 1921, a small publication called the Nanty Glo &quot;Bulletin&quot; was published. That paper was purchased by Herman Sedloff, a Russian emigre working as a typesetter in New York who moved to Nanty Glo specifically to establish a labor-oriented weekly newspaper. He published the first edition of the Nanty Glo &quot;Journal&quot; on May 5, 1921, and continued as its publisher until his retirement in the 1960s. The &quot;Journal&quot; continues to serve under new ownership.

===Fire department===
In 1913, the Nanty Glo Volunteer Fire Company was chartered. That same year, a hand-drawn hose cart with of hose was purchased by the town&#x27;s governing body, and the fire company remains strong to the present time, having an enrollment now of over 100 members. A ladies&#x27; auxiliary to the fire company was organized in 1927 by 44 women of the community.

===Nanty Glo Public Library===
It was launched in 1980. After outgrowing several earlier locations, it now occupies a spacious former store building at 942 Roberts Street.

===Historical society===
The Nant-Y-Glo Tri-Area Museum and Historical Society was established in May, 2000, to serve Nanty Glo Borough, Blacklick Township, Jackson Township, and Vintondale. The former Liberty Theater building has been acquired and is now being refurbished to display historical artifacts of the Blacklick Valley. In 2012 the Society acquired the former Nanty Glo News (previously, Hawksworth Hardware) Building and refurbished it as the Liberty Cafe, a nonprofit enterprise supporting the Historical Society. Jim Toth is the project manager and treasurer.

==Points of interest==
Just one mile north of U.S. Route 22, Nanty Glo is the major entry point to the Ghost Town Trail, a biking and walking trail that traverses much of Cambria County and adjacent Indiana County along former railroad beds. Free parking is available next to the trail entrances on both sides of the Fire Hall in the town center.

The Liberty Museum is nearing completion at the former Liberty Theater at the intersection of Shoemaker and Roberts streets.

==Cultural references==

Both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines did stories on Nanty Glo as their prime exhibit for their coverage of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s taking control of the nation&#x27;s coal mines after mine workers defied a congressional law by going on strike at the height of World War Two. The May 10, 1943, edition of &quot;Life&quot; features a photo essay by Alfred Eisenstaedt of miners&#x27; everyday lives in Nanty Glo.

The Library of Congress has an extensive collection of photographs taken in a public works program of the mines and miners in Nanty Glo and nearby mining towns, taken during the Great Depression. The figure of Levi Swanson is heavily praised, as he was the original founder.

==History==
The borough of Northern Cambria was incorporated on January 1, 2000. It was formed from the merger of two smaller municipalities, Barnesboro and Spangler. The merger proposal was taken to residents in the 1997 election, passing in Spangler 410-243 and in Barnesboro 466-324. The area was first settled by Europeans in the early-to-middle 19th century. The presence of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River allowed loggers to move their harvest downstream. Small farms developed, but the area changed in the 1890s when mining of the extensive bituminous coal fields in the area became the dominant industry. The mining companies required skilled workers, and many came from Great Britain and Eastern Europe. Railroads were built to transport the coal out, and the town flourished with the influx of money. In the 1980s, the coal industry began a decline, and there has been a subsequent decline in the population of the area. In November 1922, the Reilly Shaft No. 1 mine explosion occurred, killing 78 coal miners.

A pumpkin weighing was grown by resident Larry Checkon in 2005 (a world record at that time).

<text>Portage is a borough with home rule status in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is southeast of Ebensburg and southwest of Altoona. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,388 at the 2023 US census.

==History==

The history of Portage as a community began with the building and opening of the Allegheny-Portage Railroad (APRR) in 1834. Due to its location on the APRR, Portage was originally called “Foot of Two” as it was the located at the bottom of Inclined Plane No. 2. The APRR would build their headquarters a few hundred feet west of the foot (bottom) of Plane No. 2. The headquarters consisted of offices and a shop complex. Also near the foot of the incline was the Washington House Hotel that served as a place to stay for travelers.

“Foot of Two” was eventually renamed “Portage.” The definition of portage is: &quot;carrying boats, goods, etc., overland from one body of water to another&quot;

Today, Pennsylvania Route 53 follows the route of the APRR through Portage. With advancements in locomotive technology, Inclined Plane No. 2 was bypassed in 1852.

By 1854, the Allegheny Portage Railroad was considered obsolete due to the Pennsylvania Railroad which traveled over the Alleghenys considerably faster and safer. At the same time, another company, the New Portage Railroad, was attempting to do the same, but in 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad bought the New Portage railroad and abandoned it.

Within a few years after the opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad, a facility was constructed for locomotives to stop to take on water and pick up wood to fire the boiler. With the abundance of lumber and coal in Portage, many companies were formed to deforest and mine in the area. As a result of the new industries, a population boom occurred, and by the 1860s, a passenger station was built by the railroad along the mainline, which at the time traveled through the center of town on what is now the Sonman Branch Line.

Portage Township was cut from Washington and Summerhill Townships on March 4, 1878. On October 7, 1890, the borough of Portage was incorporated and cut from Portage Township.

In the 1890s, the Pennsylvania Railroad was re-aligned from Lilly to Summerhill, changing the landscape of Portage and a new railroad station was built on Washington Avenue. The town continued to grow in size into the 1920s when it reached its peak population of 4,804 at the time of the 1920 United States Census. The Washington Avenue PRR station remained open until 1926 when a new station was built on Lee Street.

On July 15, 1940, what is known today as the Sonman Mine Explosion occurred at the Sonman Shaft Coal Co. near Portage. A total of 63 miners would perish when a methane gas explosion occurred. In 1960, a memorial to the miners who died in the explosion was dedicated in the Jamestown section of Portage. It was later relocated to Crichton-McCormick Park in Portage. The Portage Station Museum offers a documentary about the disaster titled &quot;63 Men Down: The Story of the Sonman Mine Explosion.&quot; The museum also offers exhibits on coal mining and railroading in the area.

On November 17, 1953, the Pennsylvania Railroad ended passenger service to Portage. The station would remain open into 1954 as a stop for the Railway Express Agency, but would close that year. The population in Portage Borough would stay steady, around 4,000, until the late 1970s. Since then, a steep drop in population would occur due to the closure of many of the coal mines in the region and much of the steel industry slowing in nearby Johnstown, as a result of the 1977 Johnstown Flood and imports of steel from foreign countries.

To celebrate the town&#x27;s centennial, a town festival, known as &quot;Summerfest&quot;, was organized. It has since been celebrated every year on the second weekend of August. The festival has many traditions including ethnic foods and a mass service on Sunday morning of that weekend. Another annual event held every year is the annual community yard sale, organized by the Portage Area Historical Society. It is held on the second Saturday in June.

The Portage Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Portage adopted a home rule charter on May 10, 1994, that took effect on January 1, 1996. Although the community kept &quot;Borough of Portage&quot; as its official name, it is no longer governed under the state&#x27;s Borough Code.

==Fire company==

The Portage Volunteer Fire Company was chartered in 1906. At this time, it was a one-bay-door barn with a horse-drawn engine. In 1936, the company updated their fleet with a new American LaFrance engine. They were one of the first companies to have purchased a fire engine, and they began to run mutual aid to other departments. Many years later, they got more apparatus, and realized the single garage building was too small, so in 1977, they constructed the municipal building/fire station that also houses the Portage Boro Police Department. In 2009, the Cassandra Volunteer Fire Company and Portage Volunteer Fire Company merged to better serve the community and eliminate duplication of services in the area. In 2015, members from the Wilmore Volunteer Fire Company and Portage Volunteer Fire Company accepted a merger to better serve their communities. Today, the Portage Volunteer Fire Company operates out of two stations and has a fleet of one Quint, one rescue engine, one engine, one tanker, one ATV/brush unit, and two support vehicles. In late 2015, PVFC will be receiving a new 3,000-gallon 4 Guys Tanker and in 2016 a new Sutphen Rescue-Engine to replace retired Rescue 83. As of 2023 their old Sutphen ladder truck was sold and got a 1995 red Sutphen tower and then they got a 2024 Sutphen ladder truck with a new feature that was new for Sutphen and as of 2024 they plan on selling their special services truck.

<text>Summerhill is a borough in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 490 at the 2010 census.

==History==
A small borough in the Allegheny Mountains in southwestern Pennsylvania, Summerhill was settled in the early 19th century and grew in large part from the regional presence of Allegheny Portage Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

In 1794, Thomas and Barbara Croyle and their family were among the first to settle in the town. Their family homestead, a two-story stone structure that still stands, served the family as a fortress against Indian attacks. According to some sources, Indians burned the Croyles&#x27; cabin and property, causing the family to seek refuge at Fort Bedford. By 1800, Barbara Croyle chose to rebuild their homestead with stone; she limited windows to two sides of the house to keep it stronger if attacked.

The Croyle family built a grist mill, known locally as Croyle&#x27;s Mill, and a dam on the Little Conemaugh River to operate it. The establishment of the mill was significant enough for the county to notice and fund its first public works project, a dirt road from Ebensburg to Croyle&#x27;s Mill. The mill operated into the 1900s.

In February 1810, Summerhill Township was devolved from larger Conemaugh Township, one of three original townships established in Cambria County. Originally spelled &quot;Somerhill&quot;, the township was likely named for Joseph and David Somers, some of its early, chief landowners.

In the 1820s, Summerhill Township covered a large swath of land in the north-central part of the current county, including present-day Jackson, Munster, Washington, Portage and Blacklick townships. The existing borough took its name from Summerhill Township and was then known as Summer Hill. Records from 1926 indicate the borough&#x27;s current spelling, Summerhill.

==Geography==

Summerhill is located in south-central Cambria County at (40.375424, -78.760623) in the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains.

U.S. Route 219, a four-lane expressway, runs through the northwestern part of the borough, with access from an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 53 southwest of the borough limits. US 219 leads north to Ebensburg, the county seat. Johnstown is to the southwest via US 219 and Pennsylvania Route 56.

<text>Susquehanna Township is a township in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,007 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Susquehanna Township was incorporated on January 6, 1825, being formed from Allegheny and Cambria Townships. In addition to agriculture, the ready local supply of lumber attracted people to the area in the early 19th century. Much of this was transported down the West Branch Susquehanna River to lumber towns such as Williamsport. In the late 19th century, the arrival of the railroad opened up the area to coal mining. The subsequent mining boom created many jobs, attracting a large number of people to settle in the area of Susquehanna Township, many of whom remained with their families after the boom had ended.

==Geography==
The township is located in the northwestern corner of Cambria County, bordered by Clearfield County to the north and Indiana County to the west. The West Branch Susquehanna River flows northward through the western part of the township, having risen less than to the south near Carrolltown. The township is bordered by three boroughs: Northern Cambria is in the south, Hastings is on the eastern border, and Cherry Tree is at the township&#x27;s northwest corner. U.S. Route 219 passes through the township, leading south to Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and north to DuBois.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Westmont is a borough in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,181 at the 2010 census, down from 5,523 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Westmont is located in southwestern Cambria County and is bordered to the east by the city of Johnstown, to the north by the borough of Brownstown, and to the south by the borough of Southmont and the unincorporated community of Elim. Westmont sits on heights rising up to above the Stonycreek and Conemaugh River valleys in the center of Johnstown.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Westmont has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Before the Johnstown Flood of 1889, the Yoder Hill area consisted of nothing more than a few farms, accessible by only a few steep, muddy roads. However, since the flood was so devastating to the city and to its major employer, the Cambria Iron Company, the iron company decided to develop the top of the hill as a suburb for its top personnel to live in. The company commissioned the famous landscape architect, Charles Miller, to lay out the grid for the settlement of &quot;Tiptop&quot;, later renamed Westmont. Westmont was located on a ridge high above the valley in which Johnstown is located, and thus in a place of safety. As such, it was also above the smoke, noise, and stench of the city, and attracted the well-to-do of the town, eager to escape what (in many cases) their own factories had wrought. An inclined railway, the Johnstown Inclined Plane, was built for easy travel to the city. With the problem of transportation solved, the new settlement began to grow, and it was incorporated as the Borough of Westmont on June 13, 1892. In 1935, the borough bought the inclined railway from Bethlehem Steel.

In 1938 the Johnstown Traction Company began to operate bus service to Westmont via buses that rode up and down the Inclined Plane. At one time there were plans to extend the Southmont streetcar line from its terminus at Diamond Boulevard and Menoher Boulevard along Diamond Boulevard to Luzerne Street, and then along Luzerne Street in the center median to Colgate Avenue. This rail service extension was never constructed, and streetcar service on the Southmont line was discontinued in 1954 when a rock slide along Southmont Boulevard damaged the track and overhead. Following completion of the &quot;Easy Grade&quot; highway of Menoher Boulevard (PA Route 271) from downtown Johnstown through to Westmont, bus service was transferred to this route and service via the Inclined Plane was discontinued.

Because of its upland location, Westmont escaped destruction in the subsequent floods that damaged flood-prone Johnstown.

A Westmont native was the first American soldier to die in the Vietnam War. Captain Harry Griffith Cramer Jr. grew up at 321 Luzerne Street, a house which still stands today. He graduated from West Point in 1946, earned a Silver Star for valor in Korea, and commanded the first team of US Special Forces advisers to deploy to Vietnam. He was killed near Nha Trang on October 21, 1957.

The Westmont Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

==Westmont today==

Westmont continues to be a town of significant attractive, large, old houses. The present population of Westmont is approximately 5,000 residents.

Westmont is currently governed by the &quot;Weak Mayor-Council&quot; form of government. There are seven council members and a mayor who are elected by the voters for four-year staggered terms. The mayor votes only in case of a tie. The borough council determines municipal policy, enacts laws, approves borough officials, etc. Daily operations are supervised by the borough secretary and the public works director.

Westmont has a volunteer fire company and an ambulance service. Police protection is provided by the West Hills Regional Police Department.

Today Westmont, even though considerably larger than that envisioned by the Cambria Iron Company officials, still retains many of the characteristics that attracted residents here in the first place. It is, for the most part, still a quiet, tree-lined community. One can see joggers, walkers and children throughout the community at all times of the day. Borough restrictions against commercial enterprise are still enforced.

Perhaps the town&#x27;s standout feature is the allée of American elm trees along Luzerne Street, the last cathedral-arched boulevard left in the United States. Today there are 195 elms, the longest continuous stand of American elms in the country, planted along Luzerne Street. Westmont&#x27;s elm trees are intensively maintained to protect them from Dutch elm disease.

Switala makes reference to Wilmore being a part of the Johnstown-Wilmore-Ebensburg-Burnside route. &quot;From Johnstown, the fugitive slaves moved northeasterly through the heavily wooded valleys and gullies of the Appalachian Mountains. The more well known of the two routes … proceeds from Johnstown all the way to Ebensburg, following the trace that eventually became US-219. Blockson mentions a stop along the route at the hamlet of Wilmore, a small black community located about eight miles south of Ebensburg and near Portage. Godfrey Wilmore, a former slave from Maryland, is reported to have founded the community.&quot;

Godfrey Wilmore was born 1751 in or near Cumberland, Allegheny County, Maryland [8] and died April 2, 1815, in Wilmore; he was buried at St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Loretto, Pennsylvania. Godfrey married Mary Higgins, who was born 1747 in Ireland and died August 28, 1822, in Wilmore; buried St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Loretto.

Godfrey was a freed slave of African descent. Mary was either an indentured servant or a redemptioner and was of Irish descent. Both his and Mary Higgins&#x27; servitude were documented within Harford County, Maryland. Godfrey is said to have been a man of above average intellect, who could read and write. This is referenced numerous times within Cambria County documents by the notation that Godfrey Wilmore wrote the document and witnessed it by his signature, whereas the other parties sign by their mark &quot;X&quot;. In that he was a slave, the fact that he could read and write is remarkable and suggests that he may have been a &quot;house slave&quot; or a supervisory slave laborer. Even more remarkable is that it is further said that he was an energetic man who worked enough extra, outside of his servitude, that he was able to buy his freedom. Documents go on to say that he then bought the remaining time of indentured servitude of his white wife Mary Higgins. It is also noted that due to his education, Godfrey becomes the first teacher in the area that surrounds Wilmore.

According to the &quot;Souvenir of St. Michael&#x27;s Parish, Loretto, Pa.&quot; - On or about 1800 (?), this family traveled from Harford Co., Maryland, along the Conococheague Valley (pronounced by the early settlers &quot;Con-eck e-jig&quot;), westward through Cumberland, Maryland, and eventually coming to settle in a place then known as &quot;Jimmy Rhey Place&quot; (1909- John Mangus resides). This family was a charter pioneer in the formation of Summerhill Township (1810) and very likely a charter pioneer in the formation of Cambria County (1804). The family moved but once more, to a farm approx. 1 mile south of the town of Wilmore (1909- James H. White Farm). Godfrey built the first sawmill in this section of the county on the Little Conemaugh River, below the town of Wilmore, Pennsylvania. This water-driven sawmill was subsequently washed away and rebuilt about 800 yards east of the present (1910) Pennsylvania Railroad depot.

Mary (Higgins) Wilmore was a Catholic. Godfrey Wilmore, on the other hand, was a Baptist and well acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures. Father Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, a Catholic priest, who was a former Russian prince, visited the Wilmore household with a view to reconciling the differences of religion within the family, and it was said that they had many earnest, controversial conversations, which eventually resulted in Godfrey&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism.

In 1829, Sylvester Welch&#x27;s Corps of Engineers was running the lines of the Allegheny Portage Railroad through Summerhill Township, and they came across &quot;… a little village which they marked on their map &#x27;Guinea&#x27;, an appellation which the Irish laborers who built the road adopted until the matter was made a subject of complaint to Fr. Gallitzin, who from the altar denounced this insult to a family for whom he had the greatest respect. It was said that Father Gallitzin would chastise any person who would call the town by that opprobrious name and he declared that it should be known as Jefferson...&quot; in honor of our third President. This is further referenced within the will of Bernard Wilmore, the oldest son of Godfrey and Mary Wilmore, that he lists the town of Jefferson as his home.

It was Bernard, with the help of his nephew Martin Wilmore (son of James and Catharine Wilmore) who laid out the town-site of then Guinea, changing the name, because of the promptings of Father Gallitzin, to Jefferson (June 4, 1831). On June 10, 1831, the contract was let for Section 15 of the Old Portage Railroad, which ran through Jefferson by the time of its completion in 1834.

Jefferson, as the name of the town, never caught on. The 6th post office in the county, established in Aug. 1832 along with the train depot, were forever referred to by the residents as &quot;Wilmore&#x27;s Post Office&quot; and &quot;Wilmore&#x27;s Station&quot; respectively. In 1859 the town was formally incorporated into a borough under the name of Wilmore and there were 20 homes.

Mary Wilmore, who was a daughter of Godfrey and Mary Wilmore, married James Young. He was educated, could read and write and was a contractor and the person who built St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church- the present-day Gothic structure in Wilmore which replaced the small stone church. St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church was built in 1854. Even though Bernard Wilmore at the time of his death (1844) had left a small parcel of land in the center of town to Father Gallitzin to be used as a church, Father Gallitzin&#x27;s executors sold the property and it is currently where the Evangelical Lutheran Church now stands.

<text>Beaver Meadows is a borough in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 897 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==Geography==
Beaver Meadows is located in northwestern Carbon County at (40.928438, -75.912787) along Beaver Creek, amidst a historic transportation corridor dating back to Amerindian Trails through the wilderness area known to the Amerindians as &quot;The Great Swamp&quot;. The Great Swamp was part of a vastly greater wilderness once known as &quot;“St. Anthony’s Wilderness”&quot; and by the Amerindians, the &quot;“Towamensing”&quot; being an Indian word for &quot;“wilderness”&quot;— a vast pinewood forest and boggy swamp-plagued valleys watered by springs and mountain creeks such as Quakake Creek, Beaver Creek, Hazel Creek and others from the surrounding mountains. The Amerindians applied the term, &quot;“Towamensing”&quot; to the entire frontier area above Blue Mountain, which while a valued hunting territory was considered less favorable to Indian settlements.
Beaver Meadow is at an elevation of above sea level in the valley of Beaver Creek, north of Spring Mountain, part of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
===18th century===
Beaver Meadows began as a recognizable and describable landmar, a meadow where beaver dams dotted the landscape, along a well-known Amerindian Trail, known as the &quot;Warriors&#x27; Path&quot;, and later as well-known as the trail used by Moravian Missionaries traveling between Berwick and Bethlehem, then became known as a toll gate/rest stop along the Lehigh and Susquehanna Turnpike, a bridle trail and wagon road chartered in 1804 from Jean&#x27;s Run near the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in the hamlet and township of Lausanne about nine miles south on the other side of Broad Mountain.

In the 1790s, a large tract of land was registered in the name of tbdl and a few farm houses dotted the valley until in 1812, anthracite coal was discovered in the vicinity of Junedale, a bedroom suburb neighborhood a west of Beaver Meadows proper.

In 1752, the lands of Carbon County and Beaver Meadows area were part of Northampton County, one of the three original counties of Pennsylvania, a county as big as New Jersey. the 1790s Warrior&#x27;s Path was widened into a cart road some called the Lausanne-Nescopeck Road as Moravians increased their connections with the St. John&#x27;s settlement in the Nescopeck Creek valley.

In 1804, business interests desiring to ship timber to energy-hungry settlements raised money for a wagon road that could support timber sledges in winter snows, and the Lehigh and Susquehanna Turnpike was chartered, which is now closely followed by Pennsylvania Route 93 through the borough from over Broad Mountain at Nesquehoning, leading northwest to Hazleton and southeast to U.S. Route 209 in Nesquehoning. Weatherly is to the east via Spring Mountain Road, where Beaver Creek ends in confluence with Hazel Creek begetting Black Creek.

===19th century===
In 1800, Lausanne was created to provide local government for what is essentially all of present-day Carbon County, Pennsylvania; the eventual townships of East Penn, Lausanne, Mahoning, Banks, Towamensing, Lower Towamensing and Penn Forest; Pennsylvania townships being the most rural of organized municipal governments under the commonwealth constitution.

In 1826, Mauch Chunk, which is present-day Jim Thorpe, and other townships were split out of Lausanne and the center of that township was moved northwards. In 1843, Banks Township was organized, and incorporated the small settlement of Beaver Meadows within its larger girth.

In 1812, the secrets of burning anthracite were mostly yet to be discovered, revealed, and promoted (widely publicized) by Josiah White and Erskine Hazard but blacksmiths were several decades into knowing how to use it as an auxiliary fuel to complement bituminous or charcoal in forge fires, so by 1813 a modest pit mine was opened to provide coal for Berwick and Bloomington. The settlement&#x27;s first dwelling was built in 1804 of logs. The first houses were built along the main thoroughfare, today&#x27;s Broad Street east of the junction between Berwick St. (the continuation of the turnpike and Rt-93 to Hazelton) and Main St. westwards to Junedale, Tresckow, and Tamaqua.

Nathan Beach discovered coal in 1812, and opened a quarry in 1813, shipping his coal initially west by wagon to Berwick and Bloomsburg over the Berwick-Nescopeck Toll Bridge. With road improvements, he was able to ship his coal to Lausanne Landing where arks were being built by the Lehigh Coal Mine Company and coal could be transported to Philadelphia.

In 1817, stymied by the slow movements of the Schuylkill Canal board of directors, White and Hazard began the improvements making the one-way Lehigh Navigations in 1818, and travel Lehigh River downstream grew steadily safer. By the end of 1820, the new Lehigh Canal, still rough and unfinished, nonetheless enabled a record 365 long-tons to be shipped to Philadelphia.

By 1823, steady shipments allowed self-funding and the canal was being re-engineered and a gradual conversion begun into a system with two-way locks; its success in providing the affordable fuel to meet the young nation&#x27;s energy demands, the Erie Canal opening, followed by the news of railroad events in Britain in 1825 began whole chains of events spurring industrial production and railroads.

In 1826, Colonel William H. Wilson moved to the town and built a tavern. In 1831 James Lamison became citizen No. 3 and also opened a tavern. By that time the Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company had been formed and was subscribing stock. It was chartered on April 13, 1830, and the industrial revolution was about to begin using Beaver Meadows as a center. The company laid tracks down the valleys from Beaver and Black Creeks, the tributaries dumped into the Lehigh below and near Penn Haven Junction where the railroad expected to ship to the Lehigh Canal.

Room Run Railroad was occupying space assumed free by the Beaver Meadows planners assumptions. In 1830, operating managers Josiah White and Erskine Hazard of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (LC&amp;N Co.) opened new mines, now freed of immediate or further improvement needs of the Lehigh Canal or the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad, in the area of present-day Nesquehoning and building a two-mile funicular railway called the Room Run or Rhume Run Railroad to increase volume shipped by the company. The two railroads contended for the same space. At one point, both companies put armed men into the field, but an amicable settlement was reached but for a rate dispute to break out. This resulted in a resolve to build the railroad all the way to Easton, but a deal was reached after the railroad reached past Mauch Chunk to Parryville, where auxiliary barge loading facilities were built.

The Beaver Meadow Railroad &amp; Coal Company bought and subcontracted coal operations to A.H. VanCleve and Co. opening their own mines.

By 1833, they began local operations and construction of the railway along the surveyed right of way. Strong-armed by LC&amp;N Co., the company got a change in charter and continued downstream along the Lehigh until LC&amp;N Co. blinked and granted acceptable shipping rate terms. In 1835 they contracted for the first wood-burning steam locomotives to operate in Northampton and Carbon counties, which began operations in 1836. They also demonstrated that a railroad could be built over 30 miles through mountainous country. The Beaver Meadow Railroad became an operational success, and an inspiration.

In 1846, investors began the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad Company to link New York Harbor at Jersey City via New Jersey to the Susquehanna River and then the great lakes via a line across the Delaware and up the Lehigh Rivers. They were successful, and represented the beginning of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, whose oldest parts, the Beaver Meadows Railroad, were absorbed in 1866.

<text>Caerlaverock Castle is a moated triangular castle first built in the 13th century. It is located on the southern coast of Scotland, south of Dumfries, on the edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve. Caerlaverock was a stronghold of the Maxwell family from the 13th century until the 17th century, when the castle was abandoned. It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several partial demolitions and reconstructions over the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among &quot;the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland&quot;. In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time by the Protestant Covenanter army and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times.

The castle, which is protected as a scheduled monument, is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and is a popular tourist attraction.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Caerlaverock&quot; is of Brittonic origin. The first part of the name is the element meaning &quot;an enclosed, defensible site&quot;, (Welsh &quot;caer&quot; meaning &quot;fort, city&quot;). The second part of the name may be the personal name &quot;Lïμarch&quot; (Welsh &quot;Llywarch&quot;), or a lost stream-name formed from the adjective &quot;laβar&quot;, &quot;talkative&quot; (Welsh &quot;llafar&quot;, see Afon Llafar), suffixed with &quot;–ǭg&quot;, &quot;having the quality of&quot;, or the adjectival suffix &quot;-īg&quot;. The present form has been influenced by the Scots word &quot;laverock&quot;, &quot;skylark&quot;.

==History==
The present castle was preceded by several fortifications in the area: a Roman fort on Ward Law Hill and a British hill fort that was in use around 950. The chronicles in the 12th-century &quot;Annales Cambriæ&quot; state that King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio died nearby at the Battle of Arthuret in 573. His death triggered his bard Myrddin Wyllt to go insane and retreat into the woods, an act that later inspired the character of Merlin in Arthurian legend.

The Maxwell family can be traced back to Undwin and his son Maccus in the 11th century; Maccus gave his name to the barony of Maccuswell or Maxwell. His grandson, John de Maccuswell (d. 1241), was first Lord Maxwell of Caerlaverock. The Baronies of Maxwell and Caerlaverock then passed down through the male line, sometimes collaterally. Robert de Maxwell of Maxwell, Caerlaverock and Mearns (d. 1409) rebuilt Caerlaverock castle and was succeeded by Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock (d. 1420).

The earliest mention of the lands of Caerlaverock is around 1160, when they were granted to the monks of Holm Cultram Abbey. Around 1220 Alexander II of Scotland granted the lands to Sir John Maxwell, making him Warden of the West March. Sir John Maxwell also served as Chamberlain of Scotland from 1231 to 1233, and began work on the first castle at Caerlaverock. This castle was square in shape and was one of the earliest stone castles to be built in Scotland. It had a moat with a bridge facing north. Only the foundations and remains of a wooden enclosure around it remain.

This early castle may have been incomplete when it was abandoned in favour of a rock outcrop some to the north. It was here that Sir John&#x27;s brother Sir Aymer Maxwell began construction of the present castle. Sir Aymer also served as Chamberlain in 1258–1260, and was Justiciar of Galloway in 1264. In the 1270s the &quot;new&quot; castle was completed, and Herbert Maxwell, nephew of John Maxwell, occupied it.

When the moat around the second castle was dug, the quarrying was probably a source of building stone for the castle. While the gatehouse stands on natural rock, the rest of the castle was built on a clay platform created especially for the castle.

===Wars of independence===
In 1299, the garrison of Caerlaverock attacked Lochmaben Castle which was held by English forces.

====Siege of Caerlaverock====
In July 1300 King Edward I of England marched north with an army including eighty-seven of the Barons of England and several knights of Brittany and Lorraine, and besieged Caerlaverock. Those present on the English side included Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Robert FitzWalter; Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford; John, Baron Segrave; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; Patrick, Earl of March and his son; Prince Edward (the future Edward II); Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his brother Henry; Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The Maxwells, under their chief Sir Eustace Maxwell, mounted a vigorous defence of the castle which repelled the English several times. In the end, the garrison was compelled to surrender, after which it was found that only sixty men had withstood the whole English army for a considerable period.

During the siege the English heralds composed a roll of arms in Old French verse, known as the &quot;Siege of Caerlaverock&quot;, in which each noble or knight present was named, his feats of valour described, and a poetic blazon of his armorial bearings given.

===Recovery===
Possession of the castle was subsequently restored to Sir Eustace Maxwell, Sir Herbert&#x27;s son, who at first embraced the cause of John Balliol, and in 1312 received from Edward II an allowance of £20 for the more secure keeping of the castle. He afterwards gave in his adherence to Robert Bruce, and his castle, in consequence, underwent a second siege by the English, in which they were unsuccessful. Fearing that this important stronghold might ultimately fall into the hands of the enemy, and enable them to make good their hold on the district, Sir Eustace dismantled the fortress, service and sacrifice for which he was liberally rewarded by Robert Bruce.

By 1337 the castle was once again inhabited, and Sir Eustace now changed sides again, giving his support to Edward Balliol. Around 1355 Sir Roger Kirkpatrick of Closeburn captured Caerlaverock for David II of Scotland, and partly dismantled the castle.

===Repair and rebuilding===
By the end of the Wars of Independence in the mid-14th century, Caerlaverock had been regained by the Maxwells, with Sir Robert Maxwell rebuilding much of the castle between 1373 and 1410. Further work was undertaken by Robert, 2nd Lord Maxwell, in the mid-15th century, probably involving reconstruction of the gatehouse. A new west range was added within the walls around 1500.

The Catholic Maxwells took up the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her forced abdication in 1567. Caerlaverock was besieged in 1570 by an English Protestant force led by the Earl of Sussex, and was again partly demolished, including the destruction of the gatehouse with gunpowder.

By 1593, John, 8th Lord Maxwell was repairing the castle again, building up the gatehouse for defence against the Johnstones of Annandale, with whom the Maxwells were feuding. The 8th Lord was killed by the Johnstones during a fight at Dryfe Sands, and in 1613 the 9th Lord Maxwell was executed for the revenge murder of Sir James Johnstone.

===Earls of Nithsdale===
In 1619 Robert, 10th Lord Maxwell, married Elizabeth Beaumont, cousin of the Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James VI of Scotland. He was subsequently made Earl of Nithsdale and appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland. To reflect his new status he built the elaborate south and east ranges within the castle, known as the Nithsdale Lodging.
The new ranges were completed around 1634. Nithsdale was at Caerlaverock in August 1637, and wrote to Sir Richard Graham asking for dogs for hunting and breeding. Religious turmoil soon turned against the staunchly Catholic Maxwells. In 1640 the Protestant Covenanter army besieged Caerlaverock for 13 weeks, eventually forcing its surrender. According to Sir Henry Vane, the Earl and Countess of Nithsdale and their page were allowed to leave, but 40 defenders called Maxwell were put to the sword. The south wall and tower were demolished, and the castle was never repaired or reoccupied.

In the mid 19th century, the castle was in the possession of William Constable-Maxwell, 10th Lord Herries of Terregles (1804–1876), heir of the 5th Earl of Nithsdale.

== Architectural description ==

The castle is most unusual in having a triangular form, one of only a small number across Europe and the only one in the UK. As well, it is unusual for Scotland in having a moat and earthwork ramparts around it. It sits in a low lying formerly swampy area on the flood plain of the nearby River Nith, again unusual for a defensive structure in this area of Scotland. It is however, the finest example of a castle in south-west Scotland. 

The basic form is triangular, with the Gatehouse to the north formed of two large drum towers (see plan). In the south west and south east corners there are further but smaller drum towers. Murdoch’s Tower to the south west is largely complete, but the tower to the south east was reduced to base level during the Covenanter siege of 1640.

Despite many sieges and slightings followed by rebuildings, the original form of the castle can still be appreciated, the curtain wall bases largely remaining at lower levels, these dating to the original construction in the last quarter of the thirteenth century (HES Statement of Significance &quot;op cit&quot;, p10) The early parts of the castle were built of red sandstone quarried at nearly Bankend. While of later build, to the west and east much of the curtain walls stand to parapet height.

Within the courtyard formed by the curtain walls there are four ranges: the Gatehouse, the west range, the Banqueting Hall range and the Nithsdale Lodging range (see plan), a small triangular courtyard being formed between them. These ranges are of different dates. Especially to the south, the buildings are ruinous, the Banqueting Hall range in particular being reduced for the most part to no more than a few metres high.

A. The Gatehouse range is the earliest remaining part of the castle. It consists of the two massive drum towers faced in ashlar with the entrance passage between the towers. The west tower is largely original, but the east tower was largely rebuilt in the late fifteenth century. While ruinous at the upper levels, the drum towers still stand above the drawbridge to a height of some 15.5 metres to the machicolations, these dating to the late fifteenth century rebuild. Internally, the gatehouse has an entrance with portcullis and above a hall, later subdivided (Stell &quot;op cit&quot;, p112).

B. The west range dates to around 1500 and while roofless is largely complete. The range consists essentially of a series of rectangular rooms on two floors, each with a fireplace, the rooms most likely used as accommodation (Stell &quot;op cit,&quot; p112.)

C. The south or Banqueting House range was reduced to walls of only a few metres high or less, largely as a result of the Covenanter&#x27;s siege in 1640, when artillery fire and then slighting reduced the walls (and at the same time the SE tower). The Hall was of substantial size, and some evidence of its former grandeur can be gauged from the remains of the large fireplace on the north wall.

D. Sitting to the north east of the interior, and the last part of the castle to be built, the Nithsdale Lodging building is the most complete part of the castle. Although lacking its two eastern most bays it is perhaps the most spectacular part of the castle, with its magnificent Renaissance façade of the 1630s (SoS &quot;op cit&quot;, 12-13). The remaining front is decorated with a series of carved pediments over nine large windows, three smaller ones and two doorways, depicting various armorials and symbolic sculptures (SoS &quot;op cit&quot;, 16-18) . Internally, the rooms are quite small, due to the placement of a fireplace/flue block in the centre of the structure. With the kitchens and other service rooms on the ground floor, the rooms on the first and higher floors were most likely used as private apartments.

== Nature reserve ==
Caerlaverock Castle is within the Nith Estuary National Scenic Area, protected for its scenic qualities, with the castle recognised as a landmark of the area. The castle is at the northern edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve, which extends to and consists of saltmarsh, mudflats and grazing land. It is an internationally important wintering site for waterfowl and wading birds, including the barnacle goose.

==Cultural references==
The castle was used as a location for the 2011 romantic comedy film &quot;The Decoy Bride&quot;.
