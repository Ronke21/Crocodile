Its population was 8,466 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Fort Lancaster sent 1st Infantry Co. H &quot;to take post&quot; along Comanche Springs on 12 April 1859. Fort Stockton (named Camp Stockton until 1860) grew up around Comanche Springs, one of the largest sources of spring water in Texas. The fort was named for Robert F. Stockton. Comanche Springs was a favorite rest stop on the Great Comanche Trail to Chihuahua, San Antonio-El Paso Road, and the Butterfield Overland Mail route. On October 2, 1859, the well-known journalist and author (and future Union spy) Albert D. Richardson passed through Camp Stockton, which he described as &quot;a military post of three or four edifices with pearly, misty mountains in the background.&quot;

In 1861, the fort was garrisoned by 39 men of Company C, 8th Infantry, under the command of Capt. Arthur Tracy Lee, who evacuated the fort by April. The Confederates took possession of the fort on 9 May by Charles L. Pyron at the outbreak of the Civil War, but soon turned command over to Capt. William C. Adams. With the failure of John Baylor&#x27;s invasion of New Mexico, a general Confederate evacuation of West Texas occurred in 1862.

In 1867, the Army rebuilt the fort on a larger and more permanent basis. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Richardson, Davis, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. &quot;Subposts or intermediate stations&quot; also were used, including Bothwick&#x27;s Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.

On 21 July 1867, Fort Stockton was reoccupied by Companies A, B, E, and K of the 9th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, buffalo soldiers under the command of General Edward Hatch, while a new fort was built one-half mile north of the first post, on the west side of the creek. Major James F. Wade took command of Troops A, B, D, and E, 9th Cavalry, and Company G, 41st Infantry, on 2 Oct. 1868. Lt. Col. Wesley Merritt assumed command of Companies A and D, 9th Cavalry, G, 24th Infantry, and K, 25th Infantry in Feb. 1871. Major Zenas Randall Bliss assumed command on 15 May 1872. 
Troops B, G, and L, 10th Cavalry, and Companies A and I, 1st Infantry, under Lt. Col. J.F. Wade, were stationed at the fort when the Army decided to abandon it in 1882. Major George A. Purington was the last commander when the Army finally left on 27 June 1886.

San Antonio entrepreneurs were convinced the water from the nearby Comanche and Leon Springs could be used for irrigation. They purchased large tracts of land for agricultural development. In 1868, Peter Gallagher bought the land that included the military garrison and Comanche Springs, platted for a town site named Saint Gaul, and established two stores at Comanche Springs. Later, Gallagher and John James purchased along Comanche Creek. By 1870, the Saint Gaul region had a population of 420 civilians, predominantly Irish, German, and Mexican Catholics who had come by way of San Antonio. The first church in Saint Gaul was Catholic. When Pecos County was organized in 1875, Saint Gaul became the county seat. The name, however, was never popular with the citizens, and on August 13, 1881, it was changed officially to Fort Stockton.
By 1870, some settlers were using the water from the Pecos River for irrigation. Seven years later, irrigated farmland comprised , and by 1945, the total reached . In 1951, Clayton Williams Sr. and other &quot;pump farmers&quot; west of town drilled irrigation wells that tapped into the aquifer that fed Comanche Springs. A lawsuit was filed by the Pecos County Water District #1, and 108 families who depended on the flow from the springs, to stop the pumping (&quot;Pecos County Water District #1&quot; v. &quot;Clayton Williams et al.&quot;). On June 21, 1954, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals ruled in favor of Clayton Williams, &quot;et al.&quot; by upholding &quot;the rule of capture&quot;, agreeing with the landmark 1904 Texas Supreme Court decision that groundwater was &quot;too mysterious to regulate&quot;. The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the decision. By the late 1950s, Comanche Springs was dry due to the pumping. This ruling established what is known as &quot;the rule of capture&quot; and has regulated groundwater in Texas since. In his book, &quot;The Springs of Texas&quot;, author Gunnar Brune called the destruction of Comanche Springs, &quot;the most spectacular example of man&#x27;s abuse of nature.&quot;

After the military post was abandoned on June 30, 1886, and both the Texas and Pacific and the Southern Pacific railroads had bypassed it, Fort Stockton experienced a decline. By then, however, it was rapidly becoming the center for an extensive sheep- and cattle-ranching industry, and in 1926, the opening of the nearby Yates Oil Field brought on an economic boom. Fort Stockton was eventually served by the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Fort Stockton is southwest of Midland International Airport. The town is within driving distance of the Big Bend country, including Big Bend National Park, , and the Big Bend Ranch State Park, , as well as the scenery of numerous day-drive locations in the area.

<text>Imperial is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pecos County, Texas, United States. The population was 294 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Imperial is located at (31.271968, -102.695799). It is situated at the intersection of Farm Roads 11 and 1053, four miles south of the Pecos River and approximately 30 miles northeast of Fort Stockton in northern Pecos County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The community was settled in the early 1900s. The site was originally known as Redlands from 1908 to around 1910, when it was renamed after California&#x27;s Imperial Valley. A post office and school were opened in 1910 and a townsite was laid out on land owned by Benjamin E. Bush one year later. Water from the Pecos River was diverted and a small dam was built west of the community. An irrigation canal was constructed through Imperial in an attempt to attract new residents, but the area&#x27;s water had a high salt content, which made farming unproductive. The population was approximately 25 in the mid-1920s, but had increased tenfold by 1949. Imperial&#x27;s population approached 1,000 by the late 1960s with twenty-six businesses operating in the community. The number of inhabitants continued to decline during the latter half of the twentieth century.

<text>Iraan ( ) is a city in Pecos County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,055 at the 2020 census. The city&#x27;s name is an amalgamation of the first names of Ira and Ann Yates, owners of the ranch land upon which the town was built.

==History==

Iraan was an oil boom town, and it developed quickly after the discovery of the gigantic Yates Oil Field, which is adjacent to the town on the southwest. The oil field was discovered in 1926, and the first buildings in town were basic housing and infrastructure for workers on the field, all built by the Big Lake Oil Company, which became Plymouth Oil Company, which was purchased by the Ohio Oil Company, then purchased by Marathon Oil Company, and owned today by Kinder Morgan. By 1927, the town included a school, and the post office appeared in 1928. The population of the town in 1930 was about 1,600. About 3 mi (5 km) south of Iraan was the oil boomtown of Redbarn, which appeared almost immediately after discovery of the oil field, before Iraan itself. It was a collection of tents and shanties in the immediate vicinity of Ira Yates&#x27;s ranch. Yates donated of his ranch to the town of Iraan to encourage further development there, and in 1952, the town of Redbarn, which never had a permanent population of more than 75, was finally abandoned.

One of Iraan&#x27;s most famous residents was V.T. Hamlin, the creator of the comic strip &quot;Alley Oop&quot;. Originally from Iowa, he worked in Iraan during the oil boom period of the late 1920s, and he either got the idea for the strip or created its earliest drafts there; the strip was first published in 1932 in Des Moines. He moved back to Iowa in 1929 and later to Florida. A park in Iraan is named after the strip.

In 2021, Jason Rybolt, the CEO of Iraan General Hospital, stated that Iraan had a 42% positivity rate of COVID-19. Rosa Flores and Ashley Killough of CNN described the town as being hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas in 2021.

==Background==
Corrigan largely emerged when the Houston East and West Texas Railway was completed in 1881; however, the area had seen some establishment of mills and farms prior to the railroad. The town was named Corrigan after Pat Corrigan, the conductor of the first train to pass through the newly built railway in the area. In the years following, the timber industry boomed in Corrigan due to the large pine trees native to the area and access to the railroad. By 1882, there were 17 sawmills in the Corrigan area. The timber industry led to churches, stores, hotels, gins, and other businesses opening in Corrigan. In 1883, a post office opened. The Corrigan economy began to diversify, which helped the community survive economic downturns that happened periodically in the timber industry. However, the timber industry remained at the core of the Corrigan economy and shaped many of the town&#x27;s social structures.

In 2000, there were 114 businesses in Corrigan. An analysis by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; of Texas traffic stop data found the Corrigan Police Department to be among the most aggressive at enforcing traffic laws in the state, with the town&#x27;s 12 police officers issuing over 8,100 citations in 2020.

<doc id="136498" wikidata="Q982507" url="?curid=136498" title="Marfa, Texas">
<text>Marfa is a city in the high desert of the Trans-Pecos in far West Texas, United States, between the Davis Mountains and Big Bend National Park, at an elevation of 4685 feet. It is the county seat of Presidio County. The city was founded in the early 1880s as a water stop. The population of Marfa peaked in the 1930s and as of the 2020 United States Census the population is 1,788. 

Today Marfa is a tourist destination and a major center for minimalist art. Major attractions include Building 98, the Chinati Foundation, and the Marfa lights.

==History==
Marfa was founded in the early 1880s as a railroad water stop. The town was named &quot;Marfa&quot; (Russian for &quot;Martha&quot;) at the suggestion of the wife of a railroad executive. Although some historians have hypothesized that the name came from a character in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Marfa was actually named after Marfa Strogoff, a character in Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;. According to Sterry Butcher of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, a writer researched the Karamazov story and deemed it false, but did not receive any letters to the editor after he submitted the story to the newspaper, and therefore &quot;No one cared. The story we had suited Marfa just fine.&quot;

The town grew quickly during the 1920s.

The Marfa Army Air Field served as a training facility for several thousand pilots during World War II, including the American actor Robert Sterling, before closing in 1945. The base was also used as the training ground for many of the United States Army&#x27;s chemical mortar battalions.

Marfa experienced economic issues after the war ended and after a drought impaired agricultural output. Artist Donald Judd arrived in 1973 and began buying properties to renovate, which resulted in bohemian interest in the community. In 2012 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described it as a &quot;playground&quot; for &quot;art-world pioneers and pilgrims&quot;. Marfa is about 60 miles from the Mexico-U.S. border.

==Geography==
Marfa is in northeastern Presidio County within the Chihuahuan Desert. The town is approximately 20 miles south of Fort Davis on Texas Route 17 and about 18 miles west of Alpine on US Route 67. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Arts and culture==
The area around Marfa is known as a cultural center for contemporary artists and artisans. In 1971, Minimalist artist Donald Judd moved to Marfa from New York. After renting summer houses for a few years, he bought two large hangars and some smaller buildings and began to install his art permanently. This had started with his building in New York but the buildings in Marfa allowed him to install his works on a larger scale. In 1976, he bought the first of two ranches that became his primary places of residence, continuing a long love affair with the desert landscape surrounding Marfa. Later, with assistance from the Dia Art Foundation in New York, Judd acquired decommissioned Fort D.A. Russell, and in 1979 began transforming the fort&#x27;s buildings into art spaces. Judd&#x27;s vision was to house large collections of individual artists&#x27; work on permanent display, as a sort of antimuseum. Judd believed the prevailing model of many museums, where various art exhibits are shown for limited times, does not allow the viewer an understanding of the artist or their work as they had intended.
Following Judd&#x27;s death in 1994, two foundations have worked to maintain his legacy: the Chinati Foundation and Judd Foundation. Since its inauguration in 1986, Chinati has held an open-house event that attracts visitors from around the world to visit Marfa&#x27;s art. Between 1997 and 2008, both foundations cosponsored this event. The Chinati Foundation now occupies more than 30 buildings in Marfa and has permanently displayed work by 13 artists.

In recent years, a new wave of artists has moved to Marfa to live and work. As a result, new gallery spaces have opened in the downtown area. The Crowley Theater and its annex host public events with seating for over 175 as a public service to nonprofit foundations. Furthermore, The Lannan Foundation has established a writers-in-residency program, a Marfa theater group has formed, and a multifunctional art space called Ballroom Marfa has begun to show art films, host musical performances, and exhibit other art installations. The city is also from Prada Marfa, a pop art exhibit, and is home to Cobra Rock Boot Company and The Wrong Store.

Marfa Myths, an annual music festival and multidisciplinary cultural program, was founded in 2014 by the nonprofit contemporary arts foundation Ballroom Marfa and Brooklyn-based music label Mexican Summer. The festival brings together a diversity of emerging and established artists and musicians to work creatively and collaboratively across music, film, and visual arts contexts. The festival is inherently embedded in the landscape of Far West Texas and deeply engaged with Marfa&#x27;s cultural history and present-day community.

Building 98, also located in Marfa, is a project of the International Woman&#x27;s Foundation, which has operated an artist-in-residency program since 2002. The International Woman&#x27;s Foundation was responsible for placing Fort D.A. Russell on the National Register of Historic Places as an effort to preserve the historic importance of the site. The facility&#x27;s studio galleries host artists who desire to exhibit work in the region at a premier venue. In late September 2012 through early April 2013, the foundation held a major retrospective of the works of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong at Building 98 featuring over 75 unseen works of the early American woman modernist. Building 98 is located at historic Fort D. A. Russell; it is the home of Marfa&#x27;s German POW murals. The facility also features the George Sugarman sculpture courtyard.

===Marfa lights===
Marfa is the location of the Marfa lights, visible on clear nights between Marfa and the Paisano Pass when one is facing southwest (toward the Chinati Mountains). According to the Handbook of Texas Online, &quot;at times they appear colored as they twinkle in the distance. They move about, split apart, melt together, disappear, and reappear. Presidio County residents have watched the lights for over a hundred years.&quot; The first historical record of them dates to 1883. Presidio County has built a viewing station 9 miles east of town on US 67 near the site of the old air base. Each year, enthusiasts gather for the annual Marfa Lights Festival.

==In popular culture==

<text>Presidio is a city in Presidio County, Texas, United States. It is situated on the Rio Grande (&quot;Río Bravo del Norte&quot;) River, on the opposite side of the U.S.–Mexico border from Ojinaga, Chihuahua. The name originates from Spanish and means &quot;fortress&quot;. The population was 3,264 at the 2020 census.

Presidio is on the Farm to Market Road 170, and U.S. Route 67, south of Shafter in Presidio County. Presidio is approximately southeast of El Paso, southwest of Odessa, and northeast of Chihuahua City.

==History==
The junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande at Presidio was settled thousands of years ago by hunting and gathering peoples. By 1200 CE, the local Native Americans had adopted agriculture and lived in small, closely knit, La Junta Indians settlements, which the Spaniards later called &quot;pueblos&quot;.

The first Spaniards came to Presidio in 1535. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions stopped at the Native American pueblo, placed a cross on the mountainside, and called the village . On December 10, 1582, Antonio de Espejo and his company arrived at the site and named the pueblo . By 1681, the area of Presidio was known as . Five Jumanos towns were located along the Rio Grande to the north of the junction, consisting largely of permanent houses. In 1683, Juan Sabeata, the chief of the Jumanos, reported having seen a fiery cross on the mountain at Presidio and requested that a mission be established at La Junta. The settlement in 1684 became known as . The missions La Navidad en las Cruces, San Francisco de los Julimes, San Antonio de los Puliques, Apostol Santiago, and Santa María de la Redonda may have been established on the Texas side of the Rio Grande at La Junta.

Around 1760, a penal colony and military garrison of 60 men were established near Presidio. In 1830, the name of the area around Presidio was changed from to . White American settlers came to Presidio in 1848 after the Mexican War. Among them was John Spencer, who operated a horse ranch on the United States side of the Rio Grande near Presidio. Ben Leaton and Milton Faver, former scalp hunters for the Mexican government, built private forts in the area.

In 1790, the Spanish signed a peace agreement with the Lipan Apache, creating El Barrio del Cementerio de Los Lipanes, now located downtown.

In 1849, a Comanche raid almost destroyed Presidio, and in 1850, Indians drove off most of the cattle in town. A post office was established at Presidio in 1868, and the first public school was opened in 1887.

During the Mexican Revolution, General Pancho Villa often used Ojinaga as his headquarters for operations and visited Presidio on numerous occasions. As a result of Pancho Villa&#x27;s force&#x27;s raid and capture of Ojinaga on January 10, 1914, many Mexican army troops and civilians fled to Presidio seeking safe-haven. U.S. forces detained 2,000 Mexican refugees in Presidio, eventually marching them north 60 miles to Camp Marfa. The refugees would later be sent by train to Ft. Bliss (El Paso).

In 1930, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway reached Presidio and the Presidio–Ojinaga International Rail Bridge was built. The population grew from 96 in 1925 to 1,671 in 1988, but the number of businesses declined from 70 in 1933 to 22 in 1988. At the end of 1988, Presidio experienced a population boom, due in part to previously undocumented immigrants enrolled in the amnesty program. The population in 1990 was 3,422. Despite Presidio having been occupied continuously since ancient times, the community was finally incorporated in 1980, with Herb Myers elected as Presidio&#x27;s first mayor.

The town is featured in the 1959 movie &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and the 1964 movie &quot;Rio Conchos.&quot;

In 1986, the Texas Department of Transportation opened a two-lane bridge, connecting Presidio and Ojinaga, the Presidio–Ojinaga International Bridge. By 2019, a second span will be constructed, with the original bridge being refurbished. The increased bridge capacity is projected to meet higher traffic, mainly commercial and agricultural in nature.

As of 2020, Presidio&#x27;s local economy is based largely upon employment at Presidio Independent School District, United States Customs and Border Protection, and local retail businesses.

In 2010, Presidio built the world&#x27;s largest sodium-sulfur battery to provide power when the city&#x27;s lone line to the United States power grid goes down.

<text>Point is a city in Rains County, Texas, United States. The population was 745 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Settled &quot;circa&quot; 1880 as a flag station on a section of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas (MKT) Railroad being built from Mineola to Greenville, the name submitted for a post office was initially Rice&#x27;s Point, in honor of early area settler William Rice. When that was rejected, the name Point was accepted. By 1890, the community had an estimated population of fifty, a public school, and four churches. Ten men, led by newspaperman Isaac Newton Gresham, met in Point on August 28, 1902, and signed a charter to establish the Farmers&#x27; Educational and Cooperative Union of America. The organization went national in 1905 and had a million members by 1908. In 1913, Point established the first independent school district in Rains County. The number of residents had risen to around 600 in 1914. The Great Depression severely impacted the community, leading to a rapid decline in population and the number of businesses in Point. The paving of U.S. Route 69 in the early 1940s bolstered the population to approximately 420, but that figure had again declined to 350 by the end of that decade. The MKT line was abandoned in the mid-1950s. In 1957, the Iron Bridge Dam was constructed on the Sabine River to form Lake Tawakoni. When the lake reached its fullest extent in 1960, it was only four miles from Point. Point was incorporated as a city in 1966. Development along the shores of Lake Tawakoni eventually became a separate community, East Tawakoni, which incorporated in 1967. Point&#x27;s population was 419 in 1970 and slowly grew, due to a combination of tourism and its role as a local agricultural trade center. The 1990 census reported 645 residents living in the city and 792 in 2000.

==Geography==

<text>Big Lake is a small rural city in and the county seat of Reagan County, Texas United States. As of the 2010 Census, the city population was 2,936. It is the county seat of Reagan County.

==Description==
Big Lake is situated atop the divide between the Rio Grande and Colorado River watersheds. The city takes its name from a dry lake, a unique dryland plains geographic feature located approximately two miles south of the city, through which St Hwy 137 passes. The dry lake, with no outlet, is more than two sections in size, making it the largest in Texas; it impounds water temporarily after high-runoff rain events, being used for grazing the remainder of the time. Though seasonal and temporal, the &quot;big playa lake&quot;, in wet periods, is significant in a semiarid, drought-frequented environment and has been utilized regularly as a food and water resource by man and animal, alike, since prehistoric times.

Started as a small ranching community in the late 1880s, Big Lake owes its original existence to the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, which passed through the area in 1912, as it was extended from Sherwood, west of San Angelo, to Girvin and beyond the Pecos River. The growth from the railroad, coupled with that from the Santa Rita discovery well in 1923, allowed it, in 1925, to take over the position of county seat from Stiles, a pioneer ranching community established in 1894 on Centrailia Draw, about 20 miles to the north. The main highway through the area, US 67, was extended through the region in 1934, on the way to its terminus in Presidio. The city&#x27;s current existence is based on agriculture (some farming, but mostly ranching) and oil and gas service and production throughout the area.

==History==
In 1919, Rupert Ricker began the process of leasing 674 sections of University of Texas land, part of their Permanent University Fund. Unable to fund any test wells, Ricker sold the prospect to Frank Pickrell and Haymon Krupp, who organized the Texon Oil and Land Company. The company geologist, Hugh H. Tucker, picked the drill site, claiming a structure wide and long. The initial drill site was about west of Big Lake, north of the Orient Railroad tracks at what became Texon. They hired Carl G. Cromwell to spud the first test well in 1921, using cable tools. On the afternoon of 27 May, oil showed in the bailer. Then, on the morning of 28 May 1923, the Santa Rita No. 1 gushed oil after drilling to a depth of . Initial production was 100 BOPD, which overflowed the earthen tanks, and then onto the ground for over a month before casing could set. The oil was then shipped by tank car to a refinery in El Paso. Michael Late Benedum bought the Texon find, and formed the Big Lake Oil Company, in October 1923. By 1924, Benedum had established the Big Lake oil field as the first major oil field in the Permian Basin. In 1926, this field had 74 wells producing a total of 32,317 BOPD.

==Geography==
Big Lake is located at (31.193908, –101.458834).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Big Lake was served by the Kansas City, Mexico, and Orient Railway, and continues to be served by its successor Texas Pacifico Transportation.

==Climate==
Big Lake experiences a hot semiarid climate, typical of West Texas and parts of Central Texas. Summers are long and hot, and winters are short and relatively mild. In the summer, low humidity helps temper the heat. Due to Big Lake&#x27;s aridity and elevation, temperatures drop quickly after sunset, especially in the summer. Some precipitation falls in summer, mostly as fast-moving thunderstorms. Winters are dry. Winter temperatures occasionally drop below freezing at night, but sustained, bitter cold is uncommon. Snowfall is rare, never exceeds a few inches, and usually melts quickly.

==Education==

The City of Big Lake is served by the Reagan County Independent School District.

==Big Lake in popular culture==
The city of Big Lake was featured in the 2002 movie &quot;The Rookie&quot;, although the town portrayed in the movie was actually Thorndale, Texas, which is east of Austin.

In the movie, the town lacked a proper baseball field, while the high school football stadium was the main focus of athletic attention. &quot;The Rookie&quot; made Big Lake interested in hosting a minor league baseball team: the West Texas Big Fish of the Texas–Louisiana League in the 2000s. Today, another Big Fish team is a member of the collegiate level Central Texas Collegiate League.

Big Lake is featured in a semi-biographical 2019 novel, by Russ Brown, titled &quot;Miss Chisum&quot;. The narrative explores the life of cattle baron, John Chisum, and his fabled relationship with a slave. Big Lake is depicted as a watering hole on Chisum&#x27;s 19th century westward cattle drives. Revisited in 1970 by his granddaughter, whilst retracing his steps.

<doc id="136510" wikidata="Q976841" url="?curid=136510" title="Leakey, Texas">
<text>Leakey ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Real County, Texas, United States. The population was 315 at the 2020 census.

The city is named for John H. Leakey (1824–1900), a pioneer from Tennessee.
The Alto Frio Baptist Encampment is located to the southeast of the community.

==History==
Archaeological excavations in the Frio Canyon region revealed Paleo-American, Archaic, and Neo-American occupations. Later, several Native American tribes, including Lipan Apache, Comanche, and Tonkawa inhabited or traversed the area.

Anglo-American settlement of the area began in 1856 when John Leakey, his wife Nancy, and a few others settled near a spring along the banks of the Frio River. Shingles and lumber were produced from the abundant cypress and cedar trees. In its first few years, the community was a lonely outpost that was subject to frequent Indian raids, which continued until 1882. Growth accelerated after the Civil War as new families arrived. In 1883, A.G. Vogel moved a post office from the community of Floral to Leakey. That same year, the Texas State Legislature created Edwards County and designated Leakey as the county seat less than a year later. 1883 was also the year that the area&#x27;s first school was established on land donated by the Leakeys. A new school building was completed in 1890. In 1891, the Edwards County seat was moved from Leakey to Rocksprings. During the early 1900s, ranching superseded lumber, cotton cultivation, and corn production in importance to the local economy. The raising of Angora goats was a major component of the ranching industry. In 1902, the school in Leakey had a total enrollment of 102 students. The town&#x27;s population was estimated to be 318 in 1904.

Real County was created from parts of Edwards, Bandera, and Kerr Counties in the spring of 1913, with Leakey as the county seat. In 1919, Real County Judge Ed Kelly established the Leakey Independent School District. By the mid-1920s, the population had declined to around 120. A larger school building was completed in 1930. Soon after, several nearby schools, including West Frio, Cypress Creek, Rio Frio, Exile, Stanford, Dry Frio, and Harper were consolidated with Leakey schools.

Leakey was formally incorporated on June 11, 1951. The population fluctuated during the latter half of the 20th century. Leakey was home to 450 people in 1960, 393 in 1970, 468 in 1980, and 399 in 1990. By 2000, there were 387 residents living in Leakey, representing a 3.01% decrease in population since the last census was conducted in 1990.

On March 29, 2017, thirteen senior citizens from the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels in Comal County who had completed a retreat at Alto Frio were killed when Jack D. Young, the 20-year-old driver of a pickup, crashed into the church minivan on U.S. Highway 83 inside Uvalde County near the state park. One person survived the crash in critical condition. The accident was one of the deadliest in memory in the Leakey area. Young told a witness, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m sorry&quot; and said that he had been on his cell phone at the time of the accident. Jody Kuchler, a welder from Leakey who saw the accident, said that the driver of the church vehicle moved over to try to avoid Young&#x27;s incoming pickup but was blocked by the guard rail.

<text>Avery is a town in Red River County, in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 421 at the 2020 census. From the 1920s through the early 1960s Avery was one of the largest tomato producing and shipping cities in northeastern Texas.

==History==
The town was established in the 1870s. Avery is located on U.S. Highway 82, sixteen miles southeast of Clarksville in eastern Red River County. When the Texas and Pacific railroad was being constructed through the county in the 1870s, the managers of the railroad planned a station at the site and named it Douglass. Settlement in the community was slow because the surrounding area was so sparsely populated. When a correspondent of the Clarksville Standard newspaper visited Douglass in early 1881, he found a collection of families living in tents. Later that year, when Isaac Bradford and his partner opened their general store, a post office was established there, and the name of the town was changed to Isaca. In 1902 the name was changed to Avery, in honor of Ed Avery, the first railway station agent. In 1884, the population was estimated at thirty, and by 1896 it had increased to forty-eight. By 1900 Avery had three churches, a school, and a population of 176. During the first decade of the twentieth century, cotton ginning was an important local industry. By 1914, the town had two banks; a weekly newspaper, the Avery News, published by H. H. Morgan; and a population estimated at 500. The population reached its highest point in the late 1920s with a reported 800 residents, before declining sharply to a low of 300 in the early 1930s. Avery was incorporated before the 1940 census, when it reported 477 residents. The population subsequently remained relatively stable. The 1980 census recorded 520 residents, and in 1986 nine businesses were reported. In 1990 the population was 430. By 2000, the population increased to 462.

<doc id="136513" wikidata="Q6730626" url="?curid=136513" title="Magic Alex">
<text>Yannis (later John) Alexis Mardas (; 2 May 1942 – 13 January 2017), also known as Magic Alex, was a Greek self-professed inventor who was closely associated with the Beatles. His nickname was given to him by John Lennon when he was involved with the group between 1965 and 1969, during which time he became head of Apple Electronics.

Mardas arrived in England in 1965, exhibiting his &quot;Kinetic Light Sculptures&quot; at the Indica Gallery. He impressed John Lennon with the &quot;Nothing Box&quot;: a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights, and allegedly claimed that he could build a 72-track tape machine. Mardas was in India with the Beatles at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s ashram in India and was then given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in Savile Row. His schemes lost Apple at least £300,000 (£ in pounds).

In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. King Hussein of Jordan bought a fleet of cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to be useless. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece.

==London and the Beatles==
The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas first arrived in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in with him in a flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Known at this time as Yannis Mardas, he found employment as a television repairman. Dunbar later introduced Mardas to Brian Jones, after Mardas exhibited his &quot;Kinetic Light Sculptures&quot; at the Indica Gallery. Dunbar worked with Mardas on the &quot;psychedelic light box&quot; for the Rolling Stones&#x27; three-week tour of Europe in 1967, although they were not impressed with the results. Dunbar later said: &quot;He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing. He knew enough to know how to wind people up and to what extent. He was a fucking TV repairman: Yannis Mardas, none of this &#x27;Magic Alex&#x27; shit!&quot;

Jones introduced Mardas to Lennon, and it was at this point that Mardas impressed Lennon with the &quot;Nothing Box&quot;; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD. Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his &quot;new guru&quot;, calling him &quot;Magic Alex&quot;. Mardas allegedly told Lennon about ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was &quot;working on&quot;, which he later disavowed either promising or discussing: a telephone that responded to its owner&#x27;s voice and could identify who was calling, a force field that would surround the Beatles&#x27; homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers, which would actually be a part of the wallpaper. Mardas later asked for the V-12 engines from Lennon&#x27;s Rolls-Royce and George Harrison&#x27;s Ferrari Berlinetta car, so he could build a flying saucer. Mardas had denied these in a formal statement.

The Beatles set up a company for Mardas called Fiftyshapes Ltd. in September 1967; he later became one of the first employees of the newly formed Apple Corps, earning £40 a week (equivalent to £ in ). and receiving 10% of any profits made from his inventions.

The Beatles often called Mardas the &quot;Greek wizard&quot;, and Paul McCartney remembered being interested in his ideas: &quot;Well, if you [Mardas] could do that, we’d like one&quot;. It was always, &#x27;We&#x27;d like one. Mardas&#x27; ideas were not confined to the realms of electronic wizardry, but included songwriting involvement, with a Lennon–Mardas composition, &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot;, originally meant for inclusion on the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album (also known as the White Album). Lennon later removed Mardas&#x27; songwriting credit for unknown reasons.

Mardas was given his own laboratory called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped to obtain a British work visa. His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year (equivalent to £ in ), and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant&#x27;s coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I would like to say &#x27;Hello&#x27; to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics.&quot; Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: &quot;I&#x27;m a rock gardener, and now I&#x27;m doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant&quot;.

===Greece===
The Beatles had tried in 1964 to buy the Trinity Island, (Greek: Αγια Τριάδα), off the coast of the Greek island of Euboea (resembling a guitar in shape) but the owners were not interested in a sale. Lennon was still interested in buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967. Mardas&#x27; father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him the Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island, because many islands did not have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions. On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, Ringo Starr and Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas&#x27; parents&#x27; house overnight, until Lennon, along with Cynthia Lennon and their son Julian Lennon, McCartney and Jane Asher, Pattie Boyd&#x27;s 16-year-old sister Paula, Mal Evans and Alistair Taylor set off for Athens.

Their chartered yacht, the MV &quot;Arvi&quot;, was detained in Crete because of bad weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days. Taylor complained that on a trip to a small hill village, &quot;We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us&quot;, which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that while sailing around Greek islands, everybody just sat around and took LSD. They eventually found what is referred to as the island of Leslo (although no Greek island is officially known by this name). The island had a small fishing village, four beaches, and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (one for each Beatle). The Beatles sent Alistair Taylor back to London to handle the purchase of the island. Taylor received permission from the Greek government to purchase the island, and £90,000 of special &quot;export dollars&quot; required for the transaction were purchased. However, the Beatles changed their minds before the deal went through, and the export dollars were sold for a £11,400 profit a few months later when exchange rates went up (one of the few profitable business ventures for the Beatles).

===Apple Boutique and marriage===
On 1 August 1967, Mardas, Aspinall and Derek Taylor were invited by George Harrison to stay at the home of Robert Fitzpatrick on Blue Jay Way in Los Angeles, and on 7 August 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie visited San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district with Mardas. The Apple Boutique, at 94 Baker Street, London, was one of the first business ventures made by the Beatles&#x27; fledgling Apple Corps, and Mardas (at great expense) was commissioned to create one of his ideas: an &quot;artificial sun&quot; which would light up the night-time sky for the opening on 7 December 1967. When the time came for Mardas to demonstrate his artificial sun for the Beatles, he claimed that there was not a strong enough energy supply to power it; the Beatles accepted this explanation. Mardas appeared (uncredited) in the Beatles&#x27; TV movie &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC1 on Boxing Day in 1967. On 11 July 1968, 26-year-old Mardas married 22-year-old Eufrosyne Doxiades (the daughter of a respected Greek architect) at St Sophia&#x27;s Church, London. Harrison and his wife attended, and Lennon (who was there with Yoko Ono) was joint best man, along with Donovan.

===Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and India===
Mardas and Aspinall joined Lennon and Harrison in India, where they were studying meditation under the tutelage of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; Starr had returned to England complaining that the Indian food did not agree with him, and McCartney had left on 24 March 1968. When Mardas first met the Maharishi, sarcastically, &quot;I know you! Didn’t I meet you in Greece years ago?&quot;

Mardas was jealous of the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and during one of their frequent walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating a large part of their income to the Maharishi&#x27;s bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi&#x27;s teachings to the whole of India.

Alcohol was not allowed in the Maharishi&#x27;s ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later reported to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi had sex with a young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow&#x27;s autobiography &quot;What Falls Away&quot; (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was, making even Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: &quot;Well, it must be true, because if George is doubting him, there must be something in it&quot;. Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi&#x27;s answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some &quot;black magic&quot; on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.

Cynthia Lennon personally believed that Mardas invented the story about sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi&#x27;s influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon&#x27;s attention. Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney said that he did not believe the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot; denying that he had spread rumours.

===Lennon&#x27;s divorce===
After returning to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, Boyd, and her sister. Lennon said that he would be very busy recording what would become &quot;The White Album&quot; and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend Jenny Boyd, and others. Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Yoko Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring into each other&#x27;s eyes, and found Ono&#x27;s slippers outside the Lennons&#x27; marital bedroom door. Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had vomited in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) &quot;pushed him away&quot;. Brian Epstein&#x27;s personal assistant, Peter Brown, maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: &quot;She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex [Mardas], whom she had never trusted, nor even liked&quot;.

Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly afterward, telling Cynthia she could not go with them, so she went on a trip to Italy with her mother. During Cynthia&#x27;s holiday in Italy, an &quot;agitated&quot; Mardas unexpectedly arrived (pacing up and down outside her hotel until she returned) and gave the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia &quot;back to Hoylake&quot;. Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: &quot;The mere fact that Magic Alex [Mardas] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy for John [Lennon] and Yoko to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad&quot;.

===Apple Studio===

Mardas had often said that the Abbey Road studio was &quot;no good&quot;, much to producer George Martin&#x27;s annoyance: &quot;The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios to see what we were doing and to learn from it, while at the same time saying &#x27;These people are so out of date.&#x27; But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn&#x27;t, a minor schism developed&quot;. Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey which was being updated at the time to an so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas&#x27; more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr&#x27;s drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some &quot;huge&quot; surplus computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but &quot;they never left the barn&quot;, and were later sold as scrap metal.

Mardas gave the Beatles regular reports of his progress, but when they required their new studio in January 1969, during the &quot;Get Back&quot; project that became &quot;Let It Be&quot;, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin&#x27;s assistant, Dave Harries) like &quot;bits of wood and an old oscilloscope&quot;. The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was &quot;chaos&quot;, and that they had to &quot;rip it all out and start again,&quot; calling it &quot;the biggest disaster of all time.&quot; Harrison&#x27;s suspicions of Mardas&#x27; competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had &quot;just read the latest version of &quot;Science Weekly&quot;, and used its ideas&quot;. Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone. The Beatles asked producer Martin to come to the rescue, so he borrowed two portable four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles&#x27; engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a recording studio with the loaned equipment.

During these sessions, Mardas gave the Beatles a prototype of a combination rhythm guitar and bass that had a swivel neck. In the film &quot;The Beatles: Get Back,&quot; Lennon wondered how he would play guitar with the strings of the bass against his hand, and noted that it was impossible to tune.

After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles&#x27; manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas&#x27; ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£ in pounds if it was essentially spent in 1968). Starr once approved of one of Mardas&#x27; ideas: &quot;He [Mardas] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you&#x27;d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren&#x27;t interested at all.&quot;

According to author Peter Doggett, in the Beatles&#x27; history, Mardas is the only individual who occupies a place close to Klein&#x27;s in terms of vilification from commentators and biographers.

==Security consultant==
In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware. Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs, using the former King Constantine II of Greece as his principal salesman. Ex-King who at the time was exiled in provided contacts to several royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed Shah of Iran, who had moved to Mexico. The Shah was one of the first people interested in the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas’ companies.

In 1974, Mardas held an expensive party for the then-heir to the throne of Spain Prince Juan Carlos; this secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco the Spanish royal family thought it ought to acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in Chobham for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over £1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of &quot;Project Alcom&quot;) in St Albans Mews off Edgware Road, London, to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former Ministry of Defence official.

The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, but quickly discovered that they were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing guns at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which caused the fuel tank to explode, destroying the entire car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.
King Hussein of Jordan had a fleet of cars that Mardas customised, but carried out a safety test on them with live ammunition in November 1977. One eyewitness reported that the cars could be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the armour-plating, and the thick armoured glass broke into jagged splinters when struck. Hussein ordered that the cars be restored to their previous state. These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine to look at the growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce &quot;bullet-proof&quot; cars in 1978. This was financed by an investment of over £1 million through anonymous Monegasque and Swiss bank accounts, which were believed to be controlled by the Shah.

==The media and the courts==
On 28 February 1988, &quot;The Observer&quot; published an article naming Mardas as an arms dealer, but printed an apology on 30 April 1989. After an article on 18 September 1988 (&quot;Joan&#x27;s Secret Lover&quot;), and another a week later, &quot;The People&quot; newspaper was taken to court by Mardas, who won £75,000 in damages. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an apology and gave an undisclosed sum in damages on 16 January 2004, after an article on 11 June 2003, which accused Mardas of dealings that would later resurface in his claim against &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2008.

&quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper apologised on 21 August 2006, writing that on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas&#x27; involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had not been a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and had not been fired, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas &quot;did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a &#x27;sonic force field&#x27; or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors&quot;.

In 2008, Mardas won the right to sue &quot;The New York Times&quot; in England, in relation to an online article which said he was a charlatan. In a story about the Maharishi, Allan Kozinn had written: &quot;Alexis Mardas, a supposed inventor and charlatan who had become a Beatles&#x27; insider&quot;. After an appeal, Mardas won the right to continue his case of defamation against &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2009. After &quot;The New York Times&quot; produced a witness, Sir Harold Evans, who gave evidence supporting the journalistic responsibility of the paper, Mardas said he would not pursue the case further, on condition that the paper would publicly explain that by labelling him as a charlatan, it did not mean to imply that he was a con man. On 4 March 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an editor&#x27;s update to the 2008 article, saying: &quot;While expressing skepticism about his work as an inventor during that period, the article did not accuse Mr. Mardas of engaging in fraudulent dealings or criminality. ... &quot;The Times&quot;″s reporting on those events was attributed to Paul McCartney and based on widely published accounts from books and magazines&quot;.

==Later years and death==
Mardas put 15 items from his collection of Lennon memorabilia up for sale on 5 May 2004 at Christie&#x27;s in South Kensington, London. Among the sale was Lennon&#x27;s leather collar worn during 1967 and 1968 (at the launch party for the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; LP, and on the cover of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins&quot;), as well as a custom Vox Kensington guitar, a coloured felt pen drawing called &quot;Strong&quot;, and a pen and ink drawing by Lennon entitled &quot;Happy Fish&quot;. Mardas said he planned to donate the money to a charity in Greece. The &quot;custom Vox Kensington guitar&quot; later sold at an auction for £269,000 on 19 May 2013. Mardas lived in Athens until his death on 13 January 2017 at age 74 from pneumonia.

<text>Clarksville is a city and county seat of Red River County, Texas, United States, in the northernmost part of the Piney Woods region of East Texas. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,857.

==History==

Clarksville was established by James Clark, who moved to the area in 1833 and laid out a town site. When Red River County was organized in 1835, Clarksville was chosen as the county seat, beating out the community of La Grange (later named Madras). Isaac Smathers built one of the first houses, which was later owned by Charles DeMorse. The town was incorporated by an act of the Texas Congress in 1837, and within a few years it became an educational and agricultural center.

In 1841, John W.P. McKenzie, a Methodist minister, retired from serving as a missionary and moved to a former plantation approximately south-southwest of Clarksville. Naming his new home Itinerant&#x27;s Retreat, he soon began offering classes for boys who lived in the surrounding area. During that same year, 16 boys enrolled in classes in his home. There was more demand than he could accommodate in his home, so he had a log cabin to the plantation to serve as a more conventional school. As the enrollment grew, he added three large wooden buildings to serve as dormitories and opened the school to girls and boarding students. By 1854, McKenzie College had 300 students and 9 faculty members participating in a 10-month school year.

Before the American Civil War began, Rev. McKenzie&#x27;s school was the largest institution of higher education in Texas during the 1850s, and trained almost all of the new Methodist ministers in the state. Although the school was always considered a Methodist institution, it actually continued to be owned by McKenzie. He tried to turn it over to the local Methodist Conference in 1855 and 1860, but each time the Conference declined to accept certain unspecified conditions, so the official transfer never occurred.

By the fall of 1861, most of the male students had already enlisted in the Confederate Army. In 1863, the school had only 33 students. The average number rose to 74 during the years 1864–1867. Unable to obtain sufficient financing to continue, Rev. McKenzie closed the school permanently on June 25, 1868.

In 1844, Clarksville Female Academy opened, after moving from Pine Creek, where it was originally founded in 1840. A Clarksville post office opened in 1846, and by 1838 there was semiweekly mail service between Clarksville and Natchitoches, Louisiana.

A frame courthouse was built in 1840, and replaced with a brick structure on the main square in 1850. A brick jail was built nearby in 1852. The First Presbyterian Church was organized in Shiloh, Gregg County, Texas in 1838, but relocated to Clarksville in 1844. The Texas State Historical Society says this is &quot;...among the oldest continually operating Protestant churches in the state.&quot;

The Texas State Historical Society also reports that Clarksville was the most important commercial center in this part of Texas from the late 1830s until the Civil War. Once the Red River proved navigable by steamboats, goods could be shipped directly from New Orleans to Rowland&#x27;s Landing, north of Clarksville, then hauled overland by wagon. By the time the war broke out, the city had a population of about 900.

Economic recovery from the Civil War was stimulated when the Texas and Pacific Railway reached Clarksville in 1872, bringing new settlers and new businesses. The 1870 census showed a population of 613. By 1885, the population had grown to about 1,200. The city could then boast of a new limestone courthouse, five white and two black churches, a Catholic convent, three schools, two banks, two flour mills, and a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Clarksville Times&quot;.

In 1914, the city had 3,000 residents and had added a waterworks, two newspapers, an ice plant, and an electric power plant. After that, outside events such as two world wars, the Great Depression, and increased competition from other cities (e.g., Dallas, Paris, Bonham, and Texarkana) had begun to slow Clarksville&#x27;s growth. As shown by the census table, the population in 2000 was very near to that in 1920.

On November 4, 2022, a tornado outbreak occurred in Texas and Oklahoma, which produced a violent EF4 tornado near Clarksville.

==Geography==
Located northwest of Texarkana near the center of the county, it is at the junctions of U.S. Highway 82, State Highway 37, and Farm roads 114, 412, 909, 910, and 1159.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

<text>Pecos ( ) is the largest city in and the county seat of Reeves County, Texas, United States. It is in the valley on the west bank of the Pecos River at the eastern edge of the Chihuahuan Desert, in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas and just south of New Mexico&#x27;s border. Its population was 12,916 at the 2020 census. On January 24, 2012, Pecos City appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 as the second-fastest growing small town in the United States. The city is a regional commercial center for ranching, oil and gas production, and agriculture. The city is most recognized for its association with the local cultivation of cantaloupes. Pecos claims to be the site of the world&#x27;s first rodeo on July 4, 1883.

==History==
Pecos is one of the numerous towns in West Texas organized around a train depot during the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railway. These towns were subsequently linked by the construction of U.S. Highway 80 and Interstate 20. Prior to the arrival of the railroad, a permanent camp existed nearby where cattle drives crossed the Pecos River. With the introduction of irrigation from underground aquifers, the city became a center of commerce for extensive local agricultural production of cotton, onions, and cantaloupes. The introduction of large-scale sulfur mining in adjacent Culberson County during the 1960s led to significant economic and population growth. The growth was reversed after mining operations ceased in the 1990s.

In 1962, Pecos resident and tycoon Billie Sol Estes was indicted for fraud by a federal grand jury. Estes&#x27; extensive machinations caused a national-level scandal, resulting in a shakeup at the Department of Agriculture. Oscar Griffin, Jr., of the&quot; Pecos Independent and Enterprise&quot; newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking the story.

Pecos is the site of the largest private prison in the world, the Reeves County Detention Complex, operated by the GEO Group.

On December 18th 2024, a Union Pacific Railroad freight train hit a semi-truck that was hauling an oversize load, resulting in the train derailing with all locomotives, and some freight cars. Both crew members were killed and three were injured. The former Texas &amp; Pacific train depot, occupied by the town&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce, was damaged during the derailment.

==History==
Woodsboro is located in southwestern Refugio County, five miles southwest of the city of Refugio at the intersection of U.S. Highway 77 (Future Interstate 69E) and Farm to Market Road 2441. The town began as part of a land development project organized in 1906 by W. C. Johnson and George P. Pugh, experienced developers from Danville, Illinois. The town was originally called Church because it was located just north of the Church siding on the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway, which built through the area in 1906. The town site was laid out in November and December 1906, and by February 1907 Johnson and Pugh had completed the town&#x27;s first structure, a wooden hotel built to house prospective land buyers. (&quot;This is the Real Garden of the Lord,&quot; a large sign painted on the side of the hotel advised visitors.) A post office was established in the hotel later that year, and the town&#x27;s name was changed to Woodsboro after Captain Tobias D. Wood, who had sold the Bonnie View Ranch to the developers. The surrounding farmlands were praised in advertisements distributed across Texas and midwestern states, and a number of settlers began to move into the area. By 1908, when Woodsboro was officially platted, a school had been established, and the town already had grown to include about twenty-five buildings, including the hotel, a cotton gin, a lumberyard, and a number of dwellings. Other stores and a Masonic temple were quickly added, and in 1910 the town&#x27;s first newspaper, the Woodsboro Hustler, began publication. The Bank of Refugio opened a branch in Woodsboro in 1912, and in 1913 a contract was awarded to install electrical power and lights in the community. By 1914 there were about 500 people living in Woodsboro. The Commercial Club, a group of local businessmen organized soon after the town&#x27;s creation, actively worked to improve the community. The club organized the town&#x27;s first water works, which were turned over to the local government when Woodsboro incorporated in 1928.

An estimated 450 people lived in Woodsboro in 1925, but the town experienced a small boom after 1928, when oil was discovered nearby. As construction and oilfield workers moved into the area, Woodsboro&#x27;s population rapidly increased, rising to 1,286 by 1930. Though the town was touched by the Great Depression in the early 1930s, by the late 1930s oil activity had revived in the area, and the town continued to grow. By 1941 Woodsboro had thirty-five businesses and a population of 1,426. Though the number of farms in the area surrounding the city declined after World War II, the oil and gas industry helped to sustain the local economy until the county&#x27;s petroleum production dropped significantly during the 1980s. Woodsboro&#x27;s population was 1,829 in 1950 and 2,081 in 1960, then declined to 1,839 in 1970 before rising slightly to 1,974 in 1980. Woodsboro had fifty-two businesses in 1980, but by 1988 only thirty-three were reported in the town. In 1990 there were 1,731 residents.

<text>Bremond ( ) is a city in Robertson County, Texas, United States. The population was 858 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Bremond is named for Paul Bremond (1810–1885), entrepreneur and founder of the Houston, East and West Texas Railroad 1875, who owned the surrounding land. Years later, the new owner, cotton baron William Marsh Rice, whose first wife was Bremond&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, had the town surveyed and named after Bremond. The town was incorporated in 1870. In the 1870s a large number of Polish immigrants came to the area to grow cotton. Bremond holds an annual festival yearly to celebrate its Polish heritage.

In 1878, local resident Francis Marion Wootan discovered that the local water had a high mineral content. Following a popular trend at the time, Wootan began bottling the water and marketing it for its curing properties. Wootan Wells soon became a popular resort community, with four hotels and hundreds of support staff. (See also Mineral Wells, Texas)

In 1916, fire devastated the community, dealing a heavy blow to Wootan Wells also. Flooding and drought also contributed to the decline of the town, and in 1921 another fire shut down Wootan Wells permanently.

Texas Highway 6 was once routed through Bremond coming into town with Texas Highway 14 and took a sharp turn to the left in the town onto what is now Farm to Market Road 46. Highway 6 was later realigned and bypassed Bremond to the west. Where Texas Highway 6 intersects Farm to Market Road 46 if you look to the right coming south and to the left going north you can still see part of the curve that the original highway made to go into Bremond from the north.

<doc id="136527" wikidata="Q981815" url="?curid=136527" title="Calvert, Texas">
<text>Calvert is a city in Robertson County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 970. It is located approximately halfway between Waco and Bryan-College Station at the intersection of Texas State Highway 6 and Farm to Market Roads 979 and 1644, on the Southern Pacific line, nine miles north of Hearne, in west central Robertson County. For the last 35 years, Calvert has enjoyed a relative success as an antique &quot;capital&quot;. The town is named for Robert Calvert, an early settler who served in the Texas Legislature representing Robertson and Milam counties.

==History==

===Founding &amp; coming of the railroads===
The earliest known white settler in the area was Joseph Harlan, whose 1837 land grant laid five miles south of what is now the City of Calvert. In 1850, Robert Calvert, for whom the town was named, established a plantation west of the town. Calvert, who was a former Texas Representative and area farmer urged the Houston and Texas Central Railway to build through the area. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad agreed to stop in the town, at the encouragement of town leaders, in 1868.

In January 1868, a group of investors purchased land at the townsite and platted the community; by February of that year, merchants from the nearby communities including Sterling and Owensville were uprooting and moving to the community. A post office also opened in Calvert in 1868. The first trains arrived in Calvert in 1869, and the town was incorporated the next year with an aldermanic form of municipal government. Although the Stroud family owned most of the land, the town was named for Robert Calvert because he was a driving force behind getting the railroad to stop in the town. The order of election for the incorporation of Calvert was issued July 5, 1869, but a majority actually voted against incorporation. This election was set aside because it was believed that &quot;a fair expression of the qualified voters was not had,&quot; and a new election was held Saturday, July 24, 1869, a majority voted for incorporation, and the town was ordered incorporated on August 13, 1869.

After the railroad made Calvert the major trading center of the area, it was reported that: It was a common sight to see six or eight wagons drawn by oxen slowly passing through the one and only street of these towns en route to Houston to dispose of their cotton. These wagons averaged ten miles a day. The team-masters usually owned their teams and were paid so much per hundred pounds for hauling freight.

===Named as county seat===
In 1870, as Reconstruction sparked political maneuvering in Robertson County, the former county seat of Owensville was replaced by Calvert. The town had been briefly occupied by federal troops early in 1870. Just nine years later, however, the voters of Robertson County voted to move the county seat to nearby Morgan, now named Franklin.

===Development and decline===
By 1871, the town claimed to have the largest cotton gin in the world. However, sources differ on when, exactly, the gin was built. The &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; cites the 1871 date, while a 1931 &quot;Frontier Times&quot; piece on Calvert places the building of the gin by John H. Gibson as 1876. Eventually, P.C. and J.H. Gibson, Jr., took over the gin. It had 21 stands and a connected oil mill. The gin served a significant portion of the Brazos River bottoms. A total of 32,000 bales were reported received in 1882.

In 1873 a severe yellow fever epidemic killed many in the community, severely depopulating the town. An early judge, in speaking about the epidemic, noted: The disease was brought to town by a traveling printer from Louisiana where the fever was raging. He took a room over the restaurant in the Bailey building and died there. As many persons as could made an exodus before the town was quarantined. We lost between three and four hundred persons. The fever was a terrible epidemic, and our people suffered because we did not know how to treat the disease. The trains were not allowed to stop in Calvert then and the windows of the coaches were closed until they were far out of town.A county jail was built in 1875. By 1878, Calvert had 52 businesses. Today, the city of Calvert still exists as a Texas municipality. As of 2016, the town&#x27;s mayor is Marcus D. Greaves.

===Modern controversies===
In December 2010, all three members of the town&#x27;s police department resigned over a conflict with the city council.

In June 2015, a TV station reported that cities of Calvert, Franklin, Hearne and Lott, in a &quot;Texas Triangle&quot;, were using their police departments to issue numerous speeding tickets to turn their municipal court into a &quot;cash cow&quot;.

<text>Hearne ( ) is a city in Robertson County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 4,544. The city is named for a family that settled in the area in the 19th century and promoted the construction of rail lines through the city.

==History==

===Founding===
Hearne is located on land that initially belonged to politician and soldier José Francisco Ruiz. By the 1840s, a tavern was located there and it also served as a general store and post office. The Hearne family moved to the area in the 1850s, purchasing 10,000 acres and operating cotton plantations. Christopher C. Hearne wanted a railroad line built through the area, but the Civil War started before the railroad could be constructed. His widow later gave 700 acres to the Houston and Texas Central Railway.

With the construction of a depot in Hearne in 1868, businesses began to open, including a hotel, saloons, churches and a cotton gin. Two rail lines met in Hearne by the 1870s. Hearne&#x27;s population was 2,129 in 1900 and 3,511 in 1940. Between 1943 and 1946, a prison camp operated near the city limits and held several thousand German prisoners of war. Agricultural and manufacturing businesses came to Hearne by the 1960s. By 1990, over 5,000 people lived in Hearne; the population was 4,690 in 2000.

===Wal-Mart closure===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1990, the Wal-Mart in Hearne closed. After closure, the store was converted into the current Hearne High School. Merchants in downtown Hearne by that time had already folded their businesses because they were unable to compete with Wal-Mart. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that out of more than 1,500 Wal-Mart stores in the nation, the Hearne store was one of six that had closed.

===Drug sweeps and ACLU lawsuit===
In November 2000, 15 African-American residents of Hearne, Texas, were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of &quot;drug sweeps&quot;. The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit, &quot;Kelly v. Paschall,&quot; on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne&#x27;s male African American population aged 18 to 34 (and at least one woman) were arrested based on the &quot;uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases.&quot; The government had promised the informant leniency on a burglary charge and one hundred dollars in cash in exchange for each suspect he helped convict.

On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and Robertson County announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which &quot;both sides stated that they were satisfied with.&quot; District Attorney John Paschall dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit. He also admitted that the witness had tampered with evidence and failed a polygraph test.
A movie, &quot;American Violet&quot;, was made about the incident.

===Shooting of Pearlie Golden===

In May 2014, protesters demonstrated against the shooting of a 93-year-old woman named Pearlie Golden by the Hearne Police Department. After Officer Stephen Stem responded to a disturbance at Golden&#x27;s residence, police officials said that Golden had discharged a firearm into the ground twice. Stem shot Golden three times, resulting in Golden&#x27;s death.

The officer had been on the police force since 2012 and it was his second fatal shooting. Stem was placed on leave and Hearne mayor Ruben Gomez recommended Stem&#x27;s firing. He was terminated by a unanimous city council vote. Stem&#x27;s attorney said that some community members had turned a safety issue into one focused on age, race and gender.

<doc id="136530" wikidata="Q1060967" url="?curid=136530" title="RTFM">
<text>RTFM is an initialism and internet slang for the expression &quot;read the fucking manual&quot;typically used to reply to a basic question where the answer is easily found in the documentation, user guide, owner&#x27;s manual, man page, online help, internet forum, software documentation or FAQ. 

Usage is variously viewed as a pointed reminder of etiquette to try to find a solution before posting to a mass forum or email alias; helping a newer user (colloquially and demeaningly referred to as a noob within internet culture) to improve themselves; as a useless response; or as a hostile and elitist response. Polite usages would mention where one has looked when asking a question, and to provide an exact location or link where exactly to RTFM. 

In expurgated texts, substitutions such as &quot;read the frickn&#x27; manual&quot;, &quot;read the factory manual&quot;, &quot;read the field manual&quot;, &quot;read the flaming manual&quot;, &quot;read the fine manual&quot;, &quot;read the friendly manual&quot;, &quot;read the [pause] manual&quot; or similar variants are used.

If there is no appropriate content in the manual but the answer is frequently seen in the forum, a similar response in internet culture might be to Lurk moar, meaning to observe the forum for a time before asking questions.

A related phrase is &quot;let me Google that for you&quot; (LMGTFY). In this case, the &quot;manual&quot; is the World Wide Web, so one of several search engines such as Google could be used to look up the answer. In many cases, doing so provides an answer in less time than it takes to ask someone else the question. The range of usage is similar to that for RTFM.

==List of similar initialisms==
* – &quot;read the bloody manual&quot;
* – &quot;read the fucking question&quot;
* – &quot;read the fucking/featured article&quot;– common on news forums such as Fark and Slashdot, where using &quot;TFA&quot; instead of &quot;the article&quot; has become a meme
* – &quot;write a better manual&quot; – an answer complaining that the manual is not written well
* – &quot;read the fucking source&quot; or &quot;read the fucking standard&quot; or &quot;read the fucking syllabus&quot;
* – &quot;read the fucking binary&quot;
* – &quot;search the fucking web&quot;

<text>Fate is a city located in the center of Rockwall County, Texas, United States. The population in 2020 was 17,958, an increase from 6,357 in 2010, and 602 in 2000. In 2022, Fate&#x27;s population was estimated to have grown to just under 23,000.

== History ==
The City of Fate has a unique name and history. The name of the town is thought to have come from one of two of the towns influential residents, either William Lafayette Brown or GW Lafayette Peyton, both of whom were nicknamed &quot;Fate&quot; and lived in the area during the 1860s. At that time, land ownership, a post office, and the railroad played a vital role in the naming of the City of Fate. The town was settled shortly after the Civil War and was originally located 1.5 miles to the north of Downtown Fate&#x27;s current location today. The town of Barnes, named after a Dr. Wiley Turner Barnes, was developed where Fate&#x27;s current Downtown is located. A post office was established in Fate on July 13, 1880, with Harvey Peyton White as its postmaster. As the area continued to develop, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT) Railroad was constructed in 1886 and ran through Barnes. This brought rapid growth to the area and spurred both Fate and Barnes to combine into one town on February 11, 1887, in order to allow residents access to postal services and the railroad. During the late 1800s Fate prospered. The town grew to include four doctors, two cotton gins, two grocery stores, a barbershop, a butcher, a confectionary, a grain elevator, and a newspaper called The Fate Review. In the early 1900s the town experienced several tragedies. In 1906 a fire engulfed the south side of the city&#x27;s business district. Because there was no fire station nearby, this caused considerable damage to the businesses. In 1910 another fire destroyed the north side of the town. The great depression of the 1930s caused economic hardship to farmers in the area and forced many to lose their land. In 1933 more tragedy struck as a tornado destroyed parts of the town. As the population began to dwindle, the churches in Fate decided to combine into one united church, which brought citizens together and formed a tight-knit Christian community. In the 1940s during World War II, Fate had lost all its mail routes, its school became a one-teacher school, and the railroad depot was sold to Dallas&#x27; Old City Park. By 1950, the population had decreased to a mere 150 people, causing Fate&#x27;s school to shut down and send its students to the Royse City Independent School District or the Rockwall Independent School District. However, using the lumber from the old school house, Fate residents built a Community Center, which is still in use, and was recently renovated, in Downtown Fate. After the 1960s, Fate finally began grow again. In the 1970s, a neighborhood called Woodcreek began to be developed. In the 1980s more technology, such as the telephone and 911-system contributed to additional growth. By the 1990s Fate&#x27;s population had grown to 475 with a grocery store, upholstery, printer, and restaurants calling the town home. New subdivisions and developments continued to cause the population of Fate to boom in the early 2000s. In 2000 Fate&#x27;s population was barely over 600. Now, in 2022 the population of the City of Fate&#x27;s population is estimated to have come close to 23,000.

Persons age 25 or older who graduated high school was 95.8%, with 44.6% of those adults holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

== Education ==

Fate is served by the Rockwall Independent School District in the southern and western portions of the city and the Royse City Independent School District in the northern and eastern portions. Royse City ISD provides three campuses in Fate; Miss May Vernon Elementary School, Harry H Herndon Elementary School and Bobby Summers Middle School.

The Rockwall ISD has two elementary campuses. Billie Stevenson Elementary School, which opened at the start of the 2013–2014 school year and is located in the city&#x27;s Woodcreek subdivision. As well as, Lupe Garcia Elementary, which opened at the start of the 2021–2022 school year and is located in the Williamsburg subdivision.

Royse City ISD will open Fate&#x27;s first high school since 1933 located in the northern section of Fate off of FM 552. Worthy Fate High School is set to open in August 2027. The district&#x27;s Facility Naming Committee reviewed more than 440 name suggestions from the Royse City ISD community in the process of selecting a name and mascot for the school. The new campus, approved in a May 2023 Bond Referendum, is set to open in August 2027. Current planning would allow the school to open with freshmen and sophomores and grow into a 9-12th grade school by 2030. Royse City ISD plans to break ground on the new campus in the Spring of 2024. The campus’ offerings will reflect that of Royse City High School with career and tech programs, dual credit programs, associate degrees, ag facilities, fine arts and athletic facilities. After studying existing district and school brands, exploring a competitive logo analysis and reviewing five color combinations the group came to a consensus. The district&#x27;s second high school will be the Worthy Fate High School Wolverines with navy and vegas gold colors. WFHS will open with freshmen and sophomore students in its first year.

==Site of remarriage of Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s widow==
The town made national news in 1965 when Marina Oswald, the widow of accused presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, remarried a little more than 18 months after her husband&#x27;s slaying. Electronics worker Kenneth Porter and she worked at eluding reporters, who had learned of the engagement, and traveled to Fate to be wed by Carl Leonard Jr., a justice of the peace.

<text>McLendon-Chisholm is a city in Rockwall County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,373 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

McLendon-Chisholm is situated along State Highway 205 in south central Rockwall County, approximately six miles southeast of Rockwall.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (0.90%) is covered by water.

==History==
The community of McLendon-Chisholm began as two separate settlements: McLendon and Chisholm.

===McLendon===
Named for landowner P.A. McLendon, the community of McLendon was settled around 1870. He built a combination store, cotton gin, and blacksmith shop that remained in operation until 1975. A post office opened in 1880, and by 1896, McLendon was home to an estimated 150 residents. The post office closed in 1905. Throughout the early 20th century, the population hovered around 50.

===Chisholm===
The land that eventually became the site of Chisholm was given to Mexican War veteran King Latham in 1847. Enoch Parson Chisholm and his brother B. Frank Chisholm, from whom the community&#x27;s name was derived, purchased from Latham in 1856. A few years later, Enoch purchased an additional for $2.00/acre. He organized the Chisholm Methodist Church in 1871 and the community of Chisholm was officially platted in 1886. In that same year, Berry Creek Academy was formed through the merger of two local schools. Chisholm&#x27;s first store opened in 1890 and a post office was established in 1891. By 1898, Berry Creek Academy was the second-largest school in Rockwall County, boasting a total enrollment of 301 students. The Chisholm post office closed in 1905, but the community continued to grow. The population was estimated at 102 in 1904 and peaked around 200 in 1940. By the 1960s, that figure had dropped to around 167.

===Incorporation===
On October 18, 1969, the two communities incorporated as McLendon-Chisholm. Residents seeking zoning protection and the preservation of their rural lifestyles was the main reason behind the incorporation effort. By the mid-1970s, the city had approximately 170 residents. That number rapidly grew to 480 in the 1980s and 646 by the 1990 census. By 2000, the population had increased to 914, a 41 percent increase over the 1990 figure.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,562 people, 1,164 households, and 1,003 families residing in the city.

==Education==
The City of McLendon-Chisholm is served by the Rockwall Independent School District.

<doc id="136535" wikidata="Q250843" url="?curid=136535" title="Primogeniture">
<text>Primogeniture () is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate child to inherit the parent&#x27;s entire or main estate in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative. In most contexts, it means the inheritance of the firstborn son (agnatic primogeniture); it can also mean by the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture), or firstborn child (absolute primogeniture).

Its opposite analogue is partible inheritance.

==Description==
The common definition given is also known as male-line primogeniture, the classical form popular in European jurisdictions among others until into the 20th century. In the absence of male-line offspring, variations were expounded to entitle a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g., male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture). Variations have tempered the traditional, sole-beneficiary, right (such as French appanage) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute male-preference primogeniture). Most monarchies in Europe have eliminated this, including: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The exceptions are Spain and Monaco (male-preference primogeniture) along with Liechtenstein (agnatic primogeniture).

English primogeniture endures mainly in titles of nobility: any first-placed direct male-line descendant (e.g. eldest son&#x27;s son&#x27;s son) inherits the title before siblings and similar, this being termed &quot;by right of substitution&quot; for the deceased heir; secondly where children were only daughters they would enjoy the fettered use (life use) of an equal amount of the underlying real asset and the substantive free use (such as one-half inheritance) would accrue to their most senior-line male descendant or contingent on her marriage (moieties); thirdly, where the late estate holder had no descendants his oldest brother would succeed, and his descendants would likewise enjoy the rule of substitution where he had died. The effect of English primogeniture was to keep estates undivided wherever possible and to disinherit real property from female relations unless only daughters survived in which case the estate thus normally results in division. The principle has applied in history to inheritance of land as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Other forms of inheritance in monarchies have existed or continue. Currently, succession to the Saudi Arabian throne uses a form of lateral agnatic seniority, as did the Kievan Rus&#x27; (see Rota system), the early Kingdom of Scotland (see Tanistry), the Mongol Empire (see lateral succession) or the later Ottoman Empire (see succession practices). 

Some monarchies have (at least in principle) no element of heredity in their laws of succession at all and monarchs are elected. The Holy Roman Emperor was chosen by a small number of powerful prince electors from among Imperial magnates, while kings of Poland-Lithuania were elected directly by the nobility. Intermediate arrangements also exist, such as restricting eligible candidates to members of a dynasty (as is currently done in Cambodia).

Research shows that authoritarian regimes that rely on primogeniture for succession were more stable than forms of authoritarian rule with alternative succession arrangements. Scholars have linked primogeniture to a decline in regicide, as clear rules of succession reduce the number of people who could (absent a coup d&#x27;état) replace a ruler, thus making it less desirable to cause the death of the monarch.

==Order of succession in monarchies==



===Absolute primogeniture===

&quot;Absolute&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;, &quot;(full) cognatic&quot; or &quot;lineal primogeniture&quot; is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance; the oldest surviving child without regard to sex inherits the throne. Mathematically this is a depth-first search.

====History====
No monarchy implemented this form of primogeniture before 1980, when Sweden amended its Act of Succession to adopt it in royal succession. This displaced King Carl XVI Gustaf&#x27;s infant son, Prince Carl Philip, in favor of his elder daughter, Princess Victoria. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the Netherlands in 1983, Norway in 1990 (not retroactively), Belgium in 1991, Denmark in 2009, Luxembourg in 2011. In 2011, the governments of the 16 Commonwealth realms which have a common monarch—Elizabeth II at that date—announced the Perth Agreement, a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture. This came into effect with the necessary legislation on 26 March 2015. Other monarchies have considered changing to absolute primogeniture:
* With the birth of Infanta Leonor of Spain on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent Felipe, Prince of Asturias, and Princess Letizia, the Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero&#x27;s proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative &quot;Partido Popular&quot;, making its passage probable. However, Zapatero&#x27;s administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding governments have not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters&#x27; continued status as dynasts; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father&#x27;s abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir.
* In July 2006, the Nepalese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture, but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In Japan, it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as Princess Aiko is the only child of Emperor Naruhito. However, the birth in 2006 of Prince Hisahito, a son of Prince Akishino (the younger brother of Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne) has suspended the debate.

Monaco, the Netherlands, and Norway also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of kinship to the most recent monarch.

===Agnatic primogeniture===

Agnatic primogeniture or patrilineal primogeniture is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or head of family, with sons inheriting before brothers, and male-line male descendants inheriting before collateral male relatives in the male line, and to the total exclusion of females and descendants through females. This exclusion of females from dynastic succession is also referred to as application of the Salic law.

===Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture===

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or &quot;agnatic-cognatic primogeniture&quot;, which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line of the particular legislator. Such were the cases of Bourbon Spain until 1833 and the dominions of Austria-Hungary, as well as most realms within the former Holy Roman Empire, i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of Russia under the Pauline Laws of 1797 and of Luxembourg until absolute primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning consanguinity or proximity of blood the dynasty&#x27;s house law defines who among female relatives is &quot;nearest&quot; to the last male.

===Male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture===

Male-preference primogeniture (in the past called cognatic primogeniture) provides that a dynast&#x27;s sons and their lines of descent all come before the dynast&#x27;s daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. It accords succession to the throne to a female member of a dynasty if and only if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. Then, older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines, thus a daughter inherits before her uncle and his descendants.

It was practised in the succession to the once-separate thrones of Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, then in the Kingdom of Great Britain, and then the United Kingdom until 2015, when the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (effective March 26, 2015) changed it to absolute primogeniture (to the eldest legitimate child, regardless of sex). This rule change was simultaneously adopted by the other Commonwealth realms that have the same monarch as their head of state. With respect to hereditary titles, it is usually the rule everywhere in Scotland and baronies by writ in the United Kingdom, but usually these baronies by writ go into abeyance when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder. In England, Fiefs or titles granted &quot;in tail general&quot; or to &quot;heirs general&quot; follow this system for sons, but daughters are considered equal co-heirs to each other, which can result in abeyance. In the medieval period, actual practice varied with local custom. While women could inherit manors, power was usually exercised by their husbands (&quot;jure uxoris&quot;) or their sons (&quot;jure matris&quot;). However, in Scotland, Salic law or any of its variations have never been practised, and all the hereditary titles are inherited through male-preference primogeniture, where in the extinction of a male line, the eldest sister automatically receives the titles, and rules in her own right, not in the right of her son. A famous example of this is Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, mother of Robert the Bruce, who was the Countess of Carrick in her own right.

A similar system was practised in many of the kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent from the Middle Ages to the Indian independence movement. In many of these kingdoms, adoption was allowed from a relative if a monarch did not have children, and the adopted child could succeed to the throne at the death of the monarch. (Shahu I adopted Rajaram II who ruled as king and he in turn adopted Shahu II who ruled as the next king. Princess Bharani Thirunal Parvathy Bayi, the mother of the reigning Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore, had been adopted). Often, the wife or mother of a childless king were allowed to succeed to the throne as well and allowed to rule as queen regnants in their own right, until their death, after which the throne passed to the next closest relative. An early example of this is Queen Didda of Kashmir, who ascended the throne of Kashmir in 980 CE after the death of her grandson and ruled until 1003 CE. Another example is Qudsia Begum who became the Nawab of Bhopal in 1819 CE after the death of her husband and ruled until 1837 CE. Other famous queens include Rudrama Devi, Keladi Chennamma, Ahilyabai Holkar, Velu Nachiyar and Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. Razia Sultana was a rare example of a queen who succeeded her father even when her brothers were alive. She was the reigning queen of the Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240 CE.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practised in succession to the thrones of Monaco (since 1454) and Spain (before 1700 and since 1830).

===Matrilineal primogeniture===

&quot;Matrilineal primogeniture&quot; is a form of succession in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the exclusion of males. 

The Rain Queen of the Balobedu nation has been cited as an example of matrilineal primogeniture. Since 1800, the Balobedu Royal Council has appointed only female descendants to the queenship. The position has been unoccupied and stewarded by a regent since the death of Makobo Modjadji, the most recent Rain Queen, in 2005. The Balobedu Royal Council has not published information concerning its succession norms, but among the Limpopo tribe, it was widely expected that the late Rain Queen&#x27;s daughter, Masalanabo, would succeed to the queenship upon turning 18. A ceremony to celebrate her anticipated queenship was officially held in 2018. In May 2021, however, the Royal Council announced that Masalanabo would instead be appointed &quot;khadi-kholo&quot; (great aunt). The late queen&#x27;s son, Lekukela was installed in October 2022, becoming the first Rain King since the 18th century.

In Kerala, southern India, a custom known as Marumakkathayam was practiced by the Nair nobility, the Malabar Muslims and royal families. Through this system, descent and the inheritance of property were passed from the maternal uncle to nephews or nieces. The right of the child was with the maternal uncle or the mother&#x27;s family rather than the father or the father&#x27;s family. Through this bloodline, surnames, titles, properties, and everything of the child are inherited from his uncle or mother. Almost all the kingdoms in Kerala practised this system, including the Kingdom of Calicut, Kingdom of Cochin, the kingdom of Kolathunadu and the Kingdom of Valluvanad, to name a few. The Arakkal kingdom followed a similar matrilineal system of descent: the eldest member of the family, whether male or female, became its head and ruler; the male rulers were called Ali Rajah and female rulers were called as Arakkal Beevis. Usually after one king, his nephew through his sister succeeded to the throne, and his own son receives a courtesy title but has no place in the line of succession. In the absence of nephews, nieces could also succeed to the kingdom, as in the case of Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi who was the queen regnant from 1810 to 1813. Since Indian Independence and the passing of several acts such as the Hindu Succession Act (1956), this form of inheritance is no longer recognised by law. Regardless, the pretender to the Travancore throne is still determined by matrilinear succession.

The Akans of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, West Africa have similar matrilineal succession and as such Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II, Asantehene inherited the Golden Stool (the throne) through his mother (the Asantehemaa) Nana Afia Kobi Serwaa Ampem II.

==Preference for males==
The preference for males in most systems of primogeniture (and in other mechanisms of hereditary succession) comes mostly from the perceived nature of the tasks and role of the monarch: a monarch/prince (the latter means in Latin, chieftain) most usually was, first and foremost, a military leader, as in the Book of Numbers.

Social norms pointing to kings further flow from making clear, first-generation survivors, so to avoid civil war. Lacking advanced healthcare and resource-conscious family planning, mothers faced high risk in enduring such regular childbirth. Also in pre-20th century medicine about 10% of women could not have children. Added to this, on any necessary remarriage from death in childbirth, the king would have socially entrenched powers over his new spouse: financial and any rivalry of a new queen consort by her personal and companions&#x27; physical strength was within the chivalric norm far-fetched so far as it might present a challenge to her ruling husband, if proving relatively able. Times of turbulence were more likely when a queen regnant/female main heir allowed to inherit was married to or remarried to a similar-status foreign leader, as was conventional for high-status women for their family security and diplomacy. Such a situation was a major source of civil wars; one example is the Spanish Armada. Henry VIII of England did not wait until death and remarried twice on the basis of lack of producing a male heir, on the second occasion beheading his queen &quot;for witchcraft&quot;. A small minority of monarchs in many countries have openly made their heir an illegitimate child; stories abound of others as newborns brought to the expectant queen consort such as to James II of England &quot;in a bedpan.&quot; Under any of these considerations, sons, some of whose lives were in times of war likely to be lost in battle, could be expected to produce more heirs. Eldest daughters could find themselves under a situation of duress on remarriage, and the concept of the trophy bride if the husband were slain is one resonant in many cultures especially before the 20th century.

In Japan, the Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses from ancient times up through the Edo period; however, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained. Japanese empresses such as Empress Genshō (680–748), who succeeded her mother the Empress Gemmei (661–721) on the throne (but only because she was a Princess of the Imperial family, daughter of Prince Kusakabe), remain the sole exceptions to this conventional argument.

==Arguments==
===Arguments in favour===
Primogeniture by definition prevents the subdivision of estates. This lessens family pressures to sell property, such as if two (or more) children inherit a house and cannot afford to buy out the other(s).

In much of Europe younger sons of the nobility had no prospect of inheriting by death any property, and commonly sought careers in the Church, in military service (see purchase of commissions in the British Army), or in government. Some wills made bequests to a monastic order for an already suitably educated, disinherited son.

Many of the Spanish Conquistadors were younger sons who had to make their fortune in war. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, many younger sons of English aristocrats chose to leave England for Virginia in the Colonies. Many of the early Virginians who were plantation owners were younger sons of landed gentry who had left Britain and Ireland fortuneless due to primogeniture. These were key ancestors of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America.

===Arguments against===

In &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, Alexis de Tocqueville observes that abolition of primogeniture and entail as to property results in faster division of land. However, primogeniture, in forcing landless people to seek wealth outside the family estate to maintain their standard of living accelerated the death of the landed aristocracy and, in his view, thus, quickened the shift to democracy.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the Catholic Church originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. Its teachings forbid polygamy and state divorce is an impossibility &quot;per se&quot;. Consequently, in Europe, given morbidity and infertility, succession could not be assured solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In Islamic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned polygyny, use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

===Biblical===

The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of Isaac&#x27;s sons Esau, who was born first, and Jacob, who was born second. Esau was entitled to the &quot;birthright&quot; (&quot;bekhorah&quot; בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a mess of pottage, i. e. a small amount of lentil stew. This passage demonstrates that primogeniture was known in the Middle East prior to the Roman Empire.

A woman&#x27;s right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family was recorded in the case of the Daughters of Zelophehad in Numbers 27.

===Roman law===
During the Roman Empire, Roman law governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died intestate. Although admission to the two highest &quot;ordines&quot; (orders), i.e. the senators and equestrians, potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used. Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the &quot;ordines&quot; merely by hereditary succession or title to land. Although the eldest son typically carried his father&#x27;s name in some form, he was expected to construct his own career based on competence as an administrator or general and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court. Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the &quot;dignitas&quot; (&quot;esteem&quot;) that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as &quot;vir illustris&quot;, that were not inherited.

Most Roman emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the Praetorian Guard. Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent &quot;right&quot; to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate&#x27;s symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in Medieval Europe where the feudal system necessitated that the estates of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and as united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.

Adam Smith, in his book &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot;, explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

===Salic law===

Also known as agnatic primogeniture, is a system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch&#x27;s principal possessions. Generally known in western Europe as an application of the &quot;Salic law&quot;. This rule developed among successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, Joan, the only surviving child of Louis X of France, was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, Philip, Count of Poitiers. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of Charles IV, his paternal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, became king, notwithstanding the claims of Edward III of England. By proximity of blood, Edward was closest related as eldest son of the sister of Charles, Isabella. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent Hundred Years War. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century &quot;Pactus Legis Salicae&quot;, which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the throne, as a governing rule for the French succession. Although Salic law excludes female lines, it also mandates partible inheritance, rather than primogeniture. This rule developed among successions in France in the later Middle Ages. 

In the lands of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s conquests, Salic law was adopted, including the French Empire, the Kingdom of Westphalia and the Kingdom of Holland. Other states adopted Salic primogeniture as well, including Belgium, Sweden, Denmark (in 1853) and all of the eastern European monarchies except Greece, i.e. Albania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia. During this era, Spain (in the Carlist conflicts) fought a civil war which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

====British titles of nobility====

Many English nobility descend by Salic, male primogeniture so have a greater average rate of extinction. For many other titles, if the male line ceases to exist, the title automatically passes to the closest elder sister and her descendants. It could sometimes also pass through a line of descendants to the last holder, as abeyant holders, until they become parents or ancestors to a male descendant who is first born to &#x27;settle the abeyance&#x27;. Some senior agnatic cadets are granted from the outset courtesy or subsidiary titles. Notable English exceptions are the Duchy of Lancaster, which is merged with the British Crown which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century, and the Dukedom of Marlborough, which has done so since its establishment in 1702. 

However, in Scotland, Salic law has never been practised, and all the hereditary titles are inherited through male-preference primogeniture, where in the extinction of a male line, the eldest sister automatically receives the titles, and rules in her own right, not in the right of her son. A famous example of this is Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, mother of Robert the Bruce, who was the Countess of Carrick in her own right.

===Quasi-Salic law===
During the High Medieval period, there arose a trend where the extinction of agnatic lineages forced the consideration of women&#x27;s claims; nevertheless, the desire for a male heir saw the women themselves excluded from the succession in favor of their sons, so that women could transmit claims but not inherit themselves. Such a system was called &quot;quasi-Salic&quot;. In 1317, to illegitimize Joan II of Navarre&#x27;s claim on France, Philip V of France declared &quot;women do not succeed to the throne of France&quot;. In 1328, Philip&#x27;s successor, Charles IV of France, also died sonless; Charles&#x27; sister, Isabella of France, claimed the throne not for herself, but through her to her son, Edward. However, Philip VI of France took the throne and added another rule to illegitimize Edward, that being – one cannot transmit a right that one does not possess.

A variation of this form of primogeniture allowed the sons of female dynasts to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the Francoist succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947–1978.

===Historical examples===


A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the French royal &quot;milieu&quot;, where the Salic Law (attributed to the Salian Franks) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the dispute over the legitimate successor of John I of France, the short-lived son of deceased Louis X of France in favour of Philip V of France (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over Joan II of Navarre (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the ruling that &quot;Women do not succeed the kingdom of France&quot;. In 1328 it was further elaborated to solve the dispute over the legitimate successor of Philip V&#x27;s brother, Charles IV of France, in favour of Philip VI of France (the son of Charles&#x27; uncle Charles of Valois) over Edward III of England (the son of Charles&#x27; sister Isabella). While Edward had a stronger claim by proximity of blood, the court ruled &quot;Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess&quot;, reinforcing agnatic primogeniture. This dispute was among the factors behind the Hundred Years&#x27; War, which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of Carlism in Spain and Miguelism in Portugal.

The crowns of Hanover and Great Britain, which had been in personal union since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King William IV: his niece Victoria inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William&#x27;s eldest surviving brother, Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover.

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both subject to semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the Nassau House Treaty of 1783, which declared each prince of the House of Nassau to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)Nassau-Dietz, which was given in exchange to William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange, in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became King William I of the Netherlands. In 1890, William I&#x27;s agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant Queen Wilhelmina, whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-Duke Adolf of Nassau, who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the personal union of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the quasi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on male-preference primogeniture: A lord was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters. In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, ruling in right of his wife (&quot;jure uxoris&quot;), though on her death the title would not remain with him but pass to her heir.

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of proximity of blood and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The Burgundian succession in 1361 was resolved in favor of King John II, son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than Charles II of Navarre, grandson of the elder daughter and son of Jeanne. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the Scottish succession, 1290–1292, the Bruce family pleaded tanistry and proximity of blood, whereas Balliol argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, Edward I of England, decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the Independence Wars reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The Earldom of Gloucester (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father&#x27;s first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, &quot;agnatic primogeniture&quot; (the same as Salic Law) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter, or in a few cases, the next closest female relative. Examples of queens in antiquity include Hatshepsut and Cleopatra, pharaohs of Egypt, Zenobia, Empress of Palmyra, Shammuramat of the Assyrian empire, as well as Boudica, queen of Iceni, and Cartimandua, queen of Brigantes, both tribes in Britain. A few prominent examples in medieval times include the following queens by country - 

* Byzantine Empire - Irene of Athens was the Byzantine Empress regnant from 797 till 802 CE. Later, Empress Zoe and Empress Theodora were co-monarchs of the Byzantine empire from 1042 CE.
* Kingdom of Kashmir (India) - Queen Didda succeeded to the throne of Kashmir in 980 CE until her death in 1003 CE. She had previously ruled as regent from 958 to 980 for her son and grandsons.
* Combined Kingdoms of León, Castile and Galicia (Spain) - Queen Urraca succeeded to the combined thrones of León, Castile and Galicia in 1109 after the death of her father Alfonso VI. 
* Kingdom of Jerusalem - Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem in 1131 after the death of her father.
* Kingdom of Aragon (Spain) - Petronilla of Aragon succeeded to the throne of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1137 after the abdication of her father Ramiro II of Aragon.
* Kingdom of Navarre - Joan I of Navarre succeeded to the throne of Navarre in 1274 CE.
* Kingdom of Scotland - Margaret, Maid of Norway inherited Scotland on the death of her grandfather King Alexander III of Scotland in 1286. Later, Mary, Queen of Scots succeeded to Scotland in 1542 after the death of her father James V of Scotland.
* Kalmar Union (Denmark, Norway and Sweden) - Margaret I of Denmark succeeded to the combined thrones of Denmark, Norway and Sweden in 1387. Christina, Queen of Sweden, later succeeded to the sole Swedish throne in 1632 after the death of her father, King Gustav II Adolf.
* Kingdom of England - Mary I of England succeeded to the Kingdom of England after her brother Edward VI&#x27;s death in 1553, who in turn was herself succeeded by her sister Elizabeth I in 1558.

In England all land passed to any widow strictly for life, then by primogeniture. Until the Statute of Wills was passed in 1540, a will could control only personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant by operation of law. The statute gave power to landowners to &quot;devise&quot; land by the use of a new device, part of any will, including heading &quot;testament&quot;. The default setting of such primogeniture applying absent express written words in England was not changed until the Administration of Estates Act 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see knight). The effect of this rule was to keep the father&#x27;s land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England the 1540 Act permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, a fading custom of the gentry and farm owners in England and Wales.

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, was consortium or coregency between husband and wife or other relatives. The most notable are the Egyptian cases of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, and the monarchs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

====United States and Canada====
In British North America, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants. The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed. Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.

When Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, Roosevelt said he could not understand the British aristocracy&#x27;s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the &quot;Spanish Curse&quot; by the British upper classes: &quot;We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks&quot;. But as Churchill&#x27;s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than Roosevelt realised.

==Reform of noble title primogeniture==
===Spain===
In 2006, King Juan Carlos I of Spain decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.
===United Kingdom===
A bill to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law was tabled in 2013 for absolute primogeniture. The Equality (Titles) Bill was socially dubbed the &quot;Downton law/bill&quot; in reference to the British television drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, in which the Earl&#x27;s eldest daughter cannot inherit her father&#x27;s estate as entrusted, unless all of the adult beneficiaries amend the trust (a legal position established in the 1841 case &quot;Saunders v Vautier&quot;). A Lords&#x27; Committee was chosen for Committee Stage, which rejected it.

<doc id="136538" wikidata="Q13011" url="?curid=136538" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">
<text>The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) is a widely accepted convention in zoology that rules the formal scientific naming of organisms treated as animals. It is also informally known as the ICZN Code, for its formal author, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (which shares the acronym &quot;ICZN&quot;). The rules principally regulate:
* How names are correctly established in the frame of binominal nomenclature
* How to determine whether a given name is available
* Which available name must be used in case of name conflicts (= valid name)
* How scientific literature must cite names
Zoological nomenclature is independent of other systems of nomenclature, for example botanical nomenclature. This implies that animals can have the same generic names as plants (e.g. there is a genus &quot;Abronia&quot; in both animals and plants).

The rules and recommendations have one fundamental aim: to provide the maximum universality and continuity in the naming of all animals, except where taxonomic judgment dictates otherwise. The code is meant to guide only the nomenclature of animals, while leaving zoologists freedom in classifying new taxa. In other words, while species concepts (and thus the definition of species) are arbitrary to some degree, the rules for names are not. The code applies only to names. A new animal name published without adherence to the code may be deemed simply &quot;unavailable&quot; if it fails to meet certain criteria, or fall entirely out of the province of science (e.g., the &quot;scientific name&quot; for the Loch Ness Monster).

The rules in the code determine which available names are valid for any taxon in the family group, genus group, and species group. It has additional (but more limited) provisions on names in higher ranks. The code recognizes no case law. Any dispute is decided first by applying the code directly, and not by reference to precedent.

The code is also retroactive or retrospective, which means that previous editions of the code, or previous other rules and conventions have no force any more today, and the nomenclatural acts published earlier must be evaluated only under the present edition of the code. In cases of disputes a case can be brought to the commission who has the right to publish a final decision.

== Principles ==
In regulating the names of animals it holds by six central principles, which were first set out (as principles) in the third edition of the code (1985):

===Principle of binominal nomenclature===

This is the principle that the scientific name of a species, and not of a taxon at any other rank, is a combination of two names; the use of a trinomen for the name of a subspecies and of uninominal names for taxa above the species group is in accord with this principle.

This means that in the system of nomenclature for animals, the name of a species is composed of a combination of a generic name and a specific name; together they make a &quot;binomen&quot;. No other rank can have a name composed of two names. Examples:
:Species &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis&quot;
* Subspecies have a name composed of three names, a &quot;trinomen&quot;: generic name, specific name, subspecific name:
:Subspecies &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi&quot;
* Taxa at a rank above species have a name composed of one name, a &quot;uninominal name&quot;.
:Genus &quot;Giraffa&quot;, family Giraffidae
In botanical nomenclature, the equivalent for &quot;binominal nomenclature&quot; is &quot;binary nomenclature&quot; (or sometimes &quot;binomial nomenclature&quot;).

===Principle of priority===
This is the principle that the correct formal scientific name for an animal taxon, the &quot;valid name&quot;, correct to use, is the oldest available name that applies to it.
It is the most important principle—the fundamental guiding precept that preserves zoological nomenclature stability. It was first formulated in 1842 by a committee appointed by the British Association to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature. Hugh Edwin Strickland wrote the committee&#x27;s report.

Examples:

* Nunneley 1837 established &quot;Limax maculatus&quot; (Gastropoda), Wiktor 2001 classified it as a junior synonym of &quot;Limax maximus&quot; from S and W Europe. &quot;Limax maximus&quot; was established first, so if Wiktor&#x27;s 2001 classification is accepted, &quot;Limax maximus&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Limax maculatus&quot; and must be used for the species.

* Carl Linnaeus named the domestic cat &quot;Felis catus&quot; in 1758; Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named the wildcat &quot;Felis silvestris&quot; in 1775. For taxonomists who consider these two kinds of cat a single species the principle of priority means that the species ought to be named &quot;F. catus&quot;, but in practice almost all biologists have used &quot;F. silvestris&quot;. In 2003, the commission issued a ruling (Opinion 2027) that &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;, confirming &quot;F. silvestris&quot; for the wild cat. Taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat the same species as the wild cat should use &quot;F. silvestris&quot;; those who consider it a subspecies of the wild cat should use &quot;F. silvestris catus&quot;; those who consider it a separate species should use &quot;F. catus&quot;.

There are over 2 million junior synonyms recorded in zoology, primarily at the species level.

===Principle of coordination===
The &quot;principle of coordination&quot; is that within the family group, genus group and species group, a name established for a taxon at any rank in the group is simultaneously established with the same author and date for taxa based on the same name-bearing type at other ranks in the corresponding group.
In other words, publishing a new zoological name automatically and simultaneously establishes all corresponding names in the relevant other ranks with the same type.

In the species-group, publishing a species name (the binomen) &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis&quot; also establishes the subspecies name (the trinomen) &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis&quot; . The same applies to the name of a subspecies; this establishes the corresponding species name.

In the genus-group, similarly, publishing the name of a genus also establishes the corresponding name of a subgenus (or vice versa): genus &quot;Giraffa&quot; and subgenus &quot;Giraffa&quot; (&quot;Giraffa&quot;) .

In the family-group, publication of the name of a family, subfamily, superfamily (or any other such rank) also establishes the names in all the other ranks in the family group (family Giraffidae, superfamily Giraffoidea, subfamily Giraffinae).

Author citations for such names (for example a subgenus) are the same as for the name actually published (for example a genus). It is immaterial if there is an actual taxon to which the automatically established name applies; if ever such a taxon is recognised, there is a name available for it.

===Principle of the first reviser===

This is the principle that in cases of conflicts between simultaneously published divergent acts, the first subsequent author can decide which has precedence.
It supplements the &quot;principle of priority&quot;, which states that the first published name takes precedence. The principle of the first reviser deals with situations that cannot be resolved by priority. These items may be two or more different names for the same taxon, two or more names with the same spelling used for different taxa, two or more different spellings of a particular name, etc. In such cases, the first subsequent author who deals with the matter and chooses and publishes the decision in the required manner is the first reviser, and is to be followed.

Example:

Linnaeus 1758 established &quot;Strix scandiaca&quot; and &quot;Strix noctua&quot; (Aves), for which he gave different descriptions and referred to different types, but both taxa later turned out to refer to the same species, the snowy owl. The two names are subjective synonyms. Lönnberg 1931 acted as first reviser, cited both names and selected &quot;Strix scandiaca&quot; to have precedence.

===Principle of homonymy===
This is the principle that the name of each taxon must be unique. Consequently, a name that is a junior homonym of another name must not be used as a valid name.

It means that any one animal name, in one particular spelling, may be used only once (within its group). This is usually the first-published name; any later name with the same spelling (a homonym) is barred from being used. The principles of priority and first reviser apply here. For family-group names the termination (which is rank-bound) is not taken into account.

Genera are homonyms only if exactly the same — a one-letter difference is enough to distinguish them.

Examples:
:&quot;Argus&quot; Bohadsch, 1761 (Gastropoda) (was made available for homonymy by ICZN in Opinion 429, despite that Bohadsch 1761 was non-binominal - this had the effect that none of the various following names &quot;Argus&quot; can be used for a taxon)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Scopoli, 1763 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Polyommatinae)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Scopoli, 1777 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Poli, 1791 (Bivalvia)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Temminck, 1807 (Aves)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Lamarck, 1817 (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Walckenaer, 1836 (Araneae)
:&quot;Argus&quot; Gerhard, 1850 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclinae)
The following are not homonyms of &quot;Argus&quot;:
:&quot;Argua&quot; Walker, 1863 (Lepidoptera), &quot;Argusa&quot; Kelham, 1888 (Aves), &quot;Argusina&quot; Hebard, 1927 (Dermaptera), †&quot;Arcus&quot; Hong, 1983 (Diptera), &quot;Argas&quot; Latreille, 1795 (Araneae), &quot;Argulus&quot; Müller, 1785 (Crustacea).
The following names are not homonyms of each other:
:&quot;Isomya&quot; Cutler &amp; Cutler, 1985 (Sipunculida), &quot;Isomyia&quot; Walker, 1859 (Diptera).
:&quot;Adelomya&quot; Mulsant &amp; Verreaux, 1866 (Aves), &quot;Adelomyia&quot; Bonaparte, 1854 (Aves), †&quot;Adelomys&quot; Gervais, 1853 (Mammalia), †&quot;Adolomys&quot; Shevyreva, 1989 (Mammalia), &quot;Adulomya&quot; Kuroda, 1931 (Bivalvia).

Some spelling variants are explicitly defined by the &quot;Code&quot; as being homonyms. Otherwise the one-letter difference rule applies.

In species, &quot;primary homonyms&quot; are those with the same genus and same species in their original combination. The difference between a junior primary homonym and a subsequent use of a name is undefined, but it is commonly accepted that if the name referred to another species or form, gave a description, and if there is in addition no evidence the author knew that the name was previously used, it is considered as a junior homonym.

Example:
:Scopoli (1763) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; (Coleoptera) for a species from Slovenia. Strøm (1768) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for another species from Norway. De Geer (1775) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for a 3rd species from Sweden. Müller (1776) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for a 4th species from Denmark. Fourcroy (1785) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for a 5th species from France. Olivier (1790) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for a 6th species from France. Marsham (1802) established &quot;Curculio fasciatus&quot; for a 7th species from Britain. All these names had descriptions that clarified that different species were meant, and that their authors did not know that the name had been established by a previous author.

Typically, junior primary homonyms are permanently invalid, but some are treated as valid if the junior and senior homonyms have been in separate genera after 1899 (Art. 57.2.1, Art. 23.9).

Examples:
:Olivier published the names &quot;Cerambyx elegans&quot; in 1790, and &quot;Cerambix&quot; [sic] &quot;maculatus&quot; in 1795, both of them junior primary homonyms. However, by 1835 both species were no longer in the genus &quot;Cerambyx&quot;, so both species names are presently treated as valid, as &quot;Mionochroma elegans&quot; and &quot;Stellognatha maculata&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Secondary homonyms&quot; occur when taxa with the same specific name but different original genera are later classified in the same genus (Art. 57.3, 59).
A secondary homonym may only be a temporary state, as it only applies so long as two species are congeneric. Under a different classification, the two species may no longer be in the same genus, and the junior name can potentially be used again (Art. 59.1), as long as it was not replaced before 1961, in which case it is permanently invalid (Art. 59.3).
This is one of the rare cases where a single zoological species can have two entirely different names at the same time, depending upon whose classification is followed.

Example:
:Nunneley (1837) established &quot;Limax maculatus&quot; (Gastropoda), Wiktor (2001) classified it as a junior synonym of &quot;Limax (Limax) maximus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 from S and W Europe. Kaleniczenko, 1851 established &quot;Krynickillus maculatus&quot; for a different species from Ukraine. Wiktor, 2001 classified both &quot;Limax maximus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 and &quot;Krynickillus maculatus&quot; Kaleniczenko, 1851 in the genus &quot;Limax&quot;. This meant that &quot;L. maculatus&quot; Nunneley, 1837 and &quot;K. maculatus&quot; Kaleniczenko, 1851 were classified in the same genus, so both names were secondary homonyms in the genus Limax, and the younger name (from 1851) could not be used for the Ukrainian species. This made it necessary to look for the next younger available name that could be used for the Ukrainian species. This was &quot;Limax ecarinatus&quot; Boettger, 1881, a junior synonym of &quot;K. maculatus&quot; Kaleniczenko, 1851.
:For Wiktor (2001) and those authors who follow Wiktor&#x27;s system the name of the Ukrainian species must be &quot;Limax ecarinatus&quot; Boettger, 1881. For the others who classify &quot;Limacus&quot; as a separate genus, the name of the Ukrainian species must be &quot;Limacus maculatus&quot; (Kaleniczenko, 1851).
:So the Ukrainian species can have two names, depending from its generic classification. &quot;Limax ecarinatus&quot;, &quot;Limacus maculatus&quot;, the same species.

Article 59.3 states that junior secondary homonyms replaced before 1961 by substitute names are permanently invalid unless the substitute name is itself not in use.

Example:
:&quot;Glischrus caelatus&quot; Studer, 1820 (Gastropoda) was once classified in the genus &quot;Helix&quot;, and became a junior secondary homonym of &quot;Helix caelata&quot; [Vallot], 1801. Locard (1880) established a replacement name &quot;Helix glypta&quot;, which has very rarely been used. The species is now known as &quot;Trochulus caelatus&quot; (Studer, 1820), and Art. 59.3 is commonly ignored.

&quot;Double homonymy&quot; (genus and species) may or may not be homonymy in the strict sense: if the genera are homonyms but not the same genus, the same specific names can be used in both groups, because the species are subsequently placed in different genera when the generic homonymy is removed.

Example:
:The name &quot;Noctua&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 was established for a group of moths. In 1766 he established &quot;Noctua&quot; Linné, 1766 for a group of birds, ignoring that he had already used this name a few years ago. &quot;Noctua&quot; Linné, 1766 (Aves) is a junior homonym of &quot;Noctua&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera), and is permanently invalid.
:&quot;Noctua variegata&quot; (Lepidoptera) was coined by Jung, 1792, and &quot;Noctua variegata&quot; (Aves) by Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1830, thus creating a double homonym, until the latter species was placed in a different genus. Both species names are valid.

For &quot;disambiguating&quot; one genus-group name from its homonym, it is important to cite author and year. Citing the author alone is often not sufficient.

Examples:
:&quot;Echidna&quot; Forster, 1777 (Actinopterygii), not &quot;Echidna&quot; Cuvier, 1797 (Mammalia)
:&quot;Ansa&quot; Walker, 1858 (Lepidoptera), not &quot;Ansa&quot; Walker, 1868 (Hemiptera)
:&quot;Helix balcanica&quot; Kobelt, 1876, not &quot;Helix balcanica&quot; Kobelt, 1903 (both Gastropoda)
:&quot;Conus catenatus&quot; Sowerby, 1850, not &quot;Conus catenatus&quot; Sowerby, 1875 (both Gastropoda)

In some cases, the same genus-group or species-group name was published in the same year by the same author. In these cases it is useful to cite the page where the name was established.

:&quot;Amydona&quot; Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae) (p. 1110), not &quot;Amydona&quot; Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) (p. 1413)
:&quot;Betousa&quot; Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Thyrididae) (p. 1111), not &quot;Betousa&quot; Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (p. 1208).
:&quot;Cicada variegata&quot; Fabricius, 1775 (p. 684), not &quot;Cicada variegata&quot; Fabricius, 1775 (p. 686) (both Auchenorrhyncha).
:&quot;Noctua marginata&quot; Fabricius, 1775 (p. 597), not &quot;Noctua marginata&quot; Fabricius, 1775 (p. 610) (both Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
:&quot;Clausilia (Albinaria) oertzeni&quot; Boettger, 1889 (p. 42), not &quot;Clausilia (Albinaria) schuchi&quot; var. &quot;oertzeni&quot; Boettger, 1889 (p. 52) (both Gastropoda: Clausiliidae).

There are cases where two homonyms were established by the same author in the same year on the same page:
:&quot;Zonites verticillus&quot; var. &quot;graeca&quot; Kobelt, 1876 (Gastropoda) (p. 48), not &quot;Zonites albanicus&quot; var. &quot;graeca&quot; Kobelt, 1876 (p. 48).

Homonyms occur relatively rarely in families (only if generic names are identical or very similar and adding an ending &quot;-idae&quot; produces identical results). Discovering such a homonymy usually produces the same problems as if there were no rules: conflicts between entirely independent and unconnected groups of taxonomists working in different animal groups. Very often the Commission must be asked to take a decision.

Examples:
:&quot;Bulimina&quot; (Foraminifera) and &quot;Buliminus&quot; (Gastropoda) both give Buliminidae, and both families were used since the 1880s. When the homonymy was discovered 110 years later in the 1990s, the younger (gastropod) taxon had to receive a new family name, and the Commission was asked for a solution (Opinion 2018).
:&quot;Claria&quot; (Rotifera) and &quot;Clarias&quot; (Actinopterygii) both give Clariidae, but only the actinopterygian fish name had been used since 1845. Shortly after Clariidae had been proposed in Rotifera in 1990, the homonymy was discovered and the Commission ruled that the rotiferan family had to be emended to Clariaidae (Opinion 2032).

For names above the superfamily level, the principle of homonymy does not apply.

Examples:
:Pulmonata is usually used for a very prominent group in Gastropoda, but the name is also (rarely) used for a group in Arachnida.
:Reticulata is used as an order in Foraminifera, and as an undefined higher group in Ephemeroptera.

Family-rank names and genus-rank names cannot be homonyms of one another, even if identical.

Example:
:The frog superfamily Ranoidea and the frog genus &quot;Ranoidea&quot; are not homonyms.

Animal, plant, and fungi nomenclature are entirely independent from each other. The most evident shortcoming of this situation (for their use in biodiversity informatics) is that the same generic name can be used simultaneously for animals and plants. For this kind of homonym the expression &quot;hemihomonym&quot; is sometimes used. Far more than 1000 such names are known.

Examples:
:The genus &quot;Tandonia&quot; was established in animals (Gastropoda), in plants (Euphorbiaceae), and in Fungi (Ascomycetes).
:Prominent plant/animal pairings: &quot;Ammophila&quot; (Poaceae and Hymenoptera), &quot;Arenaria&quot; (Caryophyllaceae and Aves), &quot;Betula&quot;(Betulaceae and Hymenoptera), &quot;Chloris&quot; (Cactaceae and Aves), &quot;Dryas&quot; (Rosaceae and Lepidoptera), &quot;Dugesia&quot; (Asteraceae and Platyhelminthes), &quot;Erica&quot; (Ericaceae and Araneae), &quot;Hystrix&quot; (Poaceae and Mammalia), &quot;Iris&quot; (Iridaceae and Orthoptera), &quot;Liparis&quot; (Orchidaceae and Actinopterygii), &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; (Orchidaceae and Aves), &quot;Pinus&quot; (Pinaceae and Mollusca), &quot;Prunella&quot; (Lamiaceae and Aves), &quot;Ricinus&quot; (Euphorbiaceae and Psocodea), &quot;Taxus&quot; (Taxaceae and Mammalia), &quot;Typha&quot; (Typhaceae and Porifera), &quot;Ulva&quot; (Ulvophyceae and Lepidoptera), &quot;Viola&quot; (Violaceae and Lepidoptera).

===Principle of typification===
This is the principle that each nominal taxon in the family group, genus group, or species group has—actually or potentially—a name-bearing type fixed that provides the objective standard of reference that determines what the name applies to.

This means that any named taxon has a name-bearing type, which allows the objective application of that name. Any family-group name must have a type genus, any genus-group name must have a type species, and any species-group name can (not must) have one or more type specimens (holotype, lectotype, neotype, syntypes, or others), usually deposited in a museum collection.
The type genus for a &quot;family-group name&quot; is simply the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending &quot;-idae&quot; (for families). Example:
:The family name Spheniscidae has as its type genus the genus &quot;Spheniscus&quot; Brisson, 1760.

The type species for a &quot;genus-group name&quot; is more complicated and follows exactly defined provisions in articles 67–69.
Type species are very important, and no general zoological database has recorded the type species for all genera. Except in fishes and some minor groups, type species are rarely reliably recorded in online animal databases. In 60% of the cases the type species can be determined in the original publication.
The type species is always the original name of the taxon (and not the currently used combination).

Example:
:The correctly cited type species of &quot;Locusta&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 (Caelifera) is &quot;Gryllus migratorius&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, not &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758).

Designation and fixation have different meanings. A designation is the proposal of the type species. It is not necessary to have spelled the name of the genus or species correctly with correct authors (articles 67.2.1, 67.6, 67.7), type species are always the correctly spelled name. If the designation is valid, the type species is fixed.

A designation can also be invalid and ineffective—for example—if the genus had already a previously fixed type species, or if a type species was proposed that was not originally included, or contradicted the description or figure for a genus for which no species had originally been included.

There are various possible modes of type species designation. This is their order of legal importance, with approximate proportions of occurrence and examples:
* Superior type fixation:
::Designation by ICZN under the plenary powers (3 %)
:::Example:
:::&quot;Galba&quot; Schrank, 1803 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, &quot;Galba pusilla&quot; Schrank, 1803. This would be the type species by monotypy. In Opinion 1896 (published in 1998) this type fixation was set aside and &quot;Buccinum truncatulum&quot; Müller, 1774 was fixed as type species under the plenary power(s) (now &quot;Galba truncatula&quot;).
::Designation under Art. 70.3 (misidentified type species) (1 %)
:::Examples:
:::&quot;Bollingeria&quot; Forcart, 1940 (Gastropoda) was established with its type species &quot;Chondrus pupoides&quot; Krynicki, 1833 proposed by original designation. But Forcart 1940 misidentified the type species and meant &quot;Bulimus lamelliferus&quot; Rossmässler, 1858. It would be convenient to designate &quot;Bulimus lamelliferus&quot; as type species under Art. 70.3.
:::&quot;Helisoma&quot; Swainson, 1840 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, cited by Swainson as &quot;&quot;H. bicarinata&quot; Sow. Gen. f. 4&quot;. This suggested that the type species was misidentified, and that &quot;Planorbis campanulatus&quot; Say, 1821 and not &quot;Planorbis bicarinatus&quot; Say, 1819 was meant. But since the incorrect type species &quot;Planorbis bicarinatus&quot; has been regarded as type, it would be convenient to fix this as type under Art. 70.3.
* Type fixation in the original work:
::Original designation (31 %)
:::Examples:
:::Montfort 1810 established the genus &quot;Theodoxus&quot; (Gastropoda) and designated &quot;Theodoxus lutetianus&quot; Montfort 1810 as type species (now &quot;Theodoxus fluviatilis&quot;).
:::Vest 1867 established the subgenus &quot;Clausilia (Isabellaria)&quot; (Gastropoda) and designated &quot;Clausilia isabellina&quot; Pfeiffer, 1842 as type species (now &quot;Isabellaria isabellina&quot;).
:::Riedel 1987 established the genus &quot;Turcozonites&quot; (Gastropoda) and designated &quot;Zonites wandae&quot; Riedel, 1982 as type species (now &quot;Turcozonites wandae&quot;).
::Monotypy (28 %)
:::Examples:
:::&quot;Anodonta&quot; Lamarck, 1799 (Bivalvia) was originally established with one included nominal species, &quot;Mytilus cygneus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758. This is the type species fixed by monotypy (now &quot;Anodonta cygnea&quot;).
:::&quot;Microcondylaea&quot; Vest 1866 (Bivalvia) was originally established with two included nominal species, &quot;Unio bonellii&quot; Férussac, 1827 and with doubts &quot;Anodonta lata&quot; Rafinesque, 1820. Doubtfully included species do not count, type species is &quot;Unio bonellii&quot; fixed by monotypy (now &quot;Microcondylaea bonellii&quot;).
::Absolute tautonymy (2 %)
:::Examples:
:::Kobelt 1871 established the gastropod genus-group name &quot;Candidula&quot; and included 23 species. Among these was &quot;Glischrus candidula&quot; Studer 1820. &quot;Glischrus candidula&quot; is type species fixed by absolute tautonymy (now &quot;Candidula unifasciata&quot;).
:::Draparnaud 1801 established the gastropod genus &quot;Succinea&quot; and included two species, &quot;Succinea amphibia&quot; Draparnaud 1801 and &quot;Succinea oblonga&quot; Draparnaud 1801. Among the synonyms of &quot;S. amphibia&quot;, Draparnaud listed a name &quot;Helix succinea&quot; Müller 1774. Synonyms do count here, so &quot;Helix succinea&quot; is type species by absolute tautonymy (now &quot;Succinea putris&quot;).
:::Kobelt 1904 established the gastropod subgenus &quot;Iberus (Balearica)&quot; and included 10 species. Among these was &quot;Helix balearica&quot; Rossmässler 1838, which Kobelt cited as &quot;Iberus (Balearica) balearicus&quot;. The ending -us is irrelevant here, &quot;Helix balearica&quot; is type species by absolute tautonymy (currently &quot;Iberellus balearicus&quot; or &quot;Iberellus hispanicus&quot;).
:::&quot;Euxinolauria&quot; Lindholm, 1924 (Gastropoda: Lauriidae) was established as a new replacement name for &quot;Caucasica&quot; Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 (not &quot;Caucasica&quot; Boettger, 1877 (Gastropoda: Clausiliidae)). &quot;Caucasica&quot; Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 contained originally four species, among which was &quot;Pupa caucasica&quot; Pfeiffer, 1857. This is the type species for &quot;Caucasica&quot; Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 fixed by absolute tautonymy, and also for &quot;Euxinolauria&quot; (now &quot;Euxinolauria caucasica&quot;).
:::The following examples do not represent absolute tautonymy: &quot;Scomber scombrus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 (Actinopterygii), &quot;Babyrousa babyrussa&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) (Mammalia), &quot;Suricata suricatta&quot; (Schreber, 1776) (Mammalia), &quot;Merlangius merlangus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) (Actinopterygii), &quot;Isabellaria isabellina&quot; (Pfeiffer, 1842) (Gastropoda), &quot;Rupestrella rupestris&quot; (Philippi, 1836) (Gastropoda).
::Linnean tautonymy (0.3 %)
:::Example:
:::Linnaeus 1758 established &quot;Castor&quot; (Mammalia) and included two species, &quot;Castor fiber&quot; and &quot;Castor moschatus&quot;. Among the synonyms of &quot;Castor fiber&quot; was cited the one-word name Castor with references to six pre-Linnean works (Gesner 1598, Rondelet 1554, Jonston 1650, Dodart 1676, Ray 1693 and Aldrovandi 1649). &quot;Castor fiber&quot; Linnaeus 1758 is type species fixed by Linnean tautonymy (now &quot;Castor fiber&quot;).
* Subsequent methods of type fixation:
::Subsequent monotypy (2 %)
:::Examples:
:::&quot;Valvata&quot; Müller, 1773 (Gastropoda) was established with a short description and without species. Müller 1774 included one species &quot;Valvata cristata&quot; Müller 1774. &quot;Valvata cristata&quot; is type species by subsequent monotypy (now &quot;Valvata cristata&quot;).
:::&quot;Omphiscola&quot; Rafinesque, 1819 (Gastropoda) was established without species included. Beck 1837 [1838] included one species &quot;Buccinum glabrum&quot; Müller, 1774. &quot;Buccinum glabrum&quot; is type species by subsequent monotypy (now &quot;Omphiscola glabra&quot;).
::Subsequent absolute tautonymy (only very few cases)
:::Examples:
:::&quot;Alosa Garsault, 1764&quot; (Actinopterygii) was established without included species. As first author, Cuvier, 1829 included two species &quot;Clupea alosa&quot; and &quot;Clupea fincta&quot;. Type species is &quot;Clupea alosa&quot; Linnaeus 1758 by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now &quot;Alosa alosa&quot;).
:::&quot;Rupicapra&quot; Garsault, 1764 (Mammalia) was established without included species. As first author, Blainville, 1816 included three species &quot;Capra rupicapra&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, &quot;Capra pudu&quot;, and &quot;Capra americana&quot;. Type species is &quot;Capra rupicapra&quot; by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now &quot;Rupicapra rupicapra&quot;).
::Subsequent Linnean tautonymy (only theoretical, there might be no case)
::Subsequent designation (32 %)
:::Examples:
:::&quot;Aplexa&quot; Fleming, 1820 (Gastropoda) was established with two species, &quot;Bulla hypnorum&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 and &quot;Bulla rivalis&quot; Turton, 1807. Herrmannsen 1846 fixed &quot;Bulla hypnorum&quot; as type by subsequent designation (now &quot;Aplexa hypnorum&quot;).
:::&quot;Pseudanodonta&quot; Bourguignat 1877 (Bivalvia) was established with seven species, &quot;Anodonta complanata&quot; Rossmässler 1835, and six others. Westerlund 1902 validly designated &quot;Anodonta complanata&quot; as type species (now&quot;Pseudanodonta complanata&quot;).

A &quot;species-group name&quot; can have a name-bearing type specimen, but this is not a requirement. In many cases species-group names have no type specimens, or they are lost. In those cases the application of the species-group name is usually based on common acceptance. If there is no common acceptance, there are provisions in the Code to fix a name-bearing type specimen that is binding for users of that name. Fixing such a name-bearing type should only be done if this is taxonomically necessary (articles 74.7.3, 75.2, 75.3).

Examples:
: &quot;Aptenodytes patagonica&quot; Miller, 1778 is either based on a type specimen, perhaps deposited in the Natural History Museum London or somewhere else, or its type is lost. This is now irrelevant because the usage of the name (as &quot;Aptenodytes patagonicus&quot;) for the king penguin is unambiguously accepted.
: The name-bearing type for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 is deposited in Uppsala (the bones of Carl von Linné). This is a lectotype designated by Stearn 1959, correctly but unnecessarily because the usage of the name was unambiguous at that time, and still is.

== Structure ==

The code divides names in the following manner:
* Names above the family group
* Family-group names
* Genus-group names
* Species-group names

The names above the family group are regulated only as to the requirements for publication; there is no restriction to the number of ranks and the use of names is not restricted by priority.

The names in the family, genus, and species groups are fully regulated by the provisions in the code. There is no limitation to the number of ranks allowed in the family group. The genus group has only two ranks: &quot;genus&quot; and &quot;subgenus&quot;. The species group has only two ranks: &quot;species&quot; and &quot;subspecies&quot;.

=== Gender agreement ===
In the species group &quot;gender agreement&quot; applies. The name of a species, in two parts, a binomen, say, &quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;, and of a subspecies, in three parts, a trinomen, say &quot;Canis lupus albus&quot;, is in the form of a Latin phrase, and must be grammatically correct Latin. If the second part, the specific name (or the third part, the subspecific name) is adjectival in nature, its ending must agree in gender with the name of the genus. If it is a noun, or an arbitrary combination of letters, this does not apply.
* For instance, the generic name &quot;Equus&quot; is masculine; in the name &quot;Equus africanus&quot;, the specific name &quot;africanus&quot; is an adjective and its ending follows the gender of the generic name.
* In &quot;Equus zebra&quot; the specific name &quot;zebra&quot; is a noun, it may not be &quot;corrected&quot; to &quot;Equus zebrus&quot;.
* In &quot;Equus quagga burchellii&quot; the subspecific name &quot;burchellii&quot; is a noun in the genitive case (&quot;of Burchell&quot;).

If a species is moved, therefore, the spelling of an ending may need to change. If &quot;Gryllus migratorius&quot; is moved to the genus &quot;Locusta&quot;, it becomes &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;. Confusion over Latin grammar has led to many incorrectly formed names appearing in print. An automated search may fail to find all the variant spellings of a given name (e.g., the spellings &quot;atra&quot; and &quot;ater&quot; may refer to the same species).

== History ==
Written nomenclatural rules in zoology were compiled in various countries since the late 1830s, such as Merton&#x27;s Rules and Strickland&#x27;s Code going back to 1843. At the first and second International Zoological Congresses (Paris 1889, Moscow 1892) zoologists saw the need to establish commonly accepted international rules for all disciplines and countries to replace conventions and unwritten rules that varied across disciplines, countries, and languages.

Compiling &quot;International Rules on Zoological Nomenclature&quot; was first proposed in 1895 in Leiden (3rd International Congress for Zoology) and officially published in three languages in 1905 (French, English, German; only French was official). From then on, amendments and modifications were subsequently passed by various zoological congresses (Boston 1907, Graz 1910, Monaco 1913, Budapest 1927, Padua 1930, Paris 1948, Copenhagen 1953, and London 1958). These were only published in English, and can only be found in the reports of these congresses or other official publications.

The 1905 rules became increasingly outdated. They soon sold out, and it became increasingly difficult to obtain to a complete set of the Rules with all amendments. In Copenhagen 1953 the French and English texts of the rules were declared of equivalent official force, and a declaration was approved to prepare a new compilation of the rules. In 1958, an Editorial Committee in London elaborated a completely new version of the nomenclatural rules, which were finally published as the first edition of the &quot;ICZN Code&quot; on 9 November 1961.

The second edition of the code (only weakly modified) came in 1963. The last zoological congress to deal with nomenclatural problems took place in Monte Carlo 1972, since by then the official zoological organs no longer derived power from zoological congresses. The third edition of the code came out in 1985. The present edition is the 4th edition, effective since 2000. These code editions were elaborated on by editorial committees appointed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The ICZN Commission takes its power from a general biological congress (IUBS, International Union of Biological Sciences). The editorial committee for the fourth edition was composed of seven persons. Such new editions of the ICZN Code are not democratically approved by those taxonomists who are forced to follow the code&#x27;s provisions, neither do taxonomists have the right to vote for the members of the commission or the editorial committee.

As the commission may alter the code (by declarations and amendments) without issuing a new edition of the book, the current edition does not necessarily contain the actual provision that applies in a particular case. The Code consists of the original text of the fourth edition and Declaration 44. The code is published in an English and a French version; both versions are official and equivalent in force, meaning, and authority. This means that if something in the English code is unclear or its interpretation ambiguous, the French version is decisive, and if there is something unclear in the French code, the English version is decisive.

== Commission ==

The rules in the code apply to all users of zoological names. However, its provisions can be interpreted, waived, or modified in their application to a particular case when strict adherence would cause confusion. Such exceptions are not made by an individual scientist, no matter how well-respected within the field, but only by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, acting on behalf of all zoologists. The commission takes such action in response to proposals submitted to it.

== Electronic publications ==

The latest amendments (specifically A-2012) enacted by the commission concern electronic publishing, which is now permitted for works published under an ISBN or ISSN after 2011 in a way that requires registration with ZooBank as well as archival of multiple copies.

==Local usage and name changes==
The ICZN is used by the scientific community worldwide. Changes are governed by guidelines in the code. Local changes, such as the changes proposed by the Turkish government, are not recognised by ICZN.

<text>Rockwall is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the seat of Rockwall County. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that as of the 2020 census, Rockwall&#x27;s population is 52,918, up from 47,251 in 2020. The name Rockwall is derived from a naturally jointed geological formation, which has the appearance of an artificial wall.

==History==
The association of Paleo-Indian artifacts with extinct Pleistocene mammal remains in various archeological sites within the Texas Prairie-Savannah Region of eastern North Central Texas, including a site in Collin County, and Clovis points recovered from the Brushy Creek Clovis Site in Hunt County demonstrates that the Rockwall region was occupied by prehistoric Native American cultures at least as far back as 13,500 to 13,000 years ago. More recently, the Rockwall region was occupied by Caddo Indians. Creek Indians moved to the area in the early 19th century.

In 1851, the first Anglo-American settlers moved to the area, and wells were dug. During the digging, they found large underground rock walls that were initially believed to be man-made. Later study of the wall-like features by geologists and archaeologists found them to be jointed, natural sandstone dikes that had intruded Cretaceous marl. The wall, when viewed from above, runs in long straight lines with angles that form a near perfect rectangle. The eastern wall has several deviations that run in straight lines with sharp angles, which would be unusual for a natural formation in an already unusual closed loop wall formation.

The town was established April 17, 1854 and named after these natural rock walls. While originally part of Kaufman County, in 1873, Rockwall County was formed with Rockwall being the county seat.

<doc id="136543" wikidata="Q664723" url="?curid=136543" title="Henderson, Texas">
<text>Henderson is a city and the county seat of Rusk County, Texas, in Northeast Texas, United States. Its population was 13,271 at the 2020 census. Henderson is named for James Pinckney Henderson, the first governor of Texas.

The city has functioned as a major crossroads in Northeast Texas over the last two centuries. Several major highways pass through the business district of the town, including U.S. Route 259, Texas State Highway 64, U.S. Route 79, Texas State Highway 43, Texas State Highway 42, and Texas State Highway 64.

Annual events in the city of Henderson include the Heritage Syrup Festival in November, celebrating the East Texas tradition of syrup making, and the East Texas Sacred Harp Convention in August featuring shape note music.

==History==

The city of Henderson was established by European Americans before the State of Texas was founded. It was developed on land donated by W.B. Ochiltree and James Smith; it became the county seat of Rusk County when an act of legislature created Rusk County on January 16, 1843. The First Methodist and First Baptist churches were established in 1842 and 1845, respectively. Though a Baptist Church was organized in 1845, the current First Baptist Church was reorganized in 1850. The first courthouse, made of wood, was completed in 1849. After the Civil War, the International and Great Northern Railroad crossed through Rusk County, but bypassed Henderson. In 1869, a white mob lynched five Black men without trial, including two preachers, in the public square outside the courthouse. In 1874, the Henderson and Overton Branch Railroad Company built a stretch of railroad connecting Henderson to the tracks running through Overton. This stretch of railroad was later sold to the Missouri Pacific Railroad (now Union Pacific) and remains in use to this day.

In 1878, a fire destroyed the courthouse, and a brick courthouse was built in its place. This encouraged the construction of several other brick buildings, including the Howard Dickinson House, now a historical site.

In 1930, C. M. &quot;Dad&quot; Joiner brought in the Daisy Bradford #3 Discovery Well 6 miles northwest of Henderson. The discovery of oil in October 1930 created a booming economy in the area, with the population of Henderson increasing from 2,000 to over 10,000 in a few months. The oil fields in and surrounding Henderson, part of the high-producing five-county East Texas Oil Field, continue to provide a large part of the wealth of the town, county, and region.

During World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Henderson on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Dunkirk, France, which is the same distance from London, England, as Henderson is from Terrell.

=== 1860 Henderson fire ===
On August 5, 1860, a fire broke out and burned most of the booming town of Henderson. Forty-three buildings, including two hotels, were destroyed in the fire, for a loss of $220,000.

According to the Depot Museum, a man named John Crow recalled the fire as follows:

I was about eight years old when Henderson burned. I went to town with my father the day after the fire. It burned every house as well as I recollect, except the Flanagan Brick Building. I remember I was barefooted and careful not to burn my feet. My father said at the time they thought a fellow named Green Herndon, a union man, had hired a negro woman to burn Henderson. Herndon was a northerner and was a pronounced opponent of secession. On the negro woman&#x27;s testimony, a mob gathered, threw a loop around his neck, tied it to a saddle horse, which went around the public square dragging Herndon to death. Then they hung the body to a tree and shot it full of holes ... War was in preparation and people were in fits of anger. When the war broke out, the men got all the files they could find and went to the blacksmith shops and made knives and swords. There was much laughter and I remember they said, &quot;We&#x27;ll whip those damn Yankees with axes and butcher knives. Everyone was anxious to go.&quot;John Crow was John Stephen Crow, born in Henderson on March 5, 1852 and died there on October 19, 1952. He is buried at Maple Grove Cemetery. His father, Moses Melton Crow, was part of a large group of family, friends and neighbors who left the area of Henry and Clayton Counties, Georgia and were early settlers in Rusk County. The surnames of these early settlers include Burks, Cates, Crow, Mitchell and others.
=== 2015 Henderson Tornado ===

<text>Mount Enterprise is a city in Rusk County, Texas, United States. The population was 505 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The city of Mount Enterprise, located south of Henderson in rural Rusk County, was named for a small elevation near the town and for the business enterprise of the Vinzent brothers, who settled it in 1832.

The town owes its existence to the presence of promising iron ore in the area. Charles Vinzent considered the &quot;old mountain&quot; nearby to be an &quot;iron mountain,&quot; and he was not far off the mark; the brown, crumbly ore of the Weches formation that outcrops in the area has a better than 50 percent iron content. However, Vinzent&#x27;s real enterprise came in the form of manufacturing and retailing. His factory made wagons, buggies, furniture, plows, caskets, and a patented churn. He launched a chain of stores to sell these products, and more, operating out of Mount Enterprise. At one time Vinzent had as many as four stores.

Lumbering was also an early industry of Mount Enterprise; the furniture factory it supported is dated as early as 1850. There were also numerous plantations in the area before the Civil War. In 1846 the Mulberry Grove post office was established with Henry Henson as postmaster. Three years later the name was changed to Mount Enterprise.

Mount Enterprise Male and Female College was begun in 1851, and it lasted until 1855. In 1853 Mount Enterprise Male and Female Academy was established. In 1880 the town had three sawmills, a hotel, two cotton gins, a school, three churches, and a population of 150.

In 1894 the Caro Northern Railway was chartered to operate as a logging road between Mount Enterprise and Caro, in Nacogdoches County, a distance of little over 16 miles. The railroad, which connected Mount Enterprise with the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, came to within a mile of Mount Enterprise, and the town then moved to the railroad. It became the new Mount Enterprise, and the old location was called the old Mount Enterprise.

The railroad was abandoned in 1934, but by 1939 the town had incorporated and still had a number of businesses, a bank, a post office, a newspaper, and a population of 920. After 1940 the population gradually declined to 485 in 1982, when the town had a bank, a post office, and fifteen businesses. In 1990 the population was 501. The population grew to 525 in 2000, but has since dropped to 447 according to the 2010 census.

<doc id="136547" wikidata="Q976085" url="?curid=136547" title="Hemphill, Texas">
<text>Hemphill is a city in and the county seat of Sabine County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,029 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Sabine County. It is located on State Highway 87 at the junction of State Highway 184, and is surrounded by the Sabine National Forest and the Toledo Bend Reservoir.

==Historical development==
In 1858 the Sabine County voters elected to move the county seat from Milam, in the east along the Sabine River, to a more central part of the county. The following year, the plans for the town were laid down, with the post office opening as well. The Town was named after John Hemphill, an early Texas judge and legal scholar, and later a United States senator.

The location was ideal in terms of being centrally located in relation to other settlements, but it initially had poor transportation access, as it was neither located on the Sabine River or existing rail lines. In 1912, the &quot;Lufkin, Hemphill and Gulf Railway&quot; provided Hemphill with rail connections. This construction also supported nearby lumber operations. After the timber was depleted and sawmills closed in these communities, by 1938 the line would be abandoned.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.66%) is water.

Hemphill is 484 miles (as the crow flies) from Hemphill County (which is in the northern Panhandle). This is the largest separation of a Texas city from a Texas county of the same name.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,029 people, 469 households, and 313 families residing in the city.

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,106 people, 467 households, and 301 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 574 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 77.40% White, 16.82% African American, 0.63% Native American, 3.62% from other races, and 1.54% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.61% of the population.

There were 467 households, out of which 27.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.8% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.5% were non-families. 32.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 25.8% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 20.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 80.8 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $25,781, and the median income for a family was $33,839. Males had a median income of $30,000 versus $20,417 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,674. About 14.1% of families and 20.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.5% of those under age 18 and 18.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==

==Recreation==
The nearby Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn lakes attract many tourists during the summer months.

==Killing of Loyal Garner Jr.==
On Christmas night 1987, Loyal Garner Jr. of Florien, Louisiana, a 34-year-old African-American truck driver and married father of six, was arrested with two companions for alleged drunk driving in Sabine County. After being beaten on a bridge near the Toledo Bend area by the Hemphill Police Department&#x27;s Chief of Police, Thomas Ladner, and two deputies which were called for by Ladner, Loyal Garner Jr. was taken to the Sabine County Jail. The following morning, he was found comatose in his cell. Garner was taken for treatment to a local hospital and then to one in the city of Tyler, Texas, seat of Smith County, where he died after neurosurgery. Officials in Tyler thought the death suspicious, as an autopsy showed evidence of beating, and they refused to return the body to Hemphill until completing their own investigation. Ladner and two sheriff deputies were tried in Hemphill of violating Garner&#x27;s civil rights and acquitted, to cheers by whites in the courtroom. Garner&#x27;s family sued city officials for his death, and the city settled with the family for an undisclosed amount. In 1990, Ladner and the two Sabine County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputies were convicted of murder by a jury in Tyler, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, especially for Ladner.

The difference in the two trial verdicts has been attributed in part to the composition and attitudes of the juries. 
African-Americans in Hemphill comprised about 20 percent of the small town&#x27;s population. They conducted their first civil rights protest after Ladner&#x27;s acquittal, and founded the first chapter here of the NAACP. The circumstances of Garner&#x27;s death and the two trials of Hemphill law enforcement officers had attracted national media attention. The protest and associated events were also covered by CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

==Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster==
In February 2003, the town and its vicinity were one of the key search areas for wreckage from the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; after it broke up over Texas. Search teams recovered some of the remains of the shuttle and crew members, and the Orbiter Experiment Support System recorder (OEX) was found near Hemphill.

A memorial has been erected in Hemphill commemorating the deceased &quot;Columbia&quot; astronauts. The memorial is located at the intersection of Hwy 87 North and Hwy 83 East.

On the eighth anniversary of the disaster, the Patricia Huffman Smith NASA &quot;Remembering Columbia&quot; Museum was opened in Hemphill on February 1, 2011, in a new building constructed next to the J.R. Huffman Public Library. The museum is named for the late wife of philanthropist Al Smith, who donated most of the money to build the museum. The Sugar Land real estate developer also exports construction materials. He and his wife had also donated money for the library a decade ago. The new museum features the permanent &quot;NASA Remembering Columbia&quot; exhibit. It includes many items donated by area families who worked on the search for remains, as well as items from families of the astronauts, and official material from NASA, which operates the museum.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hemphill has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Coldspring is a city in San Jacinto County, Texas, United States. It is the county seat of San Jacinto County, which is named after the river that traverses it and shares its name with the battle that gave Texas its independence. The population was 819 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The history of Coldspring is linked to Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s first colony in Texas, which established, among other locales, San Jacinto County. Austin&#x27;s original colony extended to the Trinity River watershed (roughly along Texas 156 toward Point Blank). After receiving a commission from the Mexican government to settle the town, Joseph Vehlein, a German immigrant to Mexico, deeded to Robert Rankin, an American Revolutionary officer. This acreage included the site of Coldspring.

The settlement of Cold Springs (old spelling) began around 1850. In 1848, there had existed only a nearby trading post called &quot;Coonskin&quot; (later, &quot;Fireman&#x27;s Hill&quot;).

Coldspring had developed into a bustling county-seat town by 1915, but disaster struck on March 30, 1915 when the wooden courthouse burned, thus removing the economic foundation of the town. Plans for a new courthouse were made, and the present building was completed in 1918. The townspeople then moved their buildings to be closer to the new courthouse.

In 1983, San Jacinto County sheriff James Cecil &quot;Humpy&quot; Parker was convicted of six civil rights abuses of suspects using the form of torture called waterboarding and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. However, he served fewer than five before his medical release due to brain cancer; he died in 1994. Parker&#x27;s son and deputy, Gary, was convicted in 1984 of conspiracy to violate suspects&#x27; rights. These incidents were incorporated into a novel by Steven Sellers,
&quot;Terror on Highway 59&quot; in 1984, which in turn was made into a made-for-television movie, &quot;Terror on Highway 91&quot; (1989), starring 
Ricky Schroder.

<doc id="136560" wikidata="Q45939" url="?curid=136560" title="Collateral damage">
<text>&quot;Collateral damage&quot; is a term for any incidental and undesired death, injury or other damage inflicted, especially on civilians, as the result of an activity. Originally coined to describe military operations, it is now also used in non-military contexts to refer to negative unintended consequences of an action.

Since the development of precision-guided munitions in the 1970s, military forces often claim to have gone to great lengths to minimize collateral damage.

Critics of use of the term &quot;collateral damage&quot; see it as a euphemism that dehumanizes non-combatants killed or injured during combat, used to reduce the perceived culpability of military leadership in failing to prevent non-combatant casualties.

Collateral damage does not include civilian casualties caused by military operations that are intended to terrorize or kill enemy civilians (e.g., the bombing of Chongqing during World War II and Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure openly described as &quot;retaliatory&quot; and intended to &quot;make towns uninhabitable&quot;).

==Origins and usage==

The term &quot;collateral damage&quot; is often attributed to economist Thomas Schelling, who used it in his 1961 article &quot;Dispersal, Deterrence, and Damage&quot; published in &quot;Operations Research&quot;. In this article, Schelling discussed military strategies that inadvertently lead to the destruction of civilian areas, not directly targeted but affected by military actions intended to affect other strategic assets. The term came into usage during the Vietnam War and over several decades became entrenched in U.S. armed forces jargon.

During the 1991 Gulf War, Coalition forces used the phrase to describe the killing of civilians in attacks on legitimate military targets. According to Scottish linguist Deborah Cameron, &quot;the classic Orwellian arguments for finding this usage objectionable would be that
* it is jargon, and to the extent that people cannot decode it, it conceals what is actually going on;
* it is a euphemism; abstract, agentless, and affectless, so that even if people succeeded in associating it with a real act or event, they would be insulated from any feelings of repulsion or moral outrage&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;collateral damage&quot; () was named the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars. With this choice, it was criticized that the term had been used by NATO forces to describe civilian casualties during the Kosovo War, which the jury considered to be an inhuman euphemism.

==International humanitarian law==
Military necessity, along with distinction and proportionality, are three important principles of international humanitarian law, governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict. Offensives causing collateral damage are not automatically classed as a war crimes. They are war crimes when the objective is excessively or solely collateral damage.

Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, investigated allegations of war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and published an open letter containing his findings. A section titled &quot;Allegations concerning War Crimes&quot; elucidates this usage of &quot;military necessity&quot;, &quot;distinction&quot;, and &quot;proportionality&quot;:

==U.S. military approach==
The &quot;USAF Intelligence Targeting Guide&quot; defines the term as the &quot;unintentional damage or incidental damage affecting facilities, equipment, or personnel, occurring as a result of military actions directed against targeted enemy forces or facilities&quot;, stating that &quot;[s]uch damage can occur to friendly, neutral, and even enemy forces&quot;. Another United States Department of Defense document uses &quot;[u]nintentional or incidental injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military targets in the circumstances ruling at the time&quot;, which also states that &quot;[s]uch damage is not unlawful so long as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack&quot;.

In U.S. military terminology, the unintentional destruction of allied or neutral targets is called &quot;friendly fire&quot;.

The U.S. military follows a technology-based process for estimating and mitigating collateral damage. The software used is known as &quot;FAST-CD&quot; or &quot;Fast Assessment Strike Tool—Collateral Damage&quot;.

==Non-military uses of the phrase==
While not actually invented by the military, its use in military context has been common. However, the term has since been widely adopted for non-military cases, and in particular, the COVID-19 pandemic. A large number of medical, government sources and media use this term widely in relation to deaths caused indirectly as a result of government policy such as lockdowns, and not directly by the virus itself. Significant debate on the pandemic strategy has ensued, with some advocating restrictions such as lockdowns to save lives, where others claim the &#x27;collateral damage&#x27; caused by enforced lockdowns, masks and distancing may in fact cause more deaths over a longer term. An example is the Great Barrington Declaration, purportedly signed by 3500 medical and other professionals (and mentioned in UK parliament and media) has a FAQ page titled &#x27;Lockdowns and collateral damage&#x27;, and refers to this phrase several times.

The term has also been borrowed by the computing community to refer to the refusal of service to legitimate users when administrators take blanket preventative measures against some individuals who are abusing systems. For example, Realtime Blackhole Lists used to combat email spam generally block ranges of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses rather than individual IPs associated with spam, which can deny legitimate users within those ranges the ability to send email to some domains.

The related term &quot;collateral mortality&quot; has been presumed to derive from the term &quot;collateral damage&quot; and has been applied within military and non-military contexts. Fisheries are an example of this, where bycatch such as dolphins are called collateral mortality; they are species that die in the pursuit of the legal death of fishing targets, such as tuna.

<text>The Territoire de Belfort (; &quot;Territory of Belfort&quot;) is a department in the northeastern French region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. In 2020 it had a population of 140,120. The department, which encompasses a relatively small surface area of 609.4 km2 (235.3 sq mi), is located just southwest of the European Collectivity of Alsace. It also shares a border with the Swiss canton of Jura to the southeast. Its prefecture is Belfort.

==History==
The administrative district Territoire de Belfort was created under the terms of the 1871 Treaty of Frankfurt. The German Empire annexed almost all of Alsace, but the French were able to negotiate retention of the Territoire de Belfort which thereby was separated from the rest of Alsace (where it had been part of the department of Haut-Rhin). There were three principal reasons for this exceptional treatment:

* The population in and around Belfort was French-speaking.
* Belfort had demonstrated heroic resistance, under Colonel Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, to the German invasion. Belfort&#x27;s left-wing Catholic Deputy Émile Keller now conducted a similarly forceful political campaign in the National Assembly. He argued that ceding heroic Belfort to Germany after the war would be unthinkable.
* Since Belfort is situated in a relatively flat passage between the Vosges and Jura mountain ranges (known as the Belfort Gap), the Germans agreed to leave the city in France, because the Prussian military officers indicated that this strategy would give Germany a more defensible border.

After retaining its unique status as a for just over half a century, Belfort was officially recognized as France&#x27;s 90th department in 1922. France had recovered Alsace three years earlier, but the decision was taken not to reintegrate Belfort into its former department. There was talk of giving it a new departmental name, with suggestions that included &quot;Savoureuse&quot; (after the main river of the new department) or &quot;Mont-Terrible&quot; (the name of a former Napoleonic department embracing parts of Switzerland), but there was no consensus for a name change and the department continues to be known as the Territoire de Belfort.

When the regions of France were created, Belfort was not included in the region of Alsace, but the adjacent region of Franche-Comté, since January 2016 Bourgogne-Franche-Comté.

==Geography==
Geographers might contend that Belfort lies on the ridge that divides two regions of France, but before 1870 it was politically part of Alsace. However, in terms of the political regions established in 1982, the Territoire de Belfort has found itself in the Franche-Comté rather than Alsace.

The department has an area of only 609 km2 (235 sq. miles), being the fifth smallest of Metropolitan France (after Paris and its suburbs Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, and Val-de-Marne). It is slightly smaller than Saint Lucia or Jakarta, Indonesia.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Belfort, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 4 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Economy==
The median net income per household for the department in 2017 was €21,310. The averaged figure for the Territoire de Belfort masked relatively large disparities such as, in particular, that between Belfort itself at €17,920 and Bermont at €26,600.

==Population and demographics==
In 2019 the department recorded a population of 141,318. Of these, slightly more than 46,000 live in the commune of Belfort itself, which accounts more than 32% of the departmental population.

Four principal phases can be identified in the population trends during the two centuries between 1801 and 2000.
* the period from 1800 to 1872 was marked by steady economic development and a relatively high birth rate. However, the cholera epidemic which in 1851 arose from increasing urbanisation, along with a more general economic slow-down, reduced the rate of increase in the third quarter of the century. Between 1803 and 1872 the recorded population increased from 37,558 to 56,781.
* after the loss to Germany of most of Alsace in 1871, the Belfort population was boosted by the arrival of large numbers of refugees from &quot;Germanisation&quot;: the years between 1871 and 1914 saw the development of large factories, with the mechanical and textile sectors being prominent growth areas. The population increase and the economic development were at their most intense in the Belfort conglomeration itself. By 1911 the territoire&#x27;s population figure stood at 101,392.
* in the years between 1914 and 1945 the economic narrative was dominated by two world wars and the period of stagnation that came between them. Population declined, having slipped to 86,648 in 1946.
* after 1945 the region became a focus for industrial growth: population levels followed the same rising trend, to stand at 131,999 in 1982. Nevertheless, as in many parts of France, from about 1980 it was clear that the economic crisis of the 1970s was having a lasting effect in slowing the pace of expansion.

==Administration==
Its departmental code is 90, and its prefecture (capital) is Belfort. There is a single arrondissement (Belfort), which is subdivided into 9 cantons and thence into 101 communes.

==Politics==
The president of the Departmental Council is Florian Bouquet, first elected in 2015.

<doc id="136566" wikidata="Q183399" url="?curid=136566" title="Financial Times">
<text>The Financial Times (FT) is a British daily newspaper printed in broadsheet and also published digitally that focuses on business and economic current affairs. Based in London, the paper is owned by a Japanese holding company, Nikkei, with core editorial offices across Britain, the United States and continental Europe. In July 2015, Pearson sold the publication to Nikkei for £844 million (US$1.32 billion) after owning it since 1957. In 2019, it reported one million paying subscriptions, three-quarters of which were digital subscriptions. In 2023, it was reported to have 1.3 million subscribers of which 1.2 million were digital. The newspaper has a prominent focus on financial journalism and economic analysis rather than generalist reporting, drawing both criticism and acclaim. It sponsors an annual book award and publishes a &quot;Person of the Year&quot; feature.

The paper was founded in January 1888 as the London Financial Guide before rebranding a month later as the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. It was first circulated around metropolitan London by James Sheridan, who, along with his brother and Horatio Bottomley, sought to report on city business opposite the &quot;Financial News&quot;. The succeeding half-century of competition between the two papers eventually culminated in a 1945 merger, led by Brendan Bracken, which established it as one of the largest business newspapers in the world.

Globalisation from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries facilitated editorial expansion for the &quot;FT&quot;, with the paper adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, readers&#x27; letters, book reviews, technology articles and global politics features. The paper is often characterised by its light-pink (salmon) newsprint. It is supplemented by its lifestyle magazine (&quot;FT Magazine)&quot;, weekend edition (&quot;FT Weekend&quot;) and some industry publications.

The editorial stance of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; centres on economic liberalism, particularly advocacy of free trade and free markets. Since its founding, it has supported liberal democracy, favouring classically liberal politics and policies from international governments; its newsroom is independent from its editorial board, and it is considered a newspaper of record. Due to its history of economic commentary, the &quot;FT&quot; publishes a variety of financial indices, primarily the FTSE All-Share Index. Since the late 20th century, its typical depth of coverage has linked the paper with a white-collar, educated, and financially literate readership. Because of this tendency, the &quot;FT&quot; has traditionally been regarded as a centrist to centre-right liberal, neo-liberal, and conservative-liberal newspaper. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; is headquartered in Bracken House at 1 Friday Street, near the city&#x27;s financial centre, where it maintains its publishing house, corporate centre, and main editorial office.

==History==

The &quot;FT&quot; was launched as the &quot;London Financial Guide&quot; on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the &quot;Financial Times&quot; on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of &quot;The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator&quot;, it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London, its only rival being the more daring and slightly older (founded in 1884) &quot;Financial News&quot;. On 2 January 1893 the &quot;FT&quot; began printing on light pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named &quot;Financial News&quot;: at the time, it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as &quot;The Sporting Times&quot;, had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.

The Berry brothers, Lord Camrose and Gomer Berry (later Lord Kemsley), purchased the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 1919.

In 1945, Brendan Bracken purchased the &quot;Financial Times&quot; from Lord Camrose, and, following 57 years of rivalry, merged it with the &quot;Financial News&quot; to form a single six-page newspaper. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; had a higher circulation, while the &quot;Financial News&quot; provided much of the editorial talent. The &quot;Lex&quot; column was also introduced from &quot;Financial News&quot;.

Gordon Newton, a Cambridge graduate, took over as editor in 1949, and immediately introduced a policy (then most unusual in Fleet Street) of direct recruitment of new university graduates, mainly from Oxbridge, as its trainee journalists. Many of them proceeded to have distinguished careers elsewhere in journalism and British public life and became the mainstay of the paper&#x27;s own editorial strengths until the 1990s. The first such &#x27;direct recruit&#x27; was future leading British economist Andrew Shonfield; the second was (later Sir) William Rees-Mogg who went on, via &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, to edit &quot;The Times&quot; in 1967 following its acquisition by Roy Thomson. Other FT Oxbridge recruits included the future Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. The &quot;FT&quot;″s distinctive recruitment policy for Fleet Street journalists was never popular with the National Union of Journalists and ceased in 1966 following the recruitment of Richard Lambert from Oxford, himself a future Editor of the &quot;FT&quot;. Meanwhile, Pearson had bought the paper in 1957.

Over the years, the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the world economy towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the &quot;FT&quot; began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first &quot;FT&quot; (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt; printing in the U.S. began in July 1985. Since then, with increased international coverage, the &quot;FT&quot; has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.

The European edition is distributed throughout continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe, reporting on matters concerning the European Union, the euro and European corporate affairs. In 1994 &quot;FT&quot; launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, &quot;How To Spend It&quot;. In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine. On 13 May 1995 the &quot;Financial Times&quot; group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage. The second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000, the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to the changes online. &quot;FT&quot; introduced subscription services in 2002. &quot;FT.com&quot; is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription.

In 1997, the &quot;FT&quot; launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the &quot;FT&quot; became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK. In 2000 the &quot;Financial Times&quot; started publishing a German-language edition, &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot;, with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, Gruner + Jahr. In January 2008 the &quot;FT&quot; sold its 50% stake to its German partner. &quot;FT Deutschland&quot; never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of €250 million over 12 years. It closed on 7 December 2012. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; launched a new weekly supplement for the fund management industry on 4 February 2002. &quot;FT fund management&quot; (FTfm) was and still is distributed with the paper every Monday. FTfm is the world&#x27;s largest-circulation fund management title. Since 2005 the &quot;FT&quot; has sponsored the annual &quot;Financial Times&quot; Business Book of the Year Award.

On 23 April 2007, the &quot;FT&quot; unveiled a &quot;refreshed&quot; version of the newspaper and introduced a new slogan, &quot;We Live in Financial Times&quot;. In 2007 the &quot;FT&quot; pioneered a metered paywall, which let visitors to its website read a limited number of free articles during any one month before asking them to pay. Four years later the &quot;FT&quot; launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com. In 2012, the number of digital subscribers surpassed the circulation of the newspaper for the first time and the &quot;FT&quot; drew almost half of its revenue from subscriptions rather than advertising.

The &quot;FT&quot; has been available on Bloomberg Terminal since 2010 and on the Wisers platform since 2013. From 2015, instead of the metered paywall on the website, visitors were given unlimited free access for one month, after which they needed to subscribe. Pearson sold the Financial Times Group to Nikkei, Inc. for £844 million (US$1.32 billion) in July 2015.

In 2016, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; acquired a controlling stake in Alpha Grid, a London-based media company specialising in the development and production of quality branded content across a range of channels, including broadcast, video, digital, social and events. In 2018, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; acquired a controlling stake in Longitude, a specialist provider of thought leadership and research services to a multinational corporate and institutional client base. This investment built on the &quot;Financial Times&quot;″ recent growth in several business areas, including branded content via the acquisition of Alpha Grid, and conferences and events through &quot;Financial Times Live&quot; and extends the &quot;FT&quot; traditional commercial offering into a wider set of integrated services. In 2020, reporter Mark Di Stefano resigned from the &quot;Financial Times&quot; after hacking into Zoom calls at other media organisations including &quot;The Independent&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In 2020, the retraction of an opinion piece by a reporter for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; generated a controversy about the editorial independence of the paper from outside political pressure. The controversy followed the withdrawal by the newspaper&#x27;s editor of an opinion piece by &quot;FT&quot; Brussels correspondent Mehreen Khan that was critical of French President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s policy towards Muslim minorities in France. The piece was withdrawn from the &quot;FT&quot; website on the same day as its publication. President Macron subsequently published a letter in the &quot;FT&quot; directly responding to the arguments of the original opinion piece, even if the original opinion piece was no longer available on the website of the newspaper. The editor of the &quot;FT&quot;, Roula Khalaf, who took the decision to withdraw the initial article, acknowledged having been contacted by the Élysée Palace regarding the article, and defended her decision on the basis purely of several factual errors in the original piece by Mehreen Khan.

===Wirecard exposé===

In January 2019, the &quot;FT&quot; began a series of investigative articles detailing fraud suspicions at German payments group Wirecard. When the Wirecard share price plunged, German news media speculated that market manipulation was behind this attack on a German corporate, focusing on the lead author of the &quot;FT&quot; series, Dan McCrum. The Public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Munich subsequently launched an investigation. After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the responsible state&#x27;s attorney announced investigations into several &quot;FT&quot; journalists.

On 22 June 2020 and after 18 months of investigations and an external audit, Wirecard announced that €1.9 billion worth of cash reported in its accounts &quot;may not exist&quot;. The company subsequently filed for insolvency. BaFin itself became subject of a European Securities and Markets Authority investigation for its response to the scandal.

=== Fossil fuel advertising ===
An investigation by the Intercept, the Nation, and DeSmog found that &quot;FT&quot; is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry. Journalists who cover climate change for &quot;FT&quot; are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis.

==Audience==
According to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits among most senior financial decision makers in the world&#x27;s largest financial institutions, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (&quot;WSJ&quot;), its main rival. &quot;The Economist&quot;, which was once 50% owned by &quot;FT&quot;, reaches 32%. &quot;FT&quot; &quot;The Banker&quot; also proved vital reading, reaching 24%. In addition, in 2010 the &quot;FT&quot; was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. &quot;The Economist&quot; was rated the third-most-credible title by most influential professional investors, while the &quot;WSJ&quot; was second.

In 2022, the &quot;FT&quot; launched FT Edit, a low-price app aimed at attracting a younger audience.

==Content==
The &quot;FT&quot; is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from &quot;FT&quot; journalists such as Martin Wolf, Gillian Tett and Edward Luce, and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators.

The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles. In 2021 and 2022, the outlet began focusing more on the cryptocurrency industry, launching a Digital Assets Dashboard, publishing multi-asset crypto indexes, starting a Cryptofinance newsletter dedicated to digital assets, and recruiting more journalists to cover the sector. About 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the United Kingdom.

===The &quot;Lex&quot; column===
The &quot;Lex&quot; column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The &quot;FT&quot; calls &quot;Lex&quot; its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for &quot;Lex Mercatoria&quot;, a Latin expression meaning literally &quot;merchant law&quot;. It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the &quot;Financial News&quot; in the 1930s, and moved to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; when the two merged.

&quot;Lex&quot; boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government—including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England&#x27;s monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild&#x27;s), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).

==&quot;FT Weekend&quot;==
The &quot;FT&quot; publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper titled the &quot;Financial Times Weekend&quot;. It consists of international economic and political news, &quot;Companies &amp; Markets&quot;, &quot;Life &amp; Arts&quot;, &quot;House &amp; Home&quot; and &quot;FT Magazine&quot;.

===&quot;HTSI&quot;===
HTSI (originally &quot;How to Spend It&quot;) is a weekly magazine published with &quot;FT Weekend&quot;. Founded and launched by Julia Carrick with Lucia van der Post as founding editor, its articles concern luxury goods such as yachts, mansions, apartments, horlogerie, haute couture and automobiles, as well as fashion and columns by individuals in the arts, gardening, food, and hotel and travel industries. &quot;How to Spend It&quot; started in 1967 as a one-page consumer goods feature in the newspaper, which was edited by Sheila Black, the &quot;FT&quot; first female journalist, a former actor. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, &quot;FT&quot; launched the online version of this publication on 3 October 2009.

Some media commentators were taken aback by the online launch of a website supporting conspicuous consumption during the financial austerity of the late-2000s recession. The magazine has been derided in rival publishers&#x27; blogs, as &quot;repellent&quot; in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; and &quot;a latter-day &quot;Ab Fab&quot; manual&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. A &#x27;well-thumbed&#x27; copy of the supplement was found when rebel forces broke into Colonel Gaddafi&#x27;s Tripoli compound during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.

In September 2021, an Arabic version of &quot;HTSI&quot; was launched by Othman Al Omeir, founder of &quot;Elaph&quot; online newspaper. &quot;HTSI Arabic&quot; is published in London.

The name of the magazine was changed in 2022 from &quot;How to Spend It&quot; to &quot;HTSI&quot;.

==Editorial stance==

The &quot;FT&quot; advocates free markets, and is in favour of globalisation. During the 1980s, it supported Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s monetarist policies. It has supported the UK Labour Party in the past, including at the general election in 1992 when Neil Kinnock was Labour leader. The &quot;FT&quot; editorials tend to be pro-European. The &quot;FT&quot; was firmly opposed to the Iraq War. Due to its advocacy of free markets and free trade, it is often identified as centrist to centre-right in its political positions.

The modern &quot;FT&quot; is a product of a merger of two smaller newspapers in 1945; since that time, the paper had backed the Conservatives fairly consistently, but Labour&#x27;s tacking to the centre, combined with the Conservatives&#x27; embrace of Euroscepticism, led the &quot;FT&quot; to reverse course and back Labour from 1992 until 2010, when the &quot;FT&quot; returned to the Conservative Party. Euroscepticism further drove a wedge between the &quot;FT&quot; and the Conservatives in 2019, when the paper refused to make an endorsement, opposed to Labour&#x27;s socialist economic policies (for wanting to &quot;reverse, not revise, the Thatcherite revolution of the 1980s&quot;) and the Conservatives&#x27; commitment to a hard Brexit.

In respect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FT commentator Martin Wolf expressed support for Ukraine. 
Two years before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the FT offered an interview to the Russian President Vladimir Putin. The interview received praise, as it offered an unusual access to the Russian leader&#x27;s thinking. President Putin used the interview to state his opinions about the value of liberal democracy. The Ukrainian newspaper Kyiv Post accused the FT of asking President Putin softball questions, and said the interviewers failed to hold Putin to account.

=== United Kingdom politics ===
In the 2010 general election, the &quot;FT&quot; was receptive to the Liberal Democrats&#x27; positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour Party leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global 2007–2008 financial crisis, but on balance it backed the Conservatives, while questioning their tendency to Euroscepticism.

In the 2015 general election, the &quot;FT&quot; called for the continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years. In the 2017 general election, an &quot;FT&quot; editorial reluctantly backed Conservative Theresa May over Labour Jeremy Corbyn, while warning about her stance on immigration and the Eurosceptic elements in her party. The &quot;FT&quot; declared 2019 general election a &quot;fateful election&quot; that &quot;offers no good choices&quot;. In the 2024 general election, the &quot;FT&quot; endorsed the Labour Party again, expressing the need for a &quot;fresh start&quot;, while cautioning &quot;Labour&#x27;s interventionist instincts and fervour for regulation&quot;.

===United States politics===
In the 2008 United States presidential election, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; endorsed Barack Obama. While it raised concerns over hints of protectionism, it praised his ability to &quot;engage the country&#x27;s attention&quot;, his calls for a bipartisan politics, and his plans for &quot;comprehensive health-care reform&quot;. The &quot;FT&quot; favoured Obama again in the 2012 United States presidential election. The &quot;FT&quot; endorsed Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election, Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election, and Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Ownership and related publications==

On 23 July 2015, Nikkei, Inc. agreed to buy the Financial Times Group, a division of Pearson plc since 1957, for £844m (US$1.32 billion) and the acquisition was completed on 30 November 2015. Under the transaction agreement, Pearson retained the publishing rights to FT Press and licensed the trademark from Nikkei. Until August 2015 the FT group had a 50% shareholding in &quot;The Economist&quot;, which was sold to the Agnelli family for £469 million. Related publications include the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, FT.com, FT Search Inc., the publishing imprint FT Press and numerous joint ventures. In November 2013 it agreed to sell Mergermarket, an online intelligence reporting business, to the London private equity investor BC Partners. In addition, the FT Group has a unit called FT Specialist, which is a provider of specialist information on retail, personal and institutional finance segments. It publishes &quot;The Banker&quot;, &quot;Money Management&quot; and &quot;FT Adviser&quot; (a publication targeted to the financial intermediary market), &quot;fDi Intelligence&quot; and &quot;Professional Wealth Management&quot; (PWM). In 2023, FT Specialist acquired a majority stake in medical publisher Endpoints News.

The Financial Times Group announced the beta launch of newssift, part of FT Search, in March 2009. Newssift.com is a next-generation search tool for business professionals that indexes millions of articles from thousands of global business news sources, not just the &quot;FT&quot;. The Financial Times Group acquired Money Media (an online news and commentary site for the industry) and Exec-Appointments (an online recruitment specialist site for the executive jobs market). The FT Group once had a 13.85% stake in Business Standard Ltd of India, the publisher of the &quot;Business Standard&quot;. It sold this stake in April 2008 and has entered into an agreement with Network 18 to launch the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in India, though it is speculated that they may find it difficult to do so, as the brand &#x27;Financial Times&#x27; in India is owned by The Times Group, the publisher of &quot;The Times of India&quot; and &quot;The Economic Times&quot;. The group also publishes America&#x27;s Intelligence Wire, a daily general newswire service.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; Financial Publishing division (formerly FT Business) provides print and online content for retail, personal and institutional finance audiences. Examples of publications and services include: &quot;Investors Chronicle&quot;, a personal finance magazine and website; &quot;FT Money&quot;, a weekly personal finance supplement in &quot;FT Weekend&quot;; &quot;FT Wealth&quot;, a magazine for the global high-net-worth community and FTfm, a weekly review of the global fund management industry, &quot;Money Management&quot; and &quot;FT Adviser&quot;. The institutional segment includes: &quot;The Banker&quot;, &quot;This Is Africa&quot;, &quot;fDi&quot; &quot;Intelligence&quot; and &quot;Professional Wealth Management&quot; (PWM). Money-Media, a separate arm of Financial Publishing, delivers a range of digital information services for fund management professionals around the globe, including: Ignites, Ignites Europe, Ignites Asia, FundFire and BoardIQ. Financial Publishing includes publications (&quot;Pensions Expert&quot; and &quot;Deutsche Pensions &amp; Investmentnachrichten&quot;) and events (&quot;Investment Expert&quot;) for the European pensions industry. The group also publishes MandateWire, a financial information company that provides sales and market intelligence for investment professionals in North America, Europe and Asia.

FT Knowledge is an associated company which offers educational products and services. FT Knowledge has offered the &quot;Introducing the City&quot; course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000. FT Predict is an editorial service on forecasted economic events hosted by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki&#x27;s &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;, this contest allows people to use forecasted economic events to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; also ran a business-related game called &quot;In the Pink&quot; (a phrase meaning &quot;in good health&quot;, also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase &quot;in the red&quot; meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest profit when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of £10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.

In 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; announced it was investing in &quot;Sifted&quot;, a digital-only news site and newsletter covering European startups. The &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; initial 25% stake was subsequently diluted to 14% due to later investments from others. This marked the start of a planned 7-year strategic relationship with Sifted.
==Indices==

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former &quot;Financial News Index&quot;, started on 1 July 1935 by the &quot;Financial News&quot;. The &quot;FT&quot; published a similar index; this was replaced by the &quot;Financial News Index&quot; — which was then renamed the &quot;Financial Times (FT) Index&quot; — on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP), British-American Tobacco, Lever Brothers (later Unilever) and Shell. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.

The FTSE All-Share Index, the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation. The letters &quot;F-T-S-E&quot; represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the &quot;Financial Times&quot; (F-T) and the London Stock Exchange (S-E). On 13 February 1984 the FTSE 100 was introduced, representing about eighty per cent of the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s value. FTSE Group was made an independent company in 1995. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and San Francisco in 2001, Madrid in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.

Other well-known FTSE indices include the FTSE 350 Index, the FTSE SmallCap Index, the FTSE AIM UK 50 Index and FTSE AIM 100 Index as well as the FTSE AIM All-Share Index for stocks, and the FTSE UK Gilt Indices for government bonds.

In 2021, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; started publishing three multi-asset indexes with Wilshire Associates covering combinations of the top five cryptocurrencies.

==People==
In July 2006, the &quot;FT&quot; announced a &quot;New Newsroom&quot; project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs. A number of former &quot;FT&quot; journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson, previously the paper&#x27;s US managing editor, was the editor of &quot;The Times&quot; and is now the chief executive of News Corporation. Will Lewis, a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the &quot;FT&quot;, edited &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Dominic Lawson went on to become editor of the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; until he was dismissed in 2005. Andrew Adonis, a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the House of Lords after the 2005 election. Ed Balls became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in July 2007. Bernard Gray, a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot;. David Jones, at one time the &quot;FT&quot;″s Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper&#x27;s transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.

Sir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997. He continues his work there. During his tenure at the &quot;FT&quot; he had to deal with rapid technological change and issues related to it, for example repetitive strain injury (RSI), which affected dozens of &quot;FT&quot; journalists, reporters and staff in the late 1980s.

<text>Mathis is a city in San Patricio County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,333 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1887, when the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad was laying tracks across San Patricio County, Thomas H. Mathis received naming rights when he donated for a townsite and school. Mathis and his brother J. M. Mathis, held in the vicinity. The brothers had dropped out of the Coleman, Mathis, Fulton Cattle Company in 1879. Thomas Mathis owned an additional around Mathis and built a fence enclosing the town. As late as 1906, Mathis was enclosed and arriving and departing trains had to be let in and out.

Mathis&#x27; success was partially fueled by residents of Lagarto moving to be near the railroad. The Mathis post office opened in 1890 and the town&#x27;s first school was held in a private residence in 1893. Two years later, a one-room school was built, and in 1913, a second railroad (the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Pacific) arrived.

Cotton and corn crops were raised and ranching was an important part of the economy. During the 1930s, winter vegetable crops were grown and both railroads maintained shipping sheds. Mathis incorporated in 1939.

In the early 1950s, of land two miles (3 km) north of town were developed for vegetable crops—complete with irrigation and deep-water wells. Cotton, corn, and sorghum replaced vegetables in the 1960s.

In the 1930s, the Nueces River was dammed and Lake Mathis (since renamed Lake Corpus Christi) was formed. Construction of the Wesley Seale Dam in the late 1950s raised the level of the lake to where it became desirable for weekend homes.

In 1988, Mathis had a population of 5,910 which has since decreased to 5,034.
The game mode &quot;Longshot&quot; in &quot;Madden 18&quot; and &quot;19&quot; is set primarily in Mathis.

==Lake Corpus Christi (Lake Mathis)==

Lake Corpus Christi is a reservoir on the Nueces River, lying northwest of Mathis. The lake is a recreational spot in South Texas offering swimming, skiing, boating, and fishing. Large areas of submerged brush in the upper reaches of this lake provide prime fish habitat. All fishing is good, but it is noted for its excellent catfish—channels, flatheads, and blues; the record is a flathead weighing . Also, the lake is noted for its white, black, and striped bass, sunfish, and crappie. The record largemouth bass weighed .

The area is a winter home for hundreds of winter Texans from all parts of the state and country, as well as Canada.

Around its more than of shoreline, numerous camps and parks provide campsites, boat ramps, fishing piers, and RV and mobile home areas. A main attraction is Lake Corpus Christi State Park, whose surround a cove, protected from the prevailing southeasterly winds by high limestone cliffs, and provide a scenic view of the main body of the lake. Favorable climate offers opportunities for year-round activities.

History abounds in the area, with former battlegrounds now lush with farmland, brush, and grass for grazing cattle. The Nueces River at one time divided Texas from Mexico. It was a much-disputed boundary, and only after the Mexican War was the issue was settled, making the Rio Grande the official boundary. One of the more famous battles between the two countries was fought at Old San Patricio, founded by the Irish and located south of Mathis. The area, once inhabited by Karankawa and Lipan Apache Indians, became the site of several unsuccessful settlement attempts in the 18th and 19th centuries.

<text>Richland Springs is a town located in San Saba County, Texas, United States. The population was 244 in 2020.

==History==

Richland Springs developed in the nineteenth century as a supply and processing center for local cotton growers and cattlemen. Jackson J. Brown and his family settled near the springs on Richland Springs Creek (then known as Richland Creek) in December 1854 and were soon followed by the Tankersley and Duncan families. A private fort, Fort Duncan, was established near the springs in the late 1850s when trouble arose with Indians on the frontier, but it apparently fell into disuse shortly thereafter. The Brown School was constructed in 1868 and named for the neighborhood&#x27;s original settler. The area attracted settlers through the 1870s, and in 1877 a Richland Springs post office opened in the store of Samuel E. Hays. 

The community took its name from the nearby springs and from local enthusiasm for the agricultural promise of the region. By 1890, local production of cotton, grains, and livestock supported a settlement of 150 residents, including a justice of the peace precinct, a constabulary, and several commercial and craft businesses. A local newspaper, the Eye-Witness, began publication in 1905. Not long after, the First State Bank was organized, and in 1911 completion of a trunk line for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway linked the town with the main line between Galveston and Amarillo. 

Richland Springs incorporated in 1932 and adopted a mayor-council form of city government. With a population nearing 500 and as many as forty businesses, the town prospered until the onset of the Great Depression. World War II reversed the decline of the 1930s, and by the early 1950s residents numbered 600. The number of businesses still had not returned to predepression levels when a three-year drought in the mid-1950s crippled the local economy again. The town&#x27;s only bank failed, and within a decade its residential and business populations had fallen by nearly half. An uneven recovery from the nadir of the 1960s was based on the production of local fruit and nut growers. In 1982, the town reported 420 residents and five businesses; by 1986 the number of businesses had risen to eight. In 1990, the population was 344. The population was 350 in 2000.

==Economy==
Pecans emerged as an important crop, largely because of the work of Edmund E. Risien, an Englishman who moved to San Saba County in 1874, and made improvement of the native nuts his life&#x27;s work. Risien founded the West Texas Pecan Nursery at the junction of the San Saba and Colorado rivers. The &quot;Mother Pecan Tree&quot;, located in the heart of this orchard, has been used to produce many great pecan varieties. Some of these include the San Saba Improved, Texas Prolific, Onliwon, Squirrel Delight, No. 60, and Western Schley, and these are just a few of the varieties this tree has produced.

Risien&#x27;s customer base included Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and the Post Cereals Co. He is credited for laying the groundwork for the pecan industry that led San Saba County to proclaim itself &quot;Pecan Capital of the World&quot;.

==Education==

The City of San Saba is served by the San Saba Independent School District. Its schools include San Saba Elementary, serving students in kindergarten-grade 4; San Saba Middle School, serving grades 5–8; and San Saba High School, grades 9–12. The school district opened two new facilities in October 2013: an elementary building meant to host all elementary grades under one roof, and a set of science labs in a building immediately across from the main entrance to the high school.

==History==
Hermleigh&#x27;s history begins in 1907 when a townsite was surveyed on land donated by two men named R. C. Herm and Harry W. Harlin near the small community of Wheat. Citizens chose to name their new community &quot;Hermlin&quot; (an amalgam of the surnames of the two landowners) but this name was rejected by postal officials as being too close to the nearby town of Hamlin, potentially causing confusion between the two communities. The compromise of &quot;Hermleigh&quot; was settled upon, and the post office opened shortly thereafter. The Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway was built through the new community, and residents of Wheat began to relocate to Hermleigh.

In 1911 the Santa Fe Railroad reached the community, and Hermleigh developed into a shipping point and trading center for local ranchers and cotton farmers. A school opened to serve area students in 1913, and by the late 1910s the community had its own newspaper (the Hermleigh &quot;Herald&quot;). Hermleigh briefly changed its name in the late 1910s to Foch to honor the French field marshal and World War I hero Ferdinand Foch, but reverted to the original name shortly thereafter and continued to flourish until the early 1930s, when the effects of the Great Depression brought an end to Hermleigh&#x27;s growth.

Though adversely effected by the Depression, Hermleigh remained stable throughout most of the twentieth century and by 1980 was home to over 700 residents. By 1990, however, the population had fallen dramatically to approximately 200 and some of the remaining businesses closed down. The community inexplicably rebounded during the 1990s, with the population reaching 393 by the 2000 Census.

Hermleigh is the hometown of former head coach of the Baylor Bears football program, Grant Teaff.

The most expensive pig ever sold was owned by a Hermleigh resident. Jefferey Roemisch of Hermleigh sold his cross-breed barrow named &quot;Bud&quot; for a record-breaking $56,000 in 1983 to a man named Bud Olson and his partner, Phil Bonzio.

==Education==
The community of Hermleigh is served by the Hermleigh Independent School District.

<text>Snyder is a city in, and the county seat of Scurry County, Texas, United States. The population was 11,438 at the 2020 census. The city is located in the lower part of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region.

==History==
Snyder is named for merchant and buffalo hunter William Henry (Pete) Snyder, who built a trading post on Deep Creek in 1878. It soon drew fellow hunters, and a small settlement grew up around the post. The nature of those early dwellings, mostly constructed of buffalo hide and tree branches, led to the community&#x27;s first, if unofficial, name of &quot;Hide Town&quot;. Another early name, &quot;Robber&#x27;s Roost&quot;, is said to owe its beginnings to the sometimes nefarious nature of a few residents and a lack of law enforcement. A statue of an albino buffalo on the grounds of the Scurry County Courthouse in Snyder pays homage to the town&#x27;s beginnings as a buffalo-trading post.

Snyder antedates Scurry County by two years, with a town plan being drawn up in 1882, while the county was not organized until 1884. A population of 600 was reported in 1892, with a school, two churches, a grist mill, steam gin, two banks, and two weekly newspapers being part of the community. Significant change happened in 1907 when Snyder was granted a city charter, and construction began on the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway. The 1910 census indicated Snyder had grown to a population of 2,514. The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway tracks reached Snyder in 1911, spurring further growth. Ranching and farming were the primary economic backbone of Snyder through the first half of the 20th century.

This changed in 1948, when oil was discovered in the Canyon Reef area north of town. Snyder became a boomtown, as the population jumped to about 12,000 in just a year&#x27;s time. By the time the boom ended in 1951, an estimated peak population of 16,000 had been reached. This soon decreased to the 10,000 to 11,000 level and stabilized. Although the boom was over, oil still remained a vital part of the local economy, with the Snyder area being one of the leading oil-producing areas in Texas. In 1973, the one-billionth barrel of oil was pumped from the nearby oil fields.

An industrial base was established in the 1960s and early 1970s, diversifying the town&#x27;s economy and making it less susceptible to cycles of boom and bust. Higher education came to Snyder in 1971 with the founding of Western Texas College.

The Scurry County Coliseum in Snyder, operated by Western Texas College since 2008, is a large arena which hosts area events. Outside the coliseum is a locomotive engine and a small restored historic village. Also located in Snyder is the Diamond M Museum. Established by local oilman and rancher Clarence T. McLaughlin, the museum houses over 80 bronze works and 200 paintings. Among the collection are works by Peter Hurd and Andrew Wyeth.

==&quot;Fort Griffin Fandangle&quot;==

Since 1938, Texas&#x27; oldest outdoor musical, the &quot;Fort Griffin Fandangle&quot;, has been presented during the last two weekends of June in the Prairie Theater about historic Fort Griffin, a military outpost established in 1867 near Albany and now a state park. The program, the content of which is different each year, attempts to recapture the theatrical charm of the American West.

The show offers covered wagons and buggies, a stagecoach, a replica of the first Texas Central Railroad train, an oil derrick, and cowboys whose ancestors pushed Longhorn herds up the nearby Great Western Cattle Trail. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; describes &quot;Fandangle&quot;, accordingly: &quot;as professional as a multimillion dollar Broadway musical, with sets and costumes to match, with a cast of three hundred&quot;. The &quot;Abilene Reporter-News&quot; calls the program &quot;Frontier history served up with genuine earthiness, spiced by rare humor.&quot;

<text>Moran is a city in southeast Shackelford County, Texas, United States. The population was 226 at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==

Moran is situated at the intersection of Texas State Highway 6 and Farm to Market 576 approximately 15 miles southeast of Albany, 18 miles northwest of Cisco, 29 miles southwest of Breckenridge, and 42 miles east-northeast of Abilene. Nearby creeks include Deep Creek, Post Oak Creek, Battle Creek, and Hubbard Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.4 square mile (1.1 km2), all land.

== History ==

Pioneers came to this area as early as the 1860s. During the Civil War (1861–1865), they built the temporary fortress settlement of Mugginsville on Deep Creek 5 miles north of the future town site of Moran. At one time, a branch of the Western Cattle Trail passed nearby. Population increased after the arrival of the Texas Central Railroad in 1881. Hulltown, the original name of the town, was established by Mary and George Washington &quot;Swope&quot; Hull of McDowell, Virginia, who opened a general store at the rail crossing on Deep Creek in 1883. Hull (1849–1911) was the first postmaster. He bought 160 acres between Post Oak and Deep Creeks and platted a town site in March 1884 (he and his family would later move to Oakland, California). Most of the property was bought by Bem Scott, a real estate developer from Indiana, who eventually sold his interests in 1890 to Matthew D. Bray (1845–1926), a prominent local merchant and landowner. For unknown reasons, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Hicks in 1890. Later, in order to secure a new railroad depot, the town was renamed a third and final time to Moran in 1892 for Texas Central Railroad owner Charles Moran of New York.

By 1900, the community had several businesses, a school and Baptist, Church of Christ, Cumberland Presbyterian, and Methodist congregations. A newspaper was begun in 1895 and bank in 1902. In November 1910, the Cottle No. 1 natural gas well discovery opened the nearby Moran Field, and was the first commercial gas well completed in this vast west Texas area. In the spring of 1911, gas was piped to Moran for residential and business use. Within two years (in 1913) the cities of Albany, Cisco, and Abilene were supplied for the first time with natural gas. By October 1913, with five producing gas wells, the Moran Field won recognition as one of the most important sources of fossil fuels in Texas. For the next fifteen years, oil and gas discoveries in the area made Moran a boom town with a peak population of 5,000–10,000 at one point in the 1920s. By the 1930s, the boom was over and the population gradually began its decline to the present day. &quot;Note: much of the information above comes from the local historical markers to the town and to the Cottle No. 1 gas well.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Moran achieved fame as the home of the National Fajita Cook-off, which brought thousands of visitors from all over the world to the sleepy town. In the 2000s, Moran became home to Slide Fire Solutions, a multi-million dollar bump stock production company. The local economy remains tied to farming, ranching, and oil and gas production.

Local Texas historical markers are devoted to: Moran (#3468), Cottle No. 1 Natural Gas Well (#1076), Granville E. Waters (#13204), Moran Cemetery (#17708), and Moran Church of Christ (#17SF02).

==History==
Shelby County was one of the original 13 counties in Texas, being organized by the Republic of Texas Congress in 1837. The county was named for Isaac Shelby, an American military hero and governor of Kentucky. Shelby County eventually became one of the most populous and prosperous counties in the state because of its proximity to Louisiana and location along the Sabine River.

The settlement which eventually became the City of Center was originally called White Cottage. A post office was established at this settlement on April 6, 1848.

Al Johnson, an East Texas State Representative, introduced a bill to have all county seats be as close to the center of the county as possible. R.L. Parker, the County Clerk at the time, arranged to have the county surveyed and the center located. The originally county seat was Shelbyville, Texas located approximately from White Cottage. However, one night in 1866, a group of men led by Parker entered into the court house and stole all of the records and took them to a log cabin near White Cottage. Shortly after the incident, the community became known as Center, primarily to reflect the requisite location of the county seat.

The Center post office opened in October 1866. In 1869, Confederate veterans Captain Jesse Amason and James C. Wilson, with wife Margaret Davis Wilson, each donated of land for the townsite of Center. According to one historical account, Amason would not give the land unless the new town would have a town square, and that is the reason that Center has such a large square. Mr. Wilson owned considerable land in the southern quarter of the town. Much of that area is called the &quot;Wilson Addition&quot;.

On the night of May 31, 1882, a fire erupted at the courthouse and the building was a complete loss. The county contracted with J.J. E. Gibson, an Irish immigrant, to construct a new courthouse and jail. When the bond of builders J.J. E. Gibson and Pat McLaughlin for the sum of $26,725 was issued in 1884 for them to erect a new courthouse for Shelby County, the firm of Wilson and Martin was among the securities. The courthouse, modeled after an Irish castle, was completed in November, 1885 and is still standing as the centerpiece of the Center Square.

The town of Center made national news twice in 1920s for the lynchings of black murder suspects without a trial. On August 3, 1920, Lige Daniels was seized by an angry mob that broke into the Shelby County Jail, where he was being held on charges of the beating death of a woman. Daniels, an 18-year old black man, was dragged out and hanged from a tree in front of the courthouse, famous as the &quot;Center Hanging Oak&quot;. The oak tree was used again as a gallows on May 21, 1928, when another mob intercepted another 18-year old African-American, accused murderer Eolis Evans, as he was being returned to the county jail. The &quot;hanging oak&quot; tree itself died in 1990 and was cut down.

At noon on February 12, 1950, an F3 tornado touched down in Center, destroying several buildings. The tornado killed three and injured at least 15 people.

==Events==
The city celebrates a county wide Watermelon Festival in July and the East Texas Poultry Festival in October each year. The poultry festival is accompanied by the Poultry Festival Pageant in which high school Juniors of the county participate. The Pageant crowns a Poultry Festival Queen who presides over the three-day Poultry Festival. The festival is in honor of John Moosberg who started the broiler house system in Shelby County. A mural of the events is located in the Farmers State Bank with John Mooseberg&#x27;s picture. The Queen is decided by a board of non-partisan, appointed judges. The annual What A Melon Festival also crowns a queen to reign over the festival in July each year.

Also in Shelby County there is the Miss Shelby County Pageant. The Pageant is open to all Shelby County Young Ladies and a PreTeen, JrTeen, Teen and Miss Queen is crowned. The title holder represents Shelby County throughout her annual reign at many area events.
Also each fall, in August, junior girls from Shelby County high schools compete against each other in the Poultry festival pageant the winner wins a $2,000 scholarship.

==== Asset forfeiture controversy ====

In 2009, Tenaha became a defendant in a class action lawsuit over allegations that local police regularly made improper seizures of cash, jewelry, and property from African-American and Latino motorists passing through the town. Arrested drivers were given a choice of either going to jail on money-laundering felony charges or handing over all their valuables in order to be allowed to walk free. In one case a couple surrendered $6,000 to keep their children out of child protection services. In addition to taking of valuables from motorists who were not criminally charged, Tenaha officials allegedly agreed to lenient sentences for known drug traffickers in exchange for cash forfeitures.

Between 2006 and 2008, Tenaha Marshal’s Office used state forfeiture regulations to seize property from nearly 200 motorists. In about 50 of the cases, suspects were charged with drug possession. But in 147 incidents, marshals seized cash, jewelry, cell phones and automobiles even though no contraband was found, and the motorist was not charged with any crime. Many of these were African-American or Latino drivers. At least 150 motorists had property seized by Tenaha marshal’s office, totaling more than US$3 million.

=== Transportation ===
Tenaha is located on a junction of U.S. Routes 59, 84 and 96. In the future, Interstate 69 and Interstate 369 is planned to intersect at Tenaha.

==Education==
Public education in the town of Tenaha is provided by the Tenaha Independent School District. The best known alumnus of Tenaha High School is Jim Wilkinson (James R. Wilkinson), who gave up plans to become an undertaker to go to work for Republican Congressman Dick Armey in 1992. He served as General Tommy R.

<text>Arp is a city in Smith County, in the U.S. state of Texas. It is part of the Tyler metropolitan statistical area. According to the United States Census Bureau. The population was 892 in the 2020 census.

==History==
The area where the town of Arp now sits was occupied by Caddoan peoples in pre-Columbian periods and was a part of the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836 that granted Smith and Cherokee counties along with parts of Rusk, Gregg and Van Zandt counties to the Texas Cherokee and twelve associated tribes. The Cherokee War of 1839 forced the Native Americans out. However, the area was again occupied by Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek Indians after 1845. The descendants of these people formed the Mount Tabor Indian Community and a number continue to reside in Smith and Rusk counties today.

The settlement that would become Arp was called Bissa, from the Choctaw/Chickasaw word for blackberry, as early as the 1800s. It was later called Jarvis Junction and then Strawberry, after the fruit that was grown in the area. It was finally renamed &quot;Arp&quot; for Bill Arp (pen name of Charles Henry Smith), a Georgia humorist who was nationally known in the late 19th century. Supposedly, the three-letter name was also chosen for its brevity, which allowed local strawberry producers to spend less time hand-marking their crates.

<text>Lindale () is a city in Smith County, Texas, United States. Located in East Texas, the population was 6,059 as of 2020 census. It is part of the Tyler, Texas, metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

The area of Smith County where Lindale sits was inhabited long before the town was founded in 1871. In the early 19th century, the Caddo Indians were the area&#x27;s primary inhabitants; their artifacts can still be found along streams in the area. The area also was home to Cherokee Indians, who were forced out when the Republic of Texas was founded in 1836.

After the Civil War, Richard B. Hubbard, a former officer in the Confederate Army and owner of a large plantation on what is today a gated community called Hideaway Lake, began searching for a more convenient way to ship the produce grown on his land. Hubbard convinced railroad officials to lay track between nearby Tyler and Mineola. Hubbard&#x27;s brother-in-law, Elijah Lindsey, anticipating growth around the new railroad, opened the fledgling community&#x27;s first general store in 1871, and Lindale had its start; Lindsey was elected the town&#x27;s first mayor a year later.

In 1996, Lindale&#x27;s school board banned 32 books from its schools, including &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, because they &quot;conflicted with the values of the community.&quot; According to school board president John Offutt, a Baptist minister, the board&#x27;s action was an attempt to make students adhere to Christian beliefs.

<text>Tyler is a city in and the county seat of Smith County, Texas, United States. As of 2020, the population is 105,995. Tyler was the 38th most populous city in Texas (as well as the most populous in Northeast Texas) and 289th in the United States. It is the principal city of the Tyler metropolitan statistical area, which is the 198th most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. and 16th in Texas after Waco and the College Station–Bryan areas, with a population of 233,479 in 2020. The city is named for John Tyler, the tenth President of the United States.

In 1985, the international Adopt-a-Highway movement began in Tyler. After appeals from local Texas Department of Transportation officials, the local Civitan International chapter adopted a two-mile (three kilometer) stretch of U.S. Route 69 to maintain. Drivers and other motorists traveling on this segment of U.S. 69 (between Tyler and nearby Lindale) will see brown road signs that read &quot;First Adopt-A-Highway in the World&quot;.

Tyler is known as the &quot;Rose Capital of America&quot; (also the &quot;Rose City&quot; and the &quot;Rose Capital of the World&quot;), a nickname it earned from a long history of rose production, cultivation, and processing. It is home to the largest rose garden in the United States, a 14-acre public garden complex that has over 38,000 rose bushes of at least 500 different varieties. The Tyler Rose Garden Center is also home to the annual Texas Rose Festival which attracts thousands of tourists each October.

As Northeast Texas and Smith County&#x27;s major economic, educational, financial, medical and cultural hub, Tyler is host to more than 20,000 higher-education students; the University of Texas at Tyler; a university health science center; and regional hospital systems. It is the headquarters for Brookshire Grocery Company and many other large employers. Tyler is also home to the Caldwell Zoo and Broadway Square Mall, and the seat of Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler and its Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.

==History==

Legal recognition of Tyler was initiated by an act of the state legislature on April 11, 1846. The Texas government created Smith County and authorized a county seat.

The first plat designated a 28-block town site centered by a main square within a tract acquired by Smith County on 6 February 1847. The new town was named for President John Tyler, who advocated for the annexation of Texas by the United States. A log building on the square&#x27;s north side served as a courthouse and public meeting hall until a brick courthouse displaced it in . The City of Tyler was incorporated on January 29, 1850. Early religious and social institutions included the First Baptist Church and a Methodist church, a Masonic lodge and an Odd Fellows lodge, and Tyler&#x27;s first newspaper.

Though Tyler&#x27;s early economy from – was based on agriculture, it was also well-diversified during this period. Logging was a second major industry, while complementary manufacturing included metalworking, milling wood, and leather tanning. As the seat of Smith County, the town also benefited from government activity. The local agricultural economy relied on slave labor before the Civil War. In 1860, the population of enslaved people in Smith County was 4,982, the 4th most in east Texas.

By 1860, Tyler held over 1,000 enslaved persons, which represented 35 percent of the town&#x27;s population. There was strong support for secession and the Confederacy within Tyler, as a high percentage of its residents voted for secession and many of its men joined the Confederate Army. The town was secure enough for the Confederate States of America to establish the largest ordnance plant in Texas. In 1870, Bonner and Williams established Tyler&#x27;s first bank. When both the Texas and Pacific Railroad and the International Railroad (Texas) originally eschewed routes through Tyler, townspeople financed the Tyler Tap Railroad to link the town to the national rail grid. Ironically, before that 21-mile line to Big Sandy, Texas was completed in 1877, Tyler had already gotten its desired rail connection when the International–Great Northern Railroad built into town in 1874. Regardless, the Tyler Tap became the seed for the 725-mile-long Texas and St. Louis Railway, which in turn formed the core of the later St. Louis Southwestern Railway, commonly known as the Cotton Belt.

Toward the end of the nineteenth century, fruit orchards emerged as an important business in the regional economy. Eighty percent of the county&#x27;s agricultural revenue derived from cotton as it persisted as the dominant crop in the first decades of the twentieth century. Peaches were the principal fruit crop as the county fruit tree inventory surpassed one million by 1900. Disease struck the peach trees, though, and local farmers moved toward growing roses by the 1920s. Twenty years later, most of the U.S. rose supply originated in the Tyler area.

On October 29, 1895, an African American suspect named Robert Henry Hillard was burned at the stake in the Smith County Courthouse Square for the alleged murder of a nineteen-year-old white woman. Denied a trial and due process, Hillard was taken from law enforcement personnel by a white mob. Hillard&#x27;s executioners were never punished. Later, two entrepreneurs combined photographs from the actual lynching with others staged with actors and sold the 16-image production as a stereographic set. One of the original sets sits in the United States Library of Congress.

In 1912, Dan Davis, an African-American man suspected of attacking a sixteen-year-old white girl named Carrie Johnson, was burned at the stake in the Smith County Courthouse Square.

In , the University of Texas system established the University of Texas at Tyler and Broadway Square Mall opened in . By 1980, the population grew to 70,508 and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler and East Texas Islamic Society were established in the following years.

During the 2010 East Texas church burnings, two Tyler churches were destroyed, and historic preservation city planning began in 2016 as the population increased and the city continued development.

<text>Whitehouse is a city in Smith County, Texas, United States. Situated just southeast of Tyler, Texas, it has experienced steady growth, reaching a population of 8,257 in the 2020. As part of the Tyler metropolitan area, Whitehouse benefits from its proximity to the economic and cultural opportunities of the region while maintaining its own strong civic identity. The city is home to the Whitehouse Independent School District, known for its high academic standards, and features a mix of residential neighborhoods, parks, and businesses. With its strategic location along major transportation routes, Whitehouse continues to attract residents and businesses.
==History==

===Early history=== 

The community was founded long before the city was officially incorporated by James Calhoun Hill (auctioneer in 1846 for Tyler land grants). The community was named in 1845, but was not incorporated until 1953. The school district (WISD) preceded incorporated municipal government and was largely responsible for the eventual formation of the city. 

Residents of Whitehouse were predominantly farmers or worked in support of agriculture until transportation innovations following World War II led to other employment options. Many streets and subdivisions in the community are named for these early agricultural and commercial leaders. 

According to oral tradition, the community was named &quot;Whitehouse&quot; by the railroad engineers who stopped near a white-washed community building during early settlement times. Several cherished historic resources include the various Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects located within the city. These projects, typically built with sandstone rockwork, are found throughout the city&#x27;s historic Town Center.

===YesterYear Celebration===

Civic leaders established the YesterYear Celebration to educate residents about the community&#x27;s history and heritage. The festival is held on the fourth weekend each June and includes activities such as parades, carnivals, historic battle reenactments, pageants, and trade days.

===Historic Reading===
Several works documenting the community&#x27;s history have been published in the recent past. Shirley Smith wrote and/or edited several books including &quot;Homefolks&quot;, a collection of letters from important figures who lived in the community throughout the early 20th century. The Tri-County Leader published a series of articles by Acker Hanks called &quot;Growing up in Whitehouse.&quot; The articles recounted Mr. Hanks&#x27; experience in the community starting in the early 1920s. The Whitehouse Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan (see Planning and Development) also included a history section. This section was based on oral history interviews from prominent Whitehouse residents such as Nancy Shahan Coats, Joe Pat Hagan, Acker Hanks, Gaylon Shackelford, and Richard Waller.

==Planning and development==

===Past efforts===

 Whitehouse is in the first phase of an overhaul of its planning regulations. The city initially began regulating land use through zoning on December 4, 1987. The next major effort intended to improve quality of life in the city through planning was the completion of the community&#x27;s first comprehensive plan in April 1996. The document was developed by J.T. Dunkin &amp; Associates.

===Recent efforts===

The city&#x27;s Planning &amp; Zoning Commission has worked at the direction of the City Council to update various components of the 1987 zoning ordinance. The commission also recommended updates to the subdivision regulations which were adopted in February 2004. The city also contracted with Butler Planning Services to update the comprehensive plan from 1996. The firm, along with a citizen steering committee, produced the Whitehouse Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan in the spring of 2006. Following this effort, the city is currently evaluating the need for a new zoning ordinance which can implement the recommendations of the Vision 2020 Plan.

==Education==
The city is served by the Whitehouse Independent School District. The district consists of seven schools located on six campuses. The campuses include: 
* Cain Elementary School
* Mozelle Brown Elementary School
* Higgins Elementary School
* Stanton-Smith Elementary School
* Holloway Middle School
* Whitehouse Junior High School 
* Whitehouse High School
* AIM Center

The district is well regarded throughout the East Texas region and is one factor contributing to the city&#x27;s strong growth rate. Recognitions for the district include the &quot;One of BScene&#x27;s Best&quot; award for two straight years.

Stanton-Smith Elementary school is a more recent addition to the Whitehouse ISD campuses. It has been added to meet the needs of population growth within the city, with more efficient classroom space.
