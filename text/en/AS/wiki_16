<text>Mount Sinai is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located within the Town of Brookhaven, in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 12,118 at the 2010 census. The hamlet is located on the North Shore of Long Island.

Mount Sinai was first settled in the 1660s and was known by the name of &quot;Old Mans&quot; until a name change in the 1840s. Initially an agricultural hamlet, it transitioned into a popular resort town in the late-19th century and developed into a suburb of New York City in the mid-20th century. While primarily a residential community, the hamlet contains Mount Sinai Harbor and its popular public beach, Cedar Beach.

==History==
Mount Sinai was founded in the 1660s.

===Origins===
The area now known as Mount Sinai was originally called &quot;Nonowatuck&quot;, or &quot;stream that dries up&quot;, by the Seatocot family of Native Americans who lived here. The first European settlers were Colonial settlers living in what is now Setauket, who obtained a deed from these local Native Americans in 1664.

The origin of the town&#x27;s initial European name, &quot;Old Mans&quot;, is not known. The most prominent telling concerns Major John Gotherson, an elderly Englishman who was supposedly swindled into incorrectly believing he&#x27;d bought land in the New World by Captain John Scott, an important leader in Long Island&#x27;s early history. After Gotherson sent representatives who were quickly turned away, local residents started to jokingly refer to the land as &quot;the Old Mans&quot;.

During the American Revolution, the area and Old Mans Harbor were under British control. However, because of its remote location the British did not have troops stationed here. Many citizens moved their families to Connecticut during British occupation. During the course of the war, American agents visited local patriots and received information, clothing, supplies and money to support the cause. In 1780, American Major Benjamin Tallmadge and a detachment of Continental Army dragoons landed at Cedar Beach and traveled south to successfully attack the British at Manor St. George. The route he and his men took is now marked as an historic trail.

===Development as agricultural hamlet===
Building of houses occurred in spurts. Initially most building occurred within a mile (2 km) of the harbor. Few houses were built south of North Country Road until the late 19th century. Much of the land south of North Country Road was owned and cultivated by farmers.

There is no known 17th-century structure still standing. The 18th century is represented by six buildings dating from 1705 to 1790. Certain of these homes have structural elements which date from the early period. The 19th century has the largest number of surviving historical structures. These can be divided into two periods, 1800-1840s and 1880-1890s. Again, some of these buildings incorporated structural elements of earlier periods.

In 1840 the people of Old Mans applied for a post office. Evidently Old Mans was not considered a proper name for the area. The name was changed to Mount Vernon. This name was used for only a year as there already was a Mount Vernon in New York. Old Mans was used once again, but for unknown reason another name change occurred. The name &quot;Mount Sinai&quot;, after the biblical mountain, was chosen by the first postmaster, Charles Phillips. Local legend says that he chose the name arbitrarily by pointing a needle at random into his Bible. Mount Sinai is the name residents have used since 1841/1842.

In addition to the farmland that populated Old Mans, the town&#x27;s trees provided much of the wood for the shipbuilding trade centered in neighboring Port Jefferson. A shipyard existed in Old Mans for a time, but this was moved to the naturally deeper harbor of Port Jefferson. Riggers, sail-makers, ship carpenters and others lived in Mount Sinai and commuted to Port Jefferson. Grist mills were located somewhere along Pipe Stave Hollow and Crystal Brook Hollow roads. Records indicate that a number of windmills were located on the hills overlooking the harbor.

As the population expanded, a number of businesses were established along Route 25A. A commercial center did not develop in Mount Sinai and residents depended on businesses in the neighboring village of Port Jefferson.
===Houses of worship===
Prior to 1740, Mount Sinai residents had to travel to Setauket for services. In the 1740s a no-longer-standing Protestant church was built. The local Congregational group was established in 1789 and in 1807 this group erected the still-active Mount Sinai Congregational Church. In the early 19th century, a Methodist church was built on Shore Road, but this was later sold when the congregation joined with that of Port Jefferson.

===Resort town===
Once the Long Island Rail Road reached adjacent Port Jefferson in 1879, and temporarily continued east through Mount Sinai to Wading River from 1895 to 1938, new visitors and residents began appearing from New York City and from elsewhere on Long Island in order to enjoy the hamlet&#x27;s beaches and bucolic setting.

The development of Mount Sinai for its natural and recreational qualities had begun with the 1841 establishment of a special care facility for sick and disabled children on the southwestern side of Mount Sinai Harbor. This consisted of housing and volunteer workers on a plot, with the location being chosen due to its close proximity to St. Charles Hospital in adjacent Port Jefferson. On April 2, 1892, this parcel was sold to Dr. Jerome Walker, who established the Crystal Brook Park Association which is still owned and occupied today by Mount Sinai&#x27;s oldest private community known as &quot;Crystal Brook Park&quot;.

Seasonal vacation houses were erected along Mount Sinai Harbor. Cedar Beach, which is located on a peninsula that divides the harbor from the Long Island Sound, became a popular recreational destination. The Chandler Estate, on Mount Sinai Harbor&#x27;s southern side, was repurposed as vacation cottages and housed Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller during their holidays in the 1950s.

===Suburban growth===
In the first half of the 20th century the pace of building slowed. Although large tracts of farmland persisted, there were small pockets of development around the hamlet. Examples of these are the &quot;colony&quot; of homes built off Pipe Stave Hollow Road, both north and south of Route 25A, and the scattered development on Mount Sinai and Chestnut avenues. During this time a community was mapped but never developed just south of Route 25A and east of Crystal Brook Hollow Road.

It was not until the 1960s that housing developments began to occur as suburbanization spread eastward. Lands once farmed were now sold and developed into homes for new residents of Mount Sinai. This included the sale and development of the 404-acre Davis Peach Farm in the first years of the 2000s.

==Geography and climate==
Mount Sinai is located at (40.938532, -73.018668), bordering Long Island Sound on the North Shore of Long Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.53%, is water. Mount Sinai is bordered by Port Jefferson to the west, Port Jefferson Station to the southwest, Coram to the south, and Miller Place to the east.

Mount Sinai has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average temperature throughout the year is , with the highest average temperature in July being , and January being the coldest month with an average temperature of . The annual precipitation is . 

===Mount Sinai Harbor===

The northern part of Mount Sinai Harbor borders an active recreation area that is located on a 2-mile long peninsula. This includes Cedar Beach, one of the most popular North Shore beaches during the summer months. A marine sanctuary and nature preserve connects the various sections of Cedar Beach with scenic walking trails and serves to protect the remaining sand dunes. Commonly owned lands set aside in 1664 are being used for public recreation or have been rented for private use by a fishing station, yacht club and boatyard. A number of commercial fishermen work out of the harbor and fish in Long Island Sound. The peninsula, which is most directly accessible from the neighboring community of Miller Place, contains a number of historical vacation houses on both sides of the boundary line. The majority of these houses have since been converted to full-year use.

The southern part of it is a more serene location. Clamming is a popular activity during low tide, as is fishing at high tide. Throughout its history, Mount Sinai Harbor has been utilized for the catching of shellfish, the fishing of snapper and flounder, the hunting of waterfowl, sand milling, and the harvesting of salt hay. Satterly Landing, a small park that once housed a boathouse, provides views across the harbor.

The original mouth of the harbor was on the east side. Winds and tides continually narrowed its opening. Local residents toiled at widening the mouth. In the mid 19th century a new mouth was dredged on the west side of the harbor. Tides continue to dump sand, narrowing the mouth of the harbor. It still must be dredged to keep it open to allow for the boats moored in the harbor to reach the Sound. Three major civic battles were waged in the 20th century when various plans to dredge the harbor were proposed and pursued by the Town of Brookhaven. Two dredging projects were approved, and the present channels and deep basin south of Cedar Beach are the result of that action. A united civic action finally got the dredges out of the harbor in the late 1960s.

==Demographics==

==Education==
For parts of its history, residents lacked sufficient school facilities and sent their children to the neighboring Port Jefferson School District. However, two new school buildings constructed in 1966 and 1978 enabled students through grade 9 to remain in Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai High School opened to students in September 1991. All three schools of the Mount Sinai School District are located on a single shared campus.

<doc id="127331" wikidata="Q3460293" url="?curid=127331" title="Napeague, New York">
<text>Napeague (, ) is a census-designated place (CDP) that roughly corresponds to the hamlet with the same name in the Town of East Hampton in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The CDP population was 200 at the 2010 census.

Napeague is located on a very narrow, low-lying strip between the Atlantic Ocean to the south and Gardiners Bay to the north that was flooded in the Great Hurricane of 1938. It lies between Napeague State Park on the west and Hither Hills State Park on the east.

Napeague derives its name from the Montaukett name for &quot;land overflowed by the sea&quot;.

==Landmark structures==
The hamlet&#x27;s three major landmarks are the Mackay Radio Tower, the Art Barge, and the Smith Meal Fish Factory.

===Mackay Radio Tower===
The Mackay Radio Tower is the last of two towers (originally high and apart) that were used to transmit international point-to-point radio communications starting in 1927. At the height of World War II the tower was used for responding to upwards of ten SOS calls a day from ships at sea. The tower had somebody on site 24 hours a day, but the actual transmissions were keyed from Southampton. The towers toppled during the Great 1938 Hurricane.

At 12:35 pm. on January 28, 1961, an American Airlines Boeing 707 Flight 1502 (Flagship Oklahoma) with an engine on fire nosedived over the towers before crashing about off the Napeague coast, killing all six aboard. The plane had been on a training flight from Idlewild Airport. An often repeated story says the plane clipped one of the towers, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; account of the crash says it just missed the towers.

The Mackay towers were decommissioned in 1984, and its underlying land is now part of Napeague State Park. One of the towers was torn down. The remaining tower is used for communication purposes by the New York State Police. Its flashing white lights were once visible throughout the area but haven&#x27;t been operational in a year or two.

===The Art Barge===
The Art Barge is the home of the Victor D&#x27;Amico Institute of Art. Victor D&#x27;Amico was Director of Education for the Museum of Modern Art from 1937 until 1969. In 1955 the department had begun art classes at Ashawagh Hall in Springs, New York. D&#x27;Amico, looking for a permanent home, worked with local baymen to beach a retired World War II barge at its current location just northeast of the Mackay Towers. A summer outpost of MoMA&#x27;s Institute of Modern Art, it was for a time called the Kearsarge Art Center, for a Native American word meaning &quot;place of heaven&quot;. A second story was added in 1961. It was re-chartered as the Napeague Institute of Art in 1973 and finally renamed the Victor D&#x27;Amico Institute of Art, after its founder, in 1981. However, the popular name of &quot;Art Barge&quot; stuck. The Art Barge operates June through September. A complement to The Art Barge is the Mabel and Victor D&#x27;Amico Studio and Archive, the former home of Victor and his wife, the artist teacher Mabel Birckhead D&#x27;Amico, found across Napeague Harbor on the Lazy Point peninsula.

===Smith Meal Fish Factory===
The Smith Meal Fish Factory in Promised Land was a plant that processed menhaden fish for fish meal. It was owned by Otis Smith and produced 20–30 million fish a year from June to October and had its own flag stop on the Long Island Rail Road for employees only. After a drop in the supply of menhaden, Smith closed the plant in 1969 along with plants at Lewes, Delaware, and Crab Island, New Jersey. The plants were consolidated at Port Monmouth, New Jersey. Next to the Smith meal plant is a private marine finfish hatchery, Multi Aquaculture Systems, founded in 1976 by Dr. Robert J. Valenti, and a small restaurant.

The closed Smith Meal Fish Factory was sold to The Nature Conservancy, who transferred it to the State Parks Commission. Napeague State Park was the subject of an ongoing court battle about whether it should be used as a dock for the Cross Sound Ferry for a car ferry service to New London, Connecticut. The park has been undeveloped since its transfer in 1986 and is home to a nesting colony of piping plover which will dictate its future use.

== Water sports ==

Napeague Harbor is a well-known kiteboarding and windsurfing destination on Long Island. With flat waters and steady wind, Napeague is used by beginners and advanced riders.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.12%, is water.

At the end of the last ice age, Napeague was submerged under the sea. (At that time, Montauk was an island.) In the intervening several thousand years, ocean currents, or littoral drift, filled in this space with sand, giving rise to Napeague.

The main settlement in Napeague is the small community of Lazy Point, also known as &quot;Promised Land&quot;. It acquired this nickname, according to local lore, because of the menhaden plant located there in years gone by, which &quot;stunk to high heaven&quot;.

==Demographics==
==Demographics of the CDP==
As of the census of 2010, there were 200 people, 107 households, and 60 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 762 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Nesconset is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located within the Town of Smithtown, in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 13,207 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
At the time of colonization, the area that would become Nesconset was likely a seasonal hunting ground visited by both eastern Algonquin-speaking and western Munsee-speaking people who lived in clans. These clans likely banded together seasonally to share resources in winter, or to unify against a common threat. By the 18th century, Kieft&#x27;s War and Old World disease had reduced Long Island&#x27;s indigenous society to a few thousand people who resided in either reservations or mission-towns across Long Island. From these remaining communities, colonists ascribed tribal names to better identify parties engaging in land transactions. One of these remaining groups was in early Smithtown and would be known to them as the Nissequogue or Nesaquake (a likely descendant of today&#x27;s Matinecock tribe). The tribe&#x27;s principal sachem was known as Nassaconsett or Nassetteconsett, for whom Nesconset is named. After Smithtown passed a law in 1768 forbidding Algonquin-style living, Nesconset remained largely a deserted stretch of pine barrens. The construction of the Middle Country Road (NY 25) in the same era modestly opened the area to agricultural development. 

By the turn of the 19th century, a sparse population of farmers and seasonal residents lived along Middle Country Road and Lake Ronkonkoma. A primitive road network existed as Gibbs Pond Road, Browns Road, Old Nichols Road, Townline Road and the predecessor of Smithtown Boulevard. In 1904, brothers and French immigrants Louis and Clemen Vion came to the Pine Barrens of southeastern Smithtown from Manhattan on numerous occasions as sportsmen. By 1910, the brothers felled a line of trees off of Gibbs Pond Road immediately south of modern-day New York State Route 347 to create Midwood Avenue. They built their home on this street where it is still present. 

As the population grew, a lumber yard, general store, and post office were constructed in 1908. The historic Nesconset Schoolhouse was built in 1910 and the Nesconset Fire Department was built by 1935, A commercial center emerged where Lake Avenue South and Gibbs Pond Road meet. The brothers decided to name the newly established settlement after Smithtown&#x27;s local historical figure, Sachem Nasseconsett, who deeded the Nissequogue tribe&#x27;s land to Richard Smith. 

Early flawed attempts by western scholars to trace the etymology of the name suggest that Nassaconsett was a place name ascribed to the sachem, possibly by European settlers. The proposed etymology from 1911 claims Nassaconsett translates to &quot;at or near the second going over (by wading or otherwise)&quot;, likely a reference to a ford on the Nissequogue River. This translation is based on flawed methodology, as it cites a dialect of Algonquin from New England and as such, is subject to inaccuracies. 

Later development was concentrated on Lake Avenue South, Southern Boulevard and the Lake Ronkonkoma area along Gibbs Pond Road in the form of summer residences.

By 1930, Nesconset had a population of 50 people along Lake Avenue and spread along Smithtown Boulevard and Gibbs Pond Road. The construction of present-day New York State Route 347 in the 1950s opened the southeast corner of Smithtown to rapid suburban development by bisecting the small center of the hamlet. This caused the shift of the commercial center of Nesconset to Smithtown Boulevard between Old Nichols Road and Southern Boulevard. This area was known formerly as East Hauppauge.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The statistical area defined as Nesconset was expanded in the early 1970s to include a portion of what was Lake Ronkonkoma, New York. The area includes land from Gibbs Pond Road east to School House Road and from Brown&#x27;s Road south to Smithtown Boulevard.

The location of the &quot;submarine base&quot; was on 1st Street between Main and King Streets. The name of Mr. Holland&#x27;s company was changed to Electric Boat during this time.

In 2007, New Suffolk&#x27;s two-room school house had nine students in grades K-6, making it one of the smallest school districts in the state of New York.

<text>Nissequogue () is a village in Suffolk County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The village population was 1,564 at the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Nissequogue is located entirely within the Town of Smithtown.

== History ==
Nissequogue incorporated as a village in 1925.

In the early 1970s, during the administration of Mayor James Donahue, Nissequogue Village Hall opened inside the former Moriches Road Schoolhouse. Nissequogue Village Hall was dedicated to Donahue in 2017.

In 1973, Donahue and his administration established the Village of Nissequogue Fire Department and purchased the land for the village&#x27;s firehouse. The village created the fire department after the Saint James Fire Department, which had served the village for decades, proposed increasing their rates for fire protection services in Nissequogue.

The Mayor of Nissequogue (as of July 2022), Richard B. Smith, is a descendant and a namesake of the first English settler of the village, Richard Smith (Smythe).

August Belmont, the noted 19th-century financier, raised racing horses at his estate which is now Belmont Lake State Park. There is still a flat circular plot of ground just south of the Southern State Parkway on the western side of Belmont Avenue where his trainers worked the horses when they were in New York for the racing season. The former driveway of Belmont&#x27;s estate was lined with tall pine trees that are still visible in the median of the Southern State Parkway just west of Belmont Avenue.

Austin Corbin, who developed Coney Island in the 1870s before he became the manager of the Long Island Railroad, built his summer residence along the shores of what is now known as Deer Lake.

Col. M. Robert Guggenheim, an industrialist and statesman, and brother-in-law to the founder of the Long Island newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot;, established a country estate on the same grounds as the former Corbin estate, which is now a neighborhood of post-war houses known as Parkdale Estates. The Guggenheims built a large home on Deer Park Avenue and horse stables (which later became the Stables Garden Center). For years the lakes known as Deer Lake were named Guggenheim Lakes. Other than the lakes and a couple of service buildings which were later relocated to West Islip, no traces of the Guggenheim estate remain.

<text>Northport is a historic maritime village in the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County, on the North Shore of Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 7,347 at the time of the 2020 census.

Initially designated Great Cow Harbour by 17th-century English colonists, the area was officially renamed Northport in 1837. In 1894, in an effort to localize governance, the community was incorporated as a village.

The Incorporated Village of Northport is known for its Victorian era village center, still bearing trolley rails from a long-discontinued streetcar line which transported village residents to the Long Island Rail Road station in East Northport. The village Main Street runs from the Village Green along the harbor-front to the former hamlet of Vernon Valley, which has since been subsumed by the neighboring community of East Northport. 

== History ==

===European settlement===
The original inhabitants of the area now known as Northport were the Matinecocks, one of 13 Native American tribes of Long Island. The Matinecocks called this land &quot;Opcathontyche&quot;, which meant &quot;wading place creek&quot;. After Dutch interest a few years earlier, the land was sold by Chief Asharoken, head of the Matinecocks, to three Englishmen in 1656.

With land that was well suited for farming, the early settlers grazed cattle on pastures around the harbor. The area soon became known as Great Cow Harbour. (The nearby hamlet of Centerport was known as Little Cow Harbour.) The oldest house still standing in Northport, the Skidmore House on Main Street, was built in 1761. In 2009 the house was put up for sale, sparking the village to pass a historical preservation law.

===Growth, change, and shipbuilding===

In the early 19th century, Great Cow Harbor was still a rural farming community. By the 1830s, the village contained only eight dwellings. But a new industry of shipbuilding brought rapid change and growth. The village shifted away from its farming roots as shipbuilding became the community&#x27;s primary industry. By 1837, the village was being referred to as Northport.

The 1860 census listed Northport&#x27;s population at 1,016. By 1874, it had become the most flourishing village on Long Island&#x27;s North Shore, with three ship yards, five sets of marine railways, two hotels, and at least six general stores.

Northport&#x27;s shipbuilding boom lasted fifty years, but waned at the end of the century as steel-hulled ships began replacing the wooden vessels produced in the village.

===Railroads and trolleys===

On April 25, 1868, the Long Island Rail Road opened a station within the village of Northport. This was an essential transportation link for the village, especially for the growing commuter population. However, just a few years later the LIRR decided to move the Northport station to a new location in Larkfield to facilitate further railway extension to Port Jefferson. The new railway station located on Larkfield Road was opened on January 13, 1873, and retained the station name of Northport.

To avoid confusion with the former station located in the village of Northport, train conductors would refer to the station in Larkfield as &quot;East of Northport&quot; because the station was located east of the Northport railway junction which directed trains north to the station located in the village. Despite the fact that Larkfield was primarily &quot;south&quot; of Northport, the area became known thereafter as East Northport. The original rail spur to Northport was afterwards known as the Northport Branch. After the old village station closed in 1899, Northport decided to build a trolley line to take commuters between Main Street and the new Northport station located in Larkfield. The new commuter trolley opened in mid-April 1902. The increasing usage of the automobile led the trolley to make its last scheduled commuter run on August 19, 1924.

===Incorporation and annexation===
Although it was known by the name of Northport since at least 1837, the village of Northport was not formally incorporated until 1894, becoming the first village in the Town of Huntington to do so. Over the years Northport has expanded from its original borders, annexing other established communities.

Around the Revolutionary War, a concentration of 31 families began settling east of Northport, around where Main Street and Route 25A now intersect . This settlement was originally known as Red Hook and changed names to Vernon Valley in 1820. By 1874 Vernon Valley had a population of around 150 inhabitants. Vernon Valley became part of Northport in the mid-20th century.

Northport also annexed the formerly independent settlement of Crab Meadow (once known as Great Neck), as well as western parts of the Freshpond community .

===Modern Northport===

By the 1920s, after nearly a century of heavy commercial use, the waterfront which had supported the community for generations had fallen into decay. The village decided to purchase the land along the harbor and created Northport Memorial Park in 1932, which is a defining feature of Northport today.

In 1967, the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) opened the Northport Power Station, currently the largest oil-fired electric generating station on the East Coast. The four enormous stacks are a well-known landmark that can be seen from as far away as Connecticut across Long Island Sound. Each stack is tall.

The Northport Trolley, which had ceased operations in 1924, enjoyed a popular revival in the 1970s and 1980s, transporting weekend tourists along Main Street. Unlike the original electric trolleys, this nostalgic replica was horse driven. It also ran on rubber automobile tires rather than utilizing the original rails which still remain a visible element of Main Street to this day.

In July 1984, Northport garnered nationwide media attention for being the site of the gruesome murder of 17-year-old Gary Lauwers by his friend, high school dropout and alleged devil-worshiper Ricky Kasso. The events made national headlines and have since been recounted in books and movies, which caused the village to suffer a negative reputation for reputed satanism.

Every September, the village of Northport commemorates its rich history with the celebration of Cow Harbor Day, which follows the annual Great Cow Harbor 10K race.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.02%, is water.

Most of the village is made up of the low, steep hills of the Harbor Hill Moraine. To the west is the highly sheltered Northport Harbor, to the north is Long Island Sound, and to the east are woods and marshland.

A prominent feature of Northport is Steer&#x27;s Pit (known simply as &quot;The Pit&quot; to locals), a large land depression carved into the cliffs adjacent to Northport Harbor and just south of the Northport Power Station&#x27;s prominent smokestacks. This unusual geographic feature is the result of sand mining operations by the Steers and Steers Company. Mining began in 1923 and ceased in the 1950s. The mined sand was shipped by barge to New York City where, mixed with Portland cement and rock aggregate, it became the sidewalks of New York. The area has since been utilized for home and condo use, and a portion of the Pit is a park used by local youth soccer and baseball leagues. The Northport Fire Department maintains a training facility in the Pit that is the site of the annual fireman&#x27;s fair in the summer.

<text>Northwest Harbor is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of East Hampton, Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 3,317 at the 2010 census.

It is named for the bay on the South Fork of Long Island connecting Sag Harbor, Shelter Island and the town of East Hampton to Gardiners Bay and the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The bay derives its name from being northwest of East Hampton village. The name &quot;Northwest Harbor&quot; is applied to the Northwest Woods neighborhood (sometimes shortened to simply &quot;Northwest&quot;) of the town of East Hampton. It is also applied to Northwest Landing at Northwest Creek (a saltwater outlet from the inlet to the harbor) which was the first port for East Hampton and which became a major whaling port in the late 17th and early 18th centuries until it was replaced by Sag Harbor two miles to the west of the landing, where the water was deeper. Ships of Sag Harbor must pass through Northwest Harbor at the Cedar Point Lighthouse in order to reach Gardiners Bay and the open ocean.

During the American Revolution it was the site of two conflicts, including Meigs Raid in which Americans burned Sag Harbor and captured 90 British soldiers and an incident in which Isaac Van Scoy killed a British soldier with a pitchfork. The British were to conduct another raid during the War of 1812.

During the Great Hurricane of 1938 sand all but enclosed the harbor at its mouth at the Cedar Point Lighthouse, leaving only a narrow channel into Gardiners Bay.

In January 2007 Northwest Landing made national news in efforts to save several common dolphins that had swum up the creek.

<doc id="127350" wikidata="Q3462188" url="?curid=127350" title="Oakdale, New York">
<text>Oakdale is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Suffolk County, New York, United States, situated on the South Shore of Long Island. The hamlet&#x27;s population was 7,974 at the 2010 census. Oakdale is in the Town of Islip. It has been home to Gilded Age mansions, the South Side Sportsmen&#x27;s Club, the main campus of Dowling College and the Long Island Sharks hockey team. TSPL, “Trampoline Soccer Premier League” was also created here. It is now home to Connetquot River State Park Preserve.

== History ==

Oakdale was founded around two Native American trade routes, where Sunrise Highway and Montauk Highway currently lie. Oakdale was part of the royal land grant given to William Nicoll, who founded Islip Town in 1697. Local historian Charles P. Dickerson wrote in 1975 that Oakdale&#x27;s name appeared to come from a Nicoll descendant in the mid-19th century. The community includes: St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, built in 1765, is the third oldest church on Long Island.

The community originated with a tavern owned by Eliphalet (Liff) Snedecor in what is now Connetquot River State Park Preserve. Soon after its founding in 1820, Snedecor&#x27;s Tavern began drawing New York bluebloods and business barons who wined and dined in remote joy when they weren&#x27;t fishing and hunting nearby. &quot;Liff&#x27;s food is as good as his creek&quot;, a magazine writer declared in 1839 referring to the food and Connetquot River. The writer added: &quot;and the two are only second to his mint juleps and champagne punch; whoever gainsays either fact deserves hanging without benefit of clergy.&quot;

In 1866, as the railroad reached the area, Liff&#x27;s wealthy patrons formed the South Side Sportsmen&#x27;s Club, and soon the race was on to see who could create the most superb spread in the thick forests adjoining Great South Bay. The most prominent were built by William K. Vanderbilt, grandson of railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt; Frederick G. Bourne, president of the Singer Sewing Machine Co., and Christopher Robert II, an eccentric heir to a sugar fortune. Meanwhile, William Bayard Cutting, a lawyer, financier and railroad man, built his estate next door in Great River, New York which had once been west Oakdale.

In 1912, Jacob Ockers of Oakdale organized the Bluepoint Oyster Co., which became the largest oyster producer and shipper in the country.

==Gilded Age estates==
Gilded Age estates were a feature of Oakdale&#x27;s past toward the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century.

===Idle Hour===
In 1882, William Kissam Vanderbilt built the most noted one, Idle Hour, on the Connetquot River. The lavish, wooden 110-room home was destroyed by fire on April 15, 1899, while his son, Willie K. II, was honeymooning there. Willie and his new wife escaped. It was promptly rebuilt of red brick and gray stone, with exquisite furnishings, for $3 million. The building at the time was considered among the finest homes in America. His daughter Consuelo had also honeymooned there when she married the Duke of Marlborough in 1895.

After Vanderbilt&#x27;s death in 1920, the mansion went through several phases and visitors, including a brief stay during Prohibition by gangster Dutch Schultz. Around that time, cow stalls, pig pens and corn cribs on the farm portion of Idle Hour were converted into a short-lived bohemian artists&#x27; colony that included figures such as George Elmer Browne and Roman (Bon) Bonet-Sintas as well as sculptor Catherine Lawson, costume designer Olga Meervold, and pianist Claude Govier, and Francis Gow-Smith and his wife Carol. The estate was most recently the home of Dowling College, a struggling school which closed in August 2016.

===Pepperidge Hall===
By 1888, Christopher R. Robert II (son of Christopher Robert) built a spectacular castle just east of Idle Hour called Pepperidge Hall, furnished in the French style for his wife. But the pair didn&#x27;t get along. On January 2, 1898, she told police she found Robert shot to death in his Manhattan apartment. It was ruled a suicide and she moved to Paris. The mansion featured in silent movies 1916–1920, fell into disrepair and was razed in 1941.

===Indian Neck Hall===

In 1897, Frederick Gilbert Bourne, who began with but later owned land reaching to West Sayville, completed his mansion, Indian Neck Hall, on the east side of Oakdale. Bourne was active locally, as commodore of the Sayville Yacht Club, and was generous to the local fire department. The eastern part of his estate now comprises the West Sayville County Golf Course and the Long Island Maritime Museum, while much of the middle portion is developed with homes. Bourne died in 1920. Six years later the mansion, on the western end, became the site of La Salle Military Academy, operated by the Christian Brothers, a Catholic order. In 1993, the brothers converted the academy into a kindergarten-through-high-school &quot;global learning community&quot;. In 2001, La Salle was closed and it was bought by St. John&#x27;s University of New York.

<text>Ocean Beach is a village in the southern part of the Town of Islip, on Fire Island, within Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 153 at the time of the 2020 census. Known for its strict local ordinances, the village is nicknamed &quot;The Land of No&quot;.

The Incorporated Village of Ocean Beach is a popular tourist destination, due to its beachfront location accompanied by a commercial district featuring nightlife, hotels, waterfront restaurants, and a variety of stores.

== History ==
Ocean Beach was incorporated as a village in 1921. It formed with the merger between the tract of land owned by John A. Wilbur and Stay-A-While Estates. It is the location of Fire Island&#x27;s only elementary school, which first opened in 1918.

The community was once a favorite of celebrities including Fanny Brice, Carl Reiner, and Mel Brooks.

When artistic bohème of New York started frequenting Fire Island during the Jazz Age, Ocean Beach became the first gay village of the island. This caused tensions between the gay (often famous) tourists and locals, which peaked when Antoine de Paris built on his land an outdoor toilet with revealing saloon door right across the street from a Catholic church. The villagers arranged a provocation by choosing a teenage boy to &quot;seduce&quot; one of Antoine&#x27;s guests, and after catching the guest &quot;in flagranti&quot;, they burned down Antoine&#x27;s property. After that and the Great Hurricane of 1938, the gay community settled in the Cherry Grove.

<doc id="127353" wikidata="Q3461988" url="?curid=127353" title="Orient, New York">
<text>Orient is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, United States. The CDP&#x27;s population was 743 at the 2010 census.

&quot;Orient&quot; and &quot;Orient Point&quot; are used almost interchangeably. However, Orient Point refers specifically to the physical point at the end of the North Fork of Long Island, while Orient is the hamlet in which the point is located.

== History and tourism ==
Orient is the easternmost town on Long Island&#x27;s North Fork. It was originally named Poquatuck, after the name of the local Native American tribe that resided along the inland waterways, then named Oyster Ponds because of the nearby oyster beds.

Orient and East Marion were originally called Oysterponds because of the abundance of shellfish in the area. What is now Orient was known as Lower Neck, while East Marion was called Upper Neck. The communities separated in 1836 and East Marion was named for Revolutionary War Gen. Francis Marion, known as the Swamp Fox. &quot;East&quot; was tacked onto Marion because of an existing Marion upstate.

The name Orient was chosen to reflect that area&#x27;s easternmost position on the North Fork. A later legend has it that when Oyster Bay, New York became famous during the presidency of Teddy Roosevelt, the name was changed to &quot;Orient&quot; to match the name of its most prominent land feature, Orient Point.
Orient&#x27;s winter population swells to well over 1000 in the summer months. Other than a post office, a gas station, a country store, and a few seasonal tourist stands, there is no center of commerce, hence its residents depend on nearby Greenport for everyday necessities. Many make a living at the United States Department of Agriculture lab on nearby Plum Island, a 5-minute boat ride from Orient Point across Plum Gut, or at businesses further west. Truck farming and commercial fishing industries remain as well. Definitely New England in style and flavor, the hamlet of Orient has homes built over the last three centuries. Locals joke that a &quot;new house&quot; is anything built since World War II.

The hamlet was originally settled by five families given a land grant by the King of England in the 17th century, and their surnames, King, Terry, Glover, Latham, Tuthill and Vail, still exist in local families. Later, Orient was used as a base of operations by British commanders such as Benedict Arnold and local Tories during the American Revolution to conduct raids on Yankee-held Connecticut. Among Benedict Arnold&#x27;s headquarters was a local tavern owned and operated by the Vail family on what is now known as &quot;Village Lane&quot;. Many of the hamlet&#x27;s older structures are included in the Orient Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Ferry service has connected Orient Point to southern New England for over a century. The Cross Sound Ferry currently operates a vehicle/passenger ferry service between Orient Point and New London, Connecticut. This service has expanded in recent years with Sea Jet service being provided to the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Casino.

==Geography==

Though Orient&#x27;s climate is influenced by both subtropical and continental air, it has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), though due to the Atlantic Ocean current it borders on humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;.) The CDP experiences moderately cold, damp winters and warm, humid summers. The temperatures tend to be more moderate, especially during summer days, than other parts of the island due to the CDP&#x27;s coastal location and a constant onshore flow.

<text>Poquott is a village in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 953 at the 2010 census. The village is located in the Town of Brookhaven, on the North Shore of Long Island, and is officially known as the Incorporated Village of Poquott.

==History==
Poquott was founded by European settlers in 1659. The peninsula came to be known as “George’s Neck”, and was developed mostly as farmland. A fort with a single 32-pound gun, dubbed “Fort Nonsense”, was erected at the tip of Poquott during the War of 1812. It did little to deter the British raiders who entered Port Jefferson Harbor.

As the 20th century approached, “California Grove” was established at what is now the foot of Washington Street (1883). California Grove was an amusement park that featured an oyster restaurant, dancing pavilion, skating rink, picnic grounds, and a pier at which the steamboat Notowantuc would unload tourists from Connecticut. The establishment of California Grove led to Poquott’s development as a summer bungalow community.

Poquott continued to grow as a summer community. Several camps (Dr. Petit’s Camp/Camp Woodbine/Pine Bluff Camp) dotted the shorelines of Poquott. At the turn of the century, large swaths of George’s Neck came into the hands of world traveler, financier, and businessman Edward Larocque Tinker. The Tinker family built several stunning homes throughout Poquott.

Residents fought hard to preserve “Bayview Park”, as Poquott was referred to “back in the day”, when plans came up to develop the shorelines for industry. The Village of Poquott was ultimately incorporated in 1931. Extensive development took place in Poquott after the sale of the Tinker Estate that was later subdivided into Tinker Bluff, in the 1980s. The Village now consists of primarily year-round residences, although a few summer homes still remain.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 27.12%, is water. Residents have access to two beaches and a harbor front park. Walnut Beach lies on the shore of Port Jefferson Harbor, while Van Brunt Manor Beach allows for access to the waters of Setauket Harbor. Both beaches feature dinghy and kayak racks. California Park features two large fields, a gazebo, a private boat ramp, dinghy racks, and a playground. All residents are granted exclusive mooring rights off Poquott’s shoreline.

Village Hall lies at the foot of Birchwood Avenue, and adjoins Trustees Park. The park offers Poquott residents over two acres of scenic parkland, a greenhouse, private tennis courts, communal gardens, a playground, and picnicking areas. Recently added, Newfield Park, adjacent to California Park, was named in 2023 to honor long-time resident, and Village Clerk, Mr. Joseph Newfield. 

Two easements, Steve’s Path and the “Indian Trail”, allow for additional access to Port Jefferson Harbor. Steve’s Path connects Tinker Bluff Court to Port Jefferson Harbor, and the Indian Trail connects Birchwood Avenue to Walnut Beach

<text>Port Jefferson, also known as Port Jeff, is an incorporated village in the town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. Officially known as the Incorporated Village of Port Jefferson, the population was 7,962 as of the 2020 United States census.

Port Jefferson was first settled in the 17th century and remained a rural community until its development as an active shipbuilding center in the mid-19th century. The village has since transitioned to a tourist-based economy. The port remains active as terminus of the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry, one of two commercial ferry lines between Long Island and Connecticut, and is supplemented by the terminus of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Jefferson Branch. It is also the center of the Greater Port Jefferson region of northwestern Brookhaven, serving as the cultural, commercial and transportation hub of the neighboring Port Jefferson Station, Belle Terre, Mount Sinai, Miller Place, Poquott, and the Setaukets.

==History==
===Colonial and precolonial history===
The original settlers of the Town of Brookhaven, based in the neighboring hamlet of Setauket, bought a tract of land from the Setalcott Indians in 1655. The deed included the area of contemporary Port Jefferson along with all other lands along the North Shore from the Nissequogue River eastward to Mount Misery Point.

Port Jefferson&#x27;s original name was &quot;Sowaysset&quot;, a Native American term for either &quot;place of small pines&quot; or &quot;where water opens.

The first known home within the present village boundaries was erected in the early 1660s by Captain John Scott, an important leader in Long Island&#x27;s early history. This house, named Egerton, was a grand abode on the western end of Mount Sinai Harbor at Mount Misery Neck. The first settler in Port Jefferson&#x27;s current downtown was an Irish Protestant shoemaker from Queens named John Roe, who built his still-standing home in 1682. It remained a small community of five homes through the 18th century, and was renamed to &quot;Drowned Meadow&quot; in 1682.

Local lore has it that the pirate Captain Kidd rendezvoused in the harbor on his way to bury treasure at Gardiners Island. Another legend is that: during the Revolutionary War, naval commander John Paul Jones had a ship fitted here. However, there is no factual support for these assertions, and the historical works quoted do not present them as definitive facts. John Paul Jones&#x27;s career in particular is well documented, and there are no accounts of him visiting the village, which was under British control during the time he served as a commanding officer.

===Development as a shipbuilding village===
In 1797, when the entire town had five houses, its first shipyard was built. By 1825, several shipbuilding firms were located there, which attracted new residents and commerce.

During the War of 1812, British interference on Long Island Sound upset local shipping routes. On one occasion, two British warships, the frigate HMS &quot;Pomone&quot; and brig HMS &quot;Despatch&quot; sent their boats into the harbor under cover of darkness, capturing seven sloops. To protect local interests, a small fortress was set up on the west side of Port Jefferson Harbor.

In 1836 the local leadership initiated the community&#x27;s transition from a &quot;swampish hamlet&quot; to a busy port town. The 22 acres of the harborfront, which flooded at high tide, were brought to a stable elevation with the construction of a causeway. The village changed its name from &quot;Drowned Meadow&quot; to &quot;Port Jefferson&quot;, in honor of Thomas Jefferson.
Numerous shipyards developed along Port Jefferson&#x27;s harbor, and the village&#x27;s shipbuilding industry became the largest in Suffolk County. Two whaling vessels were built for New Bedford at Port Jefferson in 1877 (ship &quot;Horatio&quot; and bark &quot;Fleetwing&quot;), and a Port Jefferson-built schooner (&quot;La Ninfa&quot;) was later converted into a whaling vessel at San Francisco. Port Jefferson&#x27;s primary role as a port in the 19th century was to build and support vessels engaged in the coastal freighting trades. Many of Port Jefferson&#x27;s remaining homes from this period were owned by shipbuilders and captains. This includes the Mather House Museum, a mid-19th century home once owned by the Mather shipbuilding family that now serves as the center of a museum complex and headquarters for the Historical Society of Greater Port Jefferson.

P. T. Barnum, the famous circus owner, owned a tract of land which ran through the village. His intention was to make Port Jefferson the home base for his circus, founded in 1871. The residents blocked his plans, and he eventually sold his land. Barnum Avenue now runs through the area that was once Barnum&#x27;s. 

The section of town at the intersection of the two streets, then known as Hotel Square, became an active center of Port Jefferson&#x27;s early tourism industry in the mid-19th century, with a variety of hotels and restaurants. This included the John Roe house, which was converted into the Townsend House hotel. The village&#x27;s first post office was added to this intersection in 1855.

With the 1923 sale of the Bayles Shipyard to the Standard Oil Company and demolition of all but two of its structures, Port Jefferson&#x27;s shipbuilding industry came to a close. This resulted in an economic downturn, and the closing of many of the grand hotels in Hotel Square, as tourism declined along with the industry. Port Jefferson Harbor then became a depot for the oil transportation and gravel industries, and, since the 1940s, the site of a Long Island Lighting Company coal-fired power plant. The harbor also had activity as a rum-running center during the Prohibition era. Decades later, Port Jefferson&#x27;s economy had recovered, with tourism as its base.

===After incorporation===
The village of Port Jefferson was incorporated in 1963. The revitalization of lower Port Jefferson soon followed as local tourism brought increased revenues and the village adjusted itself to its new economic role. One such transformation was the 1976 redevelopment of the defunct Mather &amp; Jones Shipyard into a shop-lined promenade known as Chandler Square.

A result of the transition is new public access to much of the waterfront, as several industrial lots had previously stood in the way. Danfords Hotel and Marina was one major waterfront project, which integrated several new and historical structures into a luxury hotel. Danfords includes a commercial marina and walkable pier, marking an aspect of the harbor&#x27;s transformation from industrial to recreational use.

Harborfront Park, a project completed in 2004, similarly transitioned the site of a shipyard turned Mobil Oil terminal into a public park with picnic grounds, a seasonal ice skating rink and a promenade. Concurrent to the park&#x27;s construction was the rebuilding of a former shipyard warehouse into the Port Jefferson Village Center, a new public space for events and recreation.

A number of historic buildings were included in the Port Jefferson Village Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Separately listed are the Bayles Shipyard and First National Bank of Port Jefferson building.

==Geography==
The village&#x27;s commerce is divided into two centers that lie apart along Main Street and at differing elevations. These are known as &quot;Lower Port Jefferson&quot; and &quot;Upper Port Jefferson&quot;, respectively the waterfront and the railroad station sections of town. The first is currently the center of tourism, while the latter is undergoing plans for revitalization to the economic viability of its historic self. Further from Main Street, the remainder of Port Jefferson consists of several residential neighborhoods defined by the hills on which they sit. In the northeastern corner of the village is the neighborhood of &quot;Harbor Hills&quot;. This neighborhood occupies the western edge of Mount Sinai Harbor and contains the Port Jefferson Country Club at Harbor Hills. &quot;Brick Hill&quot; is the neighborhood directly west of the Lower Port Jefferson commercial center and was first developed by the noted circus owner P. T. Barnum. West of Upper Port Jefferson is &quot;Cedar Hill&quot;, which is topped by the c. 1859 Cedar Hill Cemetery where residents formerly would bask while enjoying views over the village from its highest point.

Within Port Jefferson is Port Jefferson Harbor, a natural deepwater harbor. Setauket Harbor branches off to the west from the harbor. One notable geographic feature is The Cove, a small cove dredged in the early 20th century by the Seaboard Dredging Company. The original name was Seaboard Hole, but it was changed for the sake of appealing to tourists, and several large sand dunes artificially created by the dredging can also be found here.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 United States census, there were 7,750 people, 3,090 households, and 1,975 families residing in the village. The population density was approximately 2,500 people per square mile (980/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 88.5% White, 10.5% Hispanic or Latino, 2.1% Asian, 1.6% African American, 0.2% Native American, 2.2% from other races, and 1.4% from two or more races.

There were 3,090 households, out of which 27.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.2% were married couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.8% had a male household with no wife present, and 36.1% were non-families. Of all households, 28.3% were made up of individuals living alone, and 9.0% consisted of people living alone who were 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.96.

The age breakdown consisted of 20.7% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 31.2% from 45 to 64, and 16.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.1 males.

In the 2008–2012 American Community Survey, the median income for a household in the village was $108,060 and the median income for a family was $138,984. The per capita income for the village was $51,937. Of the population, 6.5% were below the poverty threshold.

==Arts and culture==


Port Jefferson is home to Theatre Three, a non-profit theatre company founded in 1969. Each year Theatre Three stages four musicals and two plays and additionally performs A Christmas Carol during the annual Dickens Festival. Theatre Three is held in Athena Hall, a performance space dating to 1874. The village was home to two notable landscape painters in the late 19th century, William Moore Davis and Leon Foster Jones. Both artists produced numerous depictions of Port Jefferson and its harbor. They were the subject of a 1993 art exhibition by the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages in Stony Brook.

=== Annual cultural events ===
Port Jefferson has been home to the annual &quot;Port Jefferson Village Dickens Festival&quot; every year since 1996. The festival celebrates the works and times of English novelist Charles Dickens. It takes place during a weekend early in December and typically includes many events and occurrences, such as the regular sighting of people who dress in 19th century clothing, house tours, the reading of winter-related poetry, caroling, and booths set up by local businesses. Students from the Port Jefferson Middle School and High School submit poetry and art that are used in the festival. Free concerts of seasonal music by various ensembles are presented at the Methodist church. Many small festivals are held during the summer, showcasing music and crafts. Each Fourth of July sees a substantial parade on Main Street. The village also hosts an annual outdoor concert series and film screenings, both of which currently take place in Harborfront Park throughout July and August. In keeping with its seafaring heritage, Port Jefferson hosts its own annual boat race series known as the &quot;Village Cup Regatta&quot;, with proceeds benefiting cancer research.

== Government ==
Port Jefferson is governed at the local level by a mayor, four trustees, and a town justice.

==Education==
The Port Jefferson Union Free School District covers Belle Terre and most of Port Jefferson. In 2008, the district had 1375 students.

There are three schools:

* Edna Louise Spear Elementary School (Pre-K to 5th), also known as Port Jefferson Elementary School or Scraggy Hill School.
* Port Jefferson Middle School (6th to 8th)
* Earl L. Vandermeulen High School (9th to 12th), also known as Port Jefferson High School
* Port Jefferson Middle School and High School currently share the same building located on 350 Old Post Road. The Middle School (7th and 8th grade only) was previously located at 118 Spring Street. That building currently houses the Jefferson Academic Center, a vocational school operated by Eastern Suffolk BOCES.

Port Jefferson union free school district (UFSD) is bordered on the west by Three Village Central School District, on the south by Comsewogue School District, and on the east by Mount Sinai School District.

==Transportation==
Port Jefferson features a major ferry route, a Long Island Rail Road terminus, multiple bus lines, and an extensive network of roads.

The Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry is one of two routes connecting Long Island to New England. The other route is the Cross Sound Ferry at Orient Point and no bridges or tunnels exist despite past proposals. Port Jefferson&#x27;s ferry company was established in 1883 and was championed by influential circus owner P. T. Barnum. Barnum, who owned lands in both Port Jefferson and Bridgeport, Connecticut, became the new company&#x27;s first president.

The village additionally serves as the eastern terminus for the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Jefferson Branch. The branch consists of a diesel train that connects to the electrified Main Line at Huntington station. During the full run it continues toward the western terminus of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan or to Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. The average commute from Port Jefferson to Manhattan via the Long Island Rail Road takes approximately 2 hours. Train service to New York City first reached Port Jefferson in 1873. The ferry terminal and train station are approximately apart. In March 2014, mayor Margot Garant announced interest in establishing a future shuttle to link the two transportation networks as well as their respective sections of town, lower and upper Port Jefferson.

Suffolk County Transit operates a bus route, the 51, which runs from Patchogue station to Port Jefferson station via Ronkonkoma station, Smith Haven Mall, Stony Brook University, and Port Jefferson. It operates every 30 minutes on weekdays and hourly on weekends. Routes 53 and 55 operate between Port Jefferson station and Patchogue station via Farmingville, New York, and New York State Route 112, respectively.

Port Jefferson&#x27;s main street forms a section of New York State Route 25A, a scenic and historic route through Long Island&#x27;s North Shore from the New York City borough of Queens eastward to Calverton. Just southeast of the village is the eastern terminus of New York State Route 347, a multilane divided highway that connects to the Northern State Parkway in Hauppauge. New York State Route 112, an important north–south route, begins just south of the village and runs to Patchogue, with a dedicated bicycle lane along much of the route.

The idea is similar to many proposals that have been made over the years, collectively called the Long Island Sound link, including one project proposed from Port Jefferson to Bridgeport, Connecticut.
* Port Jefferson&#x27;s Main Street and East Main Street were featured as part of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Mapping Main Street&quot; project in spring 2010.
* The 2015 film &quot;True Story&quot; was filmed in part on the docks behind Danford&#x27;s Hotel.

<text>Remsenburg-Speonk is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the Town of Southampton, Suffolk County, New York, United States. It consists of the hamlets of Remsenburg and Speonk. The population was 2,642 at the 2010 census. The population of this CDP and surrounding ones increases in the summer due to summer renters who come out for the beaches and scenery.

==History==
As early as 1712, meadows in Speonk were leased to cattle owners from Southampton. Most of the early residents came west from Southampton and Bridgehampton in the 1740s, building farms and clearing the forests of wood. In the 1880s, duck farms thrived in Speonk, but few survived past the turn of the century. The name &quot;Speonk&quot; was inspired by a Native American word meaning &quot;high place&quot;. An 1897 Long Island Rail Road catalog listed Speonk, noting that that name &quot;certainly sounds like the call of a frog&quot;. Some residents pressed to change the name to &quot;Remsenburg&quot;, after prominent resident Charles Remsen donated a new Presbyterian church. Today, both names remain in use, each covering different areas of the community.

==Geography==
Remsenburg-Speonk is located at 40° 49&#x27; 13&quot; North, 72° 42&#x27; 4&quot; West (40.820400, -72.701133). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.20%, is water.

<text>Ridge is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 13,336 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===The Longwood Estate===

In 1693, William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith, who owned a homestead in Setauket, was allowed to purchase a large tract of land on the South Shore of Long Island in recognition of his being mayor of Tangier in Africa. The land, called Manor St. George, stretched from the Carmans River (then called the Connecticut River) in the west to the edge of the town of Southampton in the east, with a northern border around present-day New York State Route 25, as much as of land. He made his manor seat on the South Shore in present-day Mastic, and the northern part, now the south side of Ridge, was called &quot;The Swamp&quot; or &quot;Longswamp&quot;. A house wasn&#x27;t built at Longswamp until after the American Revolution. In 1817, William Sydney Smith inhabited the house and changed the name to &quot;Longwood&quot;.

In 1955, what then remained of William Smith&#x27;s original manor was primarily located in Ridge and was surrounded by the world growing up around it, in the form of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the surrounding areas becoming increasingly populated. Longwood&#x27;s fell into the hands of Elbert Clayton Smith, who immediately moved his family from California to live there. He seems to have been very generous to his new community; his donations included to the school board for the construction of Longwood High School and to Middle Island Presbyterian Church. In 1967, Elbert Smith died, and the Longwood Estate was carved into housing developments and nearly destroyed until enough noise was made about preservation to have the house and of land given to the Town of Brookhaven in 1974. The Smith Estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

===Randallville===
In 1738, northern Ridge was settled by widower Samuel Randall of North Stonington, Connecticut; his only son Stephen Randall and his descendants farmed a plot of ground that Samuel had always referred to as &quot;the Ridge&quot; based on the geographical terrain. First called &quot;Randallville&quot;, Ridge was the name selected by its residents for postal delivery. The Randall burial plot near the William Floyd Parkway includes the grave of Lt. Stephen Randall (1736–1818), patriot of the American Revolution and a Suffolk County Militia veteran of the Battle of Long Island. Graves of Randall&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Swezey (1747–1834) and several descendants are also within the plot.

<text>Rocky Point is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Brookhaven, New York, United States. As of the 2010 United States census, the CDP population was 14,014.

==History==

Rocky Point is home to the site where American radio company RCA once operated a large transmitting and transmitter research facility, known as Radio Central. RCA began to transmit transatlantic radio messages from Radio Central over longwave after its opening on November 5, 1921.

On January 7, 1927, AT&amp;T initiated the first transatlantic commercial telephone service, linking London and New York. AT&amp;T&#x27;s transmitter was at Radio Central, and their receiver was in Houlton, Maine. The radiotelephone signal from Radio Central was received by the British General Post Office’s receiver facility in Cupar, Scotland.

The Rocky Point site was decommissioned in 1978 and demolished in the 1980s. It now consists of many concrete ruins and downed telephone poles and radio towers, owned by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. It is part of the Rocky Point Pine Barrens State Forest, which is in the Long Island Central Pine Barrens. The site gives an interesting insight into the 1920s, because—being in the middle of the forest—the footprints of the site remain largely untouched since its operational period. The western terminus of the Paumanok Path hiking trail is in the forest, with the eastern terminus at the Montauk Point Light.

The hamlet was also served by a station of the Long Island Rail Road, located just east of Broadway between Prince Road and King Road. The station was opened in 1895, with service heading east to Wading River and west to Port Jefferson and New York City. The station was abandoned in 1938, with a replica of the station, containing a Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) museum, standing on the site today.

Almost all of Ronkonkoma CDP is in Connetquot Central School District. Three public elementary schools are in Ronkonkoma, with one middle school, and high school students attend Connetquot High School in Bohemia.

A portion of the CDP to the east is in Sachem Central School District. The CDP area also extends into Central Islip Union Free School District to the west, but that portion is taken up entirely by parts of the Connetquot River State Park.

Prior to 1960, the Connetquot School District portion of the area belonged to the Ronkonkoma School District. After a vote, the district merged with the Oakdale-Bohemia School District in the neighboring communities of Oakdale and Bohemia, New York, to create the Connetquot School District.

<text>Sag Harbor is an incorporated village in Suffolk County, New York, United States, in the towns of Southampton and East Hampton on eastern Long Island. The village developed as a working port on Gardiners Bay. The population was 2,772 at the 2020 census.

The entire business district is listed as the historic Sag Harbor Village District on the National Register of Historic Places. A major whaling and shipping port in the 19th century, by the end of this period and in the 20th century, it became a destination for wealthy people who summered there.

Sag Harbor is about three-fifths in Southampton and two-fifths in East Hampton (the Town boundary being Division Street). Its landmarks include structures associated with whaling and its early days when it was designated as the first port of entry to the new United States. It had the first United States custom house erected on Long Island.

==History==


Sag Harbor was settled by English colonists sometime between 1707 and 1730. Many probably migrated from New England by water, as did other settlers on eastern Long Island. The first bill of lading to use the name &quot;Sag Harbor&quot; was recorded in 1730.

While some accounts say the village was named for the neighboring settlement of Sagaponack, which at the time was called Sagg, historians say Sagaponack and Sag Harbor both were named after a tuber cultivated by the local Pequot people and used as a staple crop. In their Algonquian language, they called the vegetable &quot;sagabon&quot;. It was one of the first crops colonists sent to England. The tuber-producing vine is now known as the &quot;Apios americana&quot;.

During the American Revolutionary War, New York Patriots fled from the advancing British and Loyalist forces and departed from Sag Harbor by boat and ship for Connecticut. In 1777 American raiders under Return Jonathan Meigs attacked a British garrison at a fort on a hill in Sag Harbor, killing six and capturing 90 British soldiers in what was called Meigs Raid. The fort was dismantled after the war. The site has become known as the Old Burying Ground and is associated with the Old Whaler&#x27;s Church.

Sag Harbor supplanted Northwest, another port about east of the village in the Town of East Hampton. International ships and the whaling industry had started in Northwest, but its port was too shallow for the developing traffic. The most valuable whale product was whale oil, which was used widely in lamps.

Sag Harbor became a major port for the whaling industry, and the processing and sale of this oil. By 1789 Sag Harbor had &quot;had more tons of square-rigged vessels engaged in commerce than even New York City.&quot; It had become an international port.

After the Second Session of Congress on July 31, 1789, Sag Harbor was declared as the first official port of entry to the United States. Its streets were filled with sailors, artisans, merchants, representatives of the many different cultures working in shipping and whaling. As the first stop for ships entering United States territory, Sag Harbor received ships bound for New York City. The United States government placed a customs house in the town, the first on Long Island, to collect duties and other fees.

During the War of 1812, a British squadron dominated and controlled most of Long Island Sound. Several open British boats entered the harbor at night, without any advance planning; the young commanding midshipman, C. Claxton R.N., was curious about the village. He later wrote about his youthful misadventures years when serving as editor of &quot;The Naval Monitor.&quot; They landed at the wharf, but an alarm gun was fired before they could set fire to the coasting vessel docked there and they quickly retreated. Claxton and his men made it safely back to HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot;, anchored off Gardiners Island.

The village of Sag Harbor is in the Towns of both Southampton and East Hampton. The dividing line is Division Street, known as Town Line Road just south of the village. Most of the defining 19th-century landmarks of the village — including its Main Street, Old Whaler&#x27;s Church, John Jermain Memorial Library, Whaling Museum, Custom House, the Old Burying Ground, Oakland Cemetery, Mashashimuet Park, and Otter Pond are in Southampton. However, almost all of the Bay Street marina complex, including Sag Harbor Yacht Club and Breakwater Yacht Club, at the foot of Main Street, is in East Hampton. Also there are the village&#x27;s high school, the Sag Harbor State Golf Course, and the historic freedmen&#x27;s community of Eastville, first developed in the early 1800s.

The whaling industry in Sag Harbor peaked in the 1840s, but its importance had been widely recognized. Writer Herman Melville mentioned Sag Harbor in his novel &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. 
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it&#x27;s a wicked world in all meridians; I&#x27;ll die a pagan.

Historic buildings from this period include the Old Whaler&#x27;s Church, a Presbyterian church that sported a steeple. When the church opened in 1843, the steeple made it the tallest structure on Long Island. The steeple collapsed during the Great Hurricane of 1938. While the church has received major restoration, the steeple has not been rebuilt.

Whaling merchant Benjamin Huntting II commissioned a grand, 1845 Greek Revival home designed by American architect Minard Lafever. It is now owned and used by The Sag Harbor Whaling &amp; Historical Museum, which is open to the public. The Masonic Lodge (Wamponamon 437), which occupies the second floor, celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008.

Lafever is also credited with designing the Old Whaler&#x27;s Church and the Masonic Temple. The broken mast monument in Oakland Cemetery is the most visible of several memorials to men who died at sea.

The whaling business collapsed after 1847, as other methods were discovered to create kerosene and other fuels; the first was coal oil. The discovery of petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859 sealed the end.

Many of the ships based in Sag Harbor carried erstwhile miners around South America to San Francisco during the California Gold Rush, where the vessels were abandoned. The last whaling ship — the &quot;Myra&quot;, captained by Henry W. Babcock — sailed from Sag Harbor in 1871.

Mercator Cooper sailed as crew out of Sag Harbor on November 9, 1843, on the &quot;Manhattan&quot;. He was on a voyage to Japan, and became one of the first Americans to visit Tokyo Bay. Pyrrhus Concer, an African-American sailor, also served on the ship; he was the first African-American man known to be seen by the Japanese. Cooper continued with major sailing expeditions. On January 26, 1853, he left Sag Harbor on the &quot;Levant&quot;, bound to the South Pole. He was the first person to set foot on East Antarctica.

In 1870 the Long Island Rail Road built a Sag Harbor Branch to the village. It began to carry visitors and summer residents attracted to the harbor and the light of eastern Long Island. Given changes in passenger traffic and railroad operations, the former station is now operated as a gardening store.

New residents continued to settle in the village. In 1896, the oldest synagogue on Long Island, Temple Adas Israel, was founded in Sag Harbor.

During World War I, the E. W. Bliss Company tested torpedoes in the harbor a half mile north of the village. (They did not have live warheads.) As part of the process, Long Wharf in Sag Harbor was reinforced with concrete. Rail spurs were built along the wharf to carry torpedoes to be loaded onto ships for testing. At the time, the wharf was owned by the Long Island Rail Road, which handled the transport of torpedoes to Sag Harbor. Among those observing the tests was Thomas Alva Edison. Divers occasionally still find torpedoes from this era on the bay floor. Most of the wharf&#x27;s buildings, including one now operated as the Bay Street Theatre, were built during this period.

Sag Harbor was the residence of writer John Steinbeck from 1955 until his death in 1968. Steinbeck did some of his writings in a little house on the edge of his property, including &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot;, which was set in a fictionalized version of Sag Harbor and whose main character works at a grocery store modelled after Schiavoni&#x27;s. His view from the writing house overlooked the Upper Sag Harbor Cove. As recounted in his memoir, &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, Steinbeck started an 11-week trip with his dog, Charley, from Sag Harbor across the United States.

Steinbeck Writers&#x27; Retreat is a writer&#x27;s residency program at John Steinbeck&#x27;s home in Sag Harbor. It is run by the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas in Austin. Every fellow and writer-in-residence interacts with the community during their time at the residency, through readings from novels, film screenings and discussions, or read-throughs of plays.

The Church is a nonprofit arts center in Sag Harbor was founded by artists Eric Fischl and April Gornik. It opened April 15, 2021, and has an exhibition space and artists residency program.The Sag Harbor-North Haven Bridge was renamed in November 2008 as The LCpl Jordan Haerter Veterans&#x27; Memorial Bridge. It is believed to be the site of the 1995 suicide of Ray Johnson, a Pop artist. Spalding Gray, a writer and performer, attempted suicide at the bridge in September 2002 and October 2003.

===African-American history===
The United States Coast Survey map from the mid-1830s shows the square symbols for houses in the Eastville area. By 1840, the St. David A.M.E. Zion congregation built a church on Eastville Avenue.

Poet and educator Olivia Ward Bush-Banks (1869–1944) was born in Sag Harbour on February 27, 1869, to parents of African and Montauk descent. Noted Author Colson Whitehead wrote the book &quot;Sag Harbor&quot; about his childhood in the area.

After the Second World War, African Americans started to settle in what became the neighborhoods of Sag Harbor Hills, Ninevah, Azurest, Eastville and Chatfield&#x27;s Hill. Mrs. Hunter J. Terry (1887 - 1968) had been a regular summer visitor here, at a coastal woodland acreage she called Azurest. She urged the owners, the Gales of Huntington, L.I., to develop the land as a peaceful resort for African Americans. Lots were cheap at the time, although loans were not available. Thus lots and houses are small. The streets Terry Drive, Richards Drive, and Meredith Avenue were named for members of her family. The roads Walker and Milton were named for African-American whalers. Cuffee Drive was named for Paul Cuffee, a prominent African-American whaler. The first homeowners and two more generations had lived here near the beach by the time Mrs. Terry died in the late 1960s. Later a few African-American celebrities and prominent New York businessmen made their summer homes there.

As of the 2010s, there is pressure from investors who, consolidating lots and planning to build larger houses than is customary, pose a threat to the character of the neighborhoods. In 2016, a collective group was formed to study these impacts on the Sag Harbor Hills, Azurest, and Ninevah Subdivisions, known by the acronym SANS. They have begun a survey of the historic resources of this area, believing they may gain listing as a historic district on the State and National Register of Historic Places, through which they could establish protection for the district. On July 10, 2019
(NP ref#100004217) was listed as the Sag Harbor Hills, Azurest, and Ninevah Beach Subdivisions Historic District.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has an area of , of which is land and , or 22.44%, is water.

In the village of Sag Harbor, fresh drinking water was obtained from digging wells to support the town&#x27;s population. “The original source of water supply was secured from four dug wells in the southern part of the village of Sag Harbor”. As Sag Harbor&#x27;s population has increased, the village has had to start bringing in fresh water from pipe lines.

As in many areas, the village practice of running sewage and storm water into the bays of Sag Harbor had to change. Sewage from the village of Sag Harbor is processed by the Department of Public Works, Wastewater Treatment Plant. It uses &quot;chlorine to kill bacteria&quot; before [sewage] enters the bay. By 2014, the village was using an ultra-violet system to kill the bacteria.

=== Topography ===
The majority of Sag Harbor lies on a flat, sandy coastal plain which makes up much of southern Long Island and extends along the southern coast of the island. It is the remains of a glacial moraine. Small hills rise up from the shore at about inland. Knolls and hills are dominated mostly by Red and Scarlet oak trees, which are interspersed with pitch and white pines. On many of the protected bay shores, wetlands and dune ecosystems dominate the land.

==Media==

=== Newspapers ===

Long Island&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;Frothingham&#x27;s Long-Island Herald&quot;, was published in Sag Harbor by David Frothingham between 1791 and 1796. His wife, Nancy Pell, ran the newspaper until 1802. Frothingham was sued and found guilty of slander by Alexander Hamilton for an article published in the Brooklyn newspaper, &quot;The Argus&quot;. Unable to pay the bond, Frothingham became a seaman. He is believed to have died at sea, somewhere off the coast of Africa.

According to local historian Dorothy Zaykowski, &quot;Sag Harbor&#x27;s earliest newspapers published little in the way of local news, concentrating instead on a story, sermon, and both national and international events. It is likely folks learned all the local gossip and goings on at the general store barber shop, or on the street corner.&quot;

The community newspaper &quot;The Corrector&quot; was first published in 1822. According to Zaykowski, Henry Wentworth Hunt came to the village from Boston with three sons, two of whom followed him into the newspaper business. He published &quot;The Corrector&quot; weekly until 1837; then published it semi-weekly until his death in 1859. His sons Alexander and Brinley Sleight Hunt took over and published the newspaper daily. When this proved unprofitable, they reverted to weekly publication. &quot;The Corrector&quot; later was known as the &quot;Sag Harbor Corrector&quot;.

The &quot;Sag Harbor Corrector&quot; was eventually purchased in 1919 by Burton Corwin, owner of the &quot;Sag Harbor News&quot;; the merged papers became the &quot;Sag Harbor News and Corrector&quot;. This amalgamated newspaper was subsequently purchased in the late 1920s by the Gardner family, owners of &quot;The Sag Harbor Express&quot;. They made the latter the only newspaper in town.
&quot;The Sag Harbor Express&quot; is still the newspaper for Sag Harbor Village, the Village of North Haven, the Sag Harbor School District and the Bridgehampton School District.

=== Radio ===
WLNG has been on-the-air at 92.1 FM since April 1969. The station previously operated on 1600 AM from 1963 until 1969.

== Entertainment ==

Since 1915, four movie theaters have operated at 90 Main Street. They were George&#x27;s Theatre, The Elite, Glynne&#x27;s Sag Harbor Theatre, and the Sag Harbor Theatre. The latter was known for its art deco neon sign that read &quot;Sag Harbor.&quot; The theatre changed its name to the Sag Harbor Cinema in 1978. On December 16, 2016, a fire broke out and destroyed the cinema. The cinema was rebuilt by the non-profit Sag Harbor Partnership, opening again in 2021.

Alan Alda&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; was shot in Sag Harbor.

In 1991, The Bay Street Theater was founded by Sybil Christopher, Emma Walton Hamilton and Stephen Hamilton. It is in a building on Long Wharf and operates year-round.

Sag Harbor is the home of actress Julie Andrews.

==Education==
The school district for the village is Sag Harbor Union Free School District. The district includes both the Sag Harbor Elementary School and Pierson Middle-High School.

Stella Maris Regional School a Catholic private school, was based in Sag Harbor but closed in 2011. In May 2016, voters in Sag Harbor approved the Sag Harbor Union Free School District&#x27;s purchase of the Stella Maris Regional School property from the St. Andrew Roman Catholic Church for $3.3 million. The building now houses the district&#x27;s pre-kindergarten program.

==Nature and protected areas==
Nature preserves have been established in the area and Sag Harbor has rich fauna for its region. Endangered species, such as the eastern tiger salamander, inhabit wetlands surrounding the village. The &quot;Long Pond Greenbelt&quot;, which straddles Sag Harbor&#x27;s southern boundary, is a well-known chain of ponds formed by a retreating glacier. Other natural sites around the village include Barcelona Neck Preserve, Millers Ground Preserve, Sag Harbor Woods Preserve, and the recently acquired Cilli Farm, which lies in the center of the village.

Mammals found in these areas include white-tailed deer, red fox, eastern coyote, long-tailed weasel, mink, muskrat, woodchuck, and several bat species. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are seen in the bay. There may be river otters, which are close to local extinction in Long Island, but an estimated eight animals are thought to have recently migrated from Connecticut. A large array of amphibian and reptilian species also live in the area, including the marbled salamander, tiger salamander, spotted salamander, box turtle, spotted turtle, gray tree frog, eastern newt, black racer snake, hognose snake and rough green snake, to name a few. Kazimierz Wierzyński, an exiled Polish poet and a writer, who lived in Sag Harbor for almost twenty years with his wife Halina, devoted large parts of his collection of essays &quot;My Private America&quot; to the animals he saw there, especially the birds, and an American &quot;attraction to nature.&quot;

===Cilli Farm===

The Cilli Farm was a dairy farm owned and operated by Vitali and Antonina Cilli and their family in the early 1900s. The village acquired the farm to operate it as a refuge for wildlife in the area. It serves as an ecological island, giving large animals such as white-tailed deer a home base. Although it is protected, it is threatened by dumping and littering. The large farm acreage includes various habitats, such as including marshes, grasslands, birch forests, cedar groves, sand flats, and coastal watersheds, providing key habitat for wildlife and supporting great botanic diversity.

The wet lands and bay shellfish have suffered episodes of Brown Tide, an algal hyperproduction. The Brown Tide has adversely affected the populations of bay scallops and mussels in the surrounding bays. When the brown tide is active, the scallops and mussels populations decline.

=== The Sag Harbor Oyster Club ===
The Sag Harbor Oyster Club was formalized into a 501-3c in 2020 with the mission of clean water advocacy up and down the East Coast. Fully-funded by Simon Harrison Real Estate from its inception, the effort follows on from the Conscience Point Shellfish Hatchery, an &quot;oyster garden&quot; under the Sag Harbor village docks funded and maintained by real estate broker and clean water advocate, Simon Harrison. The oyster farming endeavor was intended to put the shellfish to work cleaning the harbor&#x27;s water.

In January 2016, after learning that oysters were being raised so close to the outlet pipe of the Sag Harbor sewage water treatment plant on the village waterfront, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ordered the Sag Harbor Harbormaster to shutter the operation. New York State prohibits cultivation of shellfish in uncertified waters – where harvesting of oysters for human consumption is banned. A further danger is oysters ingesting (and filtering) polluted water, as they too become tainted. Harrison stressed his oysters were not offered for human consumption.

<text>Sagaponack ( ) is a village in the Town of Southampton in Suffolk County, on the East End of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population of the village was 770 at the 2020 census. Sagaponack is the second wealthiest zip code in the United States. 

== History ==
The area was first settled around 1653. The village was incorporated on September 2, 2005, in the wake of the failed attempt by Dunehampton, New York to incorporate. Dunehampton&#x27;s incorporation would have blocked Sagaponack from beaches on the Atlantic Ocean. The villages are seeking to address various beach issues including erosion arising from groynes at Georgica Pond in East Hampton village.

Prior to its incorporation, Sagaponack was a census-designated place, with a population of 582 at the time of the 2000 census, and an area 70% greater than that of the current village.

The name &quot;Sagaponack&quot; comes from the Shinnecock Nation&#x27;s word for &quot;land of the big ground nuts&quot;, in reference to the Ground Nut (&quot;Apios americana&quot;). A common misconception is that the name referred to potatoes, the predominant crop grown by farmers who first settled the area. Many of the huge estates in the village were built on former potato fields. Its first settler was Josiah Stanborough in 1656. The village was originally called Sagg.

Sag Harbor, just north of Sagaponack, is believed to have derived its name from the village. West of Sagaponack is a place that the Native Americans called Mecox, now a hamlet on the west side of Sagaponack Lake in the CDP of Bridgehampton.

In July 2015, according to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, the 11962 ZIP Code encompassing Sagaponack was listed as the most expensive in the U.S., with a median home sale price of $5,125,000, rising to $8,500,000 in the end of the year.

Statements opposing Ira L. Rennert&#x27;s construction plans were given at the August 27, 1998, Board of Zoning Appeals hearing by Kurt Vonnegut and Andre Gregory, appalled at the board&#x27;s acceptance of the 29-bedroom establishment as a &quot;single-family house&quot;.

Many homes around the lanes in Sagaponack have become well-featured and instantly recognisable landmarks that define the vistas and landscape of the Hamptons. Notable iconic sights include the Sagg Store on Sagg Main Street, farm and modern houses along Daniels Lane, and Ira Rennert&#x27;s home, Fairfield.

The Elizabeth Reese House designed by Andrew Geller is historically significant in architecture.

<doc id="127368" wikidata="Q439123" url="?curid=127368" title="Thomas Cavendish">
<text>Sir Thomas Cavendish (1560 – May 1592) was an English explorer and a privateer known as &quot;The Navigator&quot; because he was the first who deliberately tried to emulate Sir Francis Drake and raid the Spanish towns and ships in the Pacific and return by circumnavigating the globe. Magellan&#x27;s-Elcano, Loaísa, Drake&#x27;s, and Loyola&#x27;s expeditions had preceded Cavendish in circumnavigating the globe. His first trip and successful circumnavigation made him rich from captured Spanish gold, silk and treasure from the Pacific and the Philippines. His richest prize was the captured 600-ton sailing ship the Manila Galleon &quot;Santa Ana&quot; (also called &quot;Santa Anna&quot;). He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I of England after his return. He later set out for a second raiding and circumnavigation trip but was not as fortunate and died at sea at the age of 31.

==Early life==
Cavendish was baptized on 19 September 1560 in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Trimley St Martin, Suffolk. He was the third son of William Cavendish and Mary Wentworth. When his father died in 1572, Cavendish inherited a sizeable estate and was placed under the guardianship of Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth. Wentworth was required to ensure that the boy was prepared for a university education.

In the spring of 1576 at the age of 15, he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge but left in November 1577 without taking a degree. He then entered Gray&#x27;s Inn, London, and for the next several years maintained a lavish lifestyle, making connections in London society including the royal court. He also came to know Richard Hakluyt and others in his circle who were advocating for the English colonization of North America. Cavendish gained a reputation as a spendthrift and between 1583 and in 1585 he was taken to court for non-payment of debts.

==Roanoke Colony==
In the 1580s, Cavendish looked for advancement under the patronage of Walter Raleigh. Raleigh and the Earl of Pembroke helped Cavendish to become a member of parliament representing the borough of Shaftesbury in 1584. In turn, he supported Raleigh&#x27;s efforts to assume Humphrey Gilbert&#x27;s contract to colonize America. Cavendish also studied navigation under the direction of Thomas Harriot at Raleigh&#x27;s Durham House in Westminster.

In 1585, Cavendish was appointed second-in-command to Richard Grenville on an expedition to establish Roanoke Colony in Virginia. He invested in the purchase and provisioning of the fleet that left Plymouth on 9 April 1585. The ships were scattered by a fierce storm but Cavendish&#x27;s ship, &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, survived and reached the rendezvous point in Puerto Rico. Grenville was impressed with the navigational skills displayed by Cavendish on his first voyage.

Grenville and Cavendish spent several weeks in the Caribbean gathering supplies for the new colony. They were able to purchase supplies from the Spanish and Hispaniola and also seized two Spanish ships that they encountered along the way. In late June they reached the Outer Banks in present-day North Carolina where the Roanoke colony was established.

Cavendish returned to England in August aboard the &quot;Tyger&quot; without profit from his investments but he did gain important experience and several close friends.

==First voyage: a successful westbound circumnavigation==

By July 1586 Spain and England were in a war which would culminate with the Spanish Armada and its threatened invasion of England in 1588. Cavendish determined to follow Sir Francis Drake by raiding the Spanish ports and ships in the Pacific and circumnavigating the globe. After getting permission for his proposed raids, Cavendish built a 120-ton sailing ship, with eighteen cannons, named the &quot;Desire&quot;. He was joined by the sixty ton, ten gun, ship &quot;Content&quot;, and the forty ton ship &quot;Hugh Gallant&quot;.

===Departure and Atlantic crossing===

Thomas Cavendish with his three ships and 123 men set out from Plymouth, England on 21 July 1586.

He anchored first at the island of Santa Magdalena near Punta Arenas, in the Strait of Magellan. There, in two hours, they killed and salted two barrels full of penguins for food. After extensive exploration of the many inlets, labyrinths, and intricate channels of the islands and broken lands of Tierra del Fuego and its environs they emerged from the strait into the Pacific on 24 February and sailed up the coast of South America.

===Exploring and raiding off the west coast of South America===
There on the Pacific coast he sank or captured nine Spanish ships and looted several towns of quantities of fresh food, supplies and treasure while intentionally sinking the ship &quot;Hugh Gallant&quot; to use her crew to replace crew members lost on his other ships. According to Hakluyt&#x27;s &#x27;Voyages&#x27; he raided an island on the coast of Ecuador (probably Isla Puna) but was repulsed with loss by local forces.

===Capturing a Manila galleon===
A pilot from one of the captured Spanish ships revealed that a Manila galleon was expected in October or November 1587 and usually stopped at Cape San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula before going on to Acapulco. The Manila galleons were restricted by the Spanish Monarch to one or two ships/year and typically carried all the goods accumulated in the Philippines in a year&#x27;s worth of trading silver, from the Mints in Peru and Mexico, with the Chinese and others, for spices, silk, gold and other expensive goods. In 1587 there were two Manila galleons: the &quot;San Francisco&quot; and the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;. Unfortunately both encountered a typhoon on leaving the Philippines and were wrecked on the coast of Japan. Only the &quot;Santa Ana&quot; was salvageable and after repairs resumed her voyage.
Upon reaching the Gulf of California in October 1587 Cavendish and his two ships put in at an island above Mazatlan where they careened their ships to clean their bottoms and made general repairs. They had to dig wells for water. They sailed for Cape San Lucas on the Baja Peninsula and set up patrols to see if they could spot the Manila galleon. Early on 4 November 1587 one of Cavendish&#x27;s lookouts spotted the 600-ton galleon manned with over 200 men. After a several hour chase the English ships overhauled the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;—which conveniently had no cannons on board, in order to carry the added cargo. After several hours of battle during which Cavendish used his cannon to fire ball and grape shot into the galleon while the Spanish tried to fight back with small arms, the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, now starting to sink, finally struck her colours and surrendered.

Because of the great disparity in size the &quot;Content&quot; and &quot;Desire&quot; had to pick and choose what rich cargo they wanted to transfer to their ships from the much larger &quot;Santa Ana&quot;. One hundred and ninety Spaniards (including Sebastián Vizcaíno, later explorer of the California coast), and Filipino crewmen, were set ashore with food and some weapons in a location where they had water and food available. Cavendish kept with him two Japanese sailors, three boys from Manila, a Portuguese traveller familiar with China and a Spanish pilot (navigator). They loaded all the gold (about 100 troy pounds/37.3 kilograms or 122,000 pesos worth) and then picked through the silks, damasks, musks (used in perfume manufacture), spices, wines, and ship&#x27;s supplies for what they could carry. Some in Mexico claimed that the total value of the cargo was about 2,000,000 pesos/50 tonnes of silver. After setting fire to the &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, the &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Content&quot; sailed away on 17 November 1587 to begin their voyage across the Pacific Ocean.

While burning, the &quot;Santa Ana&quot; drifted onto the coast where the Spanish survivors extinguished the flames, re-floated the ship and limped into Acapulco.

The &quot;Content&quot; was never heard from again. The &quot;Desire&quot; tried to avoid conflict for the rest of her voyage.

===Crossing the Pacific Ocean and exploring the islands of South East Asia===
After crossing the Pacific Ocean, Cavendish and the &quot;Desire&quot; arrived at the island of Guam on 3 January 1588. There he traded iron tools for fresh supplies, water and wood, supplied by the natives. On further landings in the Philippines, Java and other islands, he traded some of his captured linen and other goods for fresh supplies, water and wood, and collected information about the Chinese and Japanese coasts. He hoped to use this information to augment existing English knowledge of the area and for a possible second voyage. His crew of about 48 men replaced their worn out clothing and bedding with uniforms made out of silken damask.

Cavendish attacked Arevalo, the capital of the Spanish settlement in Iloilo at the time in 1587 with the raid giving the town the distinction of being the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines to be attacked by a British pirate. It was also the first recorded British incursion into Philippine waters.

===Return to England===
By 14 May 1588 Cavendish reached the coast of Africa and returned to England by way of the Cape of Good Hope, stopping at the island of Saint Helena for supplies.

On 9 September 1588 the &quot;Desire&quot; sailed into the harbour at Plymouth, England. Later she paraded up the River Thames through London, displaying her new sails of blue damask.

Cavendish&#x27;s first voyage was a huge success both financially and otherwise; Cavendish was not yet 28 at his return. The circumnavigation of the globe had been completed in two years and 49 days, nine months faster than Drake, although, like Drake, Cavendish returned with only one of his ships—the &quot;Desire&quot; with a crew of about 48 men. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was invited to a dinner aboard the &quot;Desire&quot;. England celebrated both the return of the &quot;Desire&quot; and the defeat of the Spanish Armada earlier that year.

==Second voyage and death==
Cavendish sailed on a second expedition in August 1591, accompanied by the navigator John Davis. They went further south to the Strait of Magellan and then returned to Brazil, where they hid and reprovisioned in Ilhabela and looted Santos and São Vicente. Going further north, they lost most of the crew in a battle against the Portuguese at the village of Vitória, today the capital of the State of Espirito Santo. One abandoned sailor, Anthony Knivet, later wrote about his adventures in Brazil. Cavendish set off across the Atlantic towards Saint Helena with the remainder of the crew, but died of unknown causes at age 31, possibly off Ascension Island in the South Atlantic in 1592. The last letter of Cavendish, written to his executor a few days before his death, accuses John Davis of being a &quot;villain&quot; who caused the &quot;decay of the whole action&quot;. John Davis continued on with Cavendish&#x27;s crew and ships and discovered the Falkland Islands before returning to England with most of his crew lost to starvation and illness.

==In popular culture==
*Cavendish is the central figure in the 1948 historical novel &quot;Captain for Elizabeth&quot; by Jan Westcott, which follows the events of his first circumnavigation.
*Cavendish tobacco, a popular pipe tobacco, is named after Thomas Cavendish.
*In the anime and manga series &quot;One Piece&quot;, a pirate named Cavendish refers to Thomas Cavendish.

<doc id="127370" wikidata="Q3469089" url="?curid=127370" title="Sayville, New York">
<text>Sayville is a hamlet and census-designated place in Suffolk County, New York, United States. Located on the South Shore of Long Island in the Town of Islip, the population of the CDP was 16,569 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of Sayville were the Secatogue tribe of the Algonquian peoples.

Sayville was founded by John Edwards (b. 1738) of East Hampton, New York. He built his home, the first in Sayville, in 1761, located at what is now the northwest corner of Foster Avenue and Edwards Street. The house was destroyed by fire in March 1913. Another man, John Greene, settled what is now known as West Sayville in 1767.

The community had no formal name until 1838 when residents gathered to choose a name for their post office, which had opened on March 22, 1837.
Until that time, Sayville was known informally as &quot;over south.&quot; The townspeople held a meeting to decide on a name, and after Edwardsville and Greensville tied in a vote, one resident suggested &quot;Seaville&quot;. According to historical accounts, the clerk at that particular meeting did not know how to spell and had to go home and look in an old Bible he had brought from England years before. In the Bible, the word &quot;sea&quot; was spelled &quot;s-a-y&quot;,
 and &quot;Sayville&quot; became the name he sent to Washington. After the error was discovered, the community sent a letter of protest to Washington D.C.; however, the Postmaster General responded
that the name should stay &quot;Sayville&quot;, as there were many &quot;Seaville&quot;s in the world but no &quot;Sayville&quot;s. As a result, the name stuck. The claim is also sometimes made that &quot;in some very old Bibles, the town name is also spelled &#x27;S-a-v-i-l-l-e&#x27;&quot;., It may be noted that until the early 19th Century, it was common in many varieties of English to pronounce &quot;sea&quot; so that it rhymed with &quot;obey&quot;, and thus &quot;Sayville&quot; could have been a phonetic representation of how some speakers would have pronounced &quot;Seaville.&quot;
Sayville became important mainly for its timber and oysters. Beginning in 1868, when the South Side Railroad arrived, the hamlet became a summer tourist destination. Over 30 hotels were built in the area, which hosts a ferry to Fire Island. Between 1880 and 1930, many grand homes and estates were built in Sayville, including Meadow Croft, the home of John Ellis Roosevelt, a cousin of Theodore Roosevelt. Meadow Croft still stands and is part of Suffolk County&#x27;s San Souci Lakes Nature Preserve.

In 1912 a German Telefunken wireless transmitter was built in Sayville (now West Sayville) to broadcast to Germany. In 1915 the transmitter allegedly relayed a message from the German embassy to &quot;get Lucy&quot;, referring to the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; which was sunk on May 15. Whether the signals coming from the transmitter in Sayville authorized the attack or not, they caused concern for the US government, which dispatched Marines to ensure that encrypted messages were not sent. The station was seized by the government outright after war was declared in 1917. President Woodrow Wilson sent a contingent of Marines to seize the wireless station, making it the first hostile action taken by the United States against Germany during World War I.
From 1919 to 1932 Sayville was home to Father Divine, a controversial African American religious leader who claimed to be God. His religious movement, which came to be called the International Peace Mission movement, managed a commune-like house on 72 Macon Avenue, which was the first black-owned residence in Sayville. At that time Sayville was predominantly a seasonal resort, and Father Divine&#x27;s followers made good livings as native house sitters. Because followers turned over all of their profits to Father Divine, he was able to build several expansions on the house. He even bought an expensive Cadillac when neighbors complained about his noisy Hudson automobile.

Father Divine&#x27;s ostentation annoyed the middle-class residents. Excess traffic that Father Divine attracted made him unpopular even to businesses he patronized with large cash purchases. Following a June 1932 trial and prison sentence for disturbing the peace, Father Divine moved to Harlem, New York, claiming that Sayville was racist. However, the commune remained on Macon Avenue for many years. Father Divine occasionally preached in Sayville afterward, but the home was only an outpost of his movement, not its headquarters.

On January 27, 1992, a 20 year old man was charged with arson following a fire that destroyed 19th century buildings on Main Street. In August of that same year, Louis Gelsomino, an 18 year old on the Sayville volunteer fire department was charged with two counts of murder and five counts of arson for starting the previous fire.

In 1994, California State University at Fresno designated Sayville the &quot;friendliest town in America&quot;.

In early March 2024, the Sayville United Methodist Church received criticism for one of its signs that contained the phrase, &quot;Heaven has strict immigration laws. Hell has open borders&quot;.

<text>Selden (historically known as Westfield) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 21,262 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The farmers who first moved to what is now Selden in the mid-18th century referred to the area as &quot;Westfield&quot; (or sometimes as Westfields). One of the better known early residents was Captain Daniel Roe (1740–1820), who fought in the French and Indian War and served as a captain in the Revolutionary War, and for whom Captain Daniel Roe Highway is named. Roe built a house in Selden along Middle Country Road before the Revolutionary War. Roe is buried in a small family cemetery south of Middle Country Road behind the Old Westfield shopping center.

Roe sided with the Patriots in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. In the fall of 1776, Roe was assigned to lead a raid against the Tory and Hessian detachment near Selden led by his cousin Richard Miller. Miller was a wanted man, and Roe himself had pledged 10 pounds of the bounty offered for Miller&#x27;s capture. When Miller rode right by Roe&#x27;s house in uniform, he was confronted by Roe&#x27;s men and ordered to dismount. Instead, Miller fired his pistol and turned to flee, whereupon he was shot by the militiamen. Miller was then carried into Roe&#x27;s house, where he died.

===19th-century farm community===
A school district for the Westfield area was first created in 1815, carved out of the districts for New Village (now Centereach) and Coram. Originally named District 25, it was renumbered as District 12 in 1842, which it remained until the formation of the Middle Country Central School District in 1957.

When a post office was opened in 1852, Westfield had already been taken as a name by a community upstate. Upstate attorney (and later judge) Henry Selden promised to do &quot;something handsome&quot; if the community named itself after him. The name was adopted, though it is usually said to be unknown whether he ever followed through on his promise, and probably did not. While some sources report that the attorney had no known connection to the community, one newspaper reported in 1858 that Selden and attorney Edward Boyle (the namesake for Boyle Road) acquired a large tract of land in the hamlet shortly before the post office opened, and started to develop it.

As of 1885, Selden was home to 88 residents and a Presbyterian church (built in 1857), and noted for producing melons and early garden vegetables from its farms. Around 1897, the popular cross-island Bicycle Path was completed and ran through Selden. A popular stop along the path, &quot;Wheelmen&#x27;s Rest&quot;, was in Selden and run by Albert Norton.

===Twentieth century and growth===

In 1916, the Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium opened on land then considered to be part of Holtsville. The location, including some of its original buildings, became in 1961 the main (Ammerman) campus of Suffolk County Community College, which today has an enrollment of over 11,000 students.

From 1919 to 1959, Telescope Hill on the south side of Selden was the location of a fire lookout tower. During World War II, a German U-boat spotted from Telescope Hill was later captured but not identified.

In 1935, a new public school building was built near the same location as the prior school building, near the intersection of Bicycle Path and Middle Country Road. That building was renovated in the 1980s and became a branch of the Middle Country Public Library.

The main thoroughfare, Middle Country Road, was paved from Smithtown and through Selden to Coram around 1927–1928. The rural nature of Selden soon began to change, when in 1931 (when it had around 131 residents ), real estate agents began marketing small lots to New York City residents as retreats from urban living, in a development called &quot;Nature&#x27;s Gardens&quot;. This was located on the south side of Middle Country Road and Evergreen Drive. Suburban development increased in earnest in the early 1950s, and by the early 1970s Selden had become a primarily suburban community.

===Commercial development===
The primary road in the hamlet, and the location of most of the commercial development, is New York State Route 25 (Middle Country Road), which runs east to west. Similar to surrounding communities, Selden has a number of shopping centers along Middle Country Road, which developed as suburban growth spread eastward.

In 1972, the first Westfield Shopping Center opened at the intersection of Middle Country and Blue Point roads, with a Hills Supermarkets location.

In 1975, College Plaza opened at the northeast corner of the Middle Country Road and Boyle Road intersection. Its original anchor tenants included King Kullen, Builders Emporium, and Genovese Drug Stores.

Selden Plaza, at the intersection of Middle Country and County Route 83 (in Coram but within the Selden ZIP Code), opened in 1978.

In 1992, a new major shopping center, Independence Plaza, opened at the northwest corner of Middle Country and Boyle Roads, adjacent to College Plaza. As of 2009, plans had been made to develop a town center in and around Independence Plaza. This has significantly increased the popularity of &quot;Downtown Selden&quot; in the past few years attracting more local and national chain businesses.

<text>Setauket is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the North Shore of Long Island. As of the 2010 United States census, the CDP population, which at the time included East Setauket as well, was 15,477.

Setauket was founded in 1655, the first settlement in what would become the town of Brookhaven. Prior to the 2020 census, the community was part of the Setauket-East Setauket CDP. The area was split in 2020 into two separate CDPs: Setauket and East Setauket despite many in the community still considering it one locality.

Setauket was founded as an agricultural community in the mid-17th century, and was a regional center of activity during the American Revolutionary War noted for the Culper spy ring and the Battle of Setauket. Many of Setauket&#x27;s early structures are intact and now form the Old Setauket Historic District. The Setaukets remain a mostly residential area, while bordering the more commercial enclaves of Port Jefferson and Stony Brook. The handful of businesses within the community largely cater to the over 25,000 students of Stony Brook University, which is adjacent to the CDP.

==History==

===Origins===

The name &quot;Setauket&quot; is derived from the historic Algonquian-speaking Setalcott Indians, who had lived in the area prior to its colonial period.

In 1655, a handful of land-speculating colonists orchestrated the purchase of the Setauket area from the local natives. The region&#x27;s first European settlers were English migrants from New England. This was the first settlement in what later became the town of Brookhaven, and both the hamlet and town use the 1655 date as their origin. During the 17th century, Setauket was synonymous with the colonial town of Brookhaven.

During the 1660s the settlement was temporarily renamed &quot;Ashford&quot;. This change was facilitated by Captain John Scott, a professional mercenary hired to clear out the Native American Indians. He was an early settler of Setauket and an important leader in Long Island&#x27;s early history who briefly served under the title of &quot;President of Long Island&quot;. A crafty land speculator, Scott claimed at one point to own a third of the island, including the Setauket area. Despite the questionable nature of many of his claims, John Scott had enough power and support to rename Setauket for his ancestral homeland in England, Ashford, Kent, and to construct a stately home named Egerton.

John Woolman, a well known preacher and journalist, noted having attended a Quaker meeting at &quot;Setawket&quot; in the spring of 1747.

===American Revolution===

In the American Revolutionary War, the 1777 Battle of Setauket was fought on the village green. At the time, Loyalists controlled Setauket and had fortified the Presbyterian church for use as their stronghold. A Patriot force led by General Samuel Holden Parsons sailed across Long Island Sound from Fairfield, Connecticut, proposing to attack the Loyalists. Three hours of gunfire ensued before Parsons withdrew and returned to Connecticut, with minimal casualties for either side. During the gunfight, Parsons&#x27; men took cover behind &quot;Patriots&#x27; Rock&quot;, which remains near the village green with a commemorative plaque. Because of this rock&#x27;s massive size, it provided more than sufficient cover for the soldiers. Some of the bullets were embedded into the walls of the extant Caroline Church of Brookhaven.

From 1778 to 1781, the Culper Spy Ring passed information about British troop movements gathered in New York City to George Washington. The spy ring consisted primarily of Setauket residents, including its leader Benjamin Tallmadge and key agent Abraham Woodhull. The Culper ring was highly successful and alerted Washington to such plots as a surprise attack on the newly allied French forces, a scheme to counterfeit Continental currency, and the secret defection of a general in the Continental Army (afterwards known to be Benedict Arnold). Washington later spent a night in Setauket during his 1790 tour of Long Island.

During the British occupation, residents held religious services at the c.1729 Caroline Church (Episcopal) while occupational troops used the Setauket Presbyterian Church. The pulpit of the Presbyterian church was destroyed, and a number of gravestones from the surrounding cemetery were moved as part of the fortifications. Services resumed after the war until lightning hit the church in 1812. The Presbyterian church was rebuilt in 1812. The village green continues to be owned by both churches.

===Modern history===
The 19th century brought industry to East Setauket. Shipbuilding, which had begun as early as 1662, prospered as new shipyards populated the section of Setauket Harbor known as Dyers Neck. These supplemented larger operations in neighboring Port Jefferson. Among the vessels built at Setauket were the &quot;Adorna&quot; in 1870 by David Brewster Bayles, which was the largest square-rigged sailing ship built on Long Island outside of Brooklyn. (At that time Brooklyn was considered part of Long Island, and the largest sailing vessel built at Port Jefferson, the &quot;Martha E. Wallace&quot; of 1902, was a schooner.) A likeness of the &quot;Adorna&quot; has pride of place today above the main entrance of Setauket&#x27;s elementary school. Better known is the famous, or infamous, schooner yacht &quot;Wanderer&quot; built at Setauket in 1857 by William J. Rowland at the direction of captain Thomas B. Hawkins who would later command her. The &quot;Wanderer&quot; was sold to new owners after her first cruise, and they tried to have the vessel secretly converted into a slaver at Port Jefferson in 1858, largely employing outsiders. Suspicious residents alerted authorities, and the vessel was captured by the USRC &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; off Port Jefferson as it attempted a hasty departure. Sadly, authorities in New York returned the vessel to its owners, and she later completed what is considered the last successful American slaving voyage to Africa. She did so without Captain Hawkins, who quit before the vessel was released. What is less well known is that the &quot;Wanderer&quot; later served in the Union Navy during the Civil War as the USS &quot;Wanderer&quot; and captured two small blockade runners. From 1876 until 1904, East Setauket also ran a rubber factory for the Long Island Rubber Company. By the early 20th century, nearly all industrial activity within the Setaukets had ceased.

Following the 1873 completion of railroad service from New York City to Port Jefferson, the Setaukets began functioning as a summer resort town. Into the mid-20th century, relatively wealthy families started settling in the non-industrialized sections of the Setauket waterfront.
In the post-World War II era, Setauket experienced a population boom, as the remaining agricultural lots were filled in with residential developments. The Old Setauket Historic District was established to counteract this change, and a sizeable proportion of Setauket&#x27;s housing stock continues to be pre-war. Extant historical homes include the 1709 Thompson House and the 1830 Sherwood-Jayne Museum. The Frank Melville Memorial Park was established in 1937 and preserves much of the land around the Setauket Mill Pond.

The Setaukets were also influenced by the philanthropy of Ward Melville, owner of what would become CVS Corporation, throughout the Three Village area. Melville founded Stony Brook University, the campus of which abuts the Setaukets on their western side. A minority of the university&#x27;s students and faculty now live in the Setaukets. Melville also created a New England–style village district in neighbouring Stony Brook, being the closest commercial hub to Setauket&#x27;s western areas and complementing the role of Port Jefferson to the east. East Setauket is home to Renaissance Technologies, one of America&#x27;s most profitable hedge funds, which was founded by Stony Brook University mathematics professor James Harris Simons.

In 2012, local politicians formed a planning committee for the section of New York State Route 25A bordering Stony Brook University, shared between Setauket and Stony Brook. Much of this corridor is currently underused, with a handful of businesses in small strip malls. The concept is to create a more walkable downtown area that may attract business from students and long-term residents alike.

In May 2014, a bicycle path known as the Greenway Trail opened connecting Setauket and Port Jefferson Station. Plans are being made to further expand the bicycle route to Wading River by converting defunct railroad tracks.

The Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Holy Cross, headquarters of the Jerusalem Patriarchate in America, is located in Setauket.

==Geography==

Setauket is located in the northwest part of the town of Brookhaven at . It is on the North Shore of Long Island and includes parts of two tidal inlets: Setauket Harbor and Conscience Bay, both of which are arms of Port Jefferson Harbor leading to Long Island Sound. The Setauket CDP is bordered to the north and west by the village of Old Field, to the northwest/southwest by Stony Brook, to the south by Stony Brook University, to the southeast by East Setauket, to the east by the village of Poquott, and to the northeast by Port Jefferson Harbor. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 23.2%, are water.

Setauket has a New England–style village green with a mill pond and park, a small post office, the Caroline Church built in 1729, and the Setauket Presbyterian Church, established in 1660. The Emma S. Clark Library, also on the village green, is often considered one of the most comprehensive on Long Island. This section is the historical center of the original settlement and forms the core of the Old Setauket historic district. The mill pond is additionally within the public Frank Melville Memorial Park.

New York State Route 25A is the main east–west road, connecting Port Jefferson and Stony Brook. Setauket is accessible from the Long Island Expressway via Exit 62 and Nicolls Road.

Almost all of the commercial establishments in the Setaukets is concentrated along Route 25A. Additional commercial zones exist in neighboring East Setauket along Belle Meade Road (formerly called Terminal Road after the oil terminal) and on Nesconset Highway. Numerous medical and professional offices are located on Belle Meade Road, along with other businesses that service them. A few additional shops and factories were established before modern zoning rules went into effect, a handful of which are located on Gnarled Hollow Road and Comsewogue Road in East Setauket. The remainder of Setauket is predominantly residential woodland.

&quot;The Setaukets&quot; or simply &quot;Setauket&quot; refers to a broad area between Old Field and the harbors of Stony Brook and Port Jefferson, including suburban developments East of Stony Brook University. As such, they comprise all of Setauket and East Setauket, as well as Strong&#x27;s Neck, Poquott, Western Port Jefferson Station, East Setauket, and South Setauket. The Setaukets, Old Field, and Stony Brook combine to form the &quot;Three Village&quot; area, a region served by the Three Village Central School District.

The disputed property includes the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, which Native American representatives say is the location of tribal burial grounds.

The core of the lawsuit is over a 1703 deal between Southampton and the tribe for a 1,000-year lease. The suit charges that a group of powerful investors conspired to break the lease in 1859 by sending the state legislature a fraudulent petition from a number of Shinnecock tribesmen. Although other tribal members immediately protested that the petition was a forgery, the Legislature approved the sale of of former tribal land. The town of Southampton is claimed to have spent over $732,000 in legal fees in relation to this lawsuit.

<text>Shirley is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Suffolk County, New York, United States. At the 2010 census, the population of Shirley was 27,854. Shirley is the western terminus of Atlantic Crossing 1, a major submarine telecommunications cable linking the United States with the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. Soon, the Emerald Express transatlantic communications cable will provide data connectivity between Europe and North America, landing in Shirley.

Shirley is a community in the Town of Brookhaven, on the South Shore of Long Island. It is named for developer Walter T. Shirley, who had the vision in the 1940s to turn the area on Mastic Bay into an affordable enclave. Shirley&#x27;s company priced its 4,000 four-room homes starting at $4,700, and lots were priced at $295.

Shirley is served by the Mastic–Shirley Long Island Rail Road station. The station was a compromise when both Mastic and Shirley campaigned for it. The Smith Point Bridge is the second of only two bridge crossings from Long Island to Fire Island, allowing beach goers easy access to the ocean without taking a ferry boat.

The 7th Precinct of the Suffolk County Police Department is located in Shirley. Most of Shirley, the southern part, is served by the William Floyd School District. The northern part is served by the Longwood Central School District.

Shirley was once known as Tangiers (named after William &quot;Tangier&quot; Smith) and was home to a few summer bungalows in the early 1900s, most of their owners were from New York City, looking an escape from a vast &quot;urban jungle&quot;. Today, most of the &quot;Tangiers-era&quot; still stand, although some were destroyed by hurricanes, winter storms, or arson.

==Demographics==
==History==
Springs is known in art circles as the cradle of the abstract expressionist movement. Artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and John Ferren worked there. Writers such as Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Philip Roth, Nora Ephron, and John Steinbeck have lived in or near Springs. Artists and writers were attracted to the area due to its rural nature, despite being within of New York City, and because housing prices &quot;north of the Montauk Highway&quot; on the bay side of the East Hampton peninsula have traditionally been lower than those closer to the Atlantic Ocean. Traditionally, locals are referred to as &quot;Bonackers&quot; which comes from Accabonac Harbor in Springs. East Hampton High School has adopted the Bonacker name for its sports teams.

The main roads connecting Springs to East Hampton are Springs-Fireplace Road and Three Mile Harbor Road. Jackson Pollock died in a car crash on Springs-Fireplace Road in 1956. Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner are buried in Green River Cemetery. Pollock&#x27;s grave is marked by a large glacial erratic stone on top of a hill, Krasner&#x27;s by a small stone lower on the hill. Since Pollock&#x27;s burial, numerous other writers and artists have been buried in the cemetery, joining the locals.

The Pollock-Krasner House and Studio on Springs-Fireplace Road is owned by Stony Brook University and is open for tours by appointment. It includes an external studio shed where dried paint from Pollock&#x27;s projects is splattered on the floor and evokes Pollock&#x27;s most famous works. The neighborhood around it is an East Hampton historic district. Springs-Fireplace Road gets its name from fireplaces at its terminus that was used to signal the residents of Gardiners Island that supplies were ready to be picked up.

<text>Stony Brook is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the North Shore of Long Island. Begun in the colonial era as an agricultural enclave, the hamlet experienced growth first as a resort town and then to its current state as one of Long Island&#x27;s major tourist towns and centers of education. Despite being referred to as a village by residents and tourists alike, Stony Brook has never been legally incorporated by the state. The population was 13,740 at the 2010 census.

The CDP is adjacent to the main campus of Stony Brook University, the largest public university in New York by area, and also The Stony Brook School, a private college preparatory school. It is also home to the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages and the Stony Brook Village Center, a privately maintained commercial center planned in the style of a traditional New England village.

==History==

===Origins and early history===
Stony Brook was first settled in the late 17th century. It was originally known by the native name Wopowog and then as Stony Brook, with both names likely referring to the interconnected bodies of water at the hamlet&#x27;s western edge. It began as a satellite community of adjacent Setauket, New York, the Town of Brookhaven&#x27;s first settlement, and its land was included in the initial 1655 purchase from the native Setalcott tribe.

A gristmill was built in 1699 on the water body now known as the Mill Pond. The current structure, which replaced the original in 1751, ground grain into the 1940s and has since been repurposed for public tours. For religious services and education, the hamlet&#x27;s original residents had to attend institutions in the neighboring communities of Setauket and St. James. In the latter half of the 18th century, activity began to shift from the mill area north toward the harbor as new residences, a number of which still stand, were constructed.

Stony Brook was a remote area through the 18th century aside for a modest amount of commerce near the mill at the intersection of Main Street and Harbor Road. The community&#x27;s development was stalled by its poorly accessible harbor relative to nearby Setauket and Port Jefferson. In the 1840s, local painter William Sidney Mount led a call for the harbor&#x27;s dredging. This was completed twice, but after the harbor filled in both times the effort was abandoned. Lacking the resources of its neighboring harbor settlements, Stony Brook based its economy on agriculture and the cordwood industry.

===Growth===
The Long Island Rail Road reached Stony Brook in the 1870s, creating an easy link between New York City and the citizens of Stony Brook. Stony Brook quickly became a popular summer resort for city dwellers attempting to escape the hazards and stress of urban life. The establishment of the Stony Brook Assembly in 1909 also helped to draw more residents to the local area. A number of these newcomers constructed houses and cottages, many of which were either originally made for year-round use or have since been converted to such.

Nevertheless, the majority of residences were local farmers and businessmen who depended on all necessities being in easy reach. Most businesses were then on the compact plot that would become the contemporary village green. Unlike today, the shops in this area were utilitarian and haphazardly arranged.

The history of the unincorporated &quot;village&quot; is closely linked to that of Ward Melville, a local businessman who owned what would become the CVS Corporation. At one point owned much of what his family coined as the &quot;Three Village&quot; area (consisting of Stony Brook, the hamlet of Setauket, and the incorporated village of Old Field).

Beginning in 1939 with the creation of his Stony Brook Community Fund, Melville used his wealth to begin the transformation of part of the hamlet into his idea of an idyllic New England village, the Stony Brook Village Center, with white clapboard buildings and quaint stores. The focus had been in the previous center of the village&#x27;s commerce, which now consists of a village green and a crescent of stores embellished with stone walkways and seasonal gardening. To accomplish this, Melville moved many of the existing shops in the plot into the crescent and modified their details for consistency, a design model similar to that of Colonial Williamsburg. As a centerpiece to the crescent, Melville built the Stony Brook Post Office, decorated by a large eagle that flaps its wings to mark each hour.

===Modern development===
Melville donated the land and funds to New York for establishing a branch of the State University of New York in the area. This led what was then called the &quot;State University College on Long Island&quot;, at the time in constrictive Oyster Bay quarters, to relocate and change its name to Stony Brook University. Melville also donated land and funds for the local school district. The Three Village Central School District today serves several communities in the vicinity and has named its flagship Ward Melville High School after the philanthropist.

Tourist attractions include the Stony Brook Grist Mill and the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages, a large complex of buildings originally known as the Stony Brook Carriage House and Suffolk Museum. Other Stony Brook attractions are the 19th-century William Sidney Mount House, the St. James Episcopal Chapel, and the West Meadow Beach Historic District.

==Geography==
Stony Brook is on the North Shore of Long Island, approximately east of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The census-designated place occupies an irregular shape measuring roughly north to south and east to west.

The historic core of Stony Brook was developed from the 17th century onward at the mouth of Stony Brook Harbor, a narrow inlet of the Long Island Sound. This section of town includes the Stony Brook Village Center, a planned commercial center in the style of New England clapboard architecture that opened in 1941. Nearby are the Long Island Museum, the Three Village Inn, and William Sidney Mount House. A peninsula in this vicinity known as the West Meadow includes a beach and wetlands reserve.

Stony Brook University is within and adjacent to the census-designated place, with its main campus less than from Stony Brook&#x27;s historic center. It is primarily on the eastern side of the census-designated place, with a pedestrian entrance on Route 25a at the Stony Brook station of the Long Island Rail Road and a vehicular entrance on Nicolls Road. The local stretch of Route 25A contains shops and other commercial properties that cater to the university&#x27;s student body.

The southern (inland) portion of Stony Brook primarily consists of post-war residential development. The Stony Brook University Research and Development Park (in Stony Brook and adjacent St. James) occupies a buffer between this section and the university&#x27;s central campus. Forming Stony Brook&#x27;s official southern boundary is Route 347, a corridor with commercial development including an AMC Loews cinema within the CDP boundaries and the Smith Haven Mall nearby.

==Education==
Stony Brook is well known as the home and namesake of The Stony Brook School, a prep school, and Stony Brook University. The university is in a separate census-designated place and has been since the 2010 U.S. Census, and up to the 2000 U.S. Census the U.S. Census Bureau did not place the university in a census-designated place at all.

The hamlet is primarily located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Three Village Central School District. However, a small section of the hamlet&#x27;s southwestern extreme is located within the boundaries of (and is thus served by) the Middle Country Central School District. As such, children who reside within the hamlet and attend public schools go to school in one of these two districts, depending on where they reside within the hamlet.

==Transportation==
The Stony Brook station of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Jefferson Branch is located within and serves the hamlet. Commute time to Penn Station is approximately 1 hr 48 mins including a transfer in Huntington, Hicksville or Jamaica.

Most of Wading River lies within the Town of Riverhead, but a small portion is in the Town of Brookhaven.

It was also previously known as “Lonsefekwa”. &quot;Wading in the River&quot; or Wading River was adopted by the first English colonists.

==History==
===1671===
The earliest English records show a settlement known as Wading River was founded by eight colonial families. &quot;The spot for the village was chosen with care. There was a stream adequate for water power and abounding in seafood...good water for drinking...soil rich enough to grow essential crops, woodland for fuel, building material and food, topography to offer protection from the elements, meadowland for its grass.&quot;

===Until 1947===
Between 1895 and 1938, the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road extended to Wading River. It was once planned to continue eastward to rejoin the Main Line at Riverhead or Calverton. From 1905 to 1928, Wading River was also the site of an LIRR demonstration farm. Another was east of Medford Station on the Main Line. The Wading River station closed in 1938. During World War II the Benson House was used by the FBI as the site of a secret counterintelligence operation to feed the Nazis deceptive information.

The hamlet of Wading River had a year-round population of less than 500. But during the summer months, hundreds of visitors filled the town to use Wildwood State Park, the cottages on the cliffs and dunes and, of course, the beaches.

It was in Wading River that Walter Lippmann wrote his books &quot;Public Opinion&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Public&quot; in the summers of 1921 and 1923 respectively 

===1947===
This year was a landmark year of change for the sleepy little hamlet; noteworthy accomplishments include:
* Returning service men from World War II began building homes in Wading River
* The formation of Wading River&#x27;s own volunteer fire department, Wading River Fire Department
* The military installation known as Camp Upton was converted for use as Brookhaven National Laboratory
* The Wading River Historical Society was formed.

<text>Wainscott is a hamlet in the Town of East Hampton in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the South Fork of Long Island. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP population was 650. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau defined a census-designated place (CDP) for the 2000 census that roughly corresponds to the same area.

== Background and history ==
The hamlet was named after Wainscott, Kent, a village north of Maidstone, England, an area immortalized in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and from which most of the early settlers of East Hampton came.

The Wainscott School, founded in 1730, was the last public one-room schoolhouse operating in New York until an annex was built in 2008.

Wainscott faces the Atlantic Ocean to the south. On its west is the village of Sagaponack, and on the east is the village of East Hampton. Other communities that border Wainscott are the CDPs of East Hampton North and Northwest Harbor to the northeast, the village of Sag Harbor to the north, and the CDPs of Noyack and Bridgehampton to the west (north of Sagaponack).

The eastern side of Wainscott faces Georgica Pond. The exclusive Georgica Association has a subdivision on the west side of the pond. The Association&#x27;s most famous house, Kilkare, was built in 1880. It was owned by attorney Michael J. Kennedy, who hosted Donald Trump and Ivana Trump visits for seven years, until representing Ivana in her divorce from Trump. It was the beach house featured in the 2004 film &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;.

The PBS children&#x27;s show &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Big World&quot; is taped in the industrial park at the East Hampton Airport, which is in Wainscott.

The Wainscott railroad station on the Montauk Branch closed in the 1930s.

In 2020, Citizens For The Preservation of Wainscott, a non profit organization, started a petition to incorporate the community. A driving force of the petition was to fight a proposal for the preferred location for the 138-kilovolt electricity transmission line from the South Fork Wind Farm to come ashore in the community at Beach Lane en route to an electrical substation in East Hampton. The petition was denied in 2021 by the East Hampton Town Supervisor, in part for only receiving 19 valid signatures. The organization was represented by Greenberg Traurig

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.87%, is water.

Wainscott has a different landscape than East Hampton or Amagansett. The town is flat: houses border on potato or corn fields that then border on the dune and the ocean. Main Street used to have a general store and a post office. The post office eventually moved to a new building on Montauk Highway and the old post office became a private residence. Before 1935, Main Street was lined with sycamores, but the hurricane took them all down.

== Public schools==

The West Babylon Union Free School District serves about half of the CDP of West Babylon and parts of Babylon Village and Wyandanch.

The Venetian Shores neighborhood of West Babylon is in the Lindenhurst Union Free School District. Since this area is also served by the Lindenhurst Post Office, it is commonly viewed as part of Lindenhurst.

The area around Sawyer Avenue Park is within the Babylon Union Free School District.

East of Belmont Avenue (from Sunrise Highway to Montgomery Avenue), north of Montgomery Avenue (from Belmont Avenue to Little East Neck Road), east of Little East Neck Road (from Montgomery Avenue to Straight Path), and southeast of an imaginary line that stretches from the Straight Path/Little East Neck Road intersection to the Wyandanch Avenue/Belmont avenue intersection, is within the North Babylon Union Free School District.

An area of Wyandanch that is served by the West Babylon Post Office is thought of as a part of West Babylon in the Wyandanch Union Free School District, and there is also a small portion of West Babylon served by the Wyandanch Union Free School District (around Cumberbach Street), but is also served by the Wyandanch post Office.

Main School, when it was built, was the only school in the town serving grades K-10 (older students were sent to Babylon High School). It has been said that the famed poet and writer Walt Whitman was a temporary teacher there. However, since he died in 1892, it would have been before the school district was formed, and he clearly could not have taught at Main School. By the mid-1950s, the building had been expanded, becoming an elementary school. It was demolished in June 1982. Robert Moses participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony of Santapogue Elementary School, in the fall of 1951. The school opened in September 1952, relieving the overcrowded situation at Main School.

As of the 2010-2011 school year, the West Babylon Union Free School District had 4,360 students. The racial demographics were 0% Native American or Alaska Native, 7% non-Hispanic black or African-American, 13% Hispanic or Latino, 76% non-Hispanic white, 4% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 0% multiracial. 17% of students were eligible for free lunch, 8% for reduced-price lunch, and 3% of students were Limited English Proficient. 11.8% of students were classified as &quot;Special Ed&quot;.

The school district had a graduation rate of 90%, and 1% of students did not complete school. 93% of graduates received a Regents Diploma and 50% received a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. Of the 2011 completers, 47% planned to move on to 4-year College, 39% to 2-year College, 1% to Other Post-Secondary, 2% to the Military, 8% to Employment, 0% to Adult Services, 1% had other known post-secondary plans, and 2% had no known post-secondary plan.

The district currently has: 
*Five elementary schools (grades K-5): Forest Avenue, John F. Kennedy, Santapogue, South Bay, and Tooker Avenue
*One middle school (grades 6-8): West Babylon Junior High School
*One high school (Grades 9-12): West Babylon High School

For the 2011-2012 school year, the Accountability Status for all seven schools in the district and the district as a whole was &quot;In Good Standing&quot;.

<text>West Hampton Dunes is an incorporated village in the Town of Southampton on Westhampton Island, in Suffolk County, New York, United States. Located off the South Shore of Long Island, the village&#x27;s population was 126 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
West Hampton Dunes is located on a barrier island in the Town of Southampton. The barrier island was part of Fire Island until a nor&#x27;easter in 1931 split the island creating Moriches Inlet. The inlet created a geographic oddity whereby the Town of Brookhaven actually has jurisdiction on land immediately west of West Hampton Dunes although Brookhaven land access to it involves a nearly drive through the Town of Southampton.

The village incorporated in 1993 in attempt to have more control over its precarious state since it was obliterated in the Great Hurricane of 1938, the 1991 Halloween Nor&#x27;easter (&quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;) and again in a 1992 nor&#x27;easter. Specifically, the village wanted to have a say in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers handling of the barrier beach—particularly in response to a series of groynes at Shinnecock Inlet that have created major beach erosion &quot;downstream&quot; in the longshore drift. Almost immediately after incorporation, Gary Vegliante, the village&#x27;s first and to date only mayor, sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for $200 million. The Corps settled the suit and began replenishing the beach leading to a building boom on what had been a devastated empty section of beach.

The American Shore and Beach Preservation Association named West Hampton Dunes one of America&#x27;s top restored beaches. In 2007, resident Yale Nelson finished a documentary on the town history which premiered October 20, 2007, in Westhampton at the Hamptons Film Festival.

In 1996, West Hampton Dunes was the closest community to the crash of TWA Flight 800, which occurred in the ocean about due south of it, although news reports focused on the much larger communities across Moriches Bay that provided the water response.

===Police===
In 1996, the village, under the authority of a court order, formed a law enforcement agency to better serve the needs of the community. The West Hampton Dunes Police Constabulary consists of approximately 12 members, including a department commissioner and two sergeants. The members are certified as peace officers with the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) and are trained at either the Suffolk Police and/or Suffolk Sheriffs academy. The members of the department also receive the required DCJS courses for peace officers to perform traffic enforcement duties including Radar/LIDAR, Standard Field Sobriety, and Basic Crash Management.

Evans lost her life after the ocean liner sank into the Atlantic Ocean, but her efforts saved Caroline Brown from Acton, Massachusetts.

The West Sayville Radio Station at Cherry Avenue was a German Telefunken wireless transmitter built in 1912 to broadcast primarily to Germany. In 1915, the transmitter allegedly relayed a message from the German Embassy to &quot;get Lucy&quot;, referring to the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; which was sunk on May 7. Whether the signals coming from the transmitter in Sayville authorized the attack or not, they caused concern for the US government, which was raised again when it was used in the transmission of the Zimmermann Telegram by Germany to Mexico to request their assistance in the invasion of the United States during World War I. This historic transmission was sent through the West Sayville Radio Station on January 16, 1917, and President Woodrow Wilson sent a contingent of Marines to seize the wireless station in order to ensure that no further encrypted messages were sent.

<text>Westhampton Beach is an incorporated village in the Town of Southampton, in Suffolk County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,721.

==History==
Westhampton Beach Village was incorporated in 1928. In 1938, almost all summer homes on its barrier beach were obliterated by a hurricane resulting in twenty-nine local deaths.

Like most of the shoreline of southern Long Island, the beach at Westhampton Beach was eroding shoreward. This became a political issue in the 1960s. The project to protect the beaches in the area from further erosion was started by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1966, but was only partially completed because of the failure to secure funds from the state and local government. In addition the project design was seriously flawed. As a result, there was increased erosion at the beaches in Westhampton Beach while, up current, the beaches actually grew. During the late 1970s and through the 1980s, beach homes were washed away with every severe storm (nor&#x27;easter) that hit the coast. It was only after the nor&#x27;easter of November 1992 destroyed over eighty homes, that the Army Corps of Engineers began renewed repair efforts. In the mid-1990s, fifteen historic houses were relocated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The homes were moved off the beach and out of harm&#x27;s way, at least for a while, but the beach is still eroding and additional damage is incurred with every storm. Additional work was required after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.35%, is water.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.68% of the population.

There were 805 households, out of which 22.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.1% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.1% were non-families. 32.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.25 and the average family size was 2.81.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 20.5% under the age of 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 24.6% from 25 to 44, 28.2% from 45 to 64, and 20.7% who were 65 years of age or older.

The hamlet is also served by Montauk Highway (CR 80), a two-lane road which runs from New York City to Montauk. Montauk Highway serves as the &quot;Main Street&quot; of many towns and villages along the south shore of Long Island.

The Long Island Rail Road provides limited rail service seven days per week via the Montauk Branch connecting Westhampton to Montauk and New York City. Hampton Jitney coach bus service provides slightly more frequent passenger travel between New York City and Westhampton, especially during summer months. Local Suffolk County buses also provide service to neighboring areas.

<text>Wyandanch (, ) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Babylon in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 12,990 at the time of 2020 census.

In the past, some or all of Wyandanch was proposed to become part of the never-realized Incorporated Village of Half Hollow Hills and later on proposed incorporating itself as the Incorporated Village of Wyandanch. However, those plans failed and Wyandanch has never been incorporated.

==History==
===Native settlement===
This hamlet is named after Chief Wyandanch, a leader of the Montaukett Native American tribe during the 17th century. Formerly known as Half Way Hollow Hills, West Deer Park (1875), and Wyandance (1893), the area of scrub oak and pine barrens south of the southern slope of Half Hollow terminal moraine was named Wyandanch in 1903 by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to honor Chief Wyandanch and end confusion between travelers getting off at the West Deer Park and Deer Park railroad stations. The history of the hamlet has been shaped by waves of immigrants.

No archaeological evidence of permanent Native American settlements in Wyandanch has been discovered. Native Americans hunted and gathered fruits and berries in what is now Wyandanch/Wheatley Heights.

The Massapequa Indians deeded the northwest section of what now is the town of Babylon to Huntington in the Baiting Place Purchase of 1698. The northeast section of the town of Babylon &quot;pine brush and plain&quot; was deeded to Huntington by the Secatogue Indians in the Squaw Pit Purchase of 1699. What is now Wyandanch is located in the Squaw Pit Purchase area. Lorena Frevert reported in 1949 that in the Baiting Place Purchase the Massapequa Indians &quot;reserved the right of fishing and &#x27;gathering plume and hucel bearyes&#x27;.&quot;

===Colonial settlement and after===

Wyandanch (West Deer Park before 1903) evolved out of what was originally known as the Lower Half Way Hollow Hills. The area was first settled by Captain Jacob Conklin after he was given a tract of land in what is now Wheatley Heights by his father, Timothy Conklin, about 1706. Gradually, pioneers from Huntington began settling along the southern slope of the Half Way Hollow Hills as they purchased farm and forestlands from the Conklins. What is known today as Wyandanch originated with the establishment of the West Deer Park LIRR station in 1875. The present-day Wyandanch railroad station sits on the site of the 1875 station on the Long Island Rail Road. Jacob Conklin&#x27;s 1710 &quot;Pirate House&quot; was the first house built in what became the town of Babylon.

The LIRR built the original West Deer Park railroad station, which incorporated a post office, in May 1875 at the request of General James J. Casey, a brother-in-law of President Ulysses S. Grant. Casey had purchased the Nathanial Conklin estate in 1874, and he wanted a rail depot and post office located closer than the LIRR Deer Park depot that had opened in 1853. The 1875 West Deer Park/Wyandanch railroad station was demolished in 1958.

The first lots were sold near the station, around the time of a Long Island land boom in 1872. The efforts of a local realtor successfully targeted Germans and German-Americans.

In April 1903, the ex-Conklin estate and historic Conklin family cemetery was sold to Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, who resumed the bottling of spring water from the Colonial Spring. Eventually the McDonnell property became the Catholic Youth Organization&#x27;s (CYO) summer camp in Wyandanch. In 2011, 14-year-old Michael Berdon, a descendant of Jacob Conklin, restored the 257-year-old cemetery and laid a brick path approach to the gravesite with the assistance of several local businesses.

On March 8, 1907, the Wyandanch post office was moved from the LIRR depot to Anthony Kirchner&#x27;s General Store and Hotel on Merritt Avenue diagonally across from the railroad station.

===Ethnic developments===
Between 1880 and 1955, the dominant ethnic groups in Wyandanch were the German-Americans and Austrian-Americans. The earliest homes built in Wyandanch south of the LIRR were built by German and Austrian-American families. About a hundred &quot;honest and frugal&quot; German and Austrian-American families lived in Sheet Nine of the &quot;City of Breslau&quot; neighborhood as early as the 1880s. Germans and Austrians also worked in the Wyandance Brick and Terra Cotta works; prosperous German- and Austrian-Americans also lived in the hilly, secluded and sylvan Carintha Heights section, west of Conklin Street, which was developed by Brosl Hasslacher after the construction of the Long Island Motor Parkway.

Beginning in the 1920s and extending into the 1930s, working-class settlers (recently arrived from County Donegal in Ireland) began building small wood-frame bungalow-type homes in the fire-prone pine barrens in Wyandance Springs Park-there were no springs, no park and no roads-and in Home Acres. Irish and Irish-American families built homes on land they had purchased in the 1920s land bubble in Wyandance Spring Park or Home Acres. The newcomers wanted to escape from the crowded and economically depressed conditions in Manhattan and The Bronx, and yet be within an hour&#x27;s ride of the &quot;City&quot; on the LIRR. More affluent and prominent Irish-American families in Wyandanch lived nearer the &quot;village&quot; in more prosperous homes with larger plots of land.

African-Americans have lived in Wyandanch since the 1920s, when African-American families bought plots of land and built their own homes in the &quot;Little Farms&quot; section of the West Babylon School District between Straight Path, Little East Neck Road and Gordon Avenue. In the Upper Little Farms section bounded by Straight Path, Little East Neck Road and Grunwedel Avenue (now Patton Avenue) in the Wyandanch School District pioneering upwardly mobile African-American families also began building their own homes. Mortimer Cumberbach and Ignatius Davidson opened their C and D Cement Block Corp. on Booker Avenue at Straight Path on December 6, 1928; as late as the mid-1950s, C &amp; D Cement Block was the only large business owned and operated by African-Americans in Suffolk County.

In the 1950s and 1960s, African-American families established homes south of the LIRR in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these families—both middle class and working class—purchased homes in Wyandanch because they were denied opportunities to move into other fast-developing white housing tracts on Long Island (such as Levittown) due to exclusionist real estate practices: steering, restrictive covenants, red-lining or price points. The rapid development of Wyandanch in the 1950s as one of the largest African-American communities in Suffolk County transformed Wyandanch politically into a hamlet which by 1960 voted overwhelmingly Democratic. In the 1950s and 1960s, the political interest of African-Americans in Wyandanch was mainly focused on winning seats on the Wyandanch Board of Education.

In March 1951, Taca Homes, Inc. offered expandable four-room Cape Cod style homes for sale in Wyandanch on a &quot;non-racial&quot; basis at the Carver Park development at Straight Path and Booker Avenue. The 59 first stage homes with basement, hot-water heat and tile baths sold for $7,200 and were eligible for Federal Housing Administration loan insurance. Veterans were told that they only need put $365 down and could have a 30-year 4% mortgage. (See Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 8, 1951) Carver Park was advertised as &quot;interracial housing&quot;. (Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 8, 1951) Homes in the first and second sections of Carver Park were purchased almost exclusively by African-Americans. These homes required $600 down and veterans only had to pay $58.50 per month. The building of Carver Park and then the construction of Lincoln Park in 1956, with over 400 homes combined, triggered the transformation of Wyandanch from a mostly working class white community in 1950 to a majority working class African-American community in 1960, and in turn this caused white flight: many of the whites who lived south of the LIRR moved and lower middle class African-Americans bought or built modest, individual homes in Wyandanch Springs Park and in the &quot;Tree streets&quot; area east of Straight Path. In the 1960s many whites living in the Wyandanch school district #9 north of the Long Island Railroad in the Wyandanch School District also relocated.

Hispanic-American families began to settle in Wyandanch in the late 1940s since the community offered affordable housing and land, within easy commuting distance of nearby defense plants and Pilgrim, Edgewood, Central Islip, and Kings Park State Psychiatric Centers - where jobs were plentiful.

===1967 racial disturbances===
The &quot;Long, hot summer of 1967&quot; included a reaction to racial tensions in Wyandanch. Over the first three nights of August 1967, racial disturbances broke out in Wyandanch as small groups of young African-American adults reportedly smashed windows in three stores, overturned two cars, set fire to the auditorium of the (now named) Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School on Mount Avenue, set fires at the Wyandanch VFW Hall and ambulance garage at South 20th Street and Straight Path, threw stones at the Wyandanch Fire House and pelted police officers with rocks and bottles.

Suffolk County officials intervened quickly and inventoried problems included joblessness, lack of bus access to area businesses and factories, a lack of recreational facilities for youth, and a lack of African-American representation in the police force.

As a result of the August 1967 disturbances in Wyandanch, governments, private businesses, the Wyandanch School District, community church groups and individuals, residents and non-residents acted to address the numerous problems facing the community. The U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity and its Wyandanch Community Action Center worked to improve bus routes, develop job training programs and assist the indigent with accessing government services. The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P) built a modern supermarket in downtown Wyandanch at the corner of Straight Path and Long Island Avenue. Today, this building houses Suffolk County&#x27;s Martin Luther King, Jr Community Health Center. Genovese Drugs opened a modern new store on the east side of Straight Path north of the Blue Jay shopping center.

=== Failed incorporation attempts ===
In the 1950s, some or all of Wyandanch and its neighbors Dix Hills and Melville, along with the area known as Sweet Hollow, proposed to incorporate as a single village. This village would have been known as the Incorporated Village of Half Hollow Hills, would have had an area of roughly , and would have embraced the Half Hollow Hills Central School District (CSD 5). The plans were unsuccessful, and each would remain unincorporated hamlets.

Wyandanch also tried incorporating as its own village in the 1980s, citing issues regarding race and neglect from the Town of Babylon. This village would have been known as the Incorporated Village of Wyandanch. However, these plans also failed, and Wyandanch remains an unincorporated hamlet governed by the Town of Babylon.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. 

Wyandanch is a suburb of New York City. It is served by Exit 36 on the Southern State Parkway and Exit 50 on the Long Island Expressway.

The community was formerly known as Half Way Hollow Hills, West Deer Park (beginning in 1875), and Wyandance (in 1888). Topographically, Wyandanch&#x27;s nutrient-poor loam and sandy soils are part of the outwash plain which was formed as the last glacier melted about 10,000 BCE. The outwash plain slopes gently towards Belmont Lake State Park from the Half Way Hollow Hills terminal moraine and from Little East Neck Road.

In the mid and late 20th century, the Wheatley Heights area (Half Hollow Hills School District) developed as a separate community (due to class and racial dynamics) but is still served by the Wyandanch Fire Department and the US Postal Service.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
===2010 Census===

About 11.4% of families and 15.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.9% of those under age 18 and 9.8% of those age 65 or over.

=== Religion ===
Until the early 1930s, Catholics from the area worshiped at St. Kilian&#x27;s in Farmingdale. The first Mass to be celebrated in Wyandanch took place in June 1932 in a real estate building, with fund-raising eventually allowing construction of the Little Mission Chapel of the Our Lady of Miraculous Medal Roman Catholic parish, completed on June 28, 1936. An adjacent parish hall opened in 1941, followed in 1950 by an additional wing and a rectory.

The Franciscan Brothers moved their novitiate from Smithtown to the Wyandanch parish in 1949.

Lutherans in Wyandanch held their first services from August 1934 in the Republican Hall. In June 1938, the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church was opened on South 20th Street.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
The original roads in West Deer Park/Wyandanch were Colonial Springs Road and Main Avenue, Little East Neck Road, Upper Belmont Road (now Mount Avenue) and Straight Path. All were established before 1900 by the Conklins or the Belmonts or by real estate developers wanting access to filed lots by buyers. Straight Path in Wyandanch seems to have been developed in the early 1870s by the developers of the &quot;North Breslau&quot; filed lots north of the West Deer Park railroad station. What is now called Long Island Avenue (established in 1895) was originally known as Conklin Street, designed to provide easier access between the village of Farmingdale and the new real estate sites in the future Wyandanch. A section of William K. Vanderbilt Jr.&#x27;s Long Island Motor Parkway (LIMP) toll road (1908) had two concrete overpass bridges crossing hollows at Little East Neck Road and Colonial Springs Road (across from the Wheatley Heights Post Office). The parkway (abandoned in 1938) was dug up and the bridges demolished in the early 1960s to make room for the Westwood Village housing estate in Wheatley Heights.

Working class Wyandanch was sandwiched in between the wealthy estates of the Belmonts, the Corbins and the Guggenheims in North Babylon, and the Dr. Herman B.Baruch estate in Wheatley Heights. What is now known as Wheatley Heights was mapped out as real estate sub-divisions of Wyandanch (including Wheatley Heights Estates, and Harlem Park) by Bellerose developer William Geiger (the names Geiger Lake park and pool) in 1913 following the development of the Long Island Motor Parkway. The filed lot sub-divisions south of the LIRR and east of Straight Path were known as the Colonial Springs Development Corp property. These lots ran from Straight Path to the Carlls River.

In 1941, Robert Moses&#x27; Southern State Parkway was opened to Belmont Lake State Park in North Babylon. Wyandanch residents were able to enter and exit the parkway at Exit 36 at Straight Path in West Babylon.

===Railroad===

In 1875, a station was built in Wyandanch on the Long Island Rail Road. It was demolished in June 1958 and replaced with a station building that was, in turn, replaced in 1986. The station was completely rebuilt in 2018 as part of the Double Track Project on the LIRR&#x27;s Ronkonkoma Branch.
===Buses===
Wyandanch is served by several bus routes operated by Suffolk County Transit:

*3: Babylon LIRR station – Walt Whitman Shops
*4: Amityville LIRR station – Smith Haven Mall
*12: Farmingdale State College – Bay Shore

==Government services==

To combat the danger of frequent forest fires, the Wyandanch Volunteer Fire Company was established in 1925 and incorporated in 1928. A new fire station was built in 1959, and a second one was added in 1964. Water wells were drilled in the 1950s.

Ambulance service began in 1951 with the community-formed Wyandanch Ambulance Club. Other volunteer squads operated as well, and in 1980 the non-profit Wyandanch-Wheatley Heights Ambulance Corps was formed. The Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center, a community health center, was opened in 1968, and moved into a new building in 1978.

As late as 1980, hundreds of homeowners in Wyandanch were not served by the public water mains of the Suffolk County Water Authority but relied on private water wells. After community action, public water was extended to thousands of home in Wyandanch, West Babylon and North Babylon by the late 1980s.

In October 2011, a sewer pipe was being laid down on Straight Path from the Southern State Parkway into Wyandanch as part of the &quot;Wyandanch Rising&quot; program to upgrade downtown Wyandanch.

==Education==
The Wyandanch Union Free School District operates the community&#x27;s public schools, including LaFrancis Hardiman/Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Milton L. Olive Middle School, and Wyandanch Memorial High School.

Wyandanch was part of the Deer Park school district until 1923. Deer Park built the first permanent school building in Wyandanch, on Straight Path at 20th Street, in 1913. A modern Wyandanch grade school opened in September 1937, built for $120,000, $54,000 of which was provided by the New Deal Public Works Authority.

In 1967, seven Wyandanch parents petitioned Dr. Gordon Wheaton, the Third Supervisory District principal, to dissolve the Wyandanch School District No. 9. The parents, supported by the NAACP, also asked Dr. Wheaton to order the 2,295 students in the Wyandanch schools (86 per cent of whom were African-American) to be divided equally into the more affluent and predominantly white surrounding Half Hollow Hills, Deer Park, North Babylon, West Babylon and Farmingdale school districts. The Wyandanch school board (consisting of five African-Americans and one white man) opposed, and noted that the recently hired Superintendent of Schools had proposed a &quot;$1,000,000 program designed to make Wyandanch a model school district.&quot; The superintendent noted that &quot;the uprooting of culturally disadvantaged students to schools where the educational program is planned for the middle class would have damaging effects on our community&#x27;s children.&quot; Rather than wait for a decision by Dr. Wheaton, the NAACP appealed directly to Dr. Allen, the chief of the State Education Department. On July 24, 1968, Allen rejected the petition to dissolve the Wyandanch School District; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;serious obstacles imposed by existing law&quot; prevented &quot;dissolution of the district,&quot; which the &quot;Times&quot; reported &quot;is now 91.5 per cent non-white.&quot;

A liberal arts college was started in Wyandanch, with evening classes for over 200 students, in early October 1969, but soon closed.

Following the August 1967 disturbances, the Wyandanch Day Care Center was opened on Commonwealth Boulevard. The Wyandanch school district first provided space for 35 children in a classroom in the Straight Path Elementary School and later provided room in an empty building adjacent to the Milton L. Olive Elementary School. Ground was broken for the new center on September 13, 1970, and the Wyandanch Day Care Center opened on February 25, 1973. The two-story, red brick, eight-classroom day care center was constructed with a $1 million loan from the New York State Social Services Department.

On March 12, 2012, &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the Town of Babylon will be building a larger, more modern Head Start facility at 20 Andrews Avenue in downtown Wyandanch. The new Head Start building, financed by $850,000 in State of New York funding and $1 million in U.S. Community Block Grant funding, will be larger than the current facility on Long Island Avenue near the LIRR station, which serves about 100 pre-schoolers. Head Start has served the children of Wyandanch since the late 1960s.

===Public library===

In April 1974, the construction of a public library was approved. Initially operating from two rented portable classrooms, the permanent building eventually opened in 1989.

==Parks and recreation==

In July 1945, land located between Long Island Avenue and Grand Boulevard on the border between Wyandanch and Deer Park was donated by William Geiger to the Town of Babylon to be developed as a recreational site for residents of the Town of Babylon. The Babylon Town Board voted $3,500 to improve the &quot;small lake.&quot; In 1946, Babylon cut the brush around the lake, dredged and cleared it, and rehabilitated &quot;a sturdy log cabin&quot; into concession and comfort stations. The Geiger Lake Town Beach and picnic grove was opened to the public on July 21, 1946. Geiger Memorial Lake was so popular that by 1948 &quot;many houses&quot; had been built on Elk Street on land with lake views. The town spent $156,000 refurbishing the Geiger Lake Pool in Wyandanch in the summer of 1989. The Town of Babylon demolished the Wyandanch pool in 2011. A new children&#x27;s spray park has been built and opened in July 2013. All other recreational facilities have been removed from the park including basketball courts (built less than 5 years prior), the children&#x27;s playground, ball field and tennis courts. The William Geiger memorial monument regarding his donation and desires for land use has been removed.

One of the major complaints voiced by young adults in Wyandanch after the August 1967 unrest was the lack of positive recreational activities. A youth center opened in January 1974, and in 1984 the Wyandanch Youth Services, Inc. (WYS) was formed. Since 1998 WYS has operated a full service from a new purpose-built youth center.

==Agriculture and industry==
The early history of Wyandanch was mainly agricultural. There was a large peach industry, but in 1854, seventeen-year locusts so devastated the peach trees &quot;that cultivation on any extensive scale has not been attempted since.&quot;

Water from the Colonial Spring in West Deer Park (now Wheatley Heights) was bottled in small blue embossed &quot;West Deer Park&quot; water bottles by the Colonial Springs Mineral Company between 1845 and 1854. The bottlers claimed it had &quot;special medicinal properties.&quot; When Dr. George Hopkins of Brooklyn ran the Colonial Springs bottling works, &quot;A bottling house was built and the springs were welled in with enameled brick and covered with glass tops.&quot;

Millions of building bricks were molded and baked at the Walker &amp; Conklin and W.H. and F.A. Barlett brickyards using the Cretaceous clay and fine sand found in the area. The bricks were shipped out by railroad using a LIRR spur which ran along what is now North 23rd Street. In October 1888 the Wyandanch Brick and Terra Cotta Corp. was organized on the site of the abandoned Walker and Conklin brickyard to produce solid and hollow building bricks. In 1893, the plant was destroyed by a forest fire.

The Conservative Gas Corporation established a propane bottling business in Wyandanch in 1929. Today it operates as Amerigas Propane LP. In 1947, Joseph F. Walsh established a paper box factory in Wyandanch, and Ignatius Davidson and Mortimer Cumberbach expanded their C &amp; D Cement Block factory, making it the largest African-American-owned business in Suffolk County. Fairchild Guided Missiles established a large factory in Wyandanch in 1951–1952 and built the Lark anti-aircraft missile and the Petral anti-sub and ship missile for the U.S. Navy. Fairchild Stratos left Wyandanch in 1963 and was replaced by Grumman Aircraft, which fabricated custom-built fiberglass and Plexiglas sections and nacelles for U.S. Navy aircraft. Grumman left the community in 1977. Max Staller built the first supermarket and shopping center in Wyandanch in 1955. All these businesses were located near the Long Island Rail Road track in Wyandanch. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, light industrial factories were established in Wyandanch in the northern section of the Pinelawn Industrial Park in southwest Wyandanch and on the east side of Straight Path between two African-American housing estates.

<text>Yaphank () is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 5,945 at the time of the 2010 census.

Yaphank is located in the south part of the Town of Brookhaven. It is served by the Longwood Central School District, except for extreme southwestern Yaphank, which is served by the South Country Central School District.

In the 1930s, Yaphank was a center of American Nazism where Camp Siegfried drew up to a thousand weekly visitors from New York City for pro-Nazi rallies and vacationing.

== History ==
Captain Robert Robinson came to Yaphank and built his Dutch Colonial house with the building dated at 1726. He was then granted permission to dam the Carmans River to build a mill across the street from his house. The construction of this mill in 1739 was considered the founding date of the Hamlet of Yaphank.

In the mid-18th century, John Homan built two mills along the Carmans River, which runs directly through the center of the town. These two mills inspired the first name for the town: Millville. The translator-author Mary Louise Booth was born in Millville in 1831. In 1846 a post office was opened in the town, but because there were thirteen other towns named &quot;Millville&quot; in New York state at the time, the town was renamed &quot;Yaphank&quot;, from the local Native American word &quot;Yamphanke&quot;, meaning &quot;bank of a river&quot;.

In 1843 the Long Island Rail Road built a railroad station in Yaphank (still named Millville at the time), and nearly overnight the small mill town became a major commercial center. By 1875, Yaphank had two grist mills, two lumber mills, two blacksmith shops, a printing office, an upholstery shop, a stagecoach line, two physicians, a shoe shop, two wheelwright shops, a meat market, a dressmaker and a general store.

Today, Yaphank is home to about half of those industries. The grist mills, blacksmith, physician, shoe shop, wheelwright shops, meat markets and the dressmakers are long gone, although the rail road station is still there, along with the general stores.

Today, Yaphank holds three delis, one pizza shop, a shooting supply company, a skeet range, a bank, and a house moving company.

Yaphank was the home of Camp Upton, which was used as a boot camp in 1917. In 1947, the U.S. Department of War transferred the Camp Upton site to the Atomic Energy Commission, and it now serves as the home of Brookhaven National Laboratory. Before the end of World War I, more than 30,000 men received their basic training there, including songwriter Irving Berlin. It was there that Berlin composed the musical comedy revue &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;, which had a brief run on Broadway, and wrote the patriotic tune &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

A quarter horse racing facility named Parr Meadows operated in Yaphank in 1977. The racetrack reopened in 1986 for a single meet, then called Suffolk Meadows. In 1979, Parr Meadows served as the venue of a tenth-anniversary reunion concert that featured many of the original performers from the Woodstock Festival.

A number of Suffolk County facilities are located in Yaphank, including Suffolk County Police Department headquarters, the county fire academy, and the Suffolk County Farm and Education Center, which offers a glimpse into the workings of an authentic 100-plus-year-old farm and educational programs by Cornell Cooperative Extension.

===Camp Siegfried and Nazism===
In the 1930s, Yaphank was home to Camp Siegfried, a summer camp that taught Nazi ideology. It was owned by the German American Bund, an American Nazi organization devoted to promoting a favorable view of Nazi Germany, and operated by the German American Settlement League (GASL).

Camp Siegfried was one of many such camps in the US in the 1930s, including Camp Hindenburg in Grafton, Wisconsin, Camp Nordland in Andover, New Jersey, and Deutschhorst Country Club in Sellersville, Pennsylvania.

Until 2017, homes in the former Camp Siegfried area, on land that was owned by the German-American Settlement League, were under covenants restricting residents to those of German extraction only.

<text>Bethel is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was estimated at 3,959 in 2020. The town received worldwide attention after it served as the location of Woodstock in 1969, which was originally planned for Wallkill, New York, but was relocated to Bethel after Wallkill withdrew.

== History ==
The first European settlers arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1795 near the present communities of Bethel and White Lake. The town of Bethel was established in 1809 from the town of Lumberland. It was named after Bethel.

By the middle of the 19th century, a tourist industry began to grow. Bethel was home to numerous hotels that were part of the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot; and numerous sleepaway camps for most of the 20th century, including Camp Ma-Ho-Ge, Camp Chipinaw, and Camp Ranger – all on Silver Lake. In 1961, Son of Sam mass murderer David Berkowitz was a camper at a now defunct summer camp in Bethel. Berkowitz left the camp after a suspicious fire occurred in his cabin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (5.13%) is water. One of the most attractive features of Bethel is its access to numerous lakes, all within a five-minute drive of each other. They include White Lake, its northern portion known as Kauneonga Lake, Silver Lake, and Lake Superior, which is part of the state park with the same name.

The Town of Bethel, which is primarily rural in character, was part of the old Borscht Belt Catskills resort area. Although some bungalow colonies continue to exist, catering to a largely Orthodox Jewish clientele during the summer, most of the old resorts which had their heyday from the 1930s to the early 1970s have long since closed.

== Woodstock Festival ==
The Town of Bethel was brought to the world&#x27;s attention in 1969, when nearly 500,000 people gathered at Max Yasgur&#x27;s Farm for &quot;Three Days of Peace and Music&quot;. The documentary made about Woodstock released in 1970 showed interviews with numerous Bethel residents, including Art Vassmer, co-owner of Vassmers General Store in Kauneonga Lake. A movie called &quot;Taking Woodstock&quot; was released in August 2009 based on the book of the same title by Elliot Tiber, whose parents owned the nearby El Monaco Motel in White Lake and played a pivotal role in bringing the Woodstock nation to Bethel.

In 1998, a concert was hosted at the original site and this helped ignite the vision of philanthropist Alan Gerry and daughter Robyn to acquire the land and build what was to become Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. 

On July 1, 2006, Bethel Woods Center for the Arts opened on the site of the original Woodstock Festival and hosted the New York Philharmonic. Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young closed out the inaugural season in August 2006, bringing the foursome back to Bethel for the first time since August 1969. The summer 2007 concert lineup at Bethel Woods began in June 2007 with the bands Chicago and America. Other performers during the summer of 2007 included the New York Philharmonic, Bob Dylan, Brad Paisley, Lynyrd Skynyrd with The Marshall Tucker Band, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Phish and others. The 2008 season featured the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Pops, Steely Dan, The Allman Brothers Band, and sold-out performances by the Jonas Brothers and the last concert of the season, featuring Heart, Journey and Cheap Trick. The 2009 season was headlined by Brad Paisley and his band &quot;The Drama Kings&quot;.

In early 2008, The Museum at Bethel Woods opened near the original site of Max Yasgur&#x27;s farm to complement the concert space. The multi-media interactive museum commemorates Woodstock and the Baby Boomer and hippie generation. 

The state and the town council of Bethel subsequently passed laws prohibiting mass-event types of festivals. In 2019, a 50th anniversary celebration of Woodstock was organized in Sullivan County. The &quot;Woodstock 50&quot; festival, scheduled for August, was canceled months earlier so it did not take place. The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts did organize a weekend of &quot;low-key&quot; concerts.

<doc id="127403" wikidata="Q3708502" url="?curid=127403" title="Cochecton, New York">
<text>Cochecton () is a town located in west-central Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 1,448 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the Lenape word &quot;cushetunk&quot; meaning &quot;place of red stone hills&quot;.

The Town of Cochecton (its official name) is situated on the Delaware River, directly across from Damascus, Pennsylvania, to which a bridge over the river provides access.

== History ==
In the original charter of 1664, Cochecton marked the border between New York and New Jersey. Along the Delaware River, a spot was marked named &quot;station rock.&quot; This point formed the meeting point of the borders between New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. After a long dispute - the New York-New Jersey Line War - the final border was set further south, near Port Jervis.

The town was formed from the Town of Bethel in 1828. The Town of Delaware was formed from part of Cochecton in 1869.

The town once had a station on the former Erie Railroad&#x27;s Delaware Division mainline (Erie Lackawanna Railway between 1960 and 1976), but passenger service on this line ceased on November 27, 1966. It has since been taken-over (1999) by the Norfolk Southern Railway and is currently (2022) operated by the Central New York Railroad, a short line railroad, under lease from NS. The Cochecton train station is the oldest surviving railroad passenger station in New York State. Moved from its original site in the early 1990s, a local group of people banded together to save the station from destruction. The local business Cochecton Mills, owned by the Nearing family, gave the group, called the &quot;Cochecton Preservation Society&quot;, one year to dismantle the ancient building and get it off their property so that its business could continue. In that time, the station was carefully and successfully moved roughly one mile upstream to a spot on NY Route 97, still resting along the former Erie Railroad. More recently, various proposals were made to restore passenger service on the line, but none have yet been adopted.

The correct pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name is &quot;cuh-SHEK-ton,&quot; leading many to mistakenly believe the name is of French origin; the name is, however, more likely derived from the Lenape word &quot;ksch-itchuan&quot;, meaning &quot;foaming water&quot;. A conflicting, and probably outdated, interpretation appears in the writings of James Burbank, an amateur local historian who wrote in the 1950s that the word &quot;Cushektunk&quot; meant &quot;low land&quot; and &quot;land of red rock&quot; indicating the abundance of red mudstone throughout the area.

The Drake-Curtis House, Ellery Calkins House, Cochecton Presbyterian Church, Cochecton Railroad Station, Reilly&#x27;s Store, Parsonage Road Historic District, Page House, Old Cochecton Cemetery, and Valleau Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cochecton was reportedly the home of Tammany, a Native American sage of the Lenape, who became an American symbol and a fixture in popular culture during and after the Revolutionary War.

The Woodstock Festival was held in nearby Bethel, but after the festival and because of conflict with the local postmaster, the Yasgur family that hosted the festival on their farm changed their address from Bethel to Cochecton.

Cochecton has four ZIP Codes: 12726 (for Cochecton), 12752 (for Lake Huntington), 12727 (for Cochecton Center) and 12764 (for nearby Narrowsburg). The town is also divided among six different telephone exchanges — Lake Huntington (845-932), Narrowsburg (845-252), White Lake (845-583), Jeffersonville (845-482), Callicoon (845-887) and even Galilee, Pennsylvania (570-224) — a highly unusual situation considering the town&#x27;s small size and population.

==Geography==
The western town line is the border of Pennsylvania, in the middle of the Delaware River. It is connected to Damascus Township in that state&#x27;s Wayne County by the Cochecton–Damascus Bridge.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.95%) is water.

==Climate==

Because the upper Delaware River, upon which Cochecton is situated, is at the bottom of a very steep gorge, the town experiences less thermal moderation than in what would otherwise be a river valley. As a result, Cochecton has a hemiboreal climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with mild-to-warm summers and cold winters.

Cochecton&#x27;s monthly precipitation regime is more consistent with an &quot;east coast&quot; humid continental climate than a &quot;landmass interior&quot; humid continental climate, in that its driest month — November, with 84mm (3.3 inches) average precipitation — receives more than half that of the wettest month, May — which averages 145mm (5.7 inches), plus the driest and wettest months occur in the autumn and spring, respectively, as opposed to winter and summer, which is the norm in landmass-interior continental climates.

<text>Fallsburg is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The town is in the eastern part of the county. The population was 14,192 at the 2020 census. It is not to be confused with the hamlet of Fallsburg which bears a similar name and is within the town of Fallsburg.

==History==
On March 9, 1826, the New York State Legislature passed an act establishing the town of Fallsburg. The town was created from parts of the towns of Thompson and Neversink. Fallsburg takes its name from a waterfall on the Neversink River and was established in 1826. One month later, on April 4, the first town meeting was held in the schoolhouse where the hamlet of Fallsburg is today.

The Neversink River runs from north to south through the town and played an important role in its early development. In the late 1780s, the valley above the falls on the Neversink was known as having fertile and cheap land. This brought an influx of settlers from Ulster County. By 1800, the upper areas along the river were well settled by the people in the already existing towns and by newcomers.

The region was primarily a farming community during the first part of the 1800s. Life during this time was frugal. The long haul over the mountains to Kingston prevented a lot of trade, and it sometimes took 90 days for mail to reach Fallsburg from Kingston. When the Delaware and Hudson Canal opened in the area in 1828, it brought many changes. Now the nearest place to trade was Ellenville. Up until this time, Hasbrouck was the major settlement in the area. The upper Neversink River between Woodbourne and Hasbrouck was the most settled because of the right flatlands that were found along the river. In the 1790s, there were a number of sawmills and gristmills that were built to further establish the area. The hamlet was a major business area for many years with a variety of shops and stores and its own post office from 1846 to 1923.

The town, within the Catskill Mountains, is in the heart of a once-popular predominantly Jewish summer resort area known as the Borscht Belt.

==Geography==
The eastern town line is the border of Ulster County. Fallsburg is bordered to the southeast by the town of Mamakating, to the south by the town of Thompson, to the west by the town of Liberty, to the north by the town of Neversink, and to the east by the town of Wawarsing.

The town has many small lakes, ponds, wooded areas, and former dairy farms. It is also by the Catskill Mountains.

Major bodies of water in the town include Loch Sheldrake (also known as Sheldrake Pond), Echo Lake, Evans Lake, Morningside Lake, Pleasure Lake, East Pond, and the Neversink River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and (1.73%) are water.

<text>Forestburgh is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 808 at the 2020 census. It is where the Neversink River enters the Neversink Gorge and flows over High Falls. The ZIP code of Forestburgh, New York is 12777.

The Town of Forestburgh is in the south-central part of the county.

== History ==

The town was formed from parts of the Towns of Mamakating and Thompson in 1837.

Forestburgh&#x27;s main industries in its early years were tanning, quarrying and lumbering. The mountains on either side of Bushkill Creek contained quarries of flagging, curbing and building stone (also known as bluestone). The largest of these was Paradise Quarry in Oakland Valley. Stone from this quarry was used to construct the Episcopal Church in Monticello. Many of the old sidewalks in New York City were said to have come from this area. The largest tannery was at Gilman&#x27;s Station, which was later renamed St. Joseph&#x27;s Station. According to French&#x27;s Gazette, published in 1858, there were thirty-nine tanneries within the township, producing 100,000 sides of leather annually.

The opening of the Monticello and Port Jervis Railroad in the 1870s stimulated the lumbering, tanning and quarrying industries. The railroad entered Forestburgh at the Town&#x27;s northern border and extended through it in a southerly direction along the Bushkill Creek Valley. In addition to assisting the Town&#x27;s industrial base, the railroad also brought summer residents from New York City. The population of the Town in 1870 was 916, greater than the present day population of 808.

The quarrying industry began to decline in the late 1890s with the invention of concrete. The oak and hemlock bark used in tanning became scarce, signaling the end of the tanning industry. It was at this point, however, that the resort industry began to flourish in Forestburgh. Many homes in Oakland Valley began operating as boarding houses during the summer months when city residents came north on the train from New York. The Hartwood Club and Merriewold Park were born, and the Convent of St. Joseph&#x27;s was established, along with summer camps for boys and girls and a Catholic boarding school.

By the mid-twentieth century the automobile caused the railroad to cease operation in Forestburgh. This substantially reduced the number of tourists who came to the town by train. Forestburgh slowly evolved into a rural-residential town, with many people commuting to jobs in
nearby towns.

The Forestburgh Town Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==== Forestburg Scout Reservation ====
The Forestburg Scout Reservation lies completely within the town borders. Scouting America Monmouth Council owns and operates the camp. It is a year-round reservation featuring two distinct but connected camps: J. Fred Billett Camp and Dan Beard Camp. Burnt Hope Lake, Tecumseh Rock, and Darlington Falls are three of its most notable features.

==== Neversink River Unique Area ====
The State of New York owns an extensive amount of land in Forestburgh that is under the supervision of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Foremost of this is the Neversink River Unique Area, sometimes called the Neversink Gorge.

The Neversink River has been recognized by The Nature Conservancy as one of “75 Last Great Places” based on its superior water quality and ability to support rare and pollution-sensitive species of mussels, which occur in the Neversink River approximately below the Unique Area. The portion of the Neversink River flowing through Forestburgh has long been recognized as having an excellent trout fishery.

==== Mongaup Valley Wildlife Management Area ====
New York State also owns a considerable amount of land that straddles the Mongaup River in the Town of Forestburgh and the neighboring Towns of Lumberland (Sullivan County) and Deerpark (Orange County), and owns conservation easements (from Orange and Rockland Utilities and Clove Development Corp.) for many more acres, thus prohibiting future development. Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. and/or its parent company Mirant Corp. own of land in Forestburgh along the Mongaup River.

There are public access opportunities for hunting, fishing, hiking, and boating. Eagle watching is extremely popular here in the winter, when bald eagles are numerous.

==Wildlife==
Mammals found in the Town include whitetail deer, black bear, eastern gray squirrel, red squirrel, eastern cottontail, varying hare, common porcupine, gray fox, red fox, mink, otter, beaver, woodchuck, raccoon, skunk, muskrat, coyote and fisher.

The southern bald eagle is now an overwintering year-round inhabitant of the area, especially the Mongaup River, Rio Reservoir, and Mongaup Falls Reservoir, and many more bald eagles winter in the area. As a result of bald eagles becoming more prevalent, eagle watching has become a tourist attraction within the Town, drawing people from far distances, and the Town now uses the slogan “Winter Home of the Bald Eagle” on its road signs.

Approximately 200 species of birds have been identified in the area as part of a natural resource study for the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. Migratory species include woodcock, Canada geese, redhead duck, ring-necked duck, canvasback duck, greater scaup and lesser scaup. Other waterfowl that occasionally nest in the area are the American merganser, green-winged teal, black duck, mallard duck and wood duck. In addition, rails and snipe sometimes nest in the area. A variety of hawks, including the goshawk, redtailed hawk, redshouldered hawk, and sparrow hawk, as well as eastern wild turkey and turkey buzzard, are found in Forestburgh and the surrounding area. Several species of owls, including the barn owl, screech owl and great horned owl, are known to make their home in the Town. The occasional golden eagle, peregrine falcon, and osprey are seen in the Town.

Another important wildlife species found in Forestburgh is the eastern timber rattlesnake, which is classified by the DEC as a protected species and which is fully protected.

==Vegetation==
Approximately ninety percent of Forestburgh&#x27;s is forested land; this percentage is believed to be the highest in Sullivan County. West of Route 42 the land is a mixture of deciduous (hardwoods) and coniferous (evergreen) forest. The area north of Hartwood Road between Route 42 and the Bush Kill Road is about 75% deciduous cover with a sizable amount of brush and wetlands. The area south of Hartwood Road between Route 42 and the Bush Kill Road is predominantly coniferous and mixed forest. East of the Bush Kill Road the land is a mixture of brush, wooded wetland, deciduous and mixed forest.

==Historical and architectural resources==
The historical and architectural resources of Forestburgh are rich and quite diverse in character. Among the most important are the Forestburgh log cabin, one of the earliest structures built in Sullivan County, the Blackbrook District School, the Stokes-Hartwell Mill Foundation, David H. Handy&#x27;s Grave, the Railroad Station (Gilman&#x27;s Depot), Sho-Foo-Den (an elegant Japanese wooden structure from the 1904 St. Louis Centennial Exhibition, moved and re-assembled at Merriewold in 1905 by Jokichi Takamine), and the old Hartwood Post Office.

Built in the eighteenth century the Forestburgh log cabin was covered up by a later period structure for many years. It was discovered as part of a remodeling project and preserved by the Town with assistance from Town, County, Federal and private individuals and groups.

The Blackbrook District School, located on Route 42 near St. Joseph&#x27;s, was a rural school. It has been preserved and is in good condition today in private ownership. Along Route 42 and Mill Road are the remains of the Stokes - Hartwell Saw Mill Foundation. Built by Jesse Dickinson, a noted constructor of mills, it was originally owned by Stokes who was a County Judge and a member of the assembly. William Hartwell, also a prominent citizen, later bought the mill in 1850.

David Handy was the first settler in Forestburgh. He served in the American Revolution and died in 1814. His grave site is noted by one of the eleven historic markers in the town.

The old Railroad Station (Gilman&#x27;s Depot) is located on St. Joseph&#x27;s Road. Made of stone and shingle, it served as a railroad station for the Port Jervis to Monticello Railroad from 1871 to 1958. The railroad was the major transportation mode used to bring visitors to St. Joseph in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The Hartwood Post Office was designed by New York City Bradford Gilbert, an architect main railroad building, including the stone and rustic stations on the Ontario and Western Railroad. Built by Willis Butler in 1899, the stone house served as a post office from 1899 to 1945. It is a good example of the stone homes built in Forestburgh during this era.

Other outstanding historical and architectural resources include the Old Town Hall, the Forest Shrine and Cardinal Hayes Memorial, St. Thomas Aquinas Church, the Old Forestburgh Graveyard, the Ontario and Western Railroad Bridge and the Hartwell - Benzien Stone Wall.

<text>Highland is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 2,196 at the 2020 census. The town&#x27;s name denotes its location on elevated ground north of the Delaware River. The town is in the southwestern part of the county.

== History ==

The town was formed from the Town of Lumberland in 1853. Barryville is named for William T. Barry, postmaster general under President Andrew Jackson. The community grew up around the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which opened in 1828 and operated until 1898. The canal ran through what is today the center of the hamlet, and the canal company operated a number of stores, an office and a dry dock there.

The Delaware River also served as the conduit for timber cut in the area and rafted to Philadelphia for use in the ship building industry. Men made fortunes in the timber business, and when the industry died in the middle of the 19th century, many river communities died with it. In fact, writing in 1899, John Willard Johnston, lawyer, historian, and the town of Highland&#x27;s first supervisor, predicted a dire future for Barryville.

&quot;Barryville is a small, poor village now,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but at one time supported an active business. The lumber of the region being exhausted, the business of canaling declining and now abandoned, it has for the last 25 years been waning, until now it seems to have reached a bottom of hardpan. Human imagination can hardly reach anything in the future likely to improve it; but it will probably remain indefinitely the small poor place it now is.&quot;

<text>Livingston Manor is a hamlet (and a census-designated place) in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 1,053 at the 2020 census.

Livingston Manor is located in the southern part of the town of Rockland. New York State Route 17 runs by it.

==History==

In the late 19th century, this community renamed itself as Livingston Manor, after descendants of the prominent Livingston family who had a house there. But it was not part of the original manor, a huge estate granted by the English Crown about east in present-day Dutchess and Columbia counties that extended on both sides of the Hudson River. In the early 18th century, the original manor was the site of work camps along the Hudson, where Palatine German refugees worked off their passage to New York paid by the Crown. They produced timber and supplies for the English navy. Later they were allowed to settle in the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys.

The Sullivan County community was part of the Hardenbergh patent in 1716, which included much of the Catskill Mountains.

In 1750, Robert Livingston bought in this area, shortly after becoming the third (and final) Lord of the Manor of Livingston Manor. He sold or leased most of the land by 1780. Robert&#x27;s third son, John Robert Livingston (1775–1851), deeded to his nephew, Dr. Edward R. Livingston, in 1822 around the area then called Purvis, New York. Edward Livingston died in 1864.

In 1880, the New York, Ontario and Western Railway reached Livingston Manor. Many of its premier trains, such as the Livingston Manor Express, ended there. Passenger service ended in early September, 1953, and the railroad was abandoned on March 30, 1957.

Purvis residents in 1882 chose the new name of Livingston Manor. Edward Livingston&#x27;s residence, according to a sign in the village, was on a site now occupied by the village firehouse. Another town source says that it was on a site later developed as the Rockland, New York Town Hall.

In the 1930s, a Livingston descendant arrived in Livingston Manor claiming title to his ancestral land, which had previously been held by tenants under lease. He won his case in court. The people whose ancestors had been tenants had to purchase the property they had been living on for years.

Other early settlers were the Benton family. Their immigrant ancestors had come from Essex, England, in the mid-17th century, settling in Guilford, Connecticut. Records show some of their descendants migrated to in Sullivan County in the late 18th century from Connecticut, purchasing a large tract of land in what is now known as the Township of Liberty. They were likely Scots-Irish in ancestry. They took on many jobs in Sullivan County. Other families who acquired land and settled in the surrounding area were the Bascoms, Stewarts, Wests, Harringtons, Williams, Cochrans, Motts, Kimballs, Darbees, Sherwoods, Woodards, Barnharts, and Joselyns. Some descendants of these families still reside in the area.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the village attracted immigrants from eastern Europe. Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants founded the Agudas Achim Synagogue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

==Fly fishing in the United States==
The area claims to be the &quot;birthplace of fly-fishing in the United States&quot; largely because of trout fishing on the -long Willowemoc Creek. It flows between the village and Roscoe, where it intersects the Beaver Kill. The Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum is on the northern edge of the town on the Willowemoc Creek.

Today fish stocks in the Catskills are managed by state wildlife agents. All of the stocked fish (1 million pounds each year) for the Catskills, as well all the reservoirs in the New York City water supply, are bred at the Catskill Fish Hatchery just northeast of Livingston Manor in DeBruce, New York.

Since 2004, the community has sponsored an annual Trout Parade (organized by the Catskill Art Society and the Chamber of Commerce). It has been compared to the Mermaid Parade.

==Education==
Livingston Manor Central School District manages the public schools in the township. They consist of Livingston Manor Central School (middle and high school) and Livingston Manor Elementary School. Livingston Manor&#x27;s Varsity softball team won the Class D Section 9 State title in 2010 and 2011. The Boys Varsity baseball team won the Class D Section 9 State title in 2011.

The Catskill Art Society runs a non-profit multi-arts venue on Main Street, the CAS Arts Center, which offers exhibits on view in their galleries and fine arts classes to the community.

<text>Lumberland is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 2,243 at the 2020 census. The town is a rural community in the southwestern part of the county.

== History ==
The town was formed in 1798 from the town of Mamakating, but was subsequently reduced to form other towns in 1807 and 1809. The town was partitioned in 1853 into three parts: Lumberland, Highland, and Tusten.

Lumberland in its current form began to blossom when the Delaware and Hudson Canal opened in 1828. The canal helped transport anthracite coal from the mines of northeastern Pennsylvania to the burgeoning markets of major cities. Settlements that popped up along the canal included Pond Eddy, Knights Eddy, Handsome Eddy, and Mongaup. When the canal was phased out due to the advent of railroads on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware, its bed was converted into New York State Route 97 in the 1930s.

The Pond Eddy Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Geography==
The southwestern town line, delineated by the Delaware River, is the border of Pennsylvania. The eastern town line is the border of Orange County. The north is bordered by the town of Forestburgh, and the west by the town of Highland.

The area has maintained its rural characteristics, being largely residential, with minimal commerce. There is one gas station in Glen Spey, and there are no traffic lights in Lumberland. 
Lumberland is located within the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. Elevations range from approximately 600 feet near the Delaware River to over 1,300 feet above sea level on the bluffs overlooking the Delaware, and where the Catskill Mountains begin to rise in the northern reaches of the town. The terrain is largely mountainous and wooded, with the majority of residents settling close to or on main roads, such as New York State Route 97 (Upper Delaware Scenic Byway).

Rivers and streams abound in Lumberland. The Delaware River is widely accessible through rafting companies that do day trips and that have campsites dotted along the river. The Mill Brook runs north-south from the Black Forest Colony, through Pond Eddy hollow, to the Delaware at the Mill Brook Inn. Fish Cabin Brook takes a similar course just to the east. The Mongaup River runs from Rio Reservoir southward into the Delaware at the Orange County line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (5.30%) is water.

Lumberland firefighters burned the rest of the camp down in 1982 as a training exercise, and to ensure the safety and integrity of the townspeople around them.

Camps currently exist as rafting companies along the Delaware River in Knights Eddy and Pond Eddy. There is also Camp Simcha, which is designated for children with disabilities.

==Popular culture==
Lumberland is the focal point of product testing for the Best Made Company.

It was also the subject of the song &quot;Darlings of Lumberland&quot; on the 2013 album &quot;Nanobots&quot; by the alternative rock group They Might Be Giants.

<text>Mamakating is a town in the southeastern section of Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 12,655 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Johanis Hardenburgh, a resident of Kingston, Ulster County, had purchased a large tract of land known as the Hardenburgh Patent in 1706. This land and another patent known as the Minisink Patent were what is now most of Orange and Sullivan Counties.

The town of Mamakating was organized on December 17, 1743, as the Precinct of Mamakating in Ulster County, and was coextensive with what became Sullivan County. Some say it was called Mamacotten. Over decades, the precinct was partitioned into towns. The Town of Mamakating is considered the first town in Sullivan County; its first county seat was raised in the village of Bloomingburg in 1809.

During the early and middle 18th century the construction of forts all along the Old Mine Road (today US 209) was undertaken to protect the European settlers&#x27; continued expansion and capture of Native land. There were three forts built in Mamakating. Fort Westbrookville was built in 1750 on what is now the Sullivan and Orange county border and until several years ago it was a restaurant. In 1757 a fort was built north of the village of Wurtsboro and it was called Fort Devans. A building was later added to make it larger and it is now owned by the operators of Wurtsboro Airport. Another fort was built on the east side of the Bloomingburgh Mountain. It was called Fort Roosa and was built in 1731. It is still standing and is considered the oldest building in Sullivan County. Many people traveling the old mine road from Kingston found land that was good for planting crops, plenty of game to hunt, streams filled with fish, and virgin trees to build homes. They decided that it was a good place to settle down and raise a family.

Following the end of the American Revolution, Mamakating was reduced in size by formation of Deerpark, Orange County, and Lumberland in 1798. Mamakating was reduced to its present borders by formation of Thompson in 1803 and contributing a part to Forestburgh in 1837.

In 1788 the first school in Sullivan County was built in Bloomingburg. In 1825 two brothers by the name of Wurts decided to build the Delaware and Hudson Canal. It carried coal from Pennsylvania to the people in New York City. The first canal boats loaded with coal arrived at the Hudson River in November 1828. On their return trip they brought back many of the things that were needed by the people of Sullivan County. By doing this, the canal made money each way on their trip. The D and H Canal helped bring prosperity to Mamakating and all of Sullivan County. In 1899 the railroad came and marked the beginning of the end for the D and H canal. In recent years there has been an effort by interested citizens of Sullivan County to save what is left of the D and H canal. There are many places where you can see what the D and H looked like. One is on the line between Summitville and Phillipsport where a lone stretch of the canal and the towpath, along with a dry-dock have been cleaned up. The county has posted signs explaining the various parts of the canal.

There are many historic places in Mamakating, one of the most important of which is the grave of Manual Gonsalus, the first European immigrant. His tombstone is dated April 18, 1752. Other historic places are the Phillipsport United Methodist Church built in 1823 and the Bloomingburg Reformed Church built in 1820 and now a county historic landmark. There is also an old cemetery located north of Wurtsboro called the Stanton Cemetery where many of the oldest settlers are buried. This is a popular place for genealogy hunters looking to locate links to their past. Up on the east mountain above the Wurtsboro airport there can still be seen the remains of the old lead mine. Some of the lead mined there was used to make bullets for the Union Army during the US Civil War.

In the early 19th century there were several hundred tanneries in Sullivan county with several in Mamakating. The leather from these tanneries was of superior quality and during the Civil War was used to make many of the boots, saddles and other leather goods used by the Union Army. In fact Mamakating tanneries, in the year 1850, produced 29,000 hides of leather from five water and horse powered tanneries.

The town of Mamakating town board asked the town co-historian John Masten to form a historical society in the town of Mamakating. They took ownership of the old school building in Summitville and completely renovated it. Masten eagerly accepted the offer and today the building has an archive room, a great meeting room with many pictures and histories of all the areas of Mamakating, and many artifacts of our area. The Historical Society has about 165 members.

The unique designation of &quot;Mamacoots&quot; has been invented locally referring to residents of Mamakating. It is a humorous combination of the original &quot;Mamacotten&quot; and the suffix &quot;kuts.&quot;

<text>Monticello ( ) is a village located in Thompson, Sullivan County, within the Catskills region of New York, United States. It is the seat for the town of Thompson, and the county seat of Sullivan County. The population was 7,173 at the 2020 census. The village was named after the residence of Thomas Jefferson.

== History ==
In 1801, Samuel F. Jones was given the task of finding a route for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike to connect The Hudson and Delaware Rivers. While he marked the path through what was then Orange and Ulster counties he saw an opportunity to build a village on the turnpike. Samuel convinced his younger brother, John Patterson Jones, to buy a 1861-acre tract of land that would be bisected by the turnpike so they could build this new village. In 1803, John and 11 other men started work on a sawmill, and other infrastructure to help them build the village. The group left the area during the winter but would return in the early months of 1804 to continue their work. In spring of the same year the route for the turnpike was finalized and the two brothers started to plan the village. After the plan was completed, the first tree was chopped down by John September 4, 1804, on the property that would later become his house. The village grew from there, having 20 houses by 1813 and being officially incorporated on April 20, 1830.

=== 1909 Fire ===
On the evening of August 10, 1909, a major fire started in the Broadway district of Monticello. The fire started in a local power station and quickly spread from building to building, engulfing the whole of Broadway street in flames. Local fire departments were scrambled to stop the fire, quickly containing the fire and stopping its spread to residential areas. By the time the dust had settled, 40 buildings had been reduced to ash, causing roughly 1 million dollars in damages. Luckily, no one was killed in the fire and the village soon rebuilt.

==Transportation==

Monticello is located adjacent to New York State Route 17 (known regionally as the Quickway and eventually upgraded to be Interstate 86). It is also at the eastern terminus of New York State Route 17B. New York State Route 42 also serves the area, running North and South.

The local bus station is served by Coach USA Short Line, and the station acts as a hub for the region. There is also local service provided by Sullivan County Transportation that runs once a week on two routes.

The New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railway had a branch to Monticello. Patronage was heavy until after World War II, when competition from the automobile led its abandonment on March 30, 1957.

==Tourism==

Monticello is known for its Monticello Raceway, which attracted people from all over the northeast in its heyday. Now the Raceway has turned into a racino, hosting electronic slot machines as well as horse racing. The casino portion of Monticello Casino and raceway was closed in 2019, and now serves as a raceway only. Just seven miles (11 km) away from the Raceway is Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, site of the 1969 Woodstock Festival. An auto racing circuit, Monticello Motor Club, is also located nearby. Resorts World Catskills, Vegas-style casino, luxury hotel and spa opened within the towns location near the old Concord Resort property in February 2018.

The community— the center of what was colloquially known as the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot;— was once well known internationally for its massive Jewish resorts including the Concord and Grossinger&#x27;s resorts, among many others. Only a handful survived into the 21st century. Kutsher&#x27;s Hotel was one of the last to close. The remnants were auctioned off on February 6, 2014. Today, only the Raleigh Hotel remains open.

<text>Neversink is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 3,366 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Neversink is in the northeastern corner of the county. The Neversink River that flows through the town is claimed to be the birthplace of American fly fishing.

== History ==
The town was formed in 1798 from the Town of Rochester in Ulster County, New York before Sullivan County was formed, on the site of the Neversink Reservoir. The Town of Rockland was created from part of Neversink in 1809, and part of Neversink was used to make the newer Town of Fallsburg in 1826.

In 1941, the New York City Board of Water Supply selected the site to meet the city&#x27;s growing demand for drinking water. The town was condemned, along with nearby Bittersweet, to make way for a reservoir. At the time the town had a population of about 2,000. It featured a main street, a church, a post office, a covered bridge, and a two-room schoolhouse. The town had relocated a couple of miles by the time the reservoir was completed and put to use in 1953, turning the name of the old town ironic in the process.

In 2015 the town partially lifted its ban on the sale of alcohol in restaurants but retaining the ban on sales in convenience stores. A total ban had been in effect since 1935.
==Geography==
Part of the town is in the Catskill Park. The northern and eastern town lines are on the border of Ulster County.

<text>Roscoe is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 497 at the 2020 census.

Roscoe is in the southwest part of the town of Rockland, adjacent to New York State Route 17.

It is named for New York Senator Roscoe Conkling.

Roscoe calls itself &quot;Trout Town, USA.&quot; The town is a destination for fly-fishing enthusiasts because of its location at the intersection of two rivers popular for trout fishing (the Beaver Kill and the Willowemoc Creek).

The community is a popular stopping point for people traveling along Route 17 (between New York City and Binghamton, New York) because the facilities are right by the access road to the highway. These include gas stations and convenience stores.

==History==

In 1789 Roscoe was called Westfield Flats. It was the home of the Delaware Indians, where wolves roamed freely.

Roscoe, like most of the Catskills, was part of the Hardenbergh Patent in the early 18th century which in turn was purchased by the last Lord of the Manor of Livingston Manor, Robert Livingston. The first settlers were brothers who bought the area around Roscoe from Livingston&#x27;s son Jonathan Livingston. Stewart Street is one of the community&#x27;s main streets.

On November 19, 1916 a devastating fire destroyed 23 buildings in town, mostly along Stewart Avenue. Over 100 firefighters came from Livingston Manor and Liberty to help control the flames, but after firefighters lost water pressure they were unable to do very much. The Presbyterian Church was spared.

During the construction of New York State Route 17 (Southern Tier Expressway), the section near Roscoe was one of the last to be completed, requiring travelers to exit onto the local truck roads for several miles.

Roscoe is a frequent stopping point for those traveling Route 17 between New York City and Western New York. The Roscoe Diner is a popular spot both for students heading to and from colleges in New York State and for flyfishermen as well as locals.

The Dundas Castle and Roscoe Presbyterian Church and Westfield Flats Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Despite being in Sullivan County, Roscoe is within area code 607 rather than 845 (originally part of area code 914) because an independent telephone company, known today as Citizens Telecom, furnishes the local service to Roscoe. This company also furnishes local service to the towns in neighboring Delaware County, whereas the adjacent towns in Sullivan County are serviced by Verizon, originally New York Telephone and later NYNEX.

<text>Smallwood is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 839 at the 2020 census.

Smallwood is in the southeastern section of the Town of Bethel and is a hamlet within the town of Bethel. It was founded in the 1920s as the vacation community &quot;Mountain Lakes&quot;, but was later renamed after its founder A.N. Smallwood.

==History==

Smallwood is known for its early-20th century style log cabins and camps constructed by immigrants in the 1930s. A unique feature of the community is that the original home construction materials were locally sourced: Smallwood cabins were constructed of wood lumbered and milled on site, and the distinctive stone fireplaces found in most cabins were built of limestone quarried in Smallwood in the 1920s to 1950s. Most of these historic cabin structures survive as both summer and year-round residences.

The Smallwood development, as envisioned by developer A.N. Smallwood, was originally a &quot;restricted&quot; community, i.e., homes were available only to individuals who were eligible for membership in the Mountain Lakes Country Club, which was restricted to &quot;caucasians of the Christian faith,&quot; according to literature and sales brochures. This began to change in the 1940s, but many deeds contained exclusionary covenants into the 1950s. In the past few decades, the community has become very diverse, comprising local year-round residents as well as summer-home owners who hail primarily from the New York City metropolitan area and from South Florida.

Municipal tap water for many Smallwood homes is only available on a seasonal basis from April to October. Other homes which have been winterized have wells.

==Recreation==
Centrally located in the Hamlet of Smallwood, Mountain Lake is a private holding of the Smallwood Civic Association (SWCA). Only dues paying members of the Association have access to the approximate 65 acre man-made Lake and other facilities owned and operated by the SWCA such the as a beach, tennis and pickelball courts, basketball court, playground, ball field, and Lodge. Minnie Falls is a popular water fall and part of a large public park operated by the Town of Bethel called, The Forest Reserve at Smallwood. The Reserve features hiking trails for year-round outdoor activities as well as a large dog park The Falls are part of White Lake Brook, a water system which, upon entering Smallwood becomes Mountain Lake, and upon crossing over the lake’s dam becomes White Lake Brook again. The Club at Smallwood, also located in the community, is also private. While an entity separate from the SWCA, some “Smallwoodians” maintain memberships in both organizations.The Club offers a heated pool and recreational activities in the summer months. Both the Civic Association and Club at Smallwood are open to dues-paying residents. Smallwood residents also have access to the nearby and public, Lake Superior State Park(operated by Sullivan County)and the public Toronto Reservoir, which is adjacent to Smallwood and located at the end of Pine Grove Road. The Toronto access — permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows for swimming and has a public motor-boat launch for fishing and other boating activities.

<text>Wurtsboro is a village located on U.S. Route 209 in the town of Mamakating in Sullivan County, New York, United States, near its junction with New York State Route 17 (which is being upgraded to interstate standards and will be renumbered as interstate 86). The population was 1,124 at the 2020 census. Since 1927 the area has been served by Wurtsboro-Sullivan County Airport.

== History ==

Before Europeans, Wurtsboro was inhabited by Native Americans known as the Leni Lenape. Called Delaware by the Europeans, the Leni Lenape are known to other tribes, in their tongues, as &quot;the old people&quot; and are considered to be one of the oldest tribes in North America. Many anthropologists believe the Leni Lenape are the ancestors of the original people who crossed the Bering Strait to first populate North America. Within the Leni Lenape, different villages dotted the valleys between the Delaware and Hudson rivers. The group that resided in the Wurtsboro area was known as the Mamacottin.

As the Dutch settled along the Hudson and searched inland for furs and minerals, they engineered and built the oldest road in America. This roadway, little more than a cart path along the trails of the Leni Lenape, became known as the Old Mine Road. Present day US Rte. 209 follows much of the original course. It is thought that these Dutch settlers were the first to name the area Mamakating.

As other Europeans settled the area, the treaties and land grants for a great deal of the northeast were benchmarked from the Hardenburgh tract. That survey benchmark, still annotated and utilized, can be found in the village near Rte. 209.

The original name for the village of Wurtsboro was Rome. It is said that when the ‘yankees’ obtained a foothold in the hollow (Mamakating valley), they counted all the mountain peaks they could see and with an ambitious view, called the place Rome. This name was retained until as late as 1812. That same year, the area&#x27;s first church was built. This Dutch Reformed church was named the &quot;Church of Rome.&quot; Somewhat later the town was renamed Wurtsborough, which evolved to Wurtsboro.

During the early industrial revolution, much of the nation&#x27;s bituminous coal needs were supplied by England. During the War of 1812, a fuel shortage arose when a British blockade cut off America&#x27;s coal supply. Interest turned to anthracite coal, known then as stone coal. Anthracite was native to Pennsylvania, but lack of adequate transportation was a deterrent. Three Wurts brothers (Maurice Wurts was the most prominent), then Philadelphia dry goods store owners, capitalized on this problem by forming a company to construct a 108-mile canal from Honesdale, Pennsylvania to Kingston, New York, the Delaware and Hudson Canal. On July 13, 1825, New York City Mayor (and company investor) Philip Hone used a golden spade to turn the first shovelful of earth during the canal&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony, in the village. With the advent of the canal, products such as coal, lumber, livestock, and other staples were shipped through the area on their way to Albany and New York City. In those days, it was a practice of the D&amp;H Canal Co. to rename communities along the canal for their favored officers. Names such as Honesdale, Port Jervis, Hawley, and Wurtsboro were so named.

As steam replaced horse power, the railroads replaced the canals. While the canal operated until its closure in 1898, the D&amp;H Railroad was in fact a reorganization of the original canal company. In many sections, the railroad bed (now abandoned) parallels the canal. Both can be easily seen by visiting the D&amp;H Canal Linear Park, which is a scenic walkway along the canal towpath from Wurtsboro to Summitville.

The village of Wurtsboro was originally confined to the berm of the canal. Several existing businesses were active at that time. Notable examples include Danny&#x27;s, built in 1814 for the purpose of serving food and providing lodging; and the Canal Towne Emporium, better known in the canal days as Fulton &amp; Holmes’ General Store, selling many items that were delivered by canal barge. Over time, the village gradually extended westward and merged with the old village of Mamakating. In 1830 the name of the post office was changed from Mamakating to Wurtsborough, with Lyman O’Dell (known as the village poet and essayist) acting as the first postmaster.

Another economic impact for the area in those early days was derived from the tanning industry that developed here. Hemlock bark was used to tan hides and it was in plentiful supply. In fact, over 80% of all leather goods used by the Union Army during the Civil War were processed in Sullivan county tanning vats. The industry waned as the hemlock in the area was over-forested (accounting for the scarcity today) and synthetic tannic acid was developed. In the late 1800s the Ontario &amp; Western Railroad laid down its tracks on the eastern end of the village. Like the canal, it served to carry merchandise as well as passengers to the area. The O&amp;W was a primary player in the tourism boom during the late 1800s into the 20th century, as it allowed thousands of New York residents to escape the heat of the city and relax in the clean Catskill mountain air. Eventually, just as the railroads replaced the canals, the interstate highway system replaced the railroads.

<text>Apalachin ( ) is a census-designated place within the Town of Owego in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,131 in the 2010 census. The CDP is named after Apalachin Creek.

Apalachin is in the southeastern section of the Town of Owego and is west of Binghamton. It is also part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The first settler arrived , but the community was not founded until 1836.

On November 14, 1957, the Apalachin Meeting, held with the heads of the American Mafia at the home of Joseph Barbara, an Apalachin resident. The meeting was a conference of mobsters who had gathered to iron out various issues in the underworld. The gathering was quickly broken up when a curious New York State Trooper turned up and spotted expensive cars at or near the home. Other police officers quickly arrived to arrest those attending the conference and sent some of the most powerful gangsters in the country fleeing through the surrounding countryside. Mafiosi and the FBI sometimes just refer to the meeting as &quot;Apalachin&quot;. This meeting was humorously portrayed in the opening sequence of the 1999 motion picture &quot;Analyze This&quot;, which starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. This meeting was also fully depicted in the 1972 film &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot; as well as the 2019 film &quot;Mob Town&quot;.

From 1960, until it was cancelled in 2016, the annual Apalachin Firemen&#x27;s Field Days, was hosted by Apalachin, a four-day carnival, generally held in the first week of June. This event was started in 1960 and had grown from a small event in a field to having a permanent location with large pavilions (still called the beer and food tents by locals) and a large square of game booths that surround 15-20 carnival rides. Events included the Little Miss Apalachin contest, fireworks and a large parade.

Riverside Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

<text>Richford is a town in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,043 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Ezekial Rich, an early settler and benefactor of the town.

The Town of Richford is the northernmost town in the county and is southeast of Ithaca.

==History==
European-American settlement began around 1808 when Evan Harris brought his family here. Samuel Smith was the first to settle within the present village site in 1813. The first tavern was built in the village in 1817 at the site of the Richford Hotel (now the Richford Quickway) by Beriah Wells. Ezekial Rich moved to the town in 1821 when he purchased the tavern from Beriah Wells. He established a glove and mitten factory, and later opened a general store. The town was first formed from the Town of Berkshire as the &quot;Town of Arlington&quot; in 1831. In 1832 it changed its name to the Town of Richford.

Local oral history links several properties in Richford with the Underground Railroad in the antebellum period, by which residents aided refugee slaves to reach freedom.

In 1816, the Catskill Turnpike was brought through the village on its route to Ithaca and generated considerable traffic to the village.
This was the dominant route into or out of the village until 1869, when the Southern Central Railroad was completed between Auburn and Owego.

Arts and crafts vendors are available as are games and races. The event is known for its potato-themed dishes, including potato ice-cream. This used to be made by Cornell University dairy and featured chocolate-covered potato sticks in vanilla ice cream. Now Jones&#x27; Humdinger makes two varieties: the original and a mashed sweet potato-based version.

===Broome-Tioga Sports Center===
An AMA and Non-AMA sanctioned Off Road Racing Facility is located on the border with Broome County. The track hosts several types of events, including Motorcycle, Snowmobile and ATV/UTV races.

===State lands===
Richford has more than designated as state lands, more than all other towns in Tioga County combined; these properties are mostly contained in six large state forests.

* Michigan Hill State Forest: Located east of the village and north of RT 79. Encompasses of wilderness area. There are no maintained trails. In several areas along Rockefeller Road, the ruins of old settlements and farms can be found, usually consisting of old foundations and orchards. The occasional uncovered well exists.
* Griggs Gulf State Forest: Located adjacent to Michigan Hill State Forest, the forest encompasses shared between Tioga and Cortland counties, with more than of ungroomed trails. John D Rockefeller&#x27;s birthplace is within Griggs Gulf Forest on Rockefeller Rd. An unkempt nature trail built by a local 4-H group begins here and passes several old structures, including a mill and other foundations.
* Turkey Hill State Forest: Shared with the town of Berkshire, this forest is located east and south of Richford. It consists of of primitive woodlands with only of public access road. Extensive damage in the 2003 ice storms resulted in large areas of early successional habitats that foster a wide variety of birds and other woodland creatures.
* Robinson Hollow State Forest: just west of Richford. Many recreational facilities exist including of marked trails maintained by local associations. A portion of the Finger Lakes Trail runs through the forest. The Kimmee lean-to, maintained by the Finger Lakes Trail Conference, is located here. The forest includes a trout pond, and extensive fishing areas are located along the West Branch Owego Creek. Many of the highest elevations in the county are within the forest, including the highest.
* Beaver Dam State Forest: east of Richford on the border of Tioga and Broome counties. Contains of maintained trails and a public access road.
* Andersen Hill State Forest: just south of the village proper, west of Rt 38. The forest consists of managed woodlands that maintain a mix of early, mid, and late successional forests. A short (.5 mile) maintained trail exists that connects to a larger trail network in adjacent lands, and a forest access road is available. An access point to the West Branch Owego Creek is maintained within the forest.

The numerous state-owned lands provide for excellent hiking and motorized sports activities. Many 4-wheeler and snowmobile tracks criss-cross the woodlands on both state and private land.

Many great fishing sites are available in Richford. Native and stock trout thrive in the cold waters of both branches of the Owego Creek, and some of the best areas are located in and near Richford. The NYSDEC annually releases over 10,000 brown trout into both branches in Richford. Additionally, 200 rainbow trout are released into the Tri-County Pond.

Hunting is also popular within the town. All state lands are open to hunting. They provide excellent habitats to large populations of deer, turkey, and other game animals.

<text>Tioga is a town in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 4,455 at the 2020 census. The town is in the southwestern part of the county and lies between Elmira and Binghamton. Tioga is situated in the Southern Tier District of New York.

== History ==
For thousands of years, this area of New York had been settled by distinct cultures of indigenous peoples. The most recent prehistoric peoples were the Owasco, who appeared to migrate from southern areas and displaced the Point Peninsula complex peoples. However, a 2011 paper by archaeologist Dr. John P. Hart argues there was no definable Owasco culture. They lived in isolated villages and had frequent warfare. Under pressure of warfare, they began to consolidate into larger tribes and confederacies.

The historic Iroquoian-speaking tribes developed as the Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; or the Iroquois Confederacy, since about the 15th century. Of these, the Mohawk Nation has reservations in northern New York, along the St. Lawrence River and in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario; the Oneida Nation has a small reservation in central New York and larger one near Green Bay, Wisconsin; the Onondaga Nation remains on its traditional territory on a reservation in central New York, while the Seneca Nation and Tuscarora Nation have reservations in western New York.

The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 during the American Revolutionary War passed through the area, destroying Seneca villages, as the Seneca and three other Iroquois nations sided with the British. Loyalist and allied Iroquois tribes had been raiding colonial settlements in the Mohawk Valley and related areas.

After the American Revolutionary War, those Iroquois nations who had sided with the British were forced to cede their lands to New York, although their treaties were not ratified by the US Congress. The first European-American settlers arrived around 1792.

Organized in 1788 before Tioga County was established, as part of the &quot;Old Town of Chemung,&quot; the town was renamed &quot;Owego&quot; in 1791. That was the year Tioga County was created. In 1818 the town was renamed the &quot;Town of Tioga&quot; by switching names with the current Town of Owego. The Village of Owego was thus in the town of the same name.

The First Methodist Episcopal Church of Tioga Center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
