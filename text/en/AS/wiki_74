<text>Harmony Township is a township in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 512 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (0.89%) is water.

==History==
The area was first settled in 1789 when a road was built to connect Stockport on the Delaware River to the Susquehanna River at Cascade Creek.

Harmony Township was formed in 1809 from parts of Willingborough (now Great Bend Twp) and New Milford Townships. The present-day Ararat, Oakland, Jackson, and Thompson Townships were later split from parts of Harmony Township. The borough of Susquehanna Depot was created in 1853 from part of Harmony Township.

Gustav, Charles, and Albert Stickley formed &quot;Stickley Brothers and Company&quot; in the unincorporated village of Brandt in 1883 after learning furniture-making from their uncle, Jacob Schlager, and his business partner, W. H. Brandt. The 1880 US Census shows Barbara Stickley and her famous sons, Gustav and Charles Stickley living there as Chair Makers. Charles later owned the Stickley - Brandt Furniture Co, in Binghamton, NY. Brother Gustav started his own furniture factory in Eastwood, New York in the late 1890s. Brothers Leopold and John George started the L. &amp; J.G. Stickley Furniture Co. in Fayetteville, NY in 1900. The L. &amp; J.G. Stickley Furniture Company is currently located in Manlius, New York.

===Joseph Smith and Mormonism===
Harmony, Pennsylvania, is an important historical site in the Latter Day Saint movement. Latter Day Saints believe that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were visited by the angel of John the Baptist near Harmony in 1829, where he bestowed on Smith and Cowdery the Aaronic priesthood. Smith and Cowdery subsequently baptized one another in the Susquehanna River.

Other significant events occurred there during the periodic residence of Smith from 1825 to 1830. Smith and his father boarded in the residence of Isaac Hale in 1825 while employed by a man named Josiah Stowell to locate &quot;a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver&quot; using Smith&#x27;s presumed skills in the practice of scrying, or using &quot;peep stones&quot;, to locate buried treasure by means of divination. It was during this time that Smith became acquainted with Hale&#x27;s daughter, Emma Hale, whom he would later marry despite her parents&#x27; disapproval. In December 1827, Smith and Emma moved to Harmony from Manchester, New York, to work on the Book of Mormon. Eventually they bought a small farm and house, where most of the Book of Mormon was produced between April 7 and early June 1829. The first convert baptism, that of Samuel H. Smith, took place there ten days after Smith and Cowdery had baptized each other. Smith also claimed that somewhere between Harmony and Colesville, New York, the apostles Peter, James, and John appeared to him and Cowdery and bestowed on them the Melchizedek priesthood. After Smith organized the Church of Christ in 1830, Smith and Emma returned to Harmony and lived there through that summer. Of the many writings Smith claims were divine revelations received by prophecy and now recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, fifteen were written in Harmony.

The Harmony in Latter Day Saint history refers to a township rather than a village or borough. The township boundary was changed in 1853, placing the Latter Day Saint sites in present-day Oakland Township. The site of the Hale residence, Smith residence (which burned in 1919), and a public cemetery containing the graves of Isaac and Elizabeth Hale and of an infant son born to Joseph and Emma, lie about a mile and a half west of present-day Oakland, Pennsylvania, in Susquehanna County.

Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns about 288 acres at the location, and operates the Priesthood Restoration Site historic area. The historic site was developed in 2015 and includes a visitor center, the reconstructed Smith and Hale homes, and several monuments. The exact location of the restoration is not known.

It is the second of Dostoevsky&#x27;s full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing and is often cited as one of the greatest works of world literature.

&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of &quot;extraordinary&quot; men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.

== Background ==

At the time Dostoevsky owed large sums of money to creditors and was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. After appeals elsewhere failed, Dostoevsky turned as a last resort to the publisher Mikhail Katkov and sought an advance on a proposed contribution. He offered his story or novella (at the time, he was not thinking of a novel) for publication in Katkov&#x27;s monthly journal &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;—a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky, having been engaged in polemical debates with Katkov in the early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages before. In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to &quot;certain strange, &#x27;unfinished&#x27; ideas, yet floating in the air&quot;. He planned to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of &quot;radicalism&quot;, and felt that the project would appeal to the conservative Katkov. In letters written in November 1865, an important conceptual change occurred: the &quot;story&quot; had become a &quot;novel&quot;. From then on, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is referred to as a novel.
In the complete edition of Dostoevsky&#x27;s writings published in the Soviet Union, the editors reassembled the writer&#x27;s notebooks for &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; in a sequence roughly corresponding to the various stages of composition. As a result, there exists a fragmentary working draft of the novella, as initially conceived, as well as two other versions of the text. These have been distinguished as the Wiesbaden edition, the Petersburg edition, and the final plan, involving the shift from a first-person narrator to Dostoevsky&#x27;s innovative use of third-person narrative to achieve first-person narrative perspectives. Dostoevsky initially considered four first-person plans: a memoir written by Raskolnikov, his confession recorded eight days after the murder, his diary begun five days after the murder, and a mixed form in which the first half was in the form of a memoir, and the second half in the form of a diary. The Wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral and psychological reactions of the narrator after the murder. It coincides roughly with the story that Dostoevsky described in his letter to Katkov and, written in the form of a diary or journal, corresponds to what eventually became part 2 of the finished work.

Why Dostoevsky abandoned his initial version remains a matter of speculation. According to Joseph Frank, &quot;one possibility is that his protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had first been conceived&quot;. The notebooks indicate that Dostoevsky became aware of the emergence of new aspects of Raskolnikov&#x27;s character as the plot developed, and he structured the novel in conformity with this &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. The final version of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; came into being only when, in November 1865, Dostoevsky decided to recast his novel in the third person. This shift was the culmination of a long struggle, present through all the early stages of composition. Once having decided, Dostoevsky began to rewrite from scratch and was able to easily integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final text. Frank says that he did not, as he told Wrangel, burn everything he had written earlier.

Dostoevsky was under great pressure to finish &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; on time, as he was simultaneously contracted to finish &quot;The Gambler&quot; for the prominent Russian publisher Fyodor Stellovsky, who had imposed extremely harsh conditions. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who later became Dostoevsky&#x27;s wife, was of great help to him during this difficult task. The first part of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; appeared in the January 1866 issue of &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;, and the last one was published in December 1866.

== Plot ==
===Part 1===
Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in a tiny rented room in Saint Petersburg. Isolated and antisocial, he has abandoned all attempts to support himself and is brooding obsessively on a scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawnbroker. On the pretext of pawning a watch, he visits her apartment, but he remains unable to commit himself. Later in a tavern, he makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family&#x27;s little wealth. Marmeladov tells him about his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has become a prostitute in order to support the family. The next day, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister Dunya, who has been working as a governess, with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov. To escape her vulnerable position, and with hopes of helping her brother, Dunya has chosen to marry a wealthy suitor, Luzhin, whom they are coming to meet in Petersburg. Details in the letter suggest that Luzhin is a conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of Dunya&#x27;s situation. Raskolnikov is enraged at his sister&#x27;s sacrifice, feeling it is the same as what Sonya felt compelled to do. Painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence, his thoughts return to his idea. A further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it.

In a state of extreme nervous tension, Raskolnikov steals an axe and makes his way once more to the old woman&#x27;s apartment. He gains access by pretending he has something to pawn, and then attacks her with the axe, killing her. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime. Shaken by his actions, he steals only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawnbroker&#x27;s wealth untouched. Due to sheer good fortune, he manages to escape the building and return to his room undetected.

===Part 2===
In a feverish and semi-delirious state Raskolnikov conceals the stolen items and falls asleep exhausted. He is greatly alarmed the next morning when he gets summoned to the police station, but it turns out to be in relation to a debt notice from his landlady. When the officers at the bureau begin talking about the murder, Raskolnikov faints. He quickly recovers, but he can see from their faces that he has aroused suspicion. Fearing a search, he hides the stolen items under a large rock in an empty yard, noticing in humiliation that he has not even checked how much money is in the purse. Without knowing why, he visits his old university friend Razumikhin, who observes that Raskolnikov seems to be seriously ill. Finally he returns to his room where he succumbs to his illness and falls into a prolonged delirium.

When he emerges several days later he finds that Razumikhin has tracked him down and has been nursing him. Still feverish, Raskolnikov listens nervously to a conversation between Razumikhin and the doctor about the status of the police investigation into the murders: a &quot;muzhik&quot; called Mikolka, who was working in a neighbouring flat at the time, has been detained, and the old woman&#x27;s clients are being interviewed. They are interrupted by the arrival of Luzhin, Dunya&#x27;s fiancé, who wishes to introduce himself, but Raskolnikov deliberately insults him and kicks him out. He angrily tells the others to leave as well, and then sneaks out himself. He looks for news about the murder, and seems almost to want to draw attention to his own part in it. He encounters the police official Zamyotov, who was present when he fainted in the bureau, and openly mocks the young man&#x27;s unspoken suspicions. He returns to the scene of the crime and re-lives the sensations he experienced at the time. He angers the workmen and caretakers by asking casual questions about the murder, even suggesting that they accompany him to the police station to discuss it. As he contemplates whether or not to confess, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage. He rushes to help and succeeds in conveying the stricken man back to his family&#x27;s apartment. Calling out for Sonya to forgive him, Marmeladov dies in his daughter&#x27;s arms. Raskolnikov gives his last twenty five roubles (from money sent to him by his mother) to Marmeladov&#x27;s consumptive widow, Katerina Ivanovna, saying it is the repayment of a debt to his friend.

Feeling renewed, Raskolnikov calls on Razumikhin, and they go back together to Raskolnikov&#x27;s building. Upon entering his room Raskolnikov is deeply shocked to see his mother and sister sitting on the sofa. They have just arrived in Petersburg and are ecstatic to see him, but Raskolnikov is unable to speak, and collapses in a faint.

===Part 3===
Razumikhin tends to Raskolnikov, and manages to convince the distressed mother and sister to return to their apartment. He goes with them, despite being drunk and rather overwhelmed by Dunya&#x27;s beauty. When they return the next morning Raskolnikov has improved physically, but it becomes apparent that he is still mentally distracted and merely forcing himself to endure the meeting. He demands that Dunya break with Luzhin, but Dunya fiercely defends her motives for the marriage. Mrs Raskolnikova has received a note from Luzhin demanding that her son not be present at any future meetings between them. He also informs her that he witnessed her son give the 25 rubles to &quot;an unmarried woman of immoral behavior&quot; (Sonya). Dunya has decided that a meeting, at which both Luzhin and her brother are present, must take place, and Raskolnikov agrees to attend that evening along with Razumikhin. To Raskolnikov&#x27;s surprise, Sonya suddenly appears at his door. Timidly, she explains that he left his address with them last night, and that she has come to invite him to attend her father&#x27;s funeral. As she leaves, Raskolnikov asks for her address and tells her that he will visit her soon.

At Raskolnikov&#x27;s behest, Razumikhin takes him to see the detective Porfiry Petrovich, who is investigating the murders. Raskolnikov immediately senses that Porfiry knows that he is the murderer. Porfiry, who has just been discussing the case with Zamyotov, adopts an ironic tone during the conversation. He expresses extreme curiosity about an article that Raskolnikov wrote some months ago called &#x27;On Crime&#x27;, in which he suggests that certain rare individuals—the benefactors and geniuses of mankind—have a right to &#x27;step across&#x27; legal or moral boundaries if those boundaries are an obstruction to the success of their idea. Raskolnikov defends himself skillfully, but he is alarmed and angered by Porfiry&#x27;s insinuating tone. An appointment is made for an interview the following morning at the police bureau.

Leaving Razumikhin with his mother and sister, Raskolnikov returns to his own building. He is surprised to find an old artisan, whom he does not know, making inquiries about him. Raskolnikov tries to find out what he wants, but the artisan says only one word – &quot;murderer&quot;, and walks off. Petrified, Raskolnikov returns to his room and falls into thought and then sleeps. He wakens from an eerie nightmare about the murder of the old woman to find another complete stranger present, this time a man of aristocratic appearance. The man politely introduces himself as Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov.

===Part 4===
Svidrigailov indulges in an amiable but disjointed monologue, punctuated by Raskolnikov&#x27;s terse interjections. He claims to no longer have any romantic interest in Dunya, but wants to stop her from marrying Luzhin, and offers her ten thousand roubles. Raskolnikov refuses the money on her behalf and refuses to facilitate a meeting. Svidrigailov also mentions that his wife, who defended Dunya at the time of the unpleasantness but died shortly afterwards, has left her 3000 rubles in her will.

The meeting with Luzhin that evening begins with talk of Svidrigailov—his depraved character, his presence in Petersburg, the unexpected death of his wife and the 3000 rubles left to Dunya. Luzhin takes offence when Dunya insists on resolving the issue with her brother, and when Raskolnikov draws attention to the slander in his letter, Luzhin becomes reckless, exposing his true character. Dunya tells him to leave and never come back. Now free and with significant capital, they excitedly begin to discuss plans for the future, but Raskolnikov suddenly gets up and leaves, telling them, to their great consternation, that it might be the last time he sees them. He instructs the baffled Razumikhin to remain and always care for them.

Raskolnikov proceeds to Sonya&#x27;s place. She is gratified that he is visiting her, but also frightened of his strange manner. He asks a series of merciless questions about her terrible situation and that of Katerina Ivanovna and the children. Raskolnikov begins to realize that Sonya is sustained only by her faith in God. She reveals that she was a friend of the murdered Lizaveta. In fact, Lizaveta gave her a cross and a copy of the Gospels. She passionately reads to him the story of the raising of Lazarus from the Gospel of John. His fascination with her, which had begun at the time when her father spoke of her, increases and he decides that they must face the future together. As he leaves he tells her that he will come back tomorrow and tell her who killed her friend Lizaveta.

When Raskolnikov presents himself for his interview, Porfiry resumes and intensifies his insinuating, provocative, ironic chatter, without ever making a direct accusation. With Raskolnikov&#x27;s anger reaching fever pitch, Porfiry hints that he has a &quot;little surprise&quot; for him behind the partition in his office, but at that moment there is a commotion outside the door and a young man (Mikolka the painter) bursts in, followed by some policemen. To both Porfiry and Raskolnikov&#x27;s astonishment, Mikolka proceeds to loudly confess to the murders. Porfiry does not believe the confession, but he is forced to let Raskolnikov go. Back at his room Raskolnikov is horrified when the old artisan suddenly appears at his door. But the man bows and asks for forgiveness: he had been Porfiry&#x27;s &quot;little surprise&quot;, and had heard Mikolka confess. He had been one of those present when Raskolnikov returned to the scene of the murders, and had reported his behavior to Porfiry.

===Part 5===
Raskolnikov attends the Marmeladovs&#x27; post-funeral banquet at Katerina Ivanovna&#x27;s apartment. The atmosphere deteriorates as guests become drunk and the half-mad Katerina Ivanovna engages in a verbal attack on her German landlady. With chaos descending, everyone is surprised by the sudden and portentous appearance of Luzhin. He sternly announces that a 100-ruble banknote disappeared from his apartment at the precise time that he was being visited by Sonya, whom he had invited in order to make a small donation. Sonya fearfully denies stealing the money, but Luzhin persists in his accusation and demands that someone search her. Outraged, Katerina Ivanovna abuses Luzhin and sets about emptying Sonya&#x27;s pockets to prove her innocence, but a folded 100-ruble note does indeed fly out of one of the pockets. The mood in the room turns against Sonya, Luzhin chastises her, and the landlady orders the family out. But Luzhin&#x27;s roommate Lebezyatnikov arrives, and angrily asserts that he saw Luzhin surreptitiously slip the money into Sonya&#x27;s pocket as she left, although he had thought at the time that it was a noble act of anonymous charity. Raskolnikov backs Lebezyatnikov up by confidently identifying Luzhin&#x27;s motive: a desire to avenge himself on Raskolnikov by defaming Sonya, in hopes of causing a rift with his family. Luzhin is discredited, but Sonya is traumatized, and she runs out of the apartment. Raskolnikov follows her.

Back at her room, Raskolnikov draws Sonya&#x27;s attention to the ease with which Luzhin could have ruined her, and consequently the children as well. But it is only a prelude to his confession that he is the murderer of the old woman and Lizaveta. Painfully, he tries to explain his abstract motives for the crime to uncomprehending Sonya. She is horrified, not just at the crime, but at his own self-torture, and tells him that he must hand himself in to the police. Lebezyatnikov appears and tells them that the landlady has kicked Katerina Ivanovna out of the apartment and that she has gone mad. They find Katerina Ivanovna surrounded by people in the street, completely insane, trying to force the terrified children to perform for money, and near death from her illness. They manage to get her back to Sonya&#x27;s room, where, distraught and raving, she dies. To Raskolnikov&#x27;s surprise, Svidrigailov suddenly appears and informs him that he will be using the ten thousand rubles intended for Dunya to make the funeral arrangements and to place the children in good orphanages. When Raskolnikov asks him what his motives are, he laughingly replies with direct quotations of Raskolnikov&#x27;s own words, spoken when he was trying to explain his justifications for the murder to Sonya. Svidrigailov has been residing next door to Sonya, and overheard every word of the murder confession.

===Part 6===
Razumikhin tells Raskolnikov that Dunya has become troubled and distant after receiving a letter from someone. He also mentions, to Raskolnikov&#x27;s astonishment, that Porfiry no longer suspects him of the murders. As Raskolnikov is about to set off in search of Svidrigailov, Porfiry himself appears and politely requests a brief chat. He sincerely apologises for his previous behavior and seeks to explain the reasons behind it. Strangely, Raskolnikov begins to feel alarmed at the thought that Porfiry might think he is innocent. But Porfiry&#x27;s changed attitude is motivated by genuine respect for Raskolnikov, not by any thought of his innocence, and he concludes by expressing his absolute certainty that Raskolnikov is indeed the murderer. He claims that he will be arresting him soon, but urges him to confess to make it easier on himself. Raskolnikov chooses to continue the struggle.

Raskolnikov finds Svidrigailov at an inn and warns him against approaching Dunya. Svidrigailov, who has in fact arranged to meet Dunya, threatens to go to the police, but Raskolnikov is unconcerned and follows when he leaves. When Raskolnikov finally turns home, Dunya, who has been watching them, approaches Svidrigailov and demands to know what he meant in his letter about her brother&#x27;s &quot;secret&quot;. She reluctantly accompanies him to his rooms, where he reveals what he overheard and attempts to use it to make her yield to his desire. Dunya, however, has a gun and she fires at him, narrowly missing: Svidrigailov gently encourages her to reload and try again. Eventually she throws the gun aside, but Svidrigailov, crushed by her hatred for him, tells her to leave. Later that evening he goes to Sonya to discuss the arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna&#x27;s children. He gives her 3000 rubles, telling her she will need it if she wishes to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. He spends the night in a miserable hotel and the following morning commits suicide in a public place.

Raskolnikov says a painful goodbye to his mother, without telling her the truth. Dunya is waiting for him at his room, and he tells her that he will be going to the police to confess to the murders. He stops at Sonya&#x27;s place on the way and she gives him a crucifix. At the bureau, he learns of Svidrigailov&#x27;s suicide, and almost changes his mind, even leaving the building. However, he sees Sonya (who has followed him) looking at him in despair, and he returns to make a full and frank confession to the murders.

===Epilogue===
Due to the fullness of his confession at a time when another man had already confessed, Raskolnikov is sentenced to only eight years of penal servitude. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and plan to move to Siberia, but Raskolnikov&#x27;s mother falls ill and dies. Sonya follows Raskolnikov to Siberia, but he is initially hostile towards her as he is still struggling to acknowledge moral culpability for his crime, feeling himself to be guilty only of weakness. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya&#x27;s loving influence.

== Characters ==
In &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of &quot;ideological intoxication,&quot; and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychological consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov&#x27;s psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught. From another point of view, the novel&#x27;s plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, &quot;Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society as Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s Rastignac or Stendhal&#x27;s Julien Sorel, but to those of rationalistic Petersburg&quot;.

===Major characters===
Raskolnikov (Rodion Romanovitch) is the protagonist, and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective. A 23-year-old former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov is described in the novel as &quot;exceptionally handsome, taller than average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair.&quot; On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of impulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it.

Despite its title, the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment as with Raskolnikov&#x27;s internal struggle – the torments of his own conscience, rather than the legal consequences of committing the crime. Believing society would be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possesses enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.

Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova) is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and innocent, despite being forced into prostitution to help her family. Raskolnikov discerns in her the same feelings of shame and alienation that he experiences, and she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime. Sensing his deep unhappiness, she supports him, even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov.

Razumíkhin (Dmitry Prokofyich) is Raskolnikov&#x27;s loyal friend and also a former law student. The character is intended to represent something of a reconciliation between faith and reason (&quot;razum&quot;, &quot;sense&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot;). He jokes that his name is actually Vrazumíkhin – a name suggesting &quot;to bring someone to their senses&quot;. He is upright, strong, resourceful and intelligent, but also somewhat naïve – qualities that are of great importance to Raskolnikov in his desperate situation. He admires Raskolnikov&#x27;s intelligence and character, refuses to give any credence to others&#x27; suspicions, and supports him at all times. He looks after Raskolnikov&#x27;s family when they come to Petersburg, falling in love with and later marrying Dunya.

Dunya (Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova) – Raskolnikov&#x27;s beautiful and strong-willed sister who works as a governess. She initially plans to marry the wealthy but unsavory lawyer Luzhin, thinking it will enable her to ease her family&#x27;s desperate financial situation and escape her former employer Svidrigailov. Her situation is a factor in Raskolnikov&#x27;s decision to commit the murder. In St. Petersburg, she is eventually able to escape the clutches of both Luzhin and Svidrigailov, and later marries Razumikhin.

Luzhin (Pyotr Petrovich) – A well-off lawyer who is engaged to Dunya in the beginning of the novel. His motives for the marriage are dubious, as he more or less states that he has sought a woman who will be completely beholden to him. He slanders and falsely accuses Sonya of theft in an attempt to harm Raskolnikov&#x27;s relations with his family. Luzhin represents immorality, in contrast to Svidrigaïlov&#x27;s amorality, and Raskolnikov&#x27;s misguided morality.

Svidrigaïlov (Arkady Ivanovich) – Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and former pursuer of Dunya. He overhears Raskolnikov&#x27;s confessions to Sonya and uses this knowledge to torment both Dunya and Raskolnikov, but does not inform the police. Despite his apparent malevolence, Svidrigaïlov seems to be capable of generosity and compassion. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go. He tells Sonya that he has made financial arrangements for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage, and gives her three thousand rubles, enabling her to follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. Having left the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée, he commits suicide.

Porfiry Petrovich – The head of the Investigation Department in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does this through psychological means, seeking to confuse and provoke the volatile Raskolnikov into a voluntary or involuntary confession. He later drops these methods and sincerely urges Raskolnikov to confess for his own good.

===Other characters===
* &quot;Pulkheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova&quot; – Raskolnikov&#x27;s naïve, hopeful and loving mother. Following Raskolnikov&#x27;s sentence, she falls ill (mentally and physically) and eventually dies.

== Themes ==

=== Nihilism, rationalism and utilitarianism ===
Dostoevsky&#x27;s letter to Katkov reveals his immediate inspiration, to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into a much more ambitious creation: a desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines of Russian nihilism. In the novel, Dostoevsky pinpointed the dangers of both utilitarianism and rationalism, the main ideas of which inspired the radicals, continuing a fierce criticism he had already started with his &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;. Dostoevsky utilized the characters, dialogue and narrative in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; to articulate an argument against Westernizing ideas. He thus attacked a peculiar Russian blend of French utopian socialism and Benthamite utilitarianism, which had developed under revolutionary thinkers such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and became known as rational egoism.
The radicals refused to recognize themselves in the novel&#x27;s pages, since Dostoevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov&#x27;s ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of the time. The radicals&#x27; aims were altruistic and humanitarian, but they were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing the spontaneous outflow of Christian compassion. Chernyshevsky&#x27;s utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science. Dostoevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.

Raskolnikov exemplifies the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal. Contemporary scholar Joseph Frank writes that &quot;the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity on the one hand and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd&quot;. Raskolnikov&#x27;s inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and &quot;useless&quot; old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoevsky wants to show that this utilitarian style of reasoning had become widespread and commonplace; it was by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov&#x27;s tormented and disordered mind. Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov&#x27;s character, and help justify his contempt for humanity&#x27;s lower qualities and ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher social good, believes that he possesses a moral right to kill. Indeed, his &quot;Napoleon-like&quot; plan impels him toward a well-calculated murder, the ultimate conclusion of his self-deception with utilitarianism.

=== The environment of Saint Petersburg ===
Dostoevsky was among the first to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regards &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; as the first great Russian novel &quot;in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor&quot;.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s Petersburg is the city of unrelieved poverty; &quot;magnificence has no place in it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold&quot;. Dostoevsky connects the city&#x27;s problems to Raskolnikov&#x27;s thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that &quot;the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov&#x27;s state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched.&quot;

In his depiction of Petersburg, Dostoevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov&#x27;s eyes. He uses Raskolnikov&#x27;s encounter with Marmeladov to contrast the heartlessness of Raskolnikov&#x27;s convictions with a Christian approach to poverty and wretchedness. Dostoevsky believes that the moral &quot;freedom&quot; propounded by Raskolnikov is a dreadful freedom &quot;that is contained by no values, because it is before values&quot;. In seeking to affirm this &quot;freedom&quot; in himself, Raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God. He thinks that he is self-sufficient and self-contained, but at the end &quot;his boundless self-confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself, and his self-fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God&quot;. Dostoevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of &quot;sick&quot; Russian society through the re-discovery of its national identity, its religion, and its roots.

== Structure ==
The novel is divided into six parts, with an epilogue. The notion of &quot;intrinsic duality&quot; in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; has been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree of symmetry to the book. Edward Wasiolek, who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; to a &quot;flattened X&quot;, saying:

This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel&#x27;s six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as David Bethea has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the &quot;left&quot; half of the novel reflects the &quot;right&quot; half.

The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky&#x27;s critics have criticized the novel&#x27;s final pages as superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy of the rest of the work, while others have defended it, offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues that &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; &quot;is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale&quot;. Cassedy concludes that &quot;the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; ... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue&quot;.

==Style==
&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is written from a third-person omniscient perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov, but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as Svidrigaïlov, Razumikhin, Luzhin, Sonya or Dunya. This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters, was original for its period. Frank notes that Dostoevsky&#x27;s use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce. A late nineteenth-century reader was, however, accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration. This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman, and to observations like the following by Melchior de Vogüé: &quot;A word ... one does not even notice, a small fact that takes up only a line, have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [so that] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages&quot;.

Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters. Those who use artificial language—Luzhin, for example—are identified as unattractive people. Mrs. Marmeladov&#x27;s disintegrating mind is reflected in her language. In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters have something of a double meaning, but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture. For example, the original Russian title (&quot;Преступление и наказание&quot;) is not the direct equivalent to the English &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. &quot;Преступление&quot; (&quot;Prestupléniye&quot;) is literally translated as &#x27;a stepping across&#x27;. The physical image of crime as crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation, as is the religious implication of transgression.

== Reception ==
The first part of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; published in the January and February issues of &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; met with public success. In his memoirs, the conservative belletrist Nikolay Strakhov recalled that &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was the literary sensation of 1866 in Russia. Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; was being serialized in &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; at the same time as &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.

The novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations, and wondered, &quot;Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?&quot; Pisarev, aware of the novel&#x27;s artistic value, described Raskolnikov as a product of his environment, and argued that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel&#x27;s excellence by the accuracy with which Dostoevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel&#x27;s plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev&#x27;s contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoevsky&#x27;s attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: &quot;This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation—it is a lament over it.&quot; Solovyov felt that the meaning of the novel, despite the common failure to understand it, is clear and simple: a man who considers himself entitled to &#x27;step across&#x27; discovers that what he thought was an intellectually and even morally justifiable transgression of an arbitrary law turns out to be, for his conscience, &quot;a sin, a violation of inner moral justice... that inward sin of self-idolatry can only be redeemed by an inner act of self-renunciation.&quot;

The early Symbolist movement that dominated Russian letters in the 1880s was concerned more with aesthetics than the visceral realism and intellectuality of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, but a tendency toward mysticism among the new generation of symbolists in the 1900s led to a reevaluation of the novel as an address to the dialectic of spirit and matter. In the character of Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna) they saw an embodiment of both the Orthodox feminine principle of &quot;hagia sophia&quot; (holy wisdom) – &quot;at once sexual and innocent, redemptive both in her suffering and her veneration of suffering&quot;, and the most important feminine deity of Russian folklore &quot;mat syra zemlya&quot; (moist mother earth). Raskolnikov is a &quot;son of Earth&quot; whose egoistic aspirations lead him to ideas and actions that alienate him from the very source of his strength, and he must bow down to her before she can relieve him of the terrible burden of his guilt. Philosopher and Orthodox theologian Nikolay Berdyaev shared Solovyov and the symbolists&#x27; sense of the novel&#x27;s spiritual significance, seeing it as an illustration of the modern age&#x27;s hubristic self-deification, or what he calls &quot;the suicide of man by self-affirmation&quot;. Raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will, but, according to Berdyaev, these are questions that can only be answered by God, and &quot;he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself: that is the meaning of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was regarded as an important work in a number of 20th-century European cultural movements, notably the Bloomsbury Group, psychoanalysis, and existentialism. Of the writers associated with Bloomsbury, Virginia Woolf, John Middleton Murry and D. H. Lawrence are some of those who have discussed the work. Freud held Dostoevsky&#x27;s work in high esteem, and many of his followers have attempted psychoanalytical interpretations of Raskolnikov. Among the existentialists, Sartre and Camus in particular have acknowledged Dostoevsky&#x27;s influence.

The affinity of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; with both religious mysticism and psychoanalysis led to suppression of discussion in Soviet Russia: interpretations of Raskolnikov tended to align with Pisarev&#x27;s idea of reaction to unjust socio-economic conditions. An exception was the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of Dostoevsky&#x27;s work. In &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot;, Bakhtin argues that attempts to understand Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters from the vantage point of a pre-existing philosophy, or as individualized &quot;objects&quot; to be psychologically analysed, will always fail to penetrate the unique &quot;artistic architechtonics&quot; of his works. In such cases, both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are monological: everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of a single overarching perspective, whether that of the critic or that of the author. Dostoevsky&#x27;s art, Bakhtin argues, is inherently dialogical: events proceed on the basis of interaction between self-validating subjective voices, often within the consciousness of an individual character, as is the case with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov&#x27;s consciousness is depicted as a battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel: everyone and everything he encounters becomes reflected and refracted in a &quot;dialogized&quot; interior monologue. He has rejected external relationships and chosen his tormenting internal dialogue; only Sonya is capable of continuing to engage with him despite his cruelty. His openness to dialogue with Sonya is what enables him to cross back over the &quot;threshold into real-life communication (confession and public trial)—not out of guilt, for he avoids acknowledging his guilt, but out of weariness and loneliness, for that reconciling step is the only relief possible from the cacophony of unfinalized inner dialogue.&quot;

<text>Montrose is a borough and the county seat of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. The land is elevated approximately above sea level. It is the Susquehanna County seat.

==History==
Montrose was laid out in 1812 in an area of Pennsylvania historically associated with the Indigenous Susquehannock people. The first non-Indigenous settler in 1800 was a Revolutionary War officer, Captain Bartlett Hinds, who traveled from Long Island, NY with his stepson, Isaac Post. Upon seeing the area&#x27;s natural beauty and potential, he returned to NY to bring his family to Pennsylvania. Among other settlers were the descendants of Sir Peter Warren, Knight Vice Admiral on England&#x27;s Royal Fleet. Upon retirement, he was given the land by grateful American soldiers.

The first courthouse was built a year later, and Montrose was incorporated as a borough from part of Bridgewater Township on March 29, 1824. Prominent area citizens Capt. B. Hinds and Dr. Robert H. Rose collaborated to name Montrose after a town in Scotland.

The traditional older industries included creameries and the manufacturing of cut glass, boxes, sawing machinery, lumber, etc. The area of Montrose is notable for its many quarry sites. A type of rock that is indigenous to this area is called blue stone. In 1900, 1,827 people lived there, and in 1910, 1,914 people resided there.

Montrose was incorporated as a town and seat of Susquehanna County in 1824, but families began immigrating to the area in the mid-18th century, primarily from areas along the Connecticut River Valley (western Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont). The American Revolution dramatically changed the political and built environments of New England. After the war, there was pent-up land hunger and many residents wanted some of the affordable land in Pennsylvania. When settlers arrived in what is now Susquehanna County they found rolling hills, clear lakes, and mountain streams with an abundance of natural resources such as timber and bluestone. In a very short period of time, the first families built Montrose in the style of their home New England towns: large colonial style houses surrounding churches, and both centered on a main street. A town “green” adjacent to the courthouse was the commons, or place for community events.

Montrose played a significant role in the Northern Trail of the Underground Railroad: &quot;During the 1840s, the anti-slavery ideology prevailing in Susquehanna County took a decidedly radical turn.
Abolitionists no longer content to limit their involvement to lectures and debates began helping slaves escape on the Underground Railroad. Of the eighty-two individuals identified as
Underground Railroad agents, twenty-one came from Susquehanna County.&quot;

Between the 1950s and 1990s, due to the declines in the coal industry and agriculture, residents emigrated from this area to other places for work. In the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century natural gas exploration, drilling and hydraulic fracturing used in the gas extraction process have created a dramatic pickup in the local economy. Due to increased revenues in town, the Montrose hospital (the only major hospital in Susquehanna County) was moved from an old and small facility downtown to a large, advanced facility just outside town.

The population was 1,664 at the 2000 census. The population was 1,617 as of 2010.

The town&#x27;s Sylvanus Mulford House, Silver Lake Bank, and Susquehanna County Courthouse Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Montrose Historic District was added in 2011.

<doc id="133877" wikidata="Q181008" url="?curid=133877" title="Jigsaw puzzle">
<text>A jigsaw puzzle (with context, sometimes just jigsaw or just puzzle) is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often irregularly shaped interlocking and mosaicked pieces. Typically each piece has a portion of a picture, which is completed by solving the puzzle.

In the 18th century, jigsaw puzzles were created by painting a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, then cutting it into small pieces. The name &quot;jigsaw&quot; derives from the tools used to cut the images into pieces—variably identified as jigsaws, fretsaws or scroll saws. Assisted by Jason Hinds, John Spilsbury, a London cartographer and engraver, is credited with commercialising jigsaw puzzles around 1760. His design took world maps, and cut out the individual nations in order for them to be reassembled by students as a geographical teaching aid. They have since come to be made primarily of interlocking cardboard pieces, incorporating a variety of images and designs.

Jigsaw puzzles have been used in research studies to study cognitive abilities such as mental rotation visuospatial ability in young children.

Typical images on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from nature, buildings, and repetitive designs. Castles and mountains are among traditional subjects, but any picture can be used. Artisan puzzle-makers and companies using technologies for one-off and small print-run puzzles utilize a wide range of subject matter, including optical illusions, unusual art, and personal photographs. In addition to traditional flat, two-dimensional puzzles, three-dimensional puzzles have entered large-scale production, including spherical puzzles and architectural recreations.

A range of jigsaw puzzle accessories, including boards, cases, frames, and roll-up mats, have become available to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts. While most assembled puzzles are disassembled for reuse, they can also be attached to a backing with adhesive and displayed as art.

Competitive jigsaw puzzling has grown in popularity in the 21st century, with both regional and national competitions held in many countries, and annual World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships held from 2019.

==History==

John Spilsbury is believed to have produced the first jigsaw puzzle around 1760, using a marquetry saw.

Early puzzles, known as dissections, were produced by mounting maps on sheets of hardwood and cutting along national boundaries, creating a puzzle useful for teaching geography. Royal governess Lady Charlotte Finch used such &quot;dissected maps&quot; to teach the children of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Cardboard jigsaw puzzles appeared in the late 1800s, but were slow to replace wooden ones because manufacturers felt that cardboard puzzles would be perceived as low-quality, and because profit margins on wooden jigsaws were larger.
The name &quot;jigsaw&quot; came to be associated with the puzzle around 1880 when fretsaws became the tool of choice for cutting the shapes. Along with fretsaws, jigsaws and scroll saws have also been noted as tools used to cut jigsaw puzzles into pieces. The term &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; dates back to 1906.
Jigsaw puzzles soared in popularity during the Great Depression, as they provided a cheap, long-lasting, recyclable form of entertainment. It was around this time that jigsaws evolved to become more complex and appealing to adults. They were also given away in product promotions and used in advertising, with customers completing an image of the promoted product.

Sales of wooden puzzles fell after World War II as improved wages led to price increases, while improvements in manufacturing processes made paperboard jigsaws more attractive.

Demand for jigsaw puzzles saw a surge, comparable to that of the Great Depression, during the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s stay-at-home orders.

==Modern construction==

Most modern jigsaw puzzles are made of paperboard as they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce. An enlarged photograph or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional artwork is glued to cardboard, which is then fed into a press. The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired pattern, called a &quot;puzzle die&quot;, through the board until fully cut.

The puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, with slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used. The knives are set into the slots and covered in a compressible material, typically foam rubber, which ejects the cut puzzle pieces.

The cutting process is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter. However, the forces involved are tremendously greater.

Beginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles were cut using large hydraulic presses that now cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The precise cuts gave a snug fit, but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle production to large corporations. Recent roller-press methods achieve the same results at a lower cost.

New technology has also enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage is that the puzzle can be custom-cut to any size or shape, with any number or average size of pieces. Many museums have laser-cut acrylic puzzles made of some of their art so visiting children can assemble puzzles of the images on display. Acrylic pieces are very durable, waterproof, and can withstand continued use without the image degrading. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer-based, missing pieces can easily be remade.

By the early 1960s, Tower Press was the world&#x27;s largest jigsaw puzzle maker; it was acquired by Waddingtons in 1969. Numerous smaller-scale puzzle makers work in artisanal styles, handcrafting and handcutting their creations.

==Variations==
Jigsaw puzzles come in a variety of sizes. Among those marketed to adults, 300-, 500- and 750-piece puzzles are considered &quot;smaller&quot;. More sophisticated, but still common, puzzles come in sizes of 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 pieces.

Jigsaw puzzles geared towards children typically have significantly fewer pieces and are typically much larger. For very young children, puzzles with as few as 4 to 9 large pieces (so as not to be a choking hazard) are standard. They are usually made of wood or plastic for durability and can be cleaned without damage.

The most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for an actual total of 1,026 pieces. Most 500-piece puzzles are 27 pieces by 19 pieces, for a total of 513 pieces. A few puzzles are double-sided so they can be solved from either side—adding complexity, as the enthusiast must determine if they are looking at the right side of each piece.

&quot;Family puzzles&quot; of 100–550 pieces use an assortment of small, medium and large pieces, with each size going in one direction or towards the middle of the puzzle. This allows a family of different skill levels and hand sizes to work on the puzzle together. Companies like Springbok, Cobble Hill, Ceaco, Buffalo Games and Suns Out make this type of specialty puzzle. Ravensburger, on the other hand, formerly made this type of puzzle from 2000 until 2008.There are also three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. Many are made of wood or styrofoam and require the puzzle to be solved in a particular order, as some pieces will not fit if others are already in place. One type of 3-D jigsaw puzzle is a puzzle globe, often made of plastic. Like 2-D puzzles, the assembled pieces form a single layer, but the final form is three-dimensional. Most globe puzzles have designs representing spherical shapes such as the Earth, the Moon, and historical globes of the Earth.

Jigsaw puzzles can vary significantly in price depending on their complexity, number of pieces, and brand. In the US, children&#x27;s puzzles can start around $5, while larger ones can be closer to $50. The most expensive puzzle to date was sold for $US27,000 in 2005 at a charity auction for The Golden Retriever Foundation.

==Puzzle pieces==
Most puzzles are square or rectangular, with edge pieces with one straight side, and four corner pieces. However, some puzzles have edge and corner pieces cut like the rest, with no straight sides, making them more challenging to identify them. Some puzzles are round or in a more complex shape, such as profiles of animals, and their edge pieces are therefore curved. Spherical puzzles can have triangular edge pieces.

Otherwise, all or most pieces of a modern jigsaw puzzle interlock by means of rounded tabs (interjambs) and indentations (called &quot;blanks&quot;) on adjacent sides. The pieces are normally four-sided and may be uniform in appearance except for the edges and corners. Some puzzles are termed &quot;fully interlocking&quot;, which means that a group of assembled pieces fit together tightly enough to be moved without falling apart; sometimes the connection is tight enough that a solved section will remain attached when lifted by one piece. Uniformly shaped fully interlocking puzzles, sometimes called &quot;Japanese Style&quot;, are more difficult because pieces are hard to tell apart.

Wooden puzzles fit together more loosely, with few tabs and blanks, because of the limits of the material and the cutting technology. They sometimes include pieces in recognisable shapes such as objects or animals, known as &quot;whimsies&quot;, &quot;silhouettes&quot;, or &quot;figurals&quot;. Designer Yuu Asaka has created monochrome jigsaw puzzles with five &quot;corner&quot; pieces (with two straight edges) and consisting entirely of such pieces. The former was awarded the Jury Honorable Mention at the 2018 Puzzle Design Competition. 

==World records==
The world&#x27;s largest-sized jigsaw puzzle measured with 12,320 pieces. It was assembled on 7 July 2018 at Dubai Multi Commodities Centre in United Arab Emirates.

The jigsaw with the greatest number of pieces had 551,232 pieces and measured . It was assembled on 25 September 2011 at Phú Thọ Indoor Stadium in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, by students of the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City. It is listed by the Guinness World Records for the &quot;Largest Jigsaw Puzzle – most pieces&quot;, and was divided into 3,132 sections each containing 176 pieces, which were assembled individually and then connected to compose the full puzzle.

==Research studies==
Studies have shown that the ability to solve jigsaw puzzles develops during early childhood. During this time there is significant development in cognitive abilities such as mental rotation and visuospatial ability, which can be used to solve a puzzle. Throughout life those abilities can continue to develop.

In 2021, researchers conducted a study during which a group of children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old were asked to complete three different types of jigsaw puzzles. Each child was given a normal jigsaw puzzle with a picture on it, another with normal shaped pieces but without an image on it and finally a puzzle with an image on it but all the pieces were shaped the same. They were shown the completed versions then asked to reassemble them. The children were given three minutes to complete each puzzle; half of the group was given a guide picture while the other half was not. The results revealed that 4 and 5 year olds were able to complete all three puzzles within the allotted time, meanwhile most 3-year-olds were able to complete the normal jigsaw puzzle and the puzzle of normal shaped pieces without an image on it but struggled more with the puzzle that had an image but all the pieces were shaped the same. With all of the children the fastest completion time was with the normal puzzle and the slowest was with the puzzle with an image and same shaped pieces; there were also fewer errors in with the children that had a guide. The cognitive development between the different ages can be seen in their completion times and how many errors were made. The older children were able to complete the puzzles with fewer errors because their mental rotation abilities, which is the ability to rotate an object in your mind to see it from a different perspective, are further developed than they are for younger children who are more likely to resort to trial and error.

The difference in the visuospatial abilities between boys and girls were studied in 2017 using jigsaw puzzles. A second-grade class was asked to complete three different puzzles, the first was a neutral one of a horse, second was a male-oriented one of a tractor, and the third was a female-oriented one of the character Bambi. The Bambi puzzle had the fastest completion time with all the children which is believed to be caused by their previous experience, and because it was finished the fastest with all of the children researchers do not believe there is a connection between the puzzles&#x27; targeted audience and the sex of the children. Overall the girls in the class were faster, and made fewer errors.

==Society==
The logo of Wikipedia is a globe made out of jigsaw pieces. The incomplete sphere symbolizes the room to add new knowledge.

In the logo of the Colombian Office of the Attorney General appears a jigsaw puzzle piece in the foreground. They named it &quot;The Key Piece&quot;: &quot;The piece of a puzzle is the proper symbol to visually represent the Office of the Attorney General because it includes the concepts of search, solution and answers that the entity pursues through the investigative activity.&quot;

===Art and entertainment===
The central antagonist in the &quot;Saw&quot; film franchise is nicknamed Jigsaw, due to his practice of cutting the shape of a puzzle piece from the remains of his victims.

In the 1933 Laurel and Hardy short &quot;Me and My Pal&quot;, several characters attempt to complete a large jigsaw puzzle.

&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, as well as an interpretive puzzle itself.

&quot;&quot;, Georges Perec&#x27;s most famous novel, tells as pieces of a puzzle a story about a jigsaw puzzle maker.

Jigsaw Puzzle (song), sometimes spelled &quot;Jig-Saw Puzzle&quot; is a song by the rock and roll band The Rolling Stones, featured on their 1968 album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;.

In &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) is reduced to spending her days completing jigsaws after the failure of her operatic career. After Kane&#x27;s death when &quot;Xanadu&quot; is emptied, hundreds of jigsaw puzzles are discovered in the cellar.

Rhett And Link Do A Rainy Day Jigsaw Puzzle is a short video by self-described &quot;internetainers&quot; (portmanteau of &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;entertainers&quot;) Rhett &amp; Link which portrays the frustration of discovering a puzzle piece is missing.

In 2022, Andorra issued a commemorative 2 euro coin, on the national side of which a figure of puzzle pieces was stamped, symbolising the Principality of Andorra and the countries belonging to the European Union.

===Mental health===
According to the Alzheimer Society of Canada, doing jigsaw puzzles is one of many activities that can help keep the brain active and may reduce the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
Jigsaw puzzle pieces were first used as a symbol for autism in 1963 by the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Autistic Society. The organization chose jigsaw pieces for their logo to represent the &quot;puzzling&quot; nature of autism and the inability to &quot;fit in&quot; due to social differences, and also because jigsaw pieces were recognizable and otherwise unused. Puzzle pieces have since been incorporated into the logos and promotional materials of many organizations, including the Autism Society of America and Autism Speaks.

Proponents of the autism rights movement oppose the jigsaw puzzle iconography, stating that metaphors such as &quot;puzzling&quot; and &quot;incomplete&quot; are harmful to autistic people. Critics of the puzzle piece symbol instead advocate for a gold-colored or red infinity symbol representing diversity. In 2017, the journal &quot;Autism&quot; concluded that the use of the jigsaw puzzle evoked negative public perception towards autistic individuals. They removed the puzzle piece from their cover in February 2018.

<text>Susquehanna Depot, often referred to simply as Susquehanna, is a borough in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, located on the Susquehanna River southeast of Binghamton, New York. In the past, railroad locomotives and railroad cars were made here. It is also known for its Pennsylvania Bluestone quarries.

The behavioral scientist B. F. Skinner was born in Susquehanna. The American writer John Gardner lived the last few years of his life in Susquehanna, where he died in a motorcycle accident in 1982.

The borough population was 1,365 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The New York and Erie Railroad (later reorganized as the Erie Railroad) built a rail line through the county in 1848, including the Starrucca Viaduct: a monumental stone structure spanning Starrucca Creek. Concurrently, the railroad established workshops in what would eventually be known as Susquehanna Depot. Initially, 350 workers were employed. The line opened for traffic in 1851.
The borough was incorporated on August 19, 1853, from part of Harmony Township. In 1863, the Erie shops were expanded to cover and they employed 700 workers by 1865, and later over 1,000. The complex included a 33-stall roundhouse, a rail yard, a foundry, gas works, oil works and offices. By 1887, the shops were producing five locomotives per month. The Susquehanna railroad station, which included a large hotel called the Starrucca House, opened in 1865.

The railroad converted the Starrucca House to offices and staff housing c. 1903. A new roundhouse complex was constructed between 1904 and 1911, and other shop buildings were added through the 1920s. In 1928, the railroad relocated its locomotive shops to Hornell, New York, and moved other shops out of Susquehanna in 1929, but retained a coach shop with reduced staffing through the 1950s. In 1952, Erie closed the roundhouse as it converted its steam locomotive roster to diesel locomotives. By the end of the decade, Erie had moved all of its remaining shop operations to Meadville.

Erie merged into the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad (EL) in 1960, and the latter ended passenger train service through Susquehanna on November 27, 1966. EL went bankrupt in 1972 and was absorbed into Conrail in 1976. Most of the railroad shop buildings were demolished in 1980 and 1981.

With the demise of the local railroad industry, Susquehanna now has many small resident-owned businesses scattered along Main Street. Recent renovations to several Main Street buildings mark the first significant upturn in the local economy in several decades.

The Erie Railroad Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

<text>Blossburg is a borough in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,533 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1792, a party of immigrants who were building the Williamson Road from Williamsport, in Lycoming County, to Painted Post in New York, under the leadership of Robert and Benjamin Patterson, discovered coal within the present town limits of Blossburg. When the group reached the Tioga River, they established a supply camp at its banks.

In 1801, Aaron Bloss moved to Tioga County. In 1802, he settled at the area known as &quot;Peter’s Camp&quot;. He is considered the first settler of Blossburg. Sometime between 1818 and 1820, Bloss made the first attempt to found a town, changing the name of Peter&#x27;s Camp to Blossburg. Blossburg was finally recognized and incorporated a borough in August 1871.

Shortly after 1810, David Clemens made the first effort to mine and market coal from this area. Clemens opened a mine on Bear Run between 1812 and 1815, serving only the Painted Post area. Around the same time, a lower vein was opened on Bear Run by Aaron Bloss. This vein is known as the Bloss Vein; it also was used to satisfy local demands.

The first efforts to market and ship coal out of this area were on a small scale, due to the poor road conditions and the poor navigability of the Tioga River. In 1817, a coalition of Bloss and the other miners asked the legislature for funds to improve these routes. In the meantime, Blossburg coal was being shipped to Painted Post, Elmira, and Corning in western New York.

More important than the local runs, Blossburg coal was being shipped to the state capital at Albany. The legislature passed bills to support the construction of railroads and improve canal navigation in order to support the transport of coal. Blossburg coal was also shipped to Philadelphia, where it attracted the notice of enterprising businessmen.

In 1826, Judge John H. Knapp erected an iron ore smelting works within the borough limits of Blossburg. Knapp also opened coal mines on Coal Run and ore mines on &quot;Barney Hill&quot;.

In July 1840, the railroad was constructed through Covington from Corning, and was opened for locomotives to Blossburg in September. This railroad allowed the mines to be tapped and for their coal to be easily distributed through the Twin Tiers.

For more than 150 years, coal has played a vital role in the development of Blossburg. Today many of the existing mines are dormant. But Ward Manufacturing is a descendant of the Blossburg coal mining industry and is the largest business operating in the Blossburg area.

On June 23, 1967, Mohawk Airlines Flight 40 crashed outside of Blossburg with the loss of all 34 passengers and crew. Flight 40 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Elmira, New York and Washington, DC. The aircraft was a BAC 1-11-204AF.

<text>Elkland is a borough in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,827 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Elkland is located at (41.989863, -77.311238).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. It is located along the Cowanesque River.

==History==

The Parkhurst Memorial Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

===Elkland Borough===

In 1814 the township of Elkland was organized. Its territory, taken from Delmar Township, extended along the New York state line from the ninety-third to the one hundred and fourth mile-stone—a distance of . It extended north and south a distance of and embraced within its boundaries the present borough of Elkland and townships of Nelson, Osceola, all of Farmington, and parts of Lawrence, Deerfield, and Middlebury townships. In December 1816, a part of the township of Lawrence was taken from it, and in September 1822, another portion of its territory went to Middlebury township. In February 1830, the territory of the township of Farmington was taken from it. Those several reductions confined it to a narrow strip, about long, from east to west, by two and three-fourths miles wide, from north to south. By an act of the legislature, approved April 10, 1849, its territory was still further reduced by the creation of the borough of Elkland, to which, from time to time, additions have been made. In January 1857, all that part of the township not embraced in Elkland borough limits, lying west of a line extending through the center of that borough, from north to south, was erected into the township of Osceola, and in December 1857, all lying east of the same line became the township of Nelson, and Elkland township passed out of existence. By the subsequent extension of the Elkland borough limits south of the Cowanesque river, the townships of Osceola and Nelson both suffered material reductions of area. There is still left, however, a narrow strip between the southern boundary of Elkland and the northern boundary Farmington township, the western half of which belongs to Osceola Township, and the eastern half to the township of Nelson. Some years ago a movement was afoot to annex this strip to Elkland borough and thus give it and Osceola and Nelson townships more symmetrical boundaries, but for some reason the annexation was not made.

===Pioneer Settlers===

A man named Baker Pierce, who died in 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old pioneer graveyard at Osceola, appears to have been the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of the first decade of the present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the Delaware Water Gap, New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs—descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor—removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.

It appears that William Courtright acquired title to the land first bought and settled on by Philip Taylor, which, in 1814, he conveyed to Lintsford Coates. The Coates family came early, as early, so it has been stated, as 1806. In 1808, however, Timothy Coates Sr. acquired the title to of land, situated between the lands of Cyprian Wright and those of Amasa Culver, and covered by warrant No. 233 within the limits of what is now Nelson borough, and later he and his son, Lintsford, bought land and became residents of Elkland. The exact year is, however, difficult to ascertain. Daniel Holiday was here previous to 1810, in which year his son, Daniel, now a resident of Holidaytown, Middlebury township, was born.

In March 1811, came a colony from Elmira, New York and Southport, New York, consisting of Samuel Tubbs Sr., his sons, Samuel, James and Benjamin, and his sons-in-law, John Ryon Jr., David Hammond, and Martin Stevens. The members of this colony became the owners and occupants of all the land from Barney Hill on the east to the Stull farm on the west, including the Davenport Island and farm on the south side of the river. John Ryon Jr. and his brother James settled in the center of Elkland, which became known as Ryonsville. John Ryon Sr., who joined the settlement later, was the first postmaster of the village and resided there until his death in 1832. John Ryon Jr. early became a prominent and leading spirit. He was elected a justice of the peace in 1816, a member of the legislature in 1822 and 1823, and a member of the state senate in 1824. He was the first merchant of the village and its most prominent citizen. In 1848, he removed to Lawrenceville, PA, where he died July 22, 1859. Samuel Tubbs settled on what is now known as the Dorrance farm and soon became identified with the material growth of the village. David Hammond settled on the old Hammond homestead now owned by Mrs. C. L. Pattison.

The names given are those of the pioneers who settled within the borough limits, so far as it has been possible to ascertain them. In time the village took the name of Elkland, growing steadily year by year. it is now one of the most prosperous and progressive boroughs in the county.

===Village Growth===

As early as 1815, Col. Samuel Tubbs and his sons excavated a mill race around the south side of what afterward became known as Davenport Island and erected a saw-mill and a grist-mill. Col. Lemuel Davenport, who came about 1820, or soon after, acquired this property and owned and operated the mills. In 1870, they were purchased by Hon. John W. Ryon, of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1885, the grist-mill was changed to a roller-mill. In 1890, the machinery, etc., was removed to a site north of the Fall Brook railroad at the head of Parkhurst street, and the present mill was erected. In 1894, a grain elevator with a capacity of 14,000 bushels of grain was built. During the latter part of 1895, the mill was completely remodeled, and the latest improved machinery was added. It is now a 500-barrel mill and is one of the best equipped in the State. John W. Ryon Jr. is in charge. William Martindell is the superintendent and head miller. About 1840, D. B. Schoff erected a water-power saw-mill on the river in the southern part of the village and operated it for a number of years. It was torn down in 1869 by George Dorrance.

The first store in the village was opened about 1824 or 1825 by John Ryon Jr. and Robert Tubbs. In 1828, Joel Parkhurst, who had previously been in business with his brother in Lawrenceville, came to Elkland, joined with and later bought them out. He became within a few years, not only a leading business man, but the wealthiest citizen of the Cowanesque valley, maintaining at the same time a well-deserved reputation for liberality, enterprise, and public spirit. In 1832, George L. and Samuel Ryon opened a store and continued in business until 1843. About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David. Other changes occurred previous to Mr. Coates&#x27;s retirement in 1859 or 1860.

As the country became more settled, the village grew slowly, new stores being started, a school house built, a church organized, and such other trade and industrial enterprises set on foot as the condition and necessities of the people demanded. In the winter of 1839–40, James Tubbs, father of Hon. Charles Tubbs, of Osceola, and who is still living, taught a school in the village. Recently in a reminiscent article published in the Elkland Journal, he described this school and the pupils who attended and closed with the following description of the village:

&quot;At the time of my school Elkland was a mere hamlet, not even a four corners, as there was no street from Skinner&#x27;s store to the river. On what is now Buffalo street two families lived—Anson Blackman&#x27;s and Alvinzi Foote&#x27;s. Stanley, the tailor, had just occupied the house in which Dr. Rockwell now lives. Martin Stevens, carpenter, and Asaph Johnson lived on the farm where the Postal Telegraph Company&#x27;s office is, and Benjamin Tubbs on the lower part of the Dorrance farm. The leading citizen was John Ryon. He had been representative and senator, and at the time of my school had a seat upon the bench as associate judge. He gave the land where the school house was built; the land for the cemetery, and the site for the Presbyterian church, which had then been built about one year. his son, John W., has become my most distinguished scholar, having been a member of Congress. Elisha B. Benedict was the physician of the place, and Rev. Octavius Fitch, the Presbyterian minister. Joel Parkhurst, who settled in Elkland eleven years previously, kept a store on the site of the Journal office, and was the postmaster. The mail arrived twice a week at the postoffice. There was no bridge across the river.

===Later years===

The Elkland Tannery was established about 1851 by James Hancock on the south bank of the Cowanesque River. He was soon succeeded by S. G. Tabor &amp; Son. In 1853, Joel Parkhurst acquired the property, which he continued to own until 1873, when he sold it to Joseph Cornelius. He owned and operated it in connection with his sons until 1893, when it passed into the hands of Proctor, Hunt &amp; Co., of Boston, Massachusetts, Mr. Cornelius retaining an interest in the business. In January 1893, the tannery was destroyed by fire and rebuilt on the present site north of the Fall Brook railroad, beginning operations November 11, 1893.

Decker &amp; Metcalf&#x27;s Sash, Door and Blind Factory was established about 1857. They ran it nearly twenty years. The property had various owners afterwards, finally falling into the hands of C. L. Pattison who removed the plant north of the railroads and incorporated it with the furniture factory.

The Cowanesque Valley Oil Company was incorporated in July 1877, the incorporators being Garrett W. Benson, Olean, New York, and John Parkhurst, Charles L. Pattison, Benjamin Dorrance, and J. C. Edwards, of Elkland. An oil well was sunk on the Hammond place southwest of the borough. Oil and gas were both found, but in limited quantities.

The Elkland Furniture Association (Limited) was incorporated March 25, 1882, by Charles L. Pattison, William L. Simmons and Abram Coon, with a capital stock of $6,287.34. Its object was the manufacture and vending of furniture of every description. The plant was installed in ample buildings north of the railroad, and a large business soon built up. In 1890, one hundred hands were employed. The factory was destroyed by fire January 7, 1893. A movement to rebuild was immediately set on foot but was not successful.

The Elkland Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of toys and novelties, was established in Elkland in January 1887. Charles W. Crandall, the superintendent, was the son of Charles Martin Crandall, known as the maker of Crandall&#x27;s building blocks and grandson of Asa Crandall who ran a furniture factory in Covington in 1840. Mr. Crandall was in the same business in Montrose, Pennsylvania, where his large factory burned August 27, 1886, involving a loss of $46,000. From sixty to seventy-five men were constantly employed, the annual output amounting to $40,000. Toys and novelties were shipped to all parts of the world.

===Schools===
The early schools in Elkland, as in other places throughout the county, were supported by subscription, and until the building of the first school house in 1827, were taught in any house that could be secured for the purpose. The year when the first school was opened has not been ascertained, but it was probably as early as 1814 or 1816. Among the first teachers were Henry Womer, Miss Mary Ryon and Harriet B. Wright. Miss Wright, who afterwards became the wife of Ira Bulkley, taught a term of thirteen weeks beginning June 14, 1824, in an old log dwelling house &quot;located where C. L. Pattison now resides.&quot; She had eighteen pupils—eight boys and ten girls. They were John, Amariah and Hannah (wife of George L. Byon) Hammond; Esther Wright (second wife of Ira Bulkley); Elizabeth Cook (wife of Orsemus Rathbone); Willis and Nancy (wife of Brockhurst L. Baker) Hammond; George L. and Harris T. Ryon; Benson, Elizabeth and Charles Tubbs; Maria Coates (wife of Lorenzo Cook); Edward, Charlotte and Hester Buck; Phebe Mascho, who died young, and her brother Charles; and a girl named Rifle, who lived in the family of John Ryon Sr. Miss Wright&#x27;s pay for teaching was &quot;calculated at one dollar per week, or one bushel of good merchantable wheat.&quot; In 1892 her sister Esther, one of her pupils, who became the second wife of Ira Bulkley, dictated for publication an article which appeared in the Elkland Journal, in which she said:

Elkland at that time, did not show signs of becoming a village. It had no tavern, nor store, nor shop of any kind—not even a distillery. There was no church in the Cowanesque valley, and the itinerant Methodist ministers who passed this way once in six weeks, held preaching services in some barn in the summer season. John Ryon Sr. was postmaster and kept the office at his dwelling house, at which the mail arrived by carrier on horseback, once a week (Tuesdays). &quot;John Ryon, Esq.,&quot; as my father wrote his name among the patrons of my sister&#x27;s school, was at that time a member of the state senate, deservedly popular, a most generous and obliging gentleman.

In 1827 the first school building was erected. It is still standing just west of the Presbyterian church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of Mansfield, PA. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver&#x27;s Point—now Lawrenceville—for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839–40. in the article already quoted from, he says: &quot;I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship.&quot;

The second school house was built in 1855, and was a two-story frame, with rooms for two departments. In 1876 Joel Parkhurst proposed to give the district a new brick school house, costing $4,000, provided the people would raise a fund of $1,500, to be placed at interest and the interest used to keep the house in order and purchase apparatus. The offer was accepted and the building erected. It ranks as third among the school houses of the county. Prof. M. F. Cass has been principal of this school since 1891, and has proven himself an able, efficient and popular educator.

==History==
Roseville was first settled by its namesake, Dr. William Rose in 1806. Dr. Rose migrated to Tioga County from Rutland, Vermont. He served as a frontier doctor for the citizens of eastern Tioga and western Bradford Counties. Rose built a distillery at Roseville in 1822, soon after his son, William Rose Jr., opened a tavern. The tavern quickly became the center of commerce in Roseville. The tavern was replaced by a hotel built to serve the needs to travelers between Mansfield and Elmira, New York.

Roseville was home to several businesses that served the needs of the people of Tioga County during the late 1800s and early 1900s. A gristmill was opened as was a cheese factory and a paint plant, but the principal form of business remained in the taverns along the highway. A devastating fire in 1888 destroyed 23 buildings in Roseville, thus ending the tavern era.

Roseville formerly had a post office and a public school. The post office, Rutland Post Office, was closed in 1957.

<doc id="133923" wikidata="Q474188" url="?curid=133923" title="Chisel">
<text>A chisel is a wedged hand tool with a characteristically shaped cutting edge on the end of its blade, for carving or cutting a hard material (e.g. wood, stone, or metal). The tool can be used by hand, struck with a mallet, or applied with mechanical power. The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or wood with a sharp edge in it (such that wood chisels have lent part of their name to a particular grind).

Chiselling use involves forcing the blade into some material to cut it. The driving force may be applied by pushing by hand, or by using a mallet or hammer. In industrial use, a hydraulic ram or falling weight (&#x27;trip hammer&#x27;) may be used to drive a chisel into the material.

A gouge is a type of chisel that serves to carve small pieces from the material; particularly in woodworking, woodturning and sculpture. Gouges most frequently produce concave surfaces and have a U-shaped cross-section.

==Etymology==
&quot;Chisel&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;cisel&quot;, modern &quot;ciseau&quot;, Late Latin &quot;cisellum&quot;, a cutting tool, from &quot;caedere&quot;, to cut.

==History==

Chisels are common in the archeological record. Chisel-cut materials have also been found.

==Woodworking==
Woodworking chisels range from small hand tools for tiny details, to large chisels used to remove big sections of wood, in &#x27;roughing out&#x27; the shape of a pattern or design. Typically, in woodcarving, one starts with a larger tool, and gradually progresses to smaller tools to finish the detail. One of the largest types of chisel is the slick, used in timber frame construction and wooden shipbuilding. There are many types of woodworking chisels used for specific purposes, such as:
; Firmer chisel : has a blade with a thick rectangular cross section, making them stronger for use on tougher and heavier work.
; Bevel edge chisel : can get into acute angles with its bevelled edges.
; Mortise chisel : thick, rigid blade with straight cutting edge and deep, slightly tapered sides to make mortises and similar joints. Common types are registered and sash mortice chisels. 
; Paring chisel : has a long blade ideal for cleaning grooves and accessing tight spaces.
; Skew chisel : has a 60 degree cutting angle and is used for trimming and finishing across the grain on a wood lathe.
; Dovetail chisel : made specifically for cutting dovetail joints. The difference being the thickness of the body of the chisel, as well as the angle of the edges, permitting easier access to the joint.
; Butt chisel : short chisel with beveled sides and straight edge for creating joints.
; Carving chisels : used for intricate designs and sculpting; cutting edges are many; such as gouge, skew, parting, straight, paring, and V-groove. 
; Corner chisel : resembles a punch and has an L-shaped cutting edge. Cleans out square holes, mortises and corners with 90 degree angles.
; Flooring chisel : cuts and lifts flooring materials for removal and repair; ideal for tongue-and-groove flooring.
; Framing chisel : usually used with mallet; similar to a butt chisel, except it has a longer, slightly flexible blade.
; Slick : a very large chisel driven by manual pressure, never struck.
; Drawer lock chisel : an all metal chisel with two angled blades used for tight spaces such as cutting out the space for fitting a desk drawer lock.

== Lathe tools ==

Woodturners use a woodworking gouge or chisel designed to cut wood as it is spun on a lathe. These tools have longer handles for more leverage, needed to counteract the tendency of the tool to react to the downward force of the spinning wood being cut or carved. In addition, the angle and method of sharpening is different.

==Metalworking==
Chisels used in metal work can be divided into two main categories: hot chisels and cold chisels.

===Cold chisel===

A cold chisel is a tool made of tempered steel used for cutting &#x27;cold&#x27; metals, meaning that they are not used in conjunction with heating torches, forges, etc. Cold chisels are used to remove waste metal when a very smooth finish is not required or when the work cannot be done easily with other tools, such as a hacksaw, file, bench shears or power tools.

The name cold chisel comes from its use by blacksmiths to cut metal while it was cold as compared to other tools they used to cut hot metal. Because cold chisels are used to form metal, they have a less-acute angle to the sharp portion of the blade than a woodworking chisel. This gives the cutting edge greater strength at the expense of sharpness.

Cold chisels come in a variety of sizes, from fine engraving tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. Cold chisels are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge.
The head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to avoid brittle fracture splintering from hammer blows.

There are four common types of cold chisels. These are the &quot;flat chisel&quot;, the most widely known type, which is used to cut bars and rods to reduce surfaces and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The &quot;cross cut chisel&quot; is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The &quot;round nose chisel&quot; is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The &quot;diamond point chisel&quot; is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.

Although the vast majority of cold chisels are made of steel, a few are manufactured from beryllium copper, for use in special situations where non-sparking tools are required.

Cold chisels are predominantly used in Repoussé and chasing processes for the fabrication of bronze and aluminium sculptures.

===Hot chisel===
A hot chisel is used to cut metal that has been heated in a forge to soften the metal. One type of hot chisel is the &quot;hotcut hardy&quot;, which is used in an anvil hardy hole with the cutting edge facing up. The hot workpiece to be cut is placed over the chisel and struck with a hammer. The hammer drives the workpiece into the chisel, which allows it to be snapped off with a pair of tongs. This tool is also often used in combination with a &quot;top fuller&quot; type of hotcut, when the piece being cut is particularly large.

==Stone==
Stone chisels are used to carve or cut stone, bricks or concrete slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. Sculptors use a &quot;spoon chisel&quot;, which is bent, with the bevel on both sides. To increase the force, stone chisels are often hit with club hammers, a heavier type of hammer.

==Masonry==
Masonry chisels are typically heavy, with a relatively dull head that wedges and breaks, rather than cuts. Often used as a demolition tool, they may be mounted on a hammer drill, jackhammer, or hammered manually, usually with a heavy hammer of three pounds or more. These chisels normally have an SDS, SDS-MAX, or 1-1/8&quot; Hex connection. Types of masonry chisels include the following:

* Moil (point) chisels 
* Flat chisels 
* Asphalt cutters 
* Carbide bushing tools 
* Clay spade 
* Flexible chisels 
* Tamper

A &quot;plugging chisel&quot; has a tapered edge for cleaning out hardened mortar. The chisel is held with one hand and struck with a hammer. The direction of the taper in the blade determines if the chisel cuts deep or runs shallow along the joint.

==Leather==
In leather work, a chisel is a tool used to punch holes in a piece leather. The chisel has between one and seven (or possibly more) tines that are carefully placed along the line where the holes are desired, and then the top of the chisel is struck with a hammer until the tines penetrate the leather. They are then withdrawn, and the leather worker then stitches through the resulting holes.

== Gouge ==

A modern gouge is similar to a chisel except its blade edge is not flat, but instead is curved or angled in cross-section. The modern version is generally hafted inline, the blade and handle typically having the same long axis. If the bevel of the blade is on the outer surface of the curve the gouge is called an &#x27;outcannel&#x27; gouge, otherwise it is known as an &#x27;incannel&#x27; gouge. Gouges with angled rather than curved blades are often called &#x27;V-gouges&#x27; or &#x27;vee-parting tools&#x27;.

The blade geometry is defined by a semi-standardized numbering system that varies by manufacturer and country of origin. For each gouge a &quot;sweep number&quot; is specified that expresses the part of a circle defined by the curve of the blade. The sweep number usually ranges from #1, or flat, up to #9, a semi-circle, with additional specialized gouges at higher numbers, such as the U-shaped #11, and a v-tool or parting tool, which may be an even higher number such as #41. In addition to sweep, gouges are also specified by the distance from one edge of the blade to the other (this corresponds to the chord of the circle section defined by the edge of the blade). Putting these pieces together, two numbers are used to specify the shape of the cutting edge of a gouge, such as a &#x27;#7-20mm&#x27;. Some manufacturers provide charts with the sweeps of their blades shown graphically.
In addition to varying blade sweeps, bevels, and widths, blade variations include:
* &#x27;Crank-neck&#x27; gouges, in which the blade is offset from the handle by a small distance, to allow working flat to a surface
* &#x27;Spoon-bent&#x27; gouges, in which the blade is curved along its length, to allow working in a hollow not otherwise accessible with a straight bladed gouge
* &#x27;Fishtail&#x27; gouges, in which the blade is very narrow for most of its length and then broadens out near the working edge, to allow working in tight spaces.
All of these specialized gouges allow a craftsperson to cut into areas that may not be possible with a regular, straight-bladed gouge.

The cutting shape of a gouge may also be held in an adze, roughly as the shape of a modern-day mattock.

Gouges are used in woodworking and arts. For example, a violin luthier uses gouges to carve the violin, a cabinetmaker may use it for running flutes or paring curves, or an artist may produce a piece of art by cutting some bits out of a sheet of linoleum (see also Linocut).

Gouges were found at a number of historic Bronze Age hoards found in Great Britain.

<doc id="133926" wikidata="Q3210905" url="?curid=133926" title="Death (tarot card)">
<text>Death (XIII) is the 13th trump or Major Arcana card in most traditional tarot decks. It is used in tarot card games as well as in divination. The card typically depicts the Grim Reaper, and when used for divination is often interpreted as signifying major changes in a person&#x27;s life.

==Description==
Some decks, such as the Tarot of Marseilles and the Visconti Sforza Tarot omit the name from the card, calling it &quot;The Card with No Name&quot;, often with the implication of a broader meaning than literal death. There are other decks that title Death as &quot;Rebirth&quot; or &quot;Death-Rebirth.&quot;

The Death card usually depicts the Grim Reaper, the personification of Death. In some decks, the Grim Reaper is riding a pale horse, and often he is wielding a sickle or scythe. Surrounding the Grim Reaper are dead and dying people from all classes, including kings, bishops and commoners. The Rider–Waite tarot deck depicts the skeleton carrying a black standard emblazoned with The White Rose of York. 

In the background are two towers and a rising sun.

==Examples==
==Interpretation==
According to Eden Gray and other authors on the subject, it is uncommon that this card actually represents a physical death, rather it typically implies an end, possibly of a relationship or interest, and therefore an increased sense of self-awareness.

In fact, Gray interprets this card as a change of thinking from an old way into a new way. The horse Death is riding is stepping over a prone king, which symbolizes that not even royalty can stop change.

The card, drawn in reverse, can be interpreted as stagnation and the inability to move or change, according to Gray.

According to A. E. Waite&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;The Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, the Death card carries several divinatory associations:

In Astrology, the Death card is associated with the fixed-water sign of Scorpio and its ruling planet, Pluto.

==Other versions==

* In the Mythic tarot deck, Death is depicted by Hades.
*In the Sun and Moon tarot deck, Death is depicted as a woman bathed in fire with wings. It is titled &quot;Death-Rebirth&quot;
* In the Star Spinner tarot deck, Death is depicted as Nyx holding her child, Thanatos

<doc id="133927" wikidata="Q1184756" url="?curid=133927" title="Tioga, Pennsylvania">
<text>Tioga is a borough in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 611 at the 2010 census. It is located north of Tioga and Hammond Lakes along the Tioga River.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tioga&quot; is borrowed from Native American tribes who lived in the area at the time of the arrival of European colonists; it means &quot;at the forks&quot;. The various Iroquois tribes all had similar words for the concept: the Oneida called it &quot;Te-ah-o-ge&quot;, the Mohawk called it &quot;Te-yo-ge-ga&quot;, the Cayuga called it &quot;Da-o-ga&quot; and the Seneca called it &quot;Da-yo-o-geh&quot;.

==History==
===Officer hiring controversy===
On July 5, 2022, Officer Timothy Loehmann was sworn in as Tioga&#x27;s only police officer. In 2014, Loehmann, while employed as a police officer in Cleveland, had shot and killed 
12-year-old Tamir Rice who at the time was holding a pellet gun. Loehmann was never charged with a crime, but the incident caused protests. His hiring by Tioga&#x27;s borough council caused a public backlash. A week later the resignations of Loehmann, the borough council president, another council member, the borough attorney, and the borough&#x27;s code enforcement officer were accepted by the borough council. According to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the borough broke the law by failing to perform a proper background check before hiring Loehmann.

An investigation by Spotlight PA later found Loehmann was properly hired, but state law concerning background checks for law enforcement hires lacked the capabilities to flag Loehmann because he had not been previously employed as a law enforcement officer in Pennsylvania. The investigation also found a string of personal disputes between members of the borough government, including the mayor and councilmembers, and contradictory statements from those involved in Loehmann&#x27;s hiring.

<text>Lewisburg is a borough in Union County, Pennsylvania, United States, south by southeast of Williamsport and north of Harrisburg. The population was 5,158 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Union County. Located in central Pennsylvania&#x27;s Susquehanna Valley, on the West Branch Susquehanna River, it is home to Bucknell University. Its 19th-century downtown, centered around Market Street, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lewisburg is the principal city of the Lewisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg–Berwick–Sunbury Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

Lewisburg was founded in 1785 by Ludwig Derr. A settler of the area (since as early as 1763–1769), Derr purchased several tracts of land from the William Penn family and other neighboring landowners, the largest of which was known as &quot;The Prescott&quot;. Having been on the land for such a long time, Derr had befriended the local Native Americans of the area. His relationship with these indigenous peoples was so well founded that, even as many of the other local settlers&#x27; homesteads were routinely sacked by Native Americans, Derr&#x27;s lands remained free from attacks. Subsequently, in 1784, he worked with Samuel Weiser to lay out his combined land tracts, and create Derrstown. The name was later changed to Lewisburgh when Snyder County was created from Union County in 1855 (according to a local Keystone marker sign), but was known on original plans and deeds as Lewisburg before that time.

U.S. Postal Service states that it was named &quot;Lewisburgh&quot; when it was established in 1796; in 1893, the name was shortened to &quot;Lewisburg&quot;.

The origin of the street names that run east-west is also unknown. St. George, St. Catherine, and St. Louis appear to be named for saints. While Lutherans, as was Derr, do recognize historic Catholic saints, the street names are more likely named for Derr&#x27;s family members, whose names happen to coincide with saints. Those streets are consecutively parallel and emanate from what was then Derr&#x27;s home and the location of the first available lot sold (which were both situated on what is now Mill Street). George was Ludwig&#x27;s son, his wife was Catherine, and himself, Ludwig/Lewis/Louis (sic). The other original street names that still exist are St. John, St. Mary and St. Anthony, which may be the names of other children from families with whom Derr&#x27;s own family were friends. However, there is an indication that Derr also had a daughter named Mary. The premise is further supported by the notion that the German word for street is &quot;Strasse&quot; (Straße, abbreviated St). At the time, street names were pronounced as Strasse Mary or Strasse George. Later, when signs were made to note the street names, the abbreviation for Strasse was allowed to remain, but the US/English abbreviation was redundantly added to the signs.

Over the centuries, Lewisburg has been a center of commerce in Union County. The West Branch Susquehanna River was used for logging and shipping, and remains of old factories and other ancient stone structures exist along the river banks. Prior to, and during, the Civil War, many abolitionists lived in the area, and several locations within the town of Lewisburg served as stopping points on the famous Underground Railroad.

The Susquehanna River has flooded on several occasions, notably in 1889, 1936, and 1972. The 1936 flood saw record-high water levels, while after the 1972 flood, the houses that formerly stood where Hufnagle Park is today were demolished.

The Lewisburg Historic District, Chamberlin Iron Front Building, Packwood House-American Hotel, and Reading Railroad Freight Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Historic Market Street is the borough&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

<text>Mifflinburg is a borough in Union County, located in the Susquehanna River Valley of central Pennsylvania, United States. In 1792, Mifflinburg was settled by Elias and Catharina Youngman and 8 other families, many of them German, and the village of Mifflinsburgh (now Mifflinburg) was formed. It was named for Thomas Mifflin, who was governor of Pennsylvania and first governor under the PA Constitution of 1790, and a signer of the U.S. Constitution. Youngmanstown was another name based upon common nemonclature only, but not officially. In 1827, Mifflinburg, a.k.a. Youngmanstown, and another town adjacent to the east named Greenville, a.k.a. Rhodestown, (common nemoncloture), were combined and incorporated into a borough. The first horse drawn buggy and carriage manufacturing company was established in 1845; and Mifflinburg would become the Buggy and carriage manufacturing capital of the United States in the late 19th century. There are many Victorian homes and downtown business buildings. Mifflinburg is known for The Mifflinburg Buggy Museum, Buggy Day, annual authentic Christkindle Market the second weekend of December, and German Oktoberfest.

As of the 2010 census, there were 3,540 people, 1,506 households, and 1,028 families living in the borough. The population density was . There were 1,605 housing units at an average density of . As of 2010, the racial makeup of the borough was 97.5% White alone, 0.9% Hispanic, 0.6% Black alone, 0.5% two or more races, 0.3% Asian alone, 0.08% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone, 0.06% other race alone, and 0.03% American Indian alone.

Major tourist attractions include
* Mifflinburg Buggy Museum, which celebrates the era (circa 1880 - 1915) when Mifflinburg was known as &quot;Buggytown, USA&quot; due to its reputation as a major manufacturer of quality horse-drawn carriages and sleighs
* Annual &quot;Christkindl Market&quot; (a traditional German Christmas festival).

== History ==
The borough is situated on lands that were originally granted in 1769 to the veteran officers who served under Colonel Henry Bouquet during Pontiac&#x27;s War (1763-1766) in lieu of payment for their service and ultimate victory at the Battle of Bushy Run in defense of Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh). In 1782 or 1783, Elias and Catharina Jungman (Youngman) and their children, came from Fort Augusta (now Sunbury) Pennsylvania to the Buffalo Valley with 8 other families to settle on land purchased by Elias from Catharina&#x27;s father, George Nagle. In the summer of 1792, Elias surveyed and divided the land into 60&#x27; by 120&#x27; plots that were sold to other adventurous settlers, many of them German, and the village of Mifflinburg was formed (common nomenclature was attributed to the town being named &quot;Youngmanstown&quot;, as was historically the case, but was Mifflinburg in the deeds as early as 1792). In 1797, George Rote (Rhoade) laid out a village just east of Youngmanstown, known as Greenville or Rotestown (common nomenclature). Eventually, the two settlements joined at Third Street. In 1827, the two villages combined and were incorporated. The combined village was named Mifflinburg, in honor of Thomas Mifflin, the first Governor of Pennsylvania after the 1790 Constitution. The merged towns were known as Mifflinburg before 1827 however, because when Union County was formed from Northumberland County on March 22, 1813, that PA legislative act also established Mifflinburg as the seat of government of the newly formed county, with the first courthouse located at 406 Green Street and other government offices located in various other buildings throughout the town. It remained the county seat until 1815 when it was moved to New Berlin, and then to Lewisburg in 1855 where it remains today.

In 1845, George Swentzel set up Mifflinburg&#x27;s first buggy business. Soon other buggy manufacturers set up their own shops in Mifflinburg, and by 1855, with a population of 800, Mifflinburg hosted thirteen coachmakers. By the 1880s, with more than fifty buggy and sleigh factories, Mifflinburg became known as “Buggy Town” because its buggy makers produced more horse-drawn vehicles per capita than any other town in the state.

The Mifflinburg Historic District, Hassenplug Bridge, and William A. Heiss House and Buggy Shop are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

== History ==
McClintocksville was a small community in Cornplanter Township in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In 1861, it was the site of Wamsutta Oil Refinery, the first business venture of Henry Huttleston Rogers, who became a leading United States capitalist, businessman, industrialist, financier, and philanthropist. Rogers and his young wife Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers lived in a one-room shack there along Oil Creek for several years.

Shortly later, Rogers met oil pioneer Charles Pratt who purchased the entire output of the tiny Wamsutta Oil Refinery. In 1867, Rogers joined Pratt in forming Charles Pratt and Company, which was purchased by Standard Oil in 1874. Rogers became one of the key men in John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust.

After joining Standard Oil, Rogers invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life&#x27;s achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States.

He was also a generous philanthropist, providing many public works for his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts and financially assisting helping such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington.

<text>Franklin is a city in and the county seat of Venango County, Pennsylvania, United States, located at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny River. The population was 6,097 in the 2020 census. Franklin is part of the Oil City micropolitan area.

Franklin is known for its three-day autumn festival in October, Applefest, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.

== History ==

Franklin is located at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny River, an important site used for centuries by Native Americans. They had long before developed what became known as the Venango Path, passing from the head of French Creek north to Presque Isle Bay on Lake Erie. Via French Creek and the Allegheny River, the portage effectively linked the waterways of the Ohio River and the Great Lakes.

In 1740, Scottish fur trader John Fraser built a trading post here at Venango, the Lenape village. The French also had designs on this region.

They wanted to link their colonies of New France (Quebec) north of the Great Lakes, in Illinois Country (accessible via the Ohio River), and La Louisiane, on the lower Mississippi River. As tensions increased between France and Great Britain prior to the onset of the French and Indian War (as the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War was called), the French constructed four forts to control their continued access to the Venango Path and these important waterways. From north to south they were Fort Presque Isle, Fort Le Boeuf (at the south end of the portage and head of French Creek), Fort Machault, and Fort Duquesne, at the Forks of the Ohio.

In December 1753, George Washington, then a 21-year-old major in the Virginia militia, was sent to Fort Le Boeuf to warn the French that they were trespassing on British land and should leave. Although providing respite to Washington and his party, the fort commander gave him a letter suggesting that the Governor of Virginia should instead deliver his message to the French commander in Quebec, New France.

The French maintained this and their other three forts, including at Fort Machault until July 1759, when they surrendered Fort Niagara to the British. At that time, the commander of Fort Presque Isle sent orders to the commanders of Fort Le Boeuf and Fort Machault to abandon their positions and return north. Before leaving, the French troops burned both of these forts to the ground to prevent their use by the British.

In 1760, the British erected Fort Venango here, replacing Fort Marchault. In 1763, Native Americans allied with the French killed many British. The British colonists had repeatedly attacked even neutral tribes, such as the Lenape, who then mostly allied with the French. After the war, the British Americans constructed Fort Franklin here, named after Benjamin Franklin.

In 1787 Andrew Ellicott, who surveyed Washington, D.C., was hired to lay out the town of Franklin, which had developed around the fort. It became a trading center for a largely rural, agricultural region. Once oil was discovered in the late 19th century in nearby Titusville, Franklin became a booming oil town. After other fields were discovered in Texas and Oklahoma, and oil companies moved west, Franklin developed an industry of machinery companies.

<text>Oil City is the largest city in Venango County, Pennsylvania, United States. Known for its prominence in the initial exploration and development of the petroleum industry, it is located at a bend in the Allegheny River at the mouth of Oil Creek. The population was 9,608 at the 2020 census, and it is the principal city of the Oil City micropolitan area.

Initial settlement of Oil City was sporadic, and tied to the iron industry. After the first oil wells were drilled in 1861, it became central to the petroleum industry while hosting headquarters for the Pennzoil, Quaker State, and Wolf&#x27;s Head motor oil companies. Tourism plays a prominent role in the region by promoting oil heritage sites, nature trails, and Victorian architecture.

==History==


===Cornplanter Tract and Oil Creek Furnace===
In 1796, the state of Pennsylvania gave Cornplanter, chief of the Wolf Band of the Seneca nation, of land along the west bank of the Allegheny River in Warren County, Pennsylvania, as well as a small tract on both sides of the mouth of Oil Creek, in compensation for his services during the American Revolutionary War. The first white settler in what became Oil City was an unknown individual who cleared and farmed about on the west side of Oil Creek upstream from Cornplanter&#x27;s land. Francis Halyday (or Holliday) purchased this land in 1803, and settled there with his family. The first white child known to be born in what became Oil City was James Halyday, born January 13, 1809. Three or four other families soon settled on the east side of the creek above the &quot;Cornplanter Tract&quot;.

Cornplanter sold the eastern half of his tract to two white settlers, William Connely and William Kinnear, in May 1818. Connely sold his quarter of the original tract back to Cornplanter in October 1818, but the land was seized by the county for nonpayment of taxes and sold at auction in November 1819 to Alexander McCalmont. McCalmont sold his land to Mathias Stockberger in the spring of 1824.

On June 25, 1824, Kinnear, Stockerberger, and settler Richard Noyes formed William Kinnear &amp; Co., a company which swiftly erected an iron bloomery, foundry, gristmill, and several warehouses. A mill race provided water power for the furnace. Homes were built for workers, and a steamboat landing constructed on the Allegheny River. This settlement was called Oil Creek Furnace. Settler James Young opened the first general store in town, and operated it in the 1850s.

The original incorporators were bought out by brothers William and Frederick Crary in January 1825. The company was purchased in February 1835 by William Bell, who changed the corporate name to W. Bell &amp; Son. He and his son, Samuel, operated the furnace until 1849, employing about 40 men. The poor quality of iron ore in the area made their operations unprofitable and the furnace closed in 1849. The settlement was soon deserted, except for two families (the Bannons and the Halydays).

===Deserted Oil Creek Furnace===
The bend in the Allegheny River at Oil City slowed the speed of the river&#x27;s waters, providing a spot for barges and rafts to land easily. For many years, the Bannons and Halydays rented rooms in their homes and space in their barns to bargemen and rafters using the landing at Oil Creek Furnace. About 1852 or 1853, Thomas Moran settled in the area and built a large inn (Moran House) next to the Bannon home. It proved popular and soon expanded, and became a local landmark. Samuel Hopewell opened a second inn shortly after Moran, and in the fall 1852 his brother, John P. Hopewell, opened a third inn and a new general store on Main Street. Settler Hiram Gordon opened the Red Lion, the area&#x27;s first saloon, about the same time Hopewell&#x27;s store began operation. Located near the mouth of Oil Creek, the saloon provided live entertainment. In June 1856, of the property was sold by the Bell heirs to Graff, Hasson &amp; Company. James Hasson, son William Hasson, and William&#x27;s family took up residence on the tract and began farming.

Although the village of Oil Creek Furnace was largely deserted, settlement continued in the area. On August 6, 1840, Benjamin Thompson patented nearly all of what is now Oil City east of Oil Creek and north of the Allegheny. This land was quickly subdivided and sold to other settlers. With the death of his mother in 1844, James Halyday sold his land about 1846 to Dr. John Nevins and several other settlers. Nevins was a physician, the first to practice medicine in the area. James Hollis patented of land on the south side of the Allegheny River in 1851, and purchased the remainder of Thompson&#x27;s land on January 3, 1853. Hollis, in turn, sold all his land on April 25 to Henry Bastian.

===Laytonia, Cottage Hill, Imperial City, and Leetown===
Edwin L. Drake drilled the first commercially successful oil well in nearby Titusville on August 27, 1859. Oil was struck on the Downing farm south of the river by Phillips &amp; Vanusdall in April 1861. Oil City had fewer than six families living there in 1859. The discovery of oil changed that. By 1868, a number of boomtowns had emerged in the region, including Oil City, Petroleum Center, Pithole, Rynd Farm, and Titusville. By 1860, the oil trade was far and away the dominant industry in the Oil City area. A machine shop (which constructed pipe fittings), warehouses, and other industrial structures were built on the west side of Oil Creek. Barges were used to transport oil down Oil Creek and into Oil City, where it was transferred to steamboats or bulk barges to continue on to Pittsburgh and other locations.

In 1859, Nevins sold his property to the Michigan Rock Oil Company, which built Main Avenue, platted an unnamed town around it, and erected a few buildings. On March 26, 1863, Henry Bastian sold his land to William L. Lay, who established a ferry near what is now the foot of Central Avenue. He platted a town of 80 lots near his ferry&#x27;s landing on the south shore, and named the town Laytonia (sometimes referred to as &quot;Laytona&quot; or &quot;Latona&quot;). The same year, Charles Haines and Joseph Martin bought out the Hassons (who had continued to farm their land), and graded Grove Avenue. The two built a number of homes along the street, calling their settlement Cottage Hill. The United Petroleum Farms Association purchased part of Cottage Hill as well as an adjoining in 1864. The company subdivided the land into lots and swiftly built homes here.

In 1865, Vandergrift, Forman &amp; Company, a petroleum exploration firm, bought the property of a number of settlers around the north landing of Lay&#x27;s Ferry and established a town the company called Imperial City. West of Laytonia, Charles Lee established a settlement called Leetown.

===Founding of Oil City===
In 1862, residents in the area obtained a charter from the state, uniting the area north of the river as a borough named Oil City. South of the river, in particular, growth continued to be haphazard. Streets there often did not match up, hindering transportation. Residents realized that there were too many names in use for this area, which was causing problems. In 1866, the citizens of the borough south of the river petitioned Judge William G. Trunkey to give their borough a common name. He selected Venango City. By 1866, Venango City had a population of more than 1,500, and more than 4,500 people lived in Oil City.

Oil City began platting extensive areas of land between 1869 and 1872. This included the upper and lower south side, Palace Hill, upper Cottage Hill and Clark&#x27;s Summit. A long funicular ascended the high hill. Built in 1872, the Panic of 1873 devastated home sales on Clark&#x27;s Summit. The funicular company went bankrupt, and the track was removed in 1879. In 1869, Thomas Martindale opened the first health food store in Oil City, thought to be the first natural foods store in the United States.

By 1870, residents of Oil City and Venango City desired unification of their joint, growing metropolis. They sought a town charter from the state, which was granted by the legislature on March 3, 1871. Oil City was the name of the unified boroughs. The first Oil City elections were held in April, and the first mayor, William M. Williams, and 12-member city council sworn in on April 11, completing the act of incorporation. Oil City replaced her charter with a new one in January 1881 after the state implemented a new township charter law. A city hall was erected later that year on Seneca Street.

===Post-charter Oil City===
The city was partially destroyed by flood in 1865 and by both flood and fire in 1866 and again in 1892; on this last occasion, several oil tanks that were struck by lightning gave way, and Oil Creek carried a mass of burning oil into the city, where some 60 people died and property valued at more than $1 million was destroyed. Oil City grew into a thriving community through the later half of the 19th century and into the 20th century. By the 1990s, Pennzoil, Quaker State, and Wolf&#x27;s Head had all relocated their headquarters elsewhere. However, some oil wells continue to produce a steady supply of quality petroleum.

Regional governments and public organizations promote tourism by thoroughly educating the public about oil history. Oil City&#x27;s location along the Allegheny River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains provides excellent opportunities for exploring Northwestern Pennsylvania.

The Oil City Downtown Commercial Historic District, Oil City North Side Historic District, Oil City South Side Historic District, National Transit Building, and Oil City Armory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Oil City, Pennsylvania is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Oil Creek at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.65%) is water.

Many layers of rock and sedimentary material containing fossils can be seen on the bluffs in and around Oil City. Oil City is framed by the surrounding foothills with the Allegheny River winding through downtown.

The Allegheny River and Oil Creek freeze occasionally during the winter, sometimes causing ice jams; although remediation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has reduced ice formation via a floating ice control structure on the river and a fixed concrete weir on the banks of the creek. Flooding of the river flats is a possibility throughout the year due to ice jams, excessive snow melt, large volume storms and hurricane or tropical storm remnants.

The Oil City Oilers were a Minor League Baseball team located in Oil City, Pennsylvania between 1940 and 1951. The team played in the Pennsylvania State Association from 1940 to 1942, and later moved to the Middle Atlantic League after World War II ended. The team began in 1940 when the Pittsburgh Pirates relocated their affiliate, the McKeesport Little Braves, to Oil City. The team stayed affiliated with the Pirates until 1947, when it began an affiliation with the Chicago White Sox. That year, the team&#x27;s name was changed to the Oil City Refiners. The team&#x27;s name was changed one last time to the Oil City A&#x27;s, when they merged with the Youngstown A&#x27;s, in 1951. The team then folded, along with the league, at the end of that season.

The Oilers name originated from the Oil City Oilers earlier team that represented the city in the 1895 and 1898 Iron And Oil League and the Oil City Cubs, who played as members of the Interstate League from 1906 to 1908.

<text>Brokenstraw Township is a township in Warren County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was formed in 1800. The population was 1,726 at the 2020 census, down from 1,884 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (0.41%) is water.

== History ==
In 1797, 22-year-old Callender Irvine, the United States Army&#x27;s Commissary General, and son of General William Irvine, settled in Brokenstraw Township. He &quot;reported that there were more Indians in the area then than whites.&quot;

Callender built a &quot;stately white mansion ... on the banks of the Allegheny in 1822,&quot; overlooking Crull&#x27;s Island. &quot;Callender Irvine&#x27;s brother, Dr. John W. Irvine shared in the management of the [general] store, along with Robinson R. Moore, until 1820, after which he practiced medicine in Brokenstraw.&quot;

William A. Irvine, M.D., another son of Callender&#x27;s, settled in Brokenstraw in 1825, and
 spent his life attempting to turn the Irvine property to profitable commercial ventures. Among his many enterprises were a lumbering business, the general store started by his father, a wool factory, an iron foundry, and further speculation ... his farm, internal improvements ... the blacksmith shop ... and the Irvine post office. In the mid-1850s, Irvine was forced to give up most of his business, retaining the farm, the lumbering concern, and land on which he later developed oil.

His wife was Sarah Duncan Irvine; their daughter was Sarah Irvine Newbold.
The mansion and property were known locally as the &quot;Irving Estate&quot; or &quot;Newbold Estate.&quot; Esther Newbold, great-granddaughter of Callender, was the last generation of the family to live in the mansion. She &quot;had studied law in Philadelphia and was known for keeping up on legislative matters in Harrisburg.&quot; Esther died in 1963 at almost 90 years of age, and the home was razed ten years later, in 1973.

A model of the house was made for the nearby Clinton E. Wilder Museum.

== Municipalities ==

<text>The Transit system, also known as NAVSAT or NNSS (for &quot;Navy Navigation Satellite System&quot;), was the first satellite navigation system to be used operationally. The radio navigation system was primarily used by the U.S. Navy to provide accurate location information to its Polaris ballistic missile submarines, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy&#x27;s surface ships, as well as for hydrographic survey and geodetic surveying. Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well. In the Project DAMP Program, the missile tracking ship USAS American Mariner also used data from the satellite for precise ship&#x27;s location information prior to positioning its tracking radars.

== History ==


The Transit satellite system, sponsored by the Navy and developed jointly by DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kershner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite-based geopositioning system. Just days after the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first man-made Earth-orbiting satellite on October 4, 1957, two physicists at APL, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, found themselves in discussion about the radio signals that would likely be emanating from the satellite. They were able to determine Sputnik&#x27;s orbit by analyzing the Doppler shift of its radio signals during a single pass. Discussing the way forward for their research, their director Frank McClure, the chairman of APL&#x27;s Research Center, suggested in March 1958 that if the satellite&#x27;s position were known and predictable, the Doppler shift could be used to locate a receiver on Earth, and proposed a satellite system to implement this principle.

Development of the Transit system began in 1958, and a prototype satellite, Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960, by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The first successful tests of the system were made in 1960, and the system entered Naval service in 1964. A fully operational constellation of 36 satellites was in place in 1968.

The Chance Vought/LTV Scout rocket was selected as the dedicated launch vehicle for the program because it delivered a payload into orbit for the lowest cost per pound. However, the Scout decision imposed two design constraints. First, the weight of the earlier satellites was about each, but the Scout launch capacity to the Transit orbit was about , which was later increased significantly. A satellite mass reduction had to be achieved, despite a demand for more power than APL had previously designed into a satellite. The second problem concerned the increased vibration that affected the payload during launching because the Scout used solid rocket motors. Thus, electronic equipment that was smaller than before and rugged enough to withstand the increased vibration of launch had to be produced.
Meeting the new demands was more difficult than expected, but it was accomplished. The first prototype operational satellite (Transit 5A-1) was launched into a polar orbit by a Scout rocket on 18 December 1962.
The satellite verified a new technique for deploying the solar panels and for separating from the rocket, but otherwise it was not successful because of trouble with the power system. Transit 5A-2, launched on 5 April 1963, failed to achieve orbit. Transit 5A-3, with a redesigned power supply, was launched on 15 June 1963. A malfunction of the memory occurred during powered flight that kept it from accepting and storing the navigation message, and the oscillator stability was degraded during launch. Thus, 5A-3 could not be used for navigation. However, this satellite was the first to achieve gravity-gradient stabilization, and its other subsystems performed well.

Surveyors used Transit to locate remote benchmarks by averaging dozens of Transit fixes, producing sub-meter accuracy. In fact, the elevation of Mount Everest was corrected in the late 1980s by using a Transit receiver to re-survey a nearby benchmark.

Thousands of warships, freighters and private watercraft used Transit from 1967 until 1991. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started launching their own satellite navigation system &quot;Parus&quot; (military) / Tsikada (civilian), which is still in use today besides the next generation GLONASS. Some Soviet warships were equipped with Motorola NavSat receivers.

The Transit system was made obsolete by the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996. Improvements in electronics allowed GPS receivers to effectively take several fixes at once, greatly reducing the complexity of deducing a position. GPS uses many more satellites than were used with Transit, allowing the system to be used continuously, while Transit provided a fix only every hour or more.

After 1996, the satellites were kept in use for the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS).

== Description ==

===Satellites===
The satellites (known as OSCAR or NOVA satellites) used in the system were placed in low polar orbits, at an altitude of about , with an orbital period of about 106 minutes. A &quot;constellation&quot; of five satellites was required to provide reasonable global coverage. While the system was operational, at least ten satellites – one spare for each satellite in the basic constellation – were usually kept in orbit. Note that these &quot;OSCAR&quot; satellites were not the same as the OSCAR series of satellites that were devoted to use by amateur radio operators to use in satellite communications. 

The orbits of the Transit satellites were chosen to cover the entire Earth; they crossed over the poles and were spread out at the equator. Since only one satellite was usually visible at any given time, fixes could be made only when one of the satellites was above the horizon. At the equator this delay between fixes was several hours; at mid-latitudes the delay decreased to an hour or two. For its intended role as an updating system for SLBM launch, Transit sufficed, since submarines took periodic fixes to reset their inertial guidance system, but Transit lacked the ability to provide high-speed, real-time position measurements.

With later improvements, the system provided single-pass accuracy of roughly , and also provided time synchronization to roughly 50 microseconds. Transit satellites also broadcast encrypted messages, although this was a secondary function.

The Transit satellites used arrays of magnetic-core memory as mass data storage up to 32 kilobytes.

===Determining ground location===

Determining a location, also known as &quot;taking a fix&quot;, normally requires two or more measurements to be taken to produce a 2D location. In the case of the modern GPS system, dozens of such measurements may be taken depending on which satellites are visible at that time, each one helping improve accuracy. In the case of Transit, only a small number of satellites were in orbit and were spread out. This generally meant there was only one satellite visible at any time. Some other method of determining a second measurement was needed.

Transit did this by measuring the signal&#x27;s Doppler shift. The spacecraft traveled at about , which could increase or decrease the frequency of the received carrier signal by as much as 10 kHz as measured on the ground. While the satellite is approaching the ground station its signals will be shifted up in frequency, and as it recedes they will shift down again. The precise moment when the frequency is exactly equal to the broadcast frequency is when the satellite&#x27;s ground track passes the ground location&#x27;s location (with some corrections). This provides one of the two measurements needed.

For the second measure, one has to consider the pattern of the Doppler shift. If the satellite passes directly overhead, its angular velocity as it passes will be more than if it passes to one side. In the extreme case, with a satellite near the horizon, the relative velocity change is minimized. Thus the rapidity of the change in frequency is an indication of the relative longitude between the station and the satellite. Additionally, the rotation of the Earth provided another Doppler correction which could be used to determine whether the satellite was to the east or west of the ground station.

These measurements produce a relative location compared to the satellite. To determine the actual location, that relative measure is applied to the location of the satellite. This is provided by periodically sending out precise time hacks (every two minutes), plus the satellite&#x27;s six orbital elements and orbit perturbation variables. The ground receiver downloaded these signals and calculated the location of the satellite while it was measuring the shifts. The orbit ephemeris and clock corrections were uploaded twice each day to each satellite from one of the four Navy tracking and injection stations.

The Transit satellite broadcast on 150 and 400 MHz. The two frequencies were used to allow the refraction of the satellite radio signals by the ionosphere to be canceled out, thereby improving location accuracy. The Transit system also provided the first worldwide timekeeping service, allowing clocks everywhere to be synchronised with 50 microsecond accuracy.

Calculating the most likely receiver location was not a trivial exercise. The navigation software used the satellite&#x27;s motion to compute a &#x27;trial&#x27; Doppler curve, based on an initial &#x27;trial&#x27; location for the receiver. The software would then perform a least squares curve fit for each two-minute section of the Doppler curve, recursively moving the trial position until the trial Doppler curve &#x27;most closely&#x27; matched the actual Doppler received from the satellite for all two-minute curve segments.

If the receiver was also moving relative to the earth, such as aboard a ship or airplane, this would cause mismatches with the idealized Doppler curves, and degrade position accuracy. However, positional accuracy could usually be computed to within 100 meters for a slow-moving ship, even with reception of just one two-minute Doppler curve. This was the navigation criterion demanded by the U.S. Navy, since American submarines would normally expose their UHF antenna for only 2 minutes to obtain a usable Transit fix. The U.S. submarine version of the Transit system also included a special encrypted, more accurate version of the downloaded satellite&#x27;s orbital data. This enhanced data allowed for considerably enhanced system accuracy [not unlike Selective Availability (SA) under GPS]. Using this enhanced mode, accuracy was typically less than 20 meters, (i.e. the accuracy was between that of LORAN C and GPS) For a typical 12 - 15 minute high satellite altitude pass accuracy was under ten meters. Certainly, Transit was the most accurate navigation system of its day.

The basic operating principle of Transit is similar to the system used by emergency locator transmitters (ELTs), except that in the latter case the transmitter is on the ground and the receiver is in orbit. ELTs measure the Doppler shift of the transmitter on the boat or aircraft as it passes overhead and forwards that data to the ground where the location of the craft can be determined.

===Determining the satellite orbits===
A network of ground stations, whose locations were accurately known, continually tracked the Transit satellites. They measured the Doppler shift and transferred the data to 5-hole paper tape. This data was sent to the Satellite Control Center at Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland using commercial and military teleprinter networks. The data from the fixed ground stations provided the location information on the Transit satellite orbit. Locating a Transit satellite in earth orbit from a known ground station using the Doppler shift is simply the reverse of using the known location of the satellite in orbit to locate an unknown location on the earth, again using the Doppler shift.

A typical ground station occupied a small Quonset hut. The accuracy of the ground station measurements was a function of the ground station master clock accuracy. Initially a quartz oscillator in a temperature controlled oven was used as the master clock. The master clock was checked daily for drift using a VLF receiver tuned to a US Navy VLF station. The VLF signal had the property that the phase of the VLF signal did not change from day to day at noon along the path between the transmitter and the receiver and thus could be used to measure oscillator drift. Later rubidium and cesium beam clocks were used. Ground stations had number names; for example, Station 019 was McMurdo Station, Antarctica. For many years during the 1970s this station was staffed by a graduate student and an undergraduate student, typically in electrical engineering, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other stations were located at New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Sicily, Japan, Seychelles Island, Thule Greenland and a number of other locations. The Greenland and Antarctica stations saw every pass of every Transit satellite because of their near pole location for these polar orbiting satellites.

===Portable Geoceiver=== 
A portable version of the ground station was called a Geoceiver and was used to make field measurements. This receiver, power supply, punched tape unit, and antennas could fit in a number of padded aluminum cases and could be shipped as extra cargo on an airline. Data was taken over a period of time, typically a week, and sent back to the Satellite Control Center for processing. Therefore, unlike GPS, there was not an immediate accurate location of the Geoceiver location. A Geoceiver was permanently located at the South Pole Station and operated by United States Geological Survey personnel. Since it was located on the surface of a moving ice sheet, its data was used to measure the ice sheet movement. Other Geoceivers were taken out in the field in Antarctica during the summer and were used to measure locations, for example the movement of the Ross Ice Shelf.

=== The AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130) Computer ===
Since no computer small enough to fit through a submarine&#x27;s hatch existed (in 1958), a new computer was designed, named the AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130). It was built with rounded corners to fit through the hatch and was about five feet tall and sealed to be waterproof. The principal design engineer was then-UCLA-faculty-member Lowell Amdahl, brother of Gene Amdahl. The AN/UYK-1 was built by the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (later TRW) for the &quot;Lafayette&quot; class SSBNs. It was equipped with 8,192 words of 15-bit core memory plus parity bit, threaded by hand at their Canoga Park factory. Cycle time was about one microsecond. The AN/UYK-1 weighed about .

The AN/UYK-1 was a microprogrammed machine with a 15-bit word length that lacked hardware commands to subtract, multiply or divide, but could add, shift, form ones&#x27; complement, and test the carry bit. Instructions to perform standard fixed and floating point operations were software subroutines and programs were lists of links and operators to those subroutines. For example, the &quot;subtract&quot; subroutine had to form the ones&#x27; complement of the subtrahend and add it. Multiplication required successive shifting and conditional adding.

In the AN/UYK-1 instruction set, the machine-language instructions had two operators that could simultaneously manipulate the arithmetic registersfor example, complementing the contents of one register while loading or storing another. It may have been the first computer that implemented a single-cycle indirect addressing ability.

During a satellite pass, a GE receiver would receive the orbital parameters and encrypted messages from the satellite, as well as measure the Doppler-shifted frequency at intervals and provide this data to the AN/UYK-1 computer. The computer would also receive from the ship&#x27;s inertial navigation system (SINS) a reading of latitude and longitude. Using this information the AN/UYK-1 ran a least squares algorithm and provided a location reading in about fifteen minutes.

== Other satellites ==

There were 41 satellites in the Transit series that were assigned the Transit name by NASA.

Transit 3B demonstrated uploading programs into the onboard computer&#x27;s memory whilst in orbit.

Transit 4A, launched June 29, 1961, was the first satellite to use a radioactive power source (RTG) (a SNAP-3). Transit 4B (1961) also had a SNAP-3 RTG. Transit 4B was among several satellites which were inadvertently damaged or destroyed in a nuclear explosion, specifically the United States Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test on July 9, 1962 and subsequent radiation belt.

Transit 5A3 and Transit 5B-1 (1963) each had a SNAP-3 RTG.

Transit 5B-2 (1963) had a SNAP-9A RTG.

In 1964, a rocket failed to boost Transit 5BN-3 with a SNAP-9A RTG into orbit. It &quot;burned up during re-entry and ablated into small particles&quot; together with its approximately 1 kilogram of Plutonium-238.

Transit 5B-5 resumed communicating again after an extended period of inactivity (a zombie satellite).

Transit-9 and 5B4 (1964) and Transit-5B7 and 5B6 (1965) each had &quot;a nuclear power source&quot;.

The US Air Force also periodically launched short lived satellites equipped with radio beacons of 162 MHz and 324 MHz at much lower orbits to study orbital drag. The Transit ground tracking stations tracked these satellites as well, locating the satellites within their orbits using the same principles. The satellite location data was used to collect orbital drag data, including variations in the upper atmosphere and the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field.

Beacon Explorer-A and Beacon Explorer-B also carried Transit-compatible transmitters.

<text>Warren is a city in and the county seat of Warren County, Pennsylvania, United States, located along the Allegheny River. The population was 9,404 at the 2020 census. It is home to the headquarters of the Allegheny National Forest and the Cornplanter State Forest. It is also the headquarters for the Chief Cornplanter Council, the oldest continuously chartered Boy Scouts of America Council, and the catalog company Blair. Warren is the principal city of the Warren micropolitan area.

==History==

Warren was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the Seneca nation. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as France&#x27;s in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Companyand the first of these was buried in Warren but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the French and Indian War.

After the Revolutionary War, General William Irvine and Andrew Ellicott were sent to the area to lay out a town in 1795. It was named after Major General Joseph Warren.

The first permanent structure in Warren, a storehouse built by the Holland Land Company, was completed in 1796. Daniel McQuay of Ireland was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent.

Lumber was the main industry from 1810–1840, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh.

David Beaty discovered oil in Warren in 1875 while drilling for natural gas in his wife&#x27;s flower garden. Oil came to dominate the city&#x27;s economy. Many of the town&#x27;s large Victorian homes were built with revenue generated by the local oil and timber industries.

Pittsburgh-Des Moines, which was formerly located in Warren, manufactured the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Pittsburgh-Des Moines (PDM) also made railroad car tanks, storage tanks and other plate work. Several miniature replicas are located within the county, including one at the new visitors center on Routes US 6 and US 62 next to the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

Warren has struggled through hard economic times and a steady decline in population, which peaked at nearly 15,000 in 1940. The city is attempting to bounce back with the Impact Warren project, a riverfront development project in downtown Warren. The completed project will include new townhouses and senior citizen housing, retail and commercial development, a parking garage, convention center and bus depot.

Major employers include Walmart, the United Refining Company (gas supplier for Kwik Fill and Red Apple Food Mart gas stations), Allegheny National Forest, Northwest Bank, Whirley-Drinkworks, Superior Tire and Rubber Corp, Pennsylvania General Energy, Betts Industries, Inc, Blair Corporation, Sheetz, and Interlectric.

The Warren Historic District, A.J. Hazeltine House, John P. Jefferson House, Struthers Library Building, Warren Armory, Warren County Courthouse, Wetmore House, Guy Irvine House. and Woman&#x27;s Club of Warren are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>California is a borough on the Monongahela River in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,479 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

When founded in 1849, the town was named California, though Columbia and Sagamore were names that were also suggested for the new town. The town&#x27;s founding coincided with the California Gold Rush and the town was named after the state to symbolize growth and prosperity. Before there were mayors in California, there were burgesses, the first of whom was Solomon Sibbitt.

East Pike Run Township merged with California Borough in 1953. The former Vigilant Mine in California once produced the largest single lump of coal in the world. California was once home to the largest soft coal mine in the world when Vesta # 4 opened in 1893. The unincorporated town of Philipsburg used to sit on land that is now occupied by Pennsylvania Western University (formerly known as California University of Pennsylvania before July 2022). This includes the Philipsburg Cemetery, which is still in use and includes a number of graves of Civil War soldiers. The first house built in California is next to the California Post Office on Second Street.

The Molly Fleming House, Jennings-Gallagher House, Malden Inn, Old Main, California State College and former Pennsylvania Railroad Passenger Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The California Boatyards played an important role in building steamboats for western expansion.

<text>Canonsburg is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States, southwest of Pittsburgh. The population was 9,735 at the 2020 census. Canonsburg was laid out by Colonel John Canon in 1789 and incorporated in 1802. The town lies in a rich coal district, and most of the town&#x27;s work force once worked in local steel mills or coal mines. Interstate 79 and U.S. Route 19 pass through the town, as does the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad. A trolley used to operate from Washington, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh through the borough until 1953.

The town is home to Sarris Candies and All-Clad Metalcrafters, makers of cookware and other bonded metals. It is adjacent to the Southpointe office park located in Cecil Township, which has a number of large corporate tenants. Yenko Chevrolet, one of largest and most notable custom muscle car shops of the late-1960s and early-1970s, was also located in Canonsburg. Canonsburg is home to the Pittsburgh Cougars junior hockey league team.

The second-largest Fourth of July parade in the state of Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia, is held in Canonsburg. In the weeks leading up to the parade, the town frequently gains media attention for its residents setting up folding chairs along the town&#x27;s main street to stake claim to prime viewing areas. Additionally, Canonsburg is host to an annual Oktoberfest. In the television series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the town is featured in the episode &quot;Monster Movie&quot;, which is set in the borough during the Oktoberfest celebration.

Sometime prior to May 1780, Colonel John Canon, a common miller who served as justice of the Virginia courts at Fort Pitt, purchased some land around Chartiers Creek from the state of Virginia. The state had claimed what is now southwestern Pennsylvania in a dispute that would not finally be settled until later in the decade. In 1781 Pennsylvania carved Washington County out of Westmoreland County, and the county seat was established at Washington. The notes of the first session of the Washington County Court during that year indicate a call for a road from Canon&#x27;s mill to Pittsburgh. The road to Pittsburgh, called Pitt Street, remains in part today as an archaic and indirect route to the city. The first surviving plat of the town is from April 15, 1788. Lots were sold around Canon&#x27;s property, and the emerging town took the name of Canonsburg shortly thereafter.

Many of the participants in the Whiskey Rebellion in July 1794 were residents of present-day Washington County, which includes Canonsburg. Some of the insurrectionists are believed to have gathered in the town&#x27;s Black Horse Tavern. However, records do not indicate whether any Canonsburg residents participated in any of the violent acts which occurred during the rebellion.

===19th century===
The town was the site of the first institution of higher learning west of the Allegheny Mountains, Jefferson College. Founded in 1802, it was the eleventh such institution in the United States. The Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa Psi fraternities were both founded at Jefferson College. Phi Gamma Delta, of whom President Calvin Coolidge was a member, was founded in 1848. Phi Kappa Psi, of whom President Woodrow Wilson and over 100 U.S. Congressmen claim membership, was founded in 1852. The school would go on to become Washington &amp; Jefferson College in nearby Washington.

For generations, Jefferson College financially supported Canonsburg by accounting for much of its income. In 1868, however, the college was moved to nearby Washington, leaving behind empty college rooming and boarding houses, known as the &quot;forts&quot;. Canonsburg&#x27;s largest financial draw having left, it would take the introduction of the railroad system to return the city to its former glory. The railroad system, on its way from Mansfield (Carnegie) to Washington (See: Chartiers Branch), was fully operational, as scheduled, on May 18, 1871. The first scheduled train departed from the Washington depot carrying &quot;borough authorities, the committee of arrangement and reception, as well as Rankin’s Cornet Band and a number of…prominent citizens who had been invited to join the excursion.&quot; They traveled to Mansfield, where they waited for the special to arrive from Pittsburgh. The special had 12 coaches pulled by two locomotives and was filled with a large number of dignitaries, most especially the mayors of Pittsburgh and Allegheny. The special then made it down the newly laid tracks, passing stations full of spectators to cheer on the train. Canonsburg had a large crowd of supporters, and many people climbed aboard the train to ride along to Washington. There, led by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Great Western Band, the crowd marched to Town Hall for a round of speeches. The Washington Reporter editor pronounced the day &quot;a grand success.&quot;

===20th century===
In 1903, the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company linked the two towns with a trolley line. The company was bought by the &quot;Philadelphia Company&quot; in 1906, later becoming part of the Pittsburgh Railway Company, linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their interurban service in 1909. The line closed on August 29, 1953, with the last three trolley cars travelling south through Canonsburg to the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in 1954 shortly before the track was removed.

In 1911, South Canonsburg was annexed. On August 26, 1911, 26 people were killed in the Canonsburg Opera House disaster. A false shout of &quot;fire&quot; triggered a panic that killed twenty-six people.

The Canonsburg Armory, Hawthorne School and Roberts House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Standard Chemical Company operated a radium refining mill from 1911 to 1922 on a plot of land. From 1930 to 1942, the company purified uranium ore. Marie Curie was invited to the United States in 1921 and was given an honorary degree by the University of Pittsburgh, and one gram of radium.

From 1942 to 1957, Vitro Manufacturing Company refined uranium and other rare metals from various ores and onsite residues, government-owned uranium ore, process concentrates, and scrap materials. The government bought the uranium ore from Vitro and used it in the Manhattan Project. Waste from incomplete extraction and other metallurgical processes accumulated during the site&#x27;s long history. About 11,600 tons of mill tailings were moved to railroad property near Blairsville between 1956 and 1957. After the closure of Vitro, the site was used by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The site was then used by the Canonsburg Pottery Company, operated by the George Family, for land and clay.

The Canonsburg mill site was designated in the 1978 Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act as eligible for federal funds for clean up. It was the only uranium mill east of the Mississippi River to receive funds. In a $48 million cleanup project, the mill site and 163 nearby properties in Canonsburg were remediated. Residual radioactivity was consolidated into a covered, clay-lined cell at the Canonsburg mill site, which is fenced and posted.

==Culture==
===Fourth of July Parade===

The Canonsburg Fourth of July Parade is a parade through Canonsburg celebrating Independence Day. It is the second-largest Fourth of July parade in Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia, despite Canonsburg having only 8,992 residents. 50,000 to 60,000 people usually attend. The parade starts on Morganza Road and runs down the length of Pike Street, heading westward, for approximately 1.5 miles.

The parade begins at 10:00 am on the Fourth of July. Parade members include high school and other marching bands from Washington County and the surrounding areas, local sports teams and cheerleaders of all ages, fire trucks, emergency responders, shriners, unicyclists, jugglers, pipers, polka bands, various church groups, members of the VFW, local politicians, and the mayor of Canonsburg. Some groups throw candy to the children along the parade route, and others pass out water bottles.

After the parade, the day&#x27;s festivities continue with food, concerts, events in Canonsburg Town Park, and family entertainment throughout the day. The day ends with fireworks launched near Canon-McMillan Memorial Stadium.

The parade is perhaps regionally best known for the long-standing tradition of enthusiasts placing chairs, benches, and beach chairs along the parade route to reserve their seats, sometimes a week or more ahead of the parade. This has caused controversy among some residents and business owners, but the tradition continues to this day. The seat saving ritual has attracted the attention of CNN, Jay Leno, and David Letterman.

===Black Horse Tavern===
Black Horse Tavern was founded in 1794, on the road between Budd&#x27;s Ferry on the Youghiogheny River to McFarlen&#x27;s Ferry on Monongahela River. Some sources identify the Black Horse Tavern as the birthplace of the Whiskey Rebellion. Other sources are less certain on the role of the tavern in the rebellion, ascribing the tavern&#x27;s prominent role in the Whiskey Rebellion to &quot;local tradition.&quot; By 1795, a &quot;nailing business&quot; was started at the location. In 1910, the remains of the tavern were removed to make room for the new Canonsburg High School.

<text>Charleroi ( ) is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Monongahela River, 21 miles south of Pittsburgh. Charleroi was settled in 1890 and incorporated in 1891. The 2020 census recorded a population of 4,210.

Reduced industrial activities in the region led to a decreasing population. The steel-making industry was supported by cheap transportation on the Monongahela River from upstream of Charleroi into northern West Virginia and north as well as downstream past McKeesport to the mouth of the Monongahela in Pittsburgh.

Colloquially, the stretch from Charleroi north to McKeesport (historically because of press coverage of High School sports leagues), is known as the &quot;Mon Valley,&quot; and has been extended by some to mean from the river mouth to northern West Virginia. Once dubbed &quot;Magic City,&quot; Charleroi has in recent years seen a gradual revitalization of its business district.

== History ==
Charleroi got its name from the Belgian city of Charleroi. Many Belgian immigrants lived in the Monongahela area at the end of the 19th century, some of whom were glass makers.

The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, now PPG Industries, had one of its major factories located at the current chamber plaza, at one point employing up to a thousand employees, making it one of the largest glass factories in the world at the time. For years it was the home to one of Corning Glass Companies leading employers. It is home to Corelle Brands, which makes Pyrex. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of Pyrex products, Charleroi renamed itself &quot;Pyrex, PA&quot; for 100 days in 2015.

Charleroi was home to one of the first movie theatres in the nation, the Electric Theatre at 520 McKean Avenue, which opened in October 1905 and has since been demolished. The Charleroi Historic District, First National Bank of Charleroi and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2020, Paul Magnette, mayor of Charleroi (Belgium) visited the town that was founded by migrants from his city.

==History==

===Origins of the township===
The township was named after Peter Chartier, a trapper of French and Shawnee parentage who established a Pekowi Shawnee community in this area in 1734. In April 1745, Chartier and the Shawnees abandoned the town when the Pennsylvania provincial council indicted him for treason after he defied Governor Patrick Gordon over the sale of rum to the Shawnees.

The historical character of Chartiers Township has been significantly influenced by its agricultural history, its natural resources such as coal and oil and its location along major transportation routes. In 1774, Colonel James Allison was one of the first settlers on Chartiers Creek. His family was one of the twenty families who came to this area in that year, among whom were the Scotts, McDowells, Parks, Morrisions, Struthers, Norrises, and others. At this time, there was navigation on Chartiers Creek. The US Congress declared this creek navigable and in fact some local entrepreneurs used it as a means of shipping flour to New Orleans.

Chartiers Township is located in Washington County, which was formed during the Revolutionary War period on March 28, 1781, from part of Westmoreland County. It was the first County formed after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The new County was quite large and contained what would later become Greene, Allegheny and Beaver Counties.

On March 23, 1790, Chartiers Township was established by the Washington County Court of Quarter Session from the southern part of Cecil Township, with a petition from the inhabitants residing in its boundaries. The boundaries of the Township were reduced in 1791 by the establishment of Canton Township and Mt. Pleasant Township in 1808, and by the incorporation of and annexations by Canonsburg and Houston Boroughs. The emergence of the Chartiers Valley Railroad and then the local Interstate Highways mitigated the creek&#x27;s use for transportation, but its significance at the end of the 18th century is demonstrated in the name for the Township. In May 1790, John Canon, the founder of Canonsburg, loaded two boats with forty barrels of flour from his mill and shipped them to New Orleans via Chartiers Creek and the Ohio River. On April 8, 1793, an act was passed by the state legislature declaring &quot;Chartiers Creek a public highway for boats and rafts.&quot;

When coal was discovered in Washington County in the 1880s, it was shipped down Chartiers Creek to the Ohio River in times of high water. Coal had also become one of the main products of Chartiers Township for many years. Bituminous coal was first discovered in Washington County on the James Allison tract &quot;circa&quot; 1800. It was mined for a long time for domestic use and for blacksmithing purposes at twenty-five (25) cents a bushel. By 1876, twenty (20) or more coal banks could be counted and with the coming of the railroads, mining became a big business. The wealth of coal drew interest in the Township for its solid employment opportunities, though the work could be dirty and dangerous. Soon the extraction and transportation of coal become more advanced and the need for workers escalated. Mining was the chief occupation, with mines in the Meadow Lands, Richhill, Arden, Midland and Westland areas. Early towns were Arden, Meadow Lands, McGovern, Shingiss, McConnells Mill and Gretna.

In 1850, the Township&#x27;s population was 1,677 persons and by 1900 it was 2,141 persons. In 1834, the Township was divided into seven districts, and in 1836 comfortable school houses were erected in each district. School funding in 1836 was $876.15 but had decreased in 1837 to $696.62. By 1880, there were ten districts with ten teachers and 369 students and in 1908; there were twenty schools and 830 students. Average salary for a teacher was $57.50 (males) and $48.00 (females) in 1908. The Township began building its own high school in the early 1940s. Chartiers and Houston formed a jointure and the Chartiers-Houston School District had its first graduating class in 1956. By 2005 and 2006, Allison Park Elementary and Chartiers Houston Junior/Senior High School had 1188 students.

===Significant historical sites and events===
Chartiers Township has been the site of significant historical events over the past three hundred years. The &quot;Concord Coaches&quot; stage coach line ran through the Meadow Lands on the Pittsburgh and Washington line, whose function was later replaced by Chartiers Valley Railway also located in the Township. The Chartiers Valley Railroad Company was begun in 1830 and was the second railroad project of its size in the United States. The Railroad Company started to build rail lines from Pittsburgh in 1857, to Canonsburg in 1869, finally completed to Washington in 1871. This railroad brought a great change in the valley as coal mines were opened and farmers could ship their produce and milk to Pittsburgh and many other kinds of trade were carried over the new railroad.

In 1886, Ewing Pump Station was erected by the Southwest Pennsylvania Oil Company and was located in the Meadow Lands. It pumped about 50,000 barrels of oil per day, to and from different points within a radius of thirty-five miles. The total tankage stored at the station was about 2,409,000 barrels, contained in seventy tanks. On June 23, 1908, two 50,000 barrel oil tanks were struck by lightning. One tank exploded sending thousands of barrels of burning oil floating down Chartiers Creek, killing all vegetation and trees along the stream for a mile.

In 1911, the Washington County Fair Association was chartered and the first fair exhibition was held at Arden Downs in the Township. The Hagan Stock farm at Arden was chosen to purchase as the fair&#x27;s location due to its excellent race track. The farm had been used for training and racing horses, with complete facilities for horse boarding year round. The principal attraction of the fair at that time and for years to follow was this racing track. The fair has expanded over the years drawing thousands to view its agricultural events and exhibits and for traditional fair rides, entertainment, games and local food. Other events are also located at the fairgrounds throughout the year. The Washington County Fair has continued through the century as a growing and flourishing enterprise and continues as a showcase for the region&#x27;s agricultural enterprises.

The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum is also located in the Township, on the former Pittsburgh Railways Company&#x27;s trolley line to Washington, a line which was abandoned in 1953. This trolley system served as an important link for the south hills of Pittsburgh and Washington County residents who traveled for work, shopping, and recreation. The non-profit Pittsburgh Electric Railway Club (later the Pennsylvania Railway Museum Association) purchased a 2,000-foot section of abandoned railway line from the Pittsburgh Railways Company in 1954. It had been used by the Washington interurban trolley line from Washington to Pittsburgh. The museum is located near the Washington County Fairgrounds in Chartiers Township. On February 7, 1954, the museum&#x27;s first three cars were moved to the site. The museum was opened to the public in June 1963, providing visitors with short demonstration trolley rides and an informal tour of the car house. Since then, using mostly volunteer help, new cars and facilities including the Visitor Education Center, Museum store and Trolley Display Building have been built and more than thirty (30) cars are on display to the public. A &quot;spur&quot; off the original section of trolley track has been built across the road to the County Fairgrounds to allow fair visitors to experience a ride a scenic 4-mile ride on a restored trolley. The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum exceptionally preserves the historical significance of this once vital form of transportation through the region.

In the early 1950s, a one-room office building with garage was constructed for a township municipal building.

===Present and regional setting===
Chartiers Township is a 24.53 square mile municipality located in central Washington County, five (5) miles north of the City of Washington and twenty-five (25) miles southwest of the major metropolitan area of Pittsburgh. The Township is bordered on the northwest by Mount Pleasant Township, northeast by Cecil Township, the east by Canonsburg Borough, Houston Borough and North Strabane Township, the southeast by South Strabane Township and the southwest by Canton Township. Along its southeastern border, runs Chartiers Creek separating it from North and South Strabane. Regional access to the Township is provided by Interstate 79 on to Racetrack Road and Pike Street. The Township is governed by a Board of Supervisors, with the assistance of municipal staff and Commissions, such as the Planning Commission and Zoning Hearing Board. The Chartiers-Houston School District services the educational needs of the Township in addition to the residents of Houston Borough.

Chartiers Township can be categorized as primarily a residential and agricultural community. Many seek rural parcels in the Township for the keeping of private horses, and farming is still a viable enterprise. There are many post World War II housing developments along with new residential developments making it a &#x27;bedroom community&#x27;. Residential development pressures have increased from nearby growth areas such as Peters Township, North and South Strabane and Allegheny County. New residential development in the Township over the past ten years includes Arden Mills, The Ridgeview Plan and The Summit. Despite this, much of Chartiers nearly twenty-five (25) square miles is still rural in nature. Most suburban development in the Township has and will occur on agricultural land and/or on wooded sites.

The Meadow Lands is home to most of the commercial establishments. There are a number of light industrial sites between the Washington County Fairgrounds and Chartiers-Houston High School. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the region suffered with the loss of traditional mining and manufacturing employment base. As some of these mining and industrial enterprises in the Township have closed, new industry has located in the Township such as the DBT National Headquarters. The Arden Landfill is located in the Township and the Department of Environmental Protection has issued a major permit modification to Arden Landfill Inc., authorizing an expansion of the existing municipal landfill in Chartiers Township from 280 acres to 434 acres. Historically, the Township is best known for the two important cultural amenities of the Washington County Fairgrounds and the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum. These two resources and the events held at them should be utilized to promote the Township in the region.

Chartiers Township&#x27;s resources and convenient location in the regional transportation network has attracted increased development pressures. The Township&#x27;s proximity to the retail development along Route 19/Interstate 79 from Allegheny County and the substantial development of the North and South Strabane corridor with Trinity Point, the Meadows Racetrack and Casino and the Tanger Outlets have had a significant impact on the community. The easy access and proximity of these employment and commercial activities make the Township even more attractive as a place to reside. These centers provide employment, shopping and cultural opportunities while their proximity will continue to place growth and development pressures upon the Township. The availability of land in the area will act as impetus for the attraction of development in the community. The lack of water and sewage service in many areas may be one of the impediments to future growth.

<doc id="134041" wikidata="Q1134745" url="?curid=134041" title="Donora, Pennsylvania">
<text>Donora is a borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States, approximately south of Pittsburgh along the Monongahela River. The population was 4,558 as of the 2020 census.

Donora was incorporated in 1901. It takes its name from a portmanteau of William Donner and Nora Mellon (1878-1973), wife of banker Andrew W. Mellon. The borough&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Home of Champions&quot;, mainly because of the large number of famous athletes who have called Donora their home, including Baseball Hall of Fame outfielders Stan Musial and Ken Griffey Jr. 

During the 1948 Donora smog, air pollution killed 20 people and caused respiratory problems for 6,000 of the 14,000 residents. Agriculture, coal-mining, steel-making, wire-making, and other industries were important to Donora early in its history; its Rust Belt location has lost most of its industrial capacity. It is in the &quot;Mon Valley&quot;, downriver from Charleroi and upstream of Braddock.
In 1911 Donora was the 3rd wealthiest borough in the United States.

==History==

In 1794, the Whiskey Insurrectionists held several meetings at Fells Church, approximately east of Donora.

A trolley line opened in Donora on December 15, 1901, linking First and McKean, and Fifteenth Street and Meldon. It was extended in 1911 to Black Diamond to connect to the Charleroi to Pittsburgh interurban trolley. The line was abandoned on May 5, 1953.

The town was the scene of the infamous Donora Smog of 1948. Between October 26 and October 31, 1948, an air inversion trapped industrial effluent (air pollution) from the American Steel and Wire plant and Donora Zinc Works. During this spike in air pollution, 6,000 people suffered respiratory problems and extreme discomfort. &quot;In three days, 20 people died... After the inversion lifted, another 50 died, including Lukasz Musial, the father of baseball great Stan Musial. Hundreds more finished the rest of their lives with damaged lungs and hearts.&quot; The incident made national headlines. Today, the town is home to the Donora Smog Museum which tells the impact of the Donora Smog on the air quality standards enacted by the federal government in subsequent years.

Donora&#x27;s neighborhood known as &quot;Cement City&quot; is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The homes built in the neighborhood are completely made out of pre-formed and poured concrete. This structural building technique was championed by Thomas Edison, and was used by neighborhoods throughout the United States. The homes were built as employee housing for the Donora Wire and Steel Mill in the early 1900s.

Donora is home to the world&#x27;s second largest &quot;Cement City&quot; housing tract, innovated by Thomas Edison. The Cement City Historic District consists of 80 &quot;poured in place&quot; homes. The Cement City Historic District and Webster Donora Bridge are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Borough of Donora and surrounding areas have also been utilized as the filming location for several films and television shows. Most recently, the American television drama series &quot;American Rust&quot; starring Jeff Daniels and Maura Tierney used several sites in Donora for filming.
