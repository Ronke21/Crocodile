<text>Waynesburg is a borough in and the county seat of Greene County, Pennsylvania, United States, about south of Pittsburgh. Its population was 4,001 at the 2020 census.

The region around Waynesburg is underlaid with several layers of coking coal, including the Pittsburgh No. 8 seam, the Waynesburg seam, and the Sewickley (Mapletown) seam. The area is also rich with coalbed methane, which is being developed from the underlying Marcellus Shale, the largest domestic natural gas reserve. Early in the 20th century, four large gas compressing stations and a steam shovel factory were located in Waynesburg.

Waynesburg is named for General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne, one of the top lieutenants of George Washington during the Revolutionary War (1776–81). The borough is the location of Waynesburg University, and it is served by the Greene County Airport.

==History==

In 1796, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation to create Greene County, dividing Washington County into two parts with the lower part becoming Greene County. Part of the legislation required a city to take the county seat for the section of land. They chose Waynesburg as the place for the county seat because it was in the center of the county.
Thomas Slater owned the land which is now Waynesburg. According to the Living Places website, Slater purchased the land from a Native American for a two-year-old heifer and a flint-lock rifle. In that time, land development required a patent from William Penn. The town at that time was referred to as Eden, named after his wife Elanor&#x27;s maiden name, according to the Angel Fire website. County commissioners bought the 158 acres of land from Slater for $2,376 for the purpose of building a jail, courthouse and other public buildings. The commissioners changed the name to Waynesburg, after Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne. Despite selling the land, though, Slater remained in the area. He lived next to the Waynesburg VFW where two trailers now sit. Slater lived in his house until his death in 1815 at the age of 76. The state legislature incorporated Waynesburg as a borough effective April 9, 1816.
In August 1875 construction began of the narrow gauge Waynesburg and Washington Railroad, conceived by John Day in 1874 and chartered in 1875. Its passenger service ended in 1929, and conversion to followed in 1944 as a wartime measure. Then the railroad was renamed the Waynesburg Secondary Railroad. Regular freight service ended on this line in 1976, though part of it still serves (irregularly) for railroad access to a coal mine.

The Waynesburg Historic District, Hanna Hall at the university, and Miller Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Waynesburg is located northeast of the center of Greene County at (39.897403, -80.185597). Its southern boundary follows the South Fork of Tenmile Creek, an east-flowing tributary of the Monongahela River. The borough is surrounded by Franklin Township, a separate municipality.

U.S. Route 19 passes through the center of the borough as High Street (westbound) and Greene Street (eastbound), turning on the north side of town to follow Morris Street (northbound) and Richhill Street (southbound). Pennsylvania Route 21 joins US 19 through downtown Waynesburg on High and Greene streets. PA 21 leads east to Interstate 79 at Exit 14 and continues east another to Uniontown. To the west PA 21 leads to Rogersville and to the West Virginia border. I-79 leads north from Exit 14 to Washington and to Pittsburgh, while Morgantown, West Virginia, is to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Waynesburg has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="132645" wikidata="Q187021" url="?curid=132645" title="Fiscal policy">
<text>In economics and political science, fiscal policy is the use of government revenue collection (taxes or tax cuts) and expenditure to influence a country&#x27;s economy. The use of government revenue expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed in reaction to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unworkable. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose Keynesian economics theorised that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influence aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country&#x27;s government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation and to increase employment. In modern economies, inflation is conventionally considered &quot;healthy&quot; in the range of 2%–3%. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%–3% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%–5%. This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilise the economy over the course of the business cycle.

Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including:
* aggregate demand and the level of economic activity
* saving and investment
* income distribution
* allocation of resources.

Fiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy, in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply, interest rates and is often administered by a country&#x27;s central bank. Both fiscal and monetary policies influence a country&#x27;s economic performance.

== Monetary or fiscal policy? ==
Since the 1970s, it became clear that monetary policy performance has some benefits over fiscal policy due to the fact that it reduces political influence, as it is set by the central bank (to have an expanding economy before the general election, politicians might cut the interest rates). Additionally, fiscal policy can potentially have more supply-side effects on the economy: to reduce inflation, the measures of increasing taxes and lowering spending would not be preferred, so the government might be reluctant to use these. Monetary policy is generally quicker to implement as interest rates can be set every month, while the decision to increase government spending might take time to figure out which area the money should be spent on.

The recession of the 2000s decade shows that monetary policy also has certain limitations. A liquidity trap occurs when interest rate cuts are insufficient as a demand booster as banks do not want to lend and the consumers are reluctant to increase spending due to negative expectations for the economy. Government spending is responsible for creating the demand in the economy and can provide a kick-start to get the economy out of the recession. When a deep recession takes place, it is not sufficient to rely just on monetary policy to restore the economic equilibrium.
Each side of these two policies has its differences, therefore, combining aspects of both policies to deal with economic problems has become a solution that is now used by the US. These policies have limited effects; however, fiscal policy seems to have a greater effect over the long-run period, while monetary policy tends to have a short-run success.

In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association (AEA) found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement &quot;Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy&quot;, 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement &quot;Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.&quot; In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed.

==Stances==
Depending on the state of the economy, fiscal policy may reach for different objectives: its focus can be to restrict economic growth by mediating inflation or, in turn, increase economic growth by decreasing taxes, encouraging spending on different projects that act as stimuli to economic growth and enabling borrowing and spending.
The three stances of fiscal policy are the following: 
* Neutral fiscal policy is usually undertaken when an economy is in neither a recession nor an expansion. The amount of government deficit spending (the excess not financed by tax revenue) is roughly the same as it has been on average over time, so no changes to it are occurring that would have an effect on the level of economic activity.
* Expansionary fiscal policy is used by the government when trying to balance the contraction phase in the business cycle. It involves government spending exceeding tax revenue by more than it has tended to, and is usually undertaken during recessions. Examples of expansionary fiscal policy measures include increased government spending on public works (e.g., building schools) and providing the residents of the economy with tax cuts to increase their purchasing power (in order to fix a decrease in the demand).
* Contractionary fiscal policy, on the other hand, is a measure to increase tax rates and decrease government spending. It occurs when government deficit spending is lower than usual. This has the potential to slow economic growth if inflation, which was caused by a significant increase in aggregate demand and the supply of money, is excessive. By reducing the economy&#x27;s amount of aggregate income, the available amount for consumers to spend is also reduced. So, contractionary fiscal policy measures are employed when unsustainable growth takes place, leading to inflation, high prices of investment, recession and unemployment above the &quot;healthy&quot; level of 3%–4%.

However, these definitions can be misleading because, even with no changes in spending or tax laws at all, cyclic fluctuations of the economy cause cyclic fluctuations of tax revenues and of some types of government spending, altering the deficit situation; these are not considered to be policy changes. Therefore, for purposes of the above definitions, &quot;government spending&quot; and &quot;tax revenue&quot; are normally replaced by &quot;cyclically adjusted government spending&quot; and &quot;cyclically adjusted tax revenue&quot;. Thus, for example, a government budget that is balanced over the course of the business cycle is considered to represent a neutral and effective fiscal policy stance.

==Methods of fiscal policy funding==
Governments spend money on a wide variety of things, from the military and police to services such as education and health care, as well as transfer payments such as welfare benefits. This expenditure can be funded in a number of different ways:
* Taxation
* Seigniorage, the benefit from printing money
* Borrowing money from the population or from abroad 
* Dipping into fiscal reserves
* Sale of fixed assets (e.g., land)
* Selling equity to the population

=== Borrowing ===
A fiscal deficit is often funded by issuing bonds such as Treasury bills or and gilt-edged securities but can also be funded by issuing equity. Bonds pay interest, either for a fixed period or indefinitely that is funded by taxpayers as a whole. Equity offers returns on investment (interest) that can only be realized in discharging a future tax liability by an individual taxpayer. If available government revenue is insufficient to support the interest payments on bonds, a nation may default on its debts, usually to foreign creditors. Public debt or borrowing refers to the government borrowing from the public. It is impossible for a government to &quot;default&quot; on its equity since the total returns available to all investors (taxpayers) are limited at any point by the total current year tax liability of all investors.

=== Dipping into prior surpluses ===
A fiscal surplus is often saved for future use, and may be invested in either local currency or any financial instrument that may be traded later once resources are needed and the additional debt is not needed.

=== Fiscal straitjacket ===
The concept of a fiscal straitjacket is a general economic principle that suggests strict constraints on government spending and public sector borrowing, to limit or regulate the budget deficit over a time period. Most US states have balanced budget rules that prevent them from running a deficit. The United States federal government technically has a legal cap on the total amount of money it can borrow, but it is not a meaningful constraint because the cap can be raised as easily as spending can be authorized, and the cap is almost always raised before the debt gets that high.

==Economic effects==
Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved:
*Price stability;
*Full employment;
*Economic growth.

The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand, stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place. Additionally, Keynesians argue that expansionary fiscal policy should be used in times of recession or low economic activity as an essential tool for building the framework for strong economic growth and working towards full employment. In theory, the resulting deficits would be paid for by an expanded economy during the expansion that would follow; this was the reasoning behind the New Deal.

The IS-LM model is another way of understanding the effects of fiscal expansion. As the government increases spending, there will be a shift in the IS curve up and to the right. In the short run, this increases the real interest rate, which then reduces private investment and increases aggregate demand, placing upward pressure on supply. To meet the short-run increase in aggregate demand, firms increase full-employment output. The increase in short-run price levels reduces the money supply, which shifts the LM curve back, and thus, returning the general equilibrium to the original full employment (FE) level. Therefore, the IS-LM model shows that there will be an overall increase in the price level and real interest rates in the long run due to fiscal expansion.

Governments can use a budget surplus to do two things: 
*to slow the pace of strong economic growth;
*to stabilise prices when inflation is too high. 
Keynesian theory posits that removing spending from the economy will reduce levels of aggregate demand and contract the economy, thus stabilizing prices.

But economists still debate the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. The argument mostly centers on crowding out: whether government borrowing leads to higher interest rates that may offset the stimulative impact of spending. When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt. When governments fund a deficit with the issuing of government bonds, interest rates can increase across the market, because government borrowing creates higher demand for credit in the financial markets. This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services, either partially or entirely offsetting the direct expansionary impact of the deficit spending, thus diminishing or eliminating the achievement of the objective of a fiscal stimulus. Neoclassical economists generally emphasize crowding out while Keynesians argue that fiscal policy can still be effective, especially in a liquidity trap where, they argue, crowding out is minimal.

In the classical view, expansionary fiscal policy also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer a higher rate of return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country&#x27;s currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country&#x27;s currency increases. The increased demand, in turn, causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports.

Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved. Further, the outside lag between the time of implementation and the time that most of the effects of the stimulus are felt could mean that the stimulus hits an already-recovering economy and overheats the ensuing h rather than stimulating the economy when it needs it.

Some economists are concerned about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that would have otherwise been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have been unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation.

<doc id="132647" wikidata="Q199903" url="?curid=132647" title="Lake Taupō">
<text>Lake Taupō (also spelled Taupo; or ) is a large crater lake in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, located in the caldera of Taupō Volcano. The lake is the namesake of the town of Taupō, which sits on a bay in the lake&#x27;s northeastern shore. With a surface area of , it is the largest lake by surface area in New Zealand, and the second largest freshwater lake by surface area in geopolitical Oceania after Lake Murray in Papua New Guinea. Motutaiko Island lies in the southeastern area of the lake.

==Geography==
Lake Taupō has a perimeter of approximately and a maximum depth of . It is drained by the Waikato River (New Zealand&#x27;s longest river), and its main tributaries are the Waitahanui River, the Tongariro River, and the Tauranga Taupō River. It is a noted trout fishery with stocks of introduced brown and rainbow trout.

The level of the lake is controlled by Mercury Energy, the owner of the eight hydroelectric dams on the Waikato River downstream of Lake Taupō, using gates built in 1940–41. The gates are used to reduce flooding, conserve water and ensure a minimum flow of in the Waikato River. The resource consent allows the level of the lake to be varied between above sea level.

== Lake formation and volcanism ==

Lake Taupō is in a caldera created mainly by a supervolcanic eruption which occurred approximately 25,600 years ago. According to geological records, the volcano has erupted 29 times in the last 30,000 years. It has ejected mostly rhyolitic lava, although Mount Tauhara formed from dacitic lava.

Taupō has been active for 300,000 years with a very large event known as the Oruanui eruption occurring approximately 25,600 years ago. It was the world&#x27;s largest known eruption over the past 70,000 years, ejecting 1170 cubic kilometres of material and causing several hundred square kilometres of surrounding land to collapse and form the caldera. The caldera later filled with water to form Lake Taupō, eventually overflowing to cause a huge outburst flood.

Several later eruptions occurred over the millennia before the most recent major eruption, which was traditionally dated as about 181 CE from Greenland ice-core records. Tree ring data from two studies suggests a later date of 232 CE ± 5 and this is now accepted. Known as the Hatepe eruption, it is believed to have ejected 100 cubic kilometres of material, of which 30 cubic kilometres was ejected in a few minutes. This was one of the most powerful eruptions in the last 5000 years (alongside the Minoan eruption in the 2nd millennium BCE, the Tianchi eruption of Baekdu around 1000 CE and the 1815 eruption of Tambora), with a Volcanic Explosivity Index rating of 7; and there appears to be a correlation, to within a few years, of a year in which the sky was red over Rome and China. The eruption devastated much of the North Island and further expanded the lake. The area was uninhabited by humans at the time of the eruption, as New Zealand was not settled by Māori until about 1280. Possible climatic effects of the eruption would have been concentrated on the Southern Hemisphere due to the southerly position of Lake Taupō. Taupō&#x27;s last known eruption occurred around 30 years later, with lava dome extrusion forming the Horomatangi Reefs, but that eruption was much smaller than the Hatepe eruption.

Underwater hydrothermal activity continues near the Horomatangi vent, and nearby geothermal fields with associated hot springs are found north and south of the lake, for example at Rotokawa and Tūrangi. These springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.

The volcano is considered active and is monitored by GNS Science.

== Biota ==
Much of the watershed of Lake Taupō is a beech and podocarp forest with associate understory ferns being &quot;Blechnum filiforme&quot;, &quot;Asplenium flaccidum&quot;, &quot;Doodia media&quot;, &quot;Hymenophyllum demissum&quot;, &quot;Microsorum pustulatum&quot; and &quot;Dendroconche scandens&quot;, and some prominent associate shrubs being &quot;Olearia rani&quot; and &quot;Alseuosmia quercifolia&quot;.

Native faunal species in the lake include northern kōura or crayfish (&quot;Paranephrops planifrons&quot;) and kōkopu or whitebait (&quot;Galaxias&quot; species). The lake is noted for stocks of brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), introduced from Europe and California respectively in the late nineteenth century. There has also been a subsequent introduction of smelt (Retropinnidae species) as a food for the trout.

A community of sponges and associated invertebrates live around the underwater geothermal vents.

== Tourism ==


Tourism is a major component of Taupō&#x27;s commercial sector. The busiest time for the industry is the high summer season around Christmas and New Year.

The lake area has a temperate climate. Daily maximum temperatures recorded for Taupō range from an average of 23.3 °C in January and February to 11.2 °C in July, while the nighttime minimum temperatures range from 11.6 °C in February down to 2.2 °C in July. Rain falls in all seasons but is greatest in winter and spring, from June to December.

Taupō hosts the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge, a cycling tour around the lake which can take anywhere between four and ten hours. Skydiving is a popular local sport and tourist attraction. Taupō also hosts the ANZCO Ironman event.

Crossing the 40.2 km length of the lake is a challenge for open-water swimmers. In 2020, Michael Wells from Darwin, Australia, was the first to breaststroke across the lake.

===Māori rock carving===
On the north-west side of Lake Taupō on the cliffs of Mine Bay, there are Māori rock carvings created in the late 1970s by Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell and John Randall. Carved in the likeness of Ngātoro-i-rangi, a navigator who guided the Tūwharetoa and Te Arawa tribes to the Taupō area over a thousand years ago according to Māori legend. The 10-metre-high carving is intended to protect Lake Taupō from volcanic activities underneath. The cliff has become a popular tourist destination with hundreds of boats and yachts visiting the spot yearly.

===Māori tribes===
Lake Taupō is a taonga (treasure or something special to the person) of Ngāti Tūwharetoa from the Te Arawa waka. Ngāti Tūwharetoa owns the bed of the lake and its tributaries. They grant the public free access for recreational use.

== History ==
Lake Taupō previously housed a Ngāti Tūwharetoa village known as Te Rapa near the springs of Maunga Kākaramea. It was covered in a landslide on 7 May 1846 which killed 60 people, including the iwi&#x27;s chief Mananui Te Heuheu Tūkino II.

==History==
The year 1744 is the first record of John Hart&#x27;s “logg”, near where Alexandria is located now. During the land purchase of 1755 James Sterrat of Carlisle purchased 400 acres including the sleeping place called John Hart&#x27;s log on the Juniata River, which is now Alexandria.

Some time in the years before 1785 the first mention of a religious group called Hartslog Presbyterian Congregation was formed. A log worship house, Old Hartslog Church, stood upon the hill one mile (1.6 km) north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, where a burial ground was later made. This was a primitive structure but by 1787 a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In 1794 it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews. In 1826, the old Hartslog congregation moved to a brick building, referred to by Senator John Scott in his memoirs as the &quot;Brick Church&quot;, which seems to have been located near to the site of the present Reformed Church. The old log worship house was taken down the same year, and some of its logs were used in one or two of the dwellings of Alexandria.

In the late 18th century the primary transportation to and from Alexandria was the Juniata River, suitable only during summer and when the water depth permitted. On May 3, 1808, the new road from Harrisburg to Alexandria opened, permitting a more reliable connection with the outside world. In 1833 the Juniata Division of the Pennsylvania Canal was opened, the promise of better transportation started a mini housing boom in Alexandria. By 1875 the canal was abandoned and the Pennsylvania Railroad managed the transportation needs of the area. Around this time the growth of the area slowed, while the populations of Huntingdon and Hollidaysburg grew.

==Hartslog Heritage Day Festival==
Alexandria hosts the annual &quot;Hartslog Heritage Day&quot; celebration each year on the second Saturday of October. The day-long event recognizes the early days of the small borough, when, in 1744, a licensed Indian trader named John Hart used a large hollowed-out log to feed and salt his horses while he conducted his trading.

Early settlers used this log as a landmark to describe the location of their claims and referred to this area as Hartslog Settlement. In 1793 this area was laid out into town lots and named Alexandria, with the street near the site of the log name Hartslog Street.

Today the name remains for Hartslog Street as well as the region — &quot;Hartslog Valley.&quot;

The Hartslog Museum located on the second floor of the library in Alexandria is open one weekend a month and on Hartslog Day. The museum includes artifacts and antiques from the area, when Pennsylvania was still inhabited by Indian tribes.

Hartslog Day helps to support the museum.

<text>Birmingham is a borough in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 90 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Birmingham is the site of the &quot;Birmingham Window&quot;, a geologic structure created by a Paleozoic thrust fault.

Birmingham&#x27;s early settler, John Cadwallader, settled on a hill above the Little Juniata River and made plans to establish a large city. In the first several decades of the 19th century, the village grew quickly as a hub for commerce being carried on the Little Juniata River and on the nearby Pennsylvania Canal. By 1850, the Pennsylvania Railroad had passed through the valley. The development of the railroad diminished the importance of Birmingham as a trading hub since the railroad&#x27;s nearby hubs in Tyrone and Altoona grew quickly on land that was better suited for development.

In 1853, the Mountain Female Seminary opened in Birmingham as a boarding school for girls. In its earliest years, the school benefited from the ease of transportation afforded by the passage of the Pennsylvania railroad through Birmingham. Currently, the school still operates as Grier School, a boarding school for girls.

The East Coast earthquake on August 23, 2011 caused a rockslide along Route 453 in Birmingham.

<doc id="132666" wikidata="Q1184812" url="?curid=132666" title="Huntingdon, Pennsylvania">
<text>Huntingdon is a borough in and county seat of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, in the Middle Atlantic states region of the Northeastern United States. It is located along the Juniata River, approximately east of larger Altoona and west of the state capital of Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River. With a population of 6,827 in the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census, it is the largest population center near Raystown Lake, a winding, flood-control reservoir managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

The borough is located on the main line of the Norfolk Southern freight railway (formerly the longtime Pennsylvania Railroad) in an agricultural and outdoor recreational region with extensive forests and scattered deposits of ganister rock, coal, fire clay, and limestone deposits. Historically, the region surrounding Huntingdon was dotted with iron furnaces and forges, consuming limestone, iron ore and wood (for charcoal production) throughout the 19th century. Dairy farms dominate the local agriculture. The town is a regular stop for the daily east-west Amtrak passenger train service which connects Pittsburgh to the west with Philadelphia and New York City to the east and northeast. Huntingdon is also home to Juniata College (founded 1876 by the Church of the Brethren).

==History==
The original inhabitants of Huntingdon and neighboring counties were the Susquehannock. Through a combination of ongoing war with other indigenous nations, such as the Haudenosaunee, disease brought by Europeans, and violence from settlers, the Susquehannock are currently thought to have been entirely wiped out or subsumed by other tribes.

In 1768, Rev. William Smith began selling lots on the Standing Stone Tract along the Juniata, land he had recently acquired. The tracts&#x27; two prior owners had not attempted to lay out a town, so Dr. Smith is considered the founder. Huntingdon (the name by which he eventually called his town) sits at the site of corn fields that had been cultivated at a date now unknown, next to where Standing Stone Creek flows into the Juniata River. The 100th anniversary of its incorporation was marked by the erection of a &quot;Standing Stone Monument&quot; on Third Street, modeled on a tall, narrow shaft known to have existed before 1750, whose purpose is unclear but may have served as a trail marker. It may be significant that natural sandstone formations (popularly called Pulpit Rocks), which &quot;stand erect&quot;, are on a nearby ridge. A story surfaced during the early 19th century that Smith had renamed Standing Stone Settlement to honor an Englishwoman, Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. Smith&#x27;s descendants vehemently denied the story, and there exists no evidence to support it, despite a wide circulation in published sources. More likely, the Anglican cleric named it after the town of the same name in England; doing so had become a pattern for naming Pennsylvania settlements, Bedford, Carlisle and York being nearby examples of the trend. In 1796, the little village was incorporated as a borough.

Huntingdon long served as the junction of the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and as an important port on the Main Line of Public Works of the Pennsylvania Canal. In past years, Huntingdon boasted of manufacturers of flour, heavy machinery, radiators, furniture, stationery, woolen goods, shirts, shoes, electronic components, finished lumber, fiberglass yarn, matting and underground storage tanks. In the 19th century, J. C. Blair, a native of Shade Gap and a stationer and businessman, popularized the writing tablet and began marketing it nationwide. His factory in downtown Huntingdon was later relocated to nearby Alexandria.

Huntingdon&#x27;s Herncane Broom Factory was founded in 1863 by Benjamin F. Herncane. The 1897 &quot;Commemorative Biographical Encyclopedia of the Juniata Valley&quot; reported that the factory&#x27;s output was twenty-five dozens per day and furnished &quot;all the brooms used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.&quot; The company employed 14 workers and 3 traveling salesman. The building stood on Fourteenth Street from number 1416 to 1422. On 27 February 1903, the Everett Press reported that the &quot;Herncane Broom Factory of Huntingdon was destroyed by fire last Saturday night. Loss about $1500.&quot; Brothers Walter S. and George B. Herncane, who worked with their father at the broom factory, went on to found the Herncane Bros. general store, which stood at the corner of 6th and Washington.

The vicinity (but not much of the town proper) has been the subject of repeated flooding, in 1889, in 1936, and again in 1972. More recently in 2004, Hurricane Ivan resulted in major flooding close to Huntingdon, the worst since the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the region in July 1972.

The Huntingdon Borough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

From June 8 to 11, 2017, Huntingdon celebrated its 250th anniversary.

<text>Mount Union is a borough in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States, approximately southeast of Altoona and southeast of Huntingdon, on the Juniata River. In the vicinity are found bituminous coal, ganister rock, fire clay, and some timber. A major Easter grass factory is located in the northern quadrant of the borough limits; until May 2007, the facility was owned by Bleyer Industries. The population was 2,447 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Mount Union was largely influenced by industry. It was at one time the world&#x27;s largest producer of refractory material (silica brick), with three plants – General Refractories, United States Refractories, and Harbison Walker. The refractory business in Mount Union lasted from 1899 to about 1972, with limited production into the early 1990s. Other industries included two tanneries, a tanning extract plant, coal yards, an explosives and munitions plant (Aetna), and foundry and machine shops.

Mount Union was the northern terminus for the narrow gauge East Broad Top Railroad, connecting to the Main Line of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Norfolk Southern). The EBT maintained a large dual-gauge yard and coal cleaning plant in Mount Union and supplied coal to the Refractory plants. The EBT ceased operations in 1956 but the track is still in place and owned by the railroad. From 1998 to 2010, the Mount Union Connecting Railroad attempted to reactivate the EBT main track through Mount Union and rehabilitated it, but only a couple cars were serviced and none moved over the EBT trackage.

The Mount Union Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, with 300 significant historic structures, buildings, and homes. The population tally in 1900 was 1,086 which rose to 3,338 in 1910.

==Today==
The culturally significant Thousand Steps of the Standing Stone Trail are located in the Jacks Narrows, approximately two miles west of the town along U.S. Route 22. The annual Creation Festival was hosted locally (in Shirleysburg) from 1984 to 2022, drawing thousands of visitors in late June. Mount Union is the site of the Pennsylvania Lions Beacon Lodge Camp, a summer camp for people with visual impairments and special needs, founded by Carl Shoemaker in 1948. Today, Mount Union has 3 subsidized housing developments, Hartman Village, Chestnut Terrace, and Taylor Apartments, the later of which is a 7-story building for senior-citizens. The industries in Mount Unions include Bleyers Industries which produces plastic products, Containment Solutions which makes large tanks for gas stations, and Bonney Forge which manufactures steel valves and fittings. Bleyers Industries is located in the borough near on Chestnut Street, meanwhile Bonney Forge and Containment Solutions are located outside the borough near or within the Riverview Business Center along 522

<text>Penn Township is a township in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,078 at the 2020 census. The township includes the village of Hesston and the Seven Points Marina of Raystown Lake.

==History==
&#x27;The Proprietaries of the Pennsylvania province, mindful of the rights of the natives and anxious to promote peace with them, would not grant land nor permit settlements to be made until the Indian title had been purchased. At a treaty held at Albany on the 6th day of July 1754, the Six Nations, consisting of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas and Tuscaroras, executed a deed to the Proprietaries for a large portion of the territory of the province including the whole of the valley of the Juniata [then Harrisburg to Pittsburgh]. Soon after this event the resident tribes sought a home elsewhere.’

According to various family histories—the white settlers first inhabited the Woodcock Valley Manor during the American Revolutionary War and as early as 1772. For the first time the families of Northern Europeans [German, English, Irish &amp; Welsh] lived in freedom and worshiped the religion of their choice. The early Colonist cleared the virgin forests and carved farms out the land—and these are the same working farms that you see today.

&#x27;In the early 1800s individuals of the area began mining Tussey Mountain for ore. These men operated on a small scale, but later larger companies started operations. One of these was the Grove Brothers of Danville, Montour Co., PA. They hauled ore to Cambria Iron Ore Works at Johnstown.&#x27;

Penn Township was officially made from part of Hopewell Township on November 21, 1846.

The ore was processed into Juniata pig iron and sent away from the area to be manufactured into tools, machinery, steam engines, and the first railroads.

‘On May 6, 1852, the Huntingdon and Broad Top Railroad and Coal Company was incorporated and on August 13, 1855, trains began running from Huntingdon to Bedford.’ and through the villages of Penn Township.

In 1885—‘Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company built a track from their quarries out from Grafton [Hesston] to the line of the Huntingdon &amp; Broad Top railroad, one-half mile south of the station for the purpose of shipping limestone to their furnace at Saxton.’

‘The first telephone company entirely located within Penn Township was called the Raystown Branch Telephone Company. It was commonly called the ‘Buttermilk line’. Having thirty six subscribers. Poles and wire were maintained by them. The line had one wire and used the earth as the second, a ground wire.’(1896) 

&#x27;In the early 1900s the Colonial Iron Company of Riddlesburg, purchased the Grove Brothers operations. The mines continued in operation until before WWI when they closed down.&#x27;

‘Penn Township was not completely electrified until 1947, which was when Valley Rural Electric Cooperative strung lines on the hills and valleys from Tussey Mountain to the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River. Holes were dug and poles set, all by hand.’

The Brumbaugh Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==History==

The narrow-gauge East Broad Top Railroad was constructed through the community in 1873. Rockhill was selected as the location of the railroad&#x27;s maintenance facility. The parent company Rockhill Iron and Coal located their dual-stack coke-fired iron furnace here. Rockhill as it exists today was created by the coal company and the railroad as a support community for their infrastructure.

The iron furnace shut down for the last time in 1907, and the railroad became the primary employer. The EBT shut down in 1956, but a portion from Rockhill north to Shirleysburg was reactivated in 1960 as a tourist operation. In the late 2000s the track to the south was rehabilitated to PA 475 sufficiently for speeders to operate and give rides to the public. In 2022, trackage was restored to the wye at Colgate Grove, with reproduction passenger cars powered by a small diesel locomotive. On February 18, 2023, their steam locomotive, #16, rode the rails again for the first time since 1956, carrying passengers to Colgate Grove.

Friends of the East Broad Top, Inc. have been working to provide rehabilitation to the facilities in Rockhill. Tours inside the East Broad Top shop complex are offered during the summer months.

<text>Saltillo is a borough in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 346 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Saltillo was named after the Mexican War Battle of Saltillo (23 October 1840). It was a major tanning center during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Leas and McVitty Tannery was located here, known for quality hides. The main line of the East Broad Top Railroad (EBT) was built through Saltillo in 1874. The railroad served the tannery as well as a short-lived iron mine and an equally short-lived limestone quarry, both just southeast of town.

Saltillo was an important place on the EBT, acting as a base station for the long grade up to Broad Top Mountain. The EBT had a three-track yard, a station, a water tank and a turning wye located here. Just after the turn of the 20th century a large ganister quarry was established above Saltillo on Jacks Mountain by Mount Union Refractories (later United States Refractories and North American Refractories) to supply their plant in Mount Union. In 1942 a spur was built from the EBT yard in Saltillo, which climbed the mountain to a tipple below the quarry. The branch was the steepest track on the EBT and remained in service until the line closed in 1956. The quarry continued to operate into the 1970s, served by trucks. The EBT tracks in Saltillo are still in place. The water tank was burned by vandals in the late 1980s and the station was demolished in the mid-2000s after being allowed to deteriorate to deplorable condition.

Around 1935 the skeleton of a mastodon was discovered behind the ball field in Saltillo by two young men digging a drainage ditch. They excavated several bones, teeth and both tusks. They gave them to C.R. Cornelius the landowner, who later donated them to Penn State University where they can be seen today. In the 1990s Penn State reopened the dig and found even more bones that were missed during the first excavation.

The Hudson Grist Mill at the southwest edge of town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

<text>Shirleysburg is a borough in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 150 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Shirleysburg was originally the site of, and takes its name from Fort Shirley, a French and Indian War fort. In 1754 the Oneida chief Monacatoocha (Scarouady) led about 200 pro-British Native Americans (Iroquois, Lenape, and Shawnee) from their village of Logstown on the western frontier, to take refuge at George Croghan&#x27;s trading post. In 1754, Croghan built a stockaded blockhouse known as &quot;Croghan&#x27;s Fort.&quot; Following General Edward Braddock&#x27;s defeat in July 1755, Governor Robert Hunter Morris ordered it renamed Fort Shirley and had several other forts built in a defensive line, to protect settlers from Native American attacks. The fort was abandoned in late 1756 because it was considered too difficult to defend.

On April 3, 1837, Shirleysburg was incorporated as a borough. In 1840 the population was 247. The narrow gauge East Broad Top Railroad (EBT) was constructed through Shirleysburg in 1873. It continued to serve the town for 83 years, until it ceased operations in 1956. Since 1960 EBT tourist trains have operated from Rockhill to Colgate Grove, just south of town, where a wye was constructed to turn trains. The inactive tracks pass through the community on their way to Mount Union.

The Benjamin B. Leas House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<doc id="132696" wikidata="Q830565" url="?curid=132696" title="Sleeping car">
<text>The sleeping car or sleeper (often ) is a railway passenger car that can accommodate all passengers in beds of one kind or another, for the purpose of sleeping. George Pullman was the main American innovator and owner of sleeper cars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when railroads dominated intercity passenger travel.

The first such cars saw sporadic use on American and English railways in the 1830s; they could be configured for coach seating during the day.

==History==
Possibly the earliest example of a sleeping car (or &quot;bed carriage&quot;, as it was then called) was on the London &amp; Birmingham and Grand Junction Railways between London and Lancashire, England. The bed carriage was first made available to first-class passengers in 1838.
In the spring of 1839, the Cumberland Valley Railroad pioneered sleeping car service in the United States with a car named &quot;Chambersburg&quot;, between Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A couple of years later a second car, the &quot;Carlisle&quot;, was introduced into service.

In 1857, the Wason Manufacturing Company of Springfield, Massachusetts – one of the United States&#x27; first makers of railway passenger coach equipment – produced America&#x27;s first specifically designed sleeping car. Canadian railways soon followed with their own sleeping cars: first the Grand Trunk in 1858, then the Great Western. The Great Western&#x27;s sleeping cars were manufactured in-house, with the first three built in 1858, and the railway operating six by 1863.

The man who ultimately made the sleeping car business profitable in the United States was George Pullman, who began by building a luxurious sleeping car (named &quot;Pioneer&quot;) in 1865. The Pullman Company, founded as the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1867, owned and operated most sleeping cars in the United States until the mid-20th century, attaching them to passenger trains run by the various railroads; there were also some sleeping cars that were operated by Pullman but owned by the railroad running a given train. During the peak years of American passenger railroading, several all-Pullman trains existed, including the &quot;20th Century Limited&quot; on the New York Central Railroad, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; on the Pennsylvania Railroad, the &quot;Panama Limited&quot; on the Illinois Central Railroad, and the &quot;Super Chief&quot; on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

Pullman cars were normally a dark &quot;Pullman green&quot;, although some were painted in the host railroad&#x27;s colors. The cars carried individual names, but usually did not carry visible numbers. In the 1920s, the Pullman Company went through a series of restructuring steps, which in the end resulted in a parent company, Pullman Incorporated, controlling the Pullman Company (which owned and operated sleeping cars) and the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company. Due to an antitrust verdict in 1947, a consortium of railroads bought the Pullman Company from Pullman Incorporated, and subsequently railroads owned and operated Pullman-made sleeping cars themselves. Pullman-Standard continued manufacturing sleeping cars and other passenger and freight railroad cars until 1980.

For nearly a year during the end of World War II the United States government banned sleeping cars for runs of less than in order to make sleepers available for transporting troops returning to the US from Europe, many being deployed in the Pacific Theater. The development of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and the expansion of jet airline travel in the same decade negatively affected train travel.

===Cultural impact of Pullman porters===

One unanticipated consequence of the rise of Pullman cars in the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was their effect on civil rights and African-American culture. Each Pullman car was staffed by a uniformed porter. The majority of Pullman porters were African Americans. While still a menial job in many respects, Pullman offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, in addition to a chance for travel, and it was a well regarded job in the African-American community of the time. The Pullman attendants, regardless of their true name, were traditionally referred to as &quot;George&quot; by the travelers, the name of the company&#x27;s founder, George Pullman. The Pullman company was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States.

Railway porters fought for political recognition and were eventually unionized. Their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (established, 1925), became an important source of strength for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement in the early 20th century, notably under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph. Because they moved about the country, Pullman porters also became an important means of communication for news and cultural information of all kinds. The African-American newspaper, the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, gained a national circulation in this way. Porters also used to re-sell phonograph records bought in the great metropolitan centres, greatly adding to the distribution of jazz and blues and the popularity of the artists.

===Open-section accommodation===
From the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries, the most common and more economical type of sleeping car accommodation on North American trains was the &quot;open section&quot;. Open-section accommodations consist of pairs of seats, one seat facing forward and the other backward, situated on either side of a center aisle. The seat pairs can be converted into the combination of an upper and a lower &quot;berth&quot;, each berth consisting of a bed screened from the aisle by a curtain. A famous example of open sections can be seen in the movie &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959).
===Private accommodations===
In the mid-to-late 20th century, an increasing variety of private rooms was offered. Most of these rooms provided significantly more space than open-section accommodations could offer. Open-sections were increasingly phased out in the 1950s, in favor of roomettes. Some of them, such as the rooms of the &quot;Slumbercoach&quot; cars manufactured by the Budd Company and first put into service in 1956, were triumphs of miniaturization. These allowed a single car to increase the number of sleepers over a conventional sleeping car of private rooms.

====Roomettes====
A Roomette, in the historically correct sense of the word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (&quot;not&quot; in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes are placed on both sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes, a Pullman-produced precursor to the Slumbercoach, are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car&#x27;s floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly spartan form of roomette; Slumbercoaches also included a few two-passenger units.

====Compartments and double bedrooms====

Compartments and Double Bedrooms are private rooms for two passengers, with upper and lower berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed on one side of the car, with the corridor running down the other side (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite.

====Drawing rooms and larger accommodations====
The drawing room was a relatively rare and expensive option for travelers. It could comfortably accommodate three people, again with a washbasin and private toilet on one side of the car. Even rarer are larger rooms accommodating four or more. Generally the needs of large parties were better served with multiple rooms, with or without the ability to combine them into a suite.

====Modern Amtrak accommodations====
Amtrak&#x27;s Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, although they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that fold out into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room washbasin or toilet, on both sides of both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in access ladder for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a roll-in cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities.

When the Viewliner sleeping cars were built, the accommodations were patterned after the Superliner accommodations, except that the Economy Bedrooms (or &quot;Viewliner Roomettes&quot;) include Roomette-style washbasins and toilets, as well as windows for the upper berths.

==Night trains today==
===Europe===
In Europe, the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (French for &quot;International Sleeping Car Company&quot;) first focused on sleeping cars, but later operated whole trains, including the &quot;Simplon-Orient Express&quot;, &quot;Nord Express&quot;, &quot;Train Bleu&quot;, &quot;Golden Arrow&quot;, and the &quot;Transsiberien&quot; (on the Trans-Siberian railway). Today it once again specializes in sleeping cars, along with onboard railroad catering.

In modern Europe, a number of sleeping car services continue to operate, though they face strong competition from high-speed day trains and budget airlines, sometimes leading to the cancellation or consolidation of services. In some cases, trains are split and recombined in the dead of night, making it possible to offer several connections with a relatively small number of trains. Generally, the trains consist of sleeping cars with private compartments, couchette cars, and sometimes cars with normal seating.

In Eastern Europe, night trains are still widely used. In Western Europe, they have been in decline for decades. However, in December 2020 the state railways of Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland announced a 500 million euro investment in a network of cross-border night trains linking 13 major European cities, in the largest extension of Europe&#x27;s night network in many years.

An example of a more basic type of sleeping car is the European couchette car, which is divided into compartments for four or six people, with bench-configuration seating during the day and &quot;privacyless&quot; double- or triple-level bunk beds at night.

In 2021 the French start-up company, Midnight Trains, announced plans to set up a network of sleeper trains, centered in Paris. Planned destinations include Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Berlin, Venice, Rome, Barcelona, Madrid, and Porto, with some intermediate stops. The plans were backed by telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, the co-owner of Le Monde newspaper. However, the project later collapsed due in part to a lack of funding. In 2021 Europe saw a increase in the provision of sleeper trains which is thought to be the result of increasing awareness of the environmental effects of long-distance travel.

In 2022 the design and engineering faculties of three European universities – Aalto, KTH and TalTech – discussed plans to reshape sleeping cars for flow production. The ADLNE project aims to create the railcar from modules that are themselves composed of interchangeable segments, compartments and fittings, allowing bespoke designs at low cost.

Since 2023, Belgian–Dutch start-up European Sleeper runs sleeper trains from Amsterdam to Berlin and (since 2024) Prague, as well as a seasonal service (since 2025) to Innsbruck and Venice. European Sleeper has also announced plans for an Amsterdam—Barcelona service in 2026 or 2027.

====Austria====

ÖBB&#x27;s modern Nightjet services operate in Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France, Netherlands and Belgium, and Nightjet&#x27;s partners will also take passengers to Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The services usually leave at around 20:00 hours and arrive at around 09:00 hours at the destination. Some of the Nightjet train units have a maximum speed of 230 km/h.

====Former Soviet Union countries====
In the Soviet Union overnight train travel formed the most common and accessible mode of long-distance travel, distances between the capital of Moscow and many outlying cities being ideal for overnight trips that depart in late evening and arrive at their destinations in the morning. Sleeping cars with berths are the only reasonable solution for railway trips lasting several days (e.g., trains running along the Trans-Siberian Railway, or direct trains from Moscow or Saint Petersburg to the capitals of the Central Asian Soviet Republics).

Since then, the railroads in the smaller ex-Soviet nations have largely transitioned to daytime intercity trains, such as in Belarus, where the process is based on government-funded purchases of rolling stock supplied by Stadler, which operates a train factory in Minsk, or in Uzbekistan, which has established a 600 km Afrosiyob high-speed rail service between all of its major cities.

In the larger Soviet Union successor states like Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, on the other hand, night trains are to this day a prime method of railway travel, as a shift towards faster daytime trains with seating rather than sleeping arrangements is hampered by insufficient investments in the railway infrastructure restricting the speed, lack of train sets, and most importantly, the distances involved. While certain numbers of high-speed trains have been acquired by the national railways of these countries (such as Talgo 250 in Kazakhstan, Siemens Sapsan in Russia, or Hyundai Rotem HRCS in Ukraine), all of them continue to operate a large number of sleeper trains both on domestic and international routes.

The need to compete against aviation with its soaring passenger numbers forces the railroads to maintain modest ticket prices, starting at below 10 Euros for third-class tickets in Ukraine, if higher in the richer ex-Soviet nations. Rolling stock age and quality also varies by country. In countries like Kazakhstan and Russia, locally-produced cars are purchased regularly to update the fleet, with newly introduced comforts such as showers, dry toilets, or conditioning units in passenger compartments becoming an increasingly common sight; Russian Railroads have also introduced double-deck sleeper cars; yet comfort levels still suffer from a modest degree of innovation in the bogie suspension systems and the passenger compartment design. Some other post-Soviet nations rely more heavily on the rolling stock fleet inherited from the Union, to a large extent based on vintage life-prolonged cars assembled in East Germany or Soviet Latvia back in the 1980s.

==== Croatia ====
Modern, air-conditioned sleeping cars and couchette cars are part of Croatian Railways rolling stock. Croatian sleeping coaches include single, double or 4-bed compartments with washbasin and many additional hygienic accessories. Passengers also have catering services at their disposal and are given complimentary breakfast, depending on the type of ticket bought. A night train with sleeping carriages included operates on the route between the two largest Croatian towns, Zagreb and Split, and Croatian sleeping coaches are included on the Zagreb-Stuttgart-Zagreb and Zagreb-Zürich-Zagreb EuroNight lines.

==== Czech Republic ====
Sleeping car services in the Czech Republic are operated by České dráhy and RegioJet. ČD operates them on the Prague - Leipzig - Zürich line, Prague - Linz - Zürich line, Prague - Humenné line and others. RegioJet provides them on various trains on the Prague - Košice line.

====France====
Another of the more substantial examples of current European sleeping-car service is the &quot;Train Bleu&quot;, an all-sleeping-car train. It leaves Paris from the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz station in mid-evening and arrives in Nice at about 8 in the morning, providing both first-class rooms and couchette accommodation. The train&#x27;s principal popularity is with older travelers; it has not won the same degree of popularity with younger travelers. Recently, the upper-class coaches (wagons lits) have been sold to foreign railroad companies, so that only couchette cars (1st and 2nd class) and seating coaches remain. The Train Bleu is part of the French night service network called &quot;Intercités de Nuit&quot;.

====Italy====
In Italy, Ferrovie dello Stato operates an extensive network of trains with sleeping cars, especially between the main cities in Northern Italy and the South, including Sicily using train ferry.

====Poland====
Sleeping trains in Poland are run by PKP Intercity. Sleeper cars are used on long-distance domestic trains such as the Przemyślanin as well as international trains. Polish night trains also contain standard first and second class seated cars as well as couchette cars. The sleeper cars offer various types of accommodations, including 4-bed, 3-bed, 2-bed and single accommodations, as well as a deluxe option with a private bathroom and shower.

====Romania====
Night train numbers have been reduced significantly, as the quality of the rail infrastructure is declining and repairs are insufficient, which leads to longer ride times between cities. A journey from Gara de Nord station in Bucharest to Arad (599 km) usually lasts 11 hours 20 minutes when there are no delays.
Most night trains in Romania cross the country, covering distances of 400 to 750 km, usually to end at certain international destinations or in large cities at opposite ends of the country. The overwhelming majority of night trains with sleeping coaches are owned and operated by CFR Călători (Romanian Railways). Recently, private operators such as Astra Rail Carpatica, the newly founded private operator of Astra Vagoane Arad, has started offering sleeping train services, using own-made sleeping cars and Servtrans locomotives. 

CFR today prefers operating more couchettes than sleeping cars in its trains, a practice used in Italy and Austria, adopted by the CFR in the early 2010s, thus enabling it to increase the capacity on sleeping trains. The sleeping cars of the CFR in the 1990s consisted of Bautzen and Görlitz-made sleeping cars, standard in the Eastern Bloc. They were replaced by Grivița-made WLABmee 71-70 and Hansa-made WLABmee 71–31, bought second-hand from Deutsche Bahn. The most recent sleeping cars are the WLABmee 70-91 made by Astra Arad, which is the same type used by Astra Rail (although the liveries differ), starting from 2014, 2 of the WLABmee 71-70 cars were refurbished, but no other examples have received the same treatment. Other examples that have been withdrawn since were second-hand examples of the TEN MU and T2S types.

====Spain and Portugal====
In Spain, &quot;Trenhotel&quot; was a long-distance, overnight train service which used Talgo tilting trains technology and sleeping cars developed by the Spanish rail network operator Renfe. It was operated by Renfe and CP where it operated International Sud-Express and Lusitanea services between Spain and Portugal, and by its subsidiary Elipsos (a joint venture between Renfe and French SNCF with a 50% share each) when operating in France, Switzerland and Italy.

Trenhotel services were discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic, this was due to some routes being covered by daytime high-speed trains, the age of rolling stock and the diminishing popularity of some of the services. Renfe announced that trains to and from the Spanish region of Galicia would eventually be reintroduced. This marked the end of sleeper trains in Portugal and it left Celta as the last international train service between Portugal and Spain.

The Estrella (Star) is a low-cost night train between Madrid and Barcelona served by berth carriages, with compartments for up to 6 people.

====Turkey====

While most of Turkey&#x27;s overnight trains operate within Anatolia, in Asia, TCDD Taşımacılık operates one train from Istanbul to Sofia and Bucharest. The train runs through Turkey as a single train and later splits in Bulgaria. Formerly, overnight trains departed Istanbul to several European destinations such as Thessaloniki, Belgrade, Budapest, Warsaw and Kyiv but were all discontinued in the 1990s and 2000s.

A privately operated overnight train, the Optima Express, runs between Edirne and Villach in Austria with an average trip time of 35 hours.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, a network of trains with sleeping cars operates daily between London and Scotland (&quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot;), and between London and the West Country as far as Cornwall (&quot;Night Riviera&quot;). These services offer a choice of single- or double-occupancy bedrooms. These services operate all week, except Saturdays and usually depart London from Euston and Paddington stations in the evening, arriving at their destinations at approximately 08:00. The Night Riviera service uses British Rail Mk3 sleeper coaches, whereas Caledonian Sleeper uses Mk5 coaches.

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada, all regularly scheduled sleeping car services are operated by Via Rail, using a mixture of relatively new cars and refurbished mid-century ones; the latter cars include both private rooms and &quot;open section&quot; accommodations.

==== United States ====

In the United States, all regularly scheduled sleeping car services are operated by Amtrak. Amtrak offers sleeping cars on most of its overnight trains, using modern cars of the private-room type exclusively.

Today, Amtrak operates two main types of sleeping car: the bi-level Superliner sleeping cars, built from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, and the single-level Viewliner sleeping cars, built in the mid-1990s. Superliners are used on most long-distance routes from Chicago westward, while Viewliners are used on most routes east of Chicago due to tunnel clearance issues in and around New York City and Baltimore.

In the most common Superliner sleeping car configuration, the upper level is divided into two halves, one half containing &quot;Bedrooms&quot; (formerly &quot;Deluxe Bedrooms&quot;) for one, two, or three travelers, each Bedroom containing an enclosed toilet-and-shower facility; and the other half containing &quot;Roomettes&quot; (formerly &quot;Economy Bedrooms&quot; or &quot;Standard Bedrooms&quot;) for one or two travelers; plus a beverage area and a toilet. The lower level contains more Roomettes; a Family Bedroom for as many as two adults and two children; and an &quot;Accessible Bedroom&quot; (formerly &quot;Special Bedroom&quot;) for a wheelchair-using traveler and a companion; plus toilets and a shower.

The Viewliner cars contain an Accessible Bedroom (formerly &quot;Special Bedroom&quot;) for a wheelchair-using traveler and a companion, with an enclosed toilet-and-shower facility; two Bedrooms (formerly &quot;Deluxe Bedrooms&quot;) for one, two, or three travelers, each Bedroom containing an enclosed toilet-and-shower facility; &quot;Roomettes&quot; (formerly &quot;Economy Bedrooms&quot;, &quot;Standard Bedrooms&quot;, or &quot;Compartments&quot;) for one or two travelers, each Roomette containing its own unenclosed toilet and washing facilities; and a shower room at the end of the car.

===Asia===

====China====

China Railway operates an extensive network of conventional sleeper trains throughout the country, covering all provincial capitals and many major cities. The Chinese &quot;hard&quot; sleeping car in use today is very basic, consisting of 6 fixed bunk beds per compartment, which can be converted into seats in peak season. The middle level bunk bed will be folded and top level bunk bed will still be sold as sleeper, while the lower bed will be occupied by three passengers. Chinese trains also offer &quot;soft&quot; or deluxe sleeping cars with four or two beds per room.

China is the only country to operate high-speed sleeper trains. Sleeper services are operated using high-speed CRH1E, CRH2E and CRH5E trains outfitted with sleeping berths (couchette). Services run between Beijing - Shanghai and Beijing - Guangzhou at speeds of up to , one of the fastest sleeper trains in the world. A new variant of CRH2E consists of double level bunk capsules in lieu of sleeping berths. These trains have been dubbed &quot;moving hotels&quot;.

====India====

A major portion of passenger cars in India are sleeper/couchette cars. With railways as one of the primary mode of passenger transport, sleeper cars vary from economical to First Class AC (air conditioned). Most Indian trains come in combinations of first class A/C and non-A/C private sleeper cars with doors, and A/C 3-tier or 2-tier couchette arrangements.

====Japan====
Japan used to have many sleeper trains, but most of these routes have been removed because of the development of air travel, overnight bus services and high-speed rail. As of May 2016, sleeper car trains of regular service in Japan are as follows:
* &quot;Sunrise Izumo&quot;: Tokyo – Izumoshi
* &quot;Sunrise Seto&quot;: Tokyo – Takamatsu

==== Indonesia ====
The Indonesian State Railways once operated sleeper cars on the &quot;Bima&quot; between its launch in 1967 and 1995, when the last berth (&quot;couchette&quot;) cars were decommissioned.

The successor to the Indonesian State Railways, PT Kereta Api Indonesia, relaunched the Sleeper Train service on 11 June 2018. The first route for sleeper train is from Gambir, Jakarta to Surabaya. The Luxury Sleeper Train is managed by another KAI subsidiary, KAI Wisata.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippine National Railways (PNR) operated a number of 7A-2000 and 14 class sleeper cars between 1999 and 2013. These units were first built for the Japanese National Railways (JNR) in 1974 as 14 series passenger cars , and were donated to the Philippines in 1999. They were meant to serve the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; in the South Main Line. The 7A-2000 class were a group of 5 single-level cars that were decommissioned after being involved in the fatal 2004 Padre Burgos derailment. On the other hand, the 14 class were a group of bilevel-style couchette cars. After all services to the Bicol Region were halted in 2013, the 14-class couchettes were stored in the Tutuban Yard in Manila.

==== Vietnam ====
The Vietnam Railways provides sleeper cars on North-South Railway between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi–Lào Cai railway between Hanoi and Lào Cai; the latter has much better sleeper cars.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Sleeping cars are used on:
* Journey Beyond&#x27;s east–west transcontinental train the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; between Sydney and Perth, and the north–south transcontinental train &quot;The Ghan&quot; between Adelaide and Darwin.
* NSW TrainLink&#x27;s overnight XPT services from Sydney to Melbourne, Casino and Brisbane.
* Queensland Rail&#x27;s long-distance trains the &quot;Spirit of Queensland&quot; and &quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot;.

<text>Armagh is a borough in Indiana County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The population was 103 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Armagh is the oldest community in Indiana County, having been founded in 1792 by eight families led by James and Margaret Jane Graham from Northern Ireland. The community was named after the Irish city and county of Armagh, which was the hometown of some of the settlers. Its first school began in 1799, using a log cabin, and in 1805, it established the county&#x27;s first post office.

Many of the original settlers were Presbyterian. The Wheatfield Presbyterian Church, later known simply as the Armagh Presbyterian Church, was started in 1786. The Rev. George Hill, its first minister, was installed in 1792, and was shared with churches in Fairfield and Donegal. In 1820, the congregation built a log church and in 1835–1836 replaced it with a white frame church. Another Presbyterian church was built in 1905 in Seward, approximately three miles south. The two congregations merged in 1963. The Armagh church building was destroyed in 2004 after being hit by a truck.

The community became a borough on April 10, 1824, having previously been part of East Wheatfield Township. The borough was the birthplace of pioneer American labor leader William H. Sylvis in 1828. Armagh was described in the 1940 Pennsylvania Guide as being &quot;settled in 1792 by Irish immigrants, who found the hillside bare except for a few scrubby oaks; hence the name. In stagecoach days Armagh had almost as many taverns as it has houses today.&quot;

<doc id="132705" wikidata="Q5380818" url="?curid=132705" title="Entry-shifting squeeze">
<text>In the card game contract bridge, an entry-shifting squeeze is a mixture between a material squeeze and an immaterial squeeze. The material part is the same as in a trump squeeze or a squeeze without the count. The immaterial part is that depending on the choice of discards of the squeeze an entry into one or into the other hand is created. For that very reason an entry-shifting squeeze is always a positional squeeze.

==Examples==
In the first diagram clubs are trumps and South could claim all tricks on a crossruff were it not for the trump in East&#x27;s hand. When the club jack is played, the entry-shifting squeeze comes to his rescue.
If West sheds a heart, the jack is overtaken with the ace, a heart ruffed and North is left with the last trump and a master heart. If West chooses to discard a diamond, the club jack is underplayed with the five. North&#x27;s club ace ruffs the diamonds good and the South hand wins the last two tricks.

The entry-shifting mechanism works also in No Trumps, as can be seen in the next example.
As only five tricks out of remaining six cards are required, this is a squeeze without the count. It is not possible to rectify the count as there are not enough communications between the two hands. The entry-shifting mechanism will overcome this though.
South leads the A and West has no good discard. If he discards a spade, the J is played and South continues with a spade to the ace and the spade eight. West returns a heart to South&#x27;s ace, but the diamond king serves as an entry to the established spades. If West chooses to discard a heart, the diamond king is played and after ace of hearts and another heart, the Q will serve as an entry.

<text>Glen Campbell is a borough in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough is located about 80 miles (135 km) east of Pittsburgh. Glen Campbell only shares borders with two other municipalities; the townships of Banks to the north, east and west, and Montgomery to the south.

The population was 254 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The borough was named in 1889 for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company (&quot;glen&quot; is the Scottish word for &quot;valley&quot;), which mined in that area. Glen Campbell became a borough on September 27, 1894. ″The petition for Glen Campbell to become a borough is dated March 5, 1894. The papers were presented to the grand jury and after hearing the parties, and a full investigation of the matter, it was found that the law, under Act of Assembly, had been complied with and the prayer of the petitioners was granted. It was authorized that the election be held annually, the third Tuesday of February, as provided by the constitution. The court decreed further that the first election be held October 13, 1894, at the wareroom of B. B. Kime, in the said borough, between the hours of eight o&#x27;clock A. M. and seven o&#x27;clock P. M., and designated S. J. Smith to give due notice of said election. The court appointed Andrew Patrick judge and William Lewis and D. I. Stadden inspectors.″

Popular singer Glen Campbell visited Glen Campbell in 1971. The distinguished academic Glenn Campbell did also at some point.

Michael William Menosky, a professional baseball player, also known as &quot;Leaping Mike&quot; for his speed and circus-like catches in the outfield, was born in Glen Campbell on October 16, 1894. At some point, the family moved about four miles away to Arcadia. Leaping Mike went on to play baseball from 1914 to 1930. He played for the Pittsburgh Rebels, Washington Senators, and the Boston Red Sox. He replaced Babe Ruth in left field after Babe Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, beginning what was referred to as &quot;the curse&quot; in Boston.

Glen Campbell, the first coal town in Indiana County, was founded in 1889. It was named for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company, the enterprise which initiated mining operations in the area. The town experienced immediate growth and soon a number of coal companies were operating in and around the community. The Hillsdale Coal &amp; Coke Company was formed in 1902 by H. E. Clark, J. D. Ake, S. H. Hicks and J. O. Clark. In 1905, The Clark Brothers Coal Mining Company was established by H. E. Clark, J. O. Clark and S. L. Clark.

In 1894, just five years after its inception, Glen Campbell was incorporated as a borough. The town quickly became the service, business, and shopping center for a number of smaller mining communities that sprang up in northern Indiana County.

By 1900 Glen Campbell was the third largest town in Indiana County. It also had the distinction of being the county&#x27;s fastest-growing community. In fact, residents of the community felt it was plausible that the county seat would someday be moved to Glen Campbell.

The town was serviced by both the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads. In addition to coal mining, there were a number of lumber mills. In 1905 the Giant Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company opened operations in Glen Campbell. The company provided electricity to communities in northern Indiana and southern Clearfield counties.

Other industries included a brickyard which was established on the Cush Creek, a stream that flows through the community, and a cooper&#x27;s shop which manufactured barrels. Later a battery factory was opened. There also were plans for the construction of a foundry and a furniture factory.

At its height of prosperity, the town had approximately sixty businesses. There was an opera house and a nickelodeon. The community boasted its own school system, which included a high school. There were a number of dentists and doctors. One doctor even operated an infirmary for the miners.


The borough had its own bank, the First National Bank of Glen Campbell. A number of newspapers were published in the town for instance, The Glen Campbell Comet, H. E. Williams, Publisher, and many social organizations sprang up.

Unfortunately, the bubble burst. Labor unrest, the decline in coal output, the depletion of timber stocks, and a number of disastrous fires left Glen Campbell in serious financial condition. The Great Depression dealt the town its final blow. The bank closed permanently, and a number of businesses either folded or moved elsewhere. The community never recovered.

Although its heyday has long since passed, the town still has the capability of attracting fame. It received national attention in 1971 when Glen Campbell, the country music singer, made a surprise visit. The trip was featured in a TV Guide article later that year.

Although no longer the size it once was, Glen Campbell continues to function in its own right. The town&#x27;s fire company provides fire protection to a number of communities in the area. Its three churches (Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic) all have active congregations. Social organizations include the American Legion and the Glen Campbell Fireman&#x27;s Auxiliary. The town&#x27;s post office still provides rural services to a large area surrounding the borough. There are a number of businesses, including some which are coal related, that call Glen Campbell home.

The Sen. Joseph O. Clark House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. This house is located in the area referred to by locals as &quot;Candy Bank&quot; or 247 First Avenue. Joseph O. Clark was a state senator from 1921 to 1924 for the 37th district. He was a Republican. He was &quot;Born in Montgomery Township, Indiana County, September 7, 1871, the son of John W. and Adah S. (Hiddlesen) Clark; educated in public schools; Dickinson Seminary (Williamsport); Germantown Academy; Eastman Business College, Poughkeepsie; partner in lumber business at Glen Campbell, Pa.; organizer and board member, First National Bank, Glen Campbell; elected president of same, 1905; investor and director of numerous coal, oil, water, glass, and electric companies throughout the United States; president of Royal Oil and Gas Co., 1936; elected to state Senate, 1921-1924; died July 21, 1936.″&#x27;

<text>Heilwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 711 at the time of the 2010 census.
==History==
===Early history and development===
In 1850, a portion of Wheatfield Township (located in Indiana County, Pennsylvania) was sectioned off to create Pine Township, named for its extensive pine forests. Here, J. M. Guthrie established a logging settlement consisting of five frame houses, a store room, stables, a blacksmith shop, and several other outbuildings in the 1880s. Over time, the area came to be known as Possum Glory—Edward R. Sutton, an employee of Guthrie&#x27;s, is credited with coining the name due to the preponderance of possums in the area.

By 1894, the lumber business had diminished significantly; Guthrie was facing difficult financial times and his lands were sold at a sheriff&#x27;s sale in June 1896 to J. M. Stewart of Indiana, Pennsylvania. The area was underlaid with coal and four years later Stewart would sell to Philadelphia industrialist John Heisley Weaver, founder of J. H. Weaver &amp; Company, Handlers of Coal and Coke. Weaver accumulated considerable holdings in Pine, Green, and Cherryhill Townships and by 1904 was ready to begin building a “model town” to support his expanding mining operations nearby, which he named “Heilwood,” and was probably a combination of his nickname (“Heil”) and the name of his first coal mine in Kingwood (Preston County), West Virginia (“Heisleywood”). 

This concept involved building, from the ground up, a fully-functioning modern town with amenities typical for the time, such as a school, church, boarding house, company store, policing, hotel, and a hospital. Designed to directly support mining, it would only operate as long as the mine remained viable. In theory, the company provided construction capital and filled some roles of a local government, such as maintaining public spaces and paying the salary of certain school officials, while workers and their families rented housing on a monthly basis. In practice, this meant employees found many aspects of their lives dictated by company policy, enjoyed limited freedom of movement, and did not have equitable access to housing—typical immigrant families would be provided only with a small, uninsulated shanty, and after the death or unemployment of a miner his family had as few as five days to vacate their home. Still, life in a model town with these conveniences, guaranteed work, and a stable community were preferable to the lives many left behind and by 1905, 494 men were employed across five mine complexes, producing approximately 100,000 tons of coal annually. 

The Penn Mary Coal Company (a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania and Maryland Steel Companies) purchased John H. Weaver&#x27;s western Pennsylvania holdings for $1.8 million in 1906. Following the purchase, the Penn Mary Coal Company appointed Harry P. Dowler to replace James Starford as General Superintendent. The &quot;Indiana Evening Gazette&quot; reported that the newly appointed Dowler would receive a “snug salary” of $6,000 a year, plus rent—in stark contrast to the shanty town skirting Heilwood, he resided in a stately Greek-revival mansion on a leafy avenue reserved for supervisory personnel and featuring luxuries such as indoor plumbing.
Dowler aggressively expanded operations, and over the next four years opened four new mines and introduced innovative new processes, such as the use of an incline plane at mines #5 and #7, first aid training, and emergency response teams. Additionally, he would achieve Heilwood&#x27;s peak production in 1909 of 888,058 tons, and employed 900 men by 1911. He also continued expanding the town, overseeing construction of a new school, company offices, the Catholic church, additional housing for the miners, and homes for supervisory personnel. By 1913, Heilwood was largely complete, although an additional school and gymnasium were constructed later. 

===Leadership changes===
In August 1914, the Penn Mary Coal Company was purchased by the Cambria Steel Company of Johnstown (formerly the Cambria Iron Works). All upper management personnel were replaced, and H. J. Meehan was named the General Superintendent. Cambria Steel maintained ownership of the Heilwood complex until 1916, when the Bethlehem Steel Company of Johnstown took over. Following the takeover, Thomas Richards Johns, the highly successful former general manager of the Ebensburg Coal Company, became Superintendent. Over the next several years, Bethlehem Steel Company invested over $500,000 in improvements to the Heilwood mining complex and opened mines #9 and #11, which would operate until 1946 and 1959 respectively. Despite the numerous changes in ownership, the coal mines in and around Heilwood retained the Penn Mary name until 1921, when all of the mines became known as Bethlehem Mines. Heilwood&#x27;s first and only miner&#x27;s union was chartered in 1936 under Bethlehem and made possible as a result of strong pro-labor laws during the Great Depression; previously, harsh anti-union tactics and paying above market rates for labor had previously succeeded in preventing unionization and avoided major strikes. 

In 1936, the Bethlehem Mines Corporation was dissolved and replaced by a new company, the Industrial Collieries Corporation. Industrial Collieries managed the mines until 1940, when the operation was leased to the Redlands Coal Company, a subsidiary of J. H. Weaver Company of Philadelphia – the very group that had opened the first Heilwood mines in 1904. This lease arrangement continued until 1943, at which point the Redlands Coal Company purchased the mines from Bethlehem Steel. It was during this time the Monroe Coal Company (another subsidiary of the J. H. Weaver Company) acting as a real estate agency, began selling the houses and lots to the residents of Heilwood as mining was no longer profitable enough to justify the expense of running a private town.

===Sale and closure of mines===
The Redlands Coal Company continued to run the mines until 1948, when they sold them back to Bethlehem Steel, which operated them for another year before selling them to the Pine Township Coal Company. The Pine Township Coal Company continued to operate until 1959, when the final remaining mine, #11, was exhausted and closed for good. 

Following the closure of mine #11 and without any other significant industry, Heilwood became less viable as a large, independent town and most residents moved to neighboring cities. All told, it is a remarkable history for a town designed to be temporary, and memories of its proud past as well as of those who were born, lived, worked, and died there are preserved online at Heilwood.com and in the Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s T. R. Johns Collection, and at the Indiana County Historical Society and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

<text>Nordwestmecklenburg (&quot;Northwestern Mecklenburg&quot;) is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north-western part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is situated on the coast of the Baltic Sea and borders on Schleswig-Holstein to the west. Neighboring districts are (from east clockwise) Rostock, Ludwigslust-Parchim and the district-free city Schwerin, and the district Lauenburg and the district-free city Lübeck in Schleswig-Holstein. The district seat is the town Wismar.

==Geography==
The district is roughly situated in a triangle between the towns of Lübeck, Rostock and Schwerin.

In the north there is the coast of the Baltic Sea with the small island of Poel.

===Lakes===
Two large lakes are partially situated in Nordwestmecklenburg: the eastern half of the Schaalsee () at the western border; and the northern half of the Schweriner See () in the south, as well as two smaller lakes, Bibowsee () and Mechower See ().
==History==
Nordwestmecklenburg District was established in 1994 by merging the previous districts of Gadebusch, Grevesmühlen and Wismar; along with smaller parts of the districts of Sternberg and Schwerin-Land. In the 2011 district reform, it was merged with the formerly district-free town Wismar. The name of the district was decided by referendum on 4 September 2011.

==Coat of arms==
“Party per pale Or and Azure, dexter the half crowned bull&#x27;s head Sable of Mecklenburg, sinister a bishopric staff Or”. The staff symbolizes the diocese of Ratzeburg, which in 1648 became the Principality of Ratzeburg. It also stands for the diocese of Schwerin. Also the Hanseatic city of Wismar is represented in red-white.

The coat of arms was designed by the designer and heraldic Heinz Kippnick, and was granted on July 1, 1996.

==Towns and municipalities==

===Former municipalities===
The following municipalities that were independently administrative within the district were (situation August 2011):

* Börzow - formerly part of Grevesmühlen-Land Amt; now part of Stepenitztal since 25 May 2014
* Mallentin - formerly part of Grevesmühlen-Land Amt; now part of Stepenitztal since 25 May 2014

<text>In mathematics, a tuple is a finite sequence or &quot;ordered list&quot; of numbers or, more generally, mathematical objects, which are called the &quot;elements&quot; of the tuple. An -tuple is a tuple of elements, where is a non-negative integer. There is only one 0-tuple, called the &quot;empty tuple&quot;. A 1-tuple and a 2-tuple are commonly called a singleton and an ordered pair, respectively. The term &quot;infinite tuple&quot; is occasionally used for &quot;infinite sequences&quot;.

Tuples are usually written by listing the elements within parentheses &quot;&quot; and separated by commas; for example, denotes a 5-tuple. Other types of brackets are sometimes used, although they may have a different meaning.

An -tuple can be formally defined as the image of a function that has the set of the first natural numbers as its domain.
Tuples may be also defined from ordered pairs by a recurrence starting from ordered pairs; indeed, an -tuple can be identified with the ordered pair of its first elements and its th element.

In computer science, tuples come in many forms. Most typed functional programming languages implement tuples directly as product types, tightly associated with algebraic data types, pattern matching, and destructuring assignment. Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as record types, featuring unordered elements accessed by label. A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in C structs and Haskell records. Relational databases may formally identify their rows (records) as &quot;tuples&quot;.

Tuples also occur in relational algebra; when programming the semantic web with the Resource Description Framework (RDF); in linguistics; and in philosophy.

==Etymology==
The term originated as an abstraction of the sequence: single, couple/double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, ..., ‑tuple, ..., where the prefixes are taken from the Latin names of the numerals. The unique 0-tuple is called the &quot;null tuple&quot; or &quot;empty tuple&quot;. A 1‑tuple is called a &quot;single&quot; (or &quot;singleton&quot;), a 2‑tuple is called an &quot;ordered pair&quot; or &quot;couple&quot;, and a 3‑tuple is called a &quot;triple&quot; (or &quot;triplet&quot;). The number can be any nonnegative integer. For example, a complex number can be represented as a 2‑tuple of reals, a quaternion can be represented as a 4‑tuple, an octonion can be represented as an 8‑tuple, and a sedenion can be represented as a 16‑tuple.

Although these uses treat &quot;‑uple&quot; as the suffix, the original suffix was &quot;‑ple&quot; as in &quot;triple&quot; (three-fold) or &quot;decuple&quot; (ten‑fold). This originates from medieval Latin &quot;plus&quot; (meaning &quot;more&quot;) related to Greek ‑πλοῦς, which replaced the classical and late antique &quot;‑plex&quot; (meaning &quot;folded&quot;), as in &quot;duplex&quot;.

==Properties==
The general rule for the identity of two -tuples is
: formula_1 if and only if formula_2.

Thus a tuple has properties that distinguish it from a set:
# A tuple may contain multiple instances of the same element, so tuple formula_3; but set formula_4.
# Tuple elements are ordered: tuple formula_5, but set formula_6.
# A tuple has a finite number of elements, while a set or a multiset may have an infinite number of elements.

==Definitions==

There are several definitions of tuples that give them the properties described in the previous section.

===Tuples as functions===
The formula_7-tuple may be identified as the empty function. For formula_8 the formula_9-tuple formula_10 may be identified with the (surjective) function 
:formula_11

with domain 
:formula_12

and with codomain 
:formula_13

that is defined at formula_14 by
:formula_15

That is, formula_16 is the function defined by
:formula_17

in which case the equality 

:formula_18

necessarily holds.

;Tuples as sets of ordered pairs

Functions are commonly identified with their graphs, which is a certain set of ordered pairs. 
Indeed, many authors use graphs as the definition of a function. 
Using this definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above function formula_16 can be defined as:

:formula_20

===Tuples as nested ordered pairs===
Another way of modeling tuples in set theory is as nested ordered pairs. This approach assumes that the notion of ordered pair has already been defined.
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set formula_21.
# An -tuple, with , can be defined as an ordered pair of its first entry and an -tuple (which contains the remaining entries when :
#: formula_22
This definition can be applied recursively to the -tuple:
: formula_23

Thus, for example:
: formula_24

A variant of this definition starts &quot;peeling off&quot; elements from the other end:
# The 0-tuple is the empty set formula_21.
# For :
#: formula_26
This definition can be applied recursively:
: formula_27

Thus, for example:
: formula_28

===Tuples as nested sets===
Using Kuratowski&#x27;s representation for an ordered pair, the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure set theory:
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set formula_21;
# Let formula_30 be an -tuple formula_31, and let formula_32. Then, formula_33. (The right arrow, formula_34, could be read as &quot;adjoined with&quot;.)

In this formulation:
: formula_35

==-tuples of -sets ==

In discrete mathematics, especially combinatorics and finite probability theory, -tuples arise in the context of various counting problems and are treated more informally as ordered lists of length . -tuples whose entries come from a set of elements are also called &quot;arrangements with repetition&quot;, &quot;permutations of a multiset&quot; and, in some non-English literature, &quot;variations with repetition&quot;. The number of -tuples of an -set is . This follows from the combinatorial rule of product. If is a finite set of cardinality , this number is the cardinality of the -fold Cartesian power . Tuples are elements of this product set.

== Type theory ==
In type theory, commonly used in programming languages, a tuple has a product type; this fixes not only the length, but also the underlying types of each component. Formally:
: formula_36
and the projections are term constructors:
: formula_37

The tuple with labeled elements used in the relational model has a record type. Both of these types can be defined as simple extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus.

The notion of a tuple in type theory and that in set theory are related in the following way: If we consider the natural model of a type theory, and use the Scott brackets to indicate the semantic interpretation, then the model consists of some sets formula_38 (note: the use of italics here that distinguishes sets from types) such that:
: formula_39
and the interpretation of the basic terms is:
: formula_40.

The -tuple of type theory has the natural interpretation as an -tuple of set theory:
: formula_41
The unit type has as semantic interpretation the 0-tuple.

<doc id="132730" wikidata="Q125649" url="?curid=132730" title="William III of the Netherlands">
<text>William III (Dutch: &quot;Willem Alexander Paul Frederik Lodewijk&quot;; English: &quot;William Alexander Paul Frederick Louis&quot;; 19 February 1817 – 23 November 1890) was King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 1849 until his death in 1890. He was also the Duke of Limburg from 1849 until the abolition of the duchy in 1866.

William was the son of King William II and Anna Pavlovna of Russia. On the abdication of his grandfather William I in 1840, he became the Prince of Orange. On the death of his father in 1849, he succeeded as king of the Netherlands.

William married his cousin Sophie of Württemberg in 1839 and they had three sons, William, Maurice, and Alexander, all of whom predeceased him. After Sophie&#x27;s death in 1877 he married Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1879 and they had one daughter Wilhelmina, who succeeded William to the Dutch throne. Meanwhile, being the last agnatic dynastic descendant of Otto I, Count of Nassau, the throne of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg passed to his patrilineal seventeenth cousin once removed (and matrilineal third cousin), Adolphe. , he is the last Dutch monarch to die whilst on the throne as all his successors have abdicated in favor of their children.

==Early life==
William was born on 19 February 1817 in the Palace of the Nation in Brussels, which was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time. He was the eldest son of the future king William II of the Netherlands and Anna Pavlovna of Russia. He had three brothers, one of whom died in infancy, and one sister. William was particularly close to his brother Alexander, who was only 18 months his junior and for the most part was raised alongside him. As adults the two princes shared a passion for outdoor pursuits like shooting, riding and falconry as well as horse racing. Both were active members of the Royal Loo Hawking Club, which drew a large crowd of hunting enthusiasts to Het Loo Palace during the 1840s and early 1850s. William and Alexander also shared a deep frustration at not being given any meaningful tasks in the military. Alexander, who had a lively, amiable, tactful personality, got on well with his hot headed, capricious brother. His death at age 29 was a great loss to William, who counted him a true friend. He never became close to his youngest brother Henry, who was painfully shy, easily embarrassed and anxious to avoid incurring William&#x27;s wrath.

William and his brothers were raised by military men (their governors were distinguished officers decorated with the Military Order of William) and expected to join the military. In 1827, at the age of ten, William was made an honorary colonel in the Royal Netherlands Army by his grandfather. In the 1830s, he served as lieutenant in the Grenadiers Regiment and studied at Leiden University for a while, though without attempting to attain any degree. In 1834, during a visit to his maternal uncle Tsar Nicholas I, he was made honorary commander of the Grenadiers Regiment of Kiev nr. 5 in the Imperial Russian Army.

He married his first cousin, Sophie, daughter of King William I of Württemberg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, in Stuttgart on 18 June 1839. This marriage was unhappy and was characterized by struggles about their children. Sophie was a liberal intellectual, hating everything leaning toward dictatorship, such as the army. William was simpler, more conservative, and loved the military. He prohibited intellectual exercise at home, for which action Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who corresponded with Princess Sophie, called him an uneducated farmer. His extramarital enthusiasms, however, led the &quot;New York Times&quot; to call him &quot;the greatest debauchee of the age&quot;. Another cause of marital tension (and later political tension) was his capriciousness; he could rage against someone one day, and be extremely polite the next. The situation was made worse by Sophie, who made no secret of the fact she had never wanted to marry William in the first place and considered herself intellectually superior to him. She could be very dramatic, often complaining about her suffering and her wish to die and expressing negative opinions about pretty much everyone who crossed her path in The Netherlands, especially her inlaws.

William struggled with his position as heir to the throne. Upon his father&#x27;s investiture as king in 1840 he was made Inspector-General of Infantry and promoted to Lieutenant-General. The position was purely honorary and William relinquished it only 5 years later. His father gave him no role in politics and did little to prepare him for his future role.

William loathed the 1848 constitutional changes initiated by his father (William II) and Johan Rudolf Thorbecke. His father saw them as key to the monarchy&#x27;s survival in changing times. Sophie, who was a liberal, also shared this view. William himself saw them as useless limitations of royal power, and would have preferred to govern as an enlightened despot in the mold of his grandfather, William I.

He considered relinquishing his right to the throne to his older son. His mother convinced him to cancel this action. The Dutch constitution provided no way to relinquish one&#x27;s claim to the throne.

On 17 March 1849, his father died and William succeeded to the throne of the Netherlands. He was at that moment a guest of the Duchess of Cleveland in Raby Castle. Representatives of the Dutch government traveled to London to meet their new king. William was reluctant to return, but he was convinced to do so. Upon arrival the new queen welcomed her spouse with the question &quot;did you accept?&quot;. The new king nodded, but he remained uncertain about the matter for some time.

==Reign==

William repeatedly contemplated abdicating as soon as his eldest son William, Prince of Orange, turned eighteen. This occurred in 1858, but as William was uncomfortable making a decision he remained king. His first act was the inauguration of the parliamentary cabinet of Thorbecke, the liberal designer of the 1848 constitution, whom William loathed.

When the Roman Catholic hierarchy of bishops was restored in 1853, he found growing conservative support and a reason to dismiss Thorbecke. In the first two decades of his reign, he dismissed several cabinets and disbanded the States-General several times, installing royal cabinets which ruled as long as there was support in the elected second chamber of parliament.

In what became known as the &quot;Luxembourg Coup of 1856&quot;, William unilaterally instituted a new, reactionary constitution for Luxembourg, which he ruled personally, separate from the Dutch crown.

In 1867, France offered to buy Luxembourg, leading to the Luxembourg Crisis, which almost precipitated war between Prussia and France. However, the subsequent Second Treaty of London confirmed Luxembourg as a fully independent country.

During his reign, the king became more and more unpopular with his bourgeois-liberal subjects, his whims provoking their resistance and mockery, but remained quite popular with the common man.

The king was a man of immense stature and with a boisterous voice. He could be gentle and kind, then suddenly he could become intimidating and even violent. He kicked and hit his servants about. He was inclined to terrorize and humiliate his courtiers. The king was cruel to animals as well. His ministers were afraid of him. Most people around him agreed that he was, to some degree, insane.

The king could be erratic, he ordered the dismissal and even the arrest and execution of those that he found in lack of respect, including a Mayor of The Hague. Orders like these were disregarded. The king who thought of himself as a specialist on all matters military frequently tried to take command of manoeuvres, creating chaos wherever he went.

In 1877, Queen Sophie died and years of war in the palace came to an end. In the same year, King William announced his intention to marry Émilie Ambre, a French opera singer, whom he ennobled as countess d&#x27;Ambroise – without government consent. Under pressure from society and the government, he abandoned these marriage plans.

William remained eager to remarry. In 1878, he first proposed to his niece, Princess Elisabeth Sybille of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. He then considered marriage with Princess Pauline of Waldeck and Pyrmont, a small German principality, and Princess Thyra of Denmark, who had her own private scandalous history.

He finally decided to marry Pauline&#x27;s younger sister Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont. Some politicians were quite angry, as she was 41 years the king&#x27;s junior. Emma showed herself, however, as a cordial woman. William asked permission from parliament, this was easily granted. The couple were quickly married in Bad Arolsen on 7 January 1879.

Emma had a relieving influence on William&#x27;s capricious personality and the marriage was extremely happy. The last decade was without any doubt the best of his reign. The king had stopped interfering with most aspects of government. In 1880, Wilhelmina was born. She became heir presumptive in 1884 after the death of the last remaining son from William&#x27;s first marriage. Many potential male heirs had died between 1878 and 1884.

King William became seriously ill in 1887. He was suffering from a kidney ailment. However, in 1888, he personally presented a gold medal of honor to the lifeboat hero Dorus Rijkers, for saving the lives of 20 people.

In 1888 and 1889, the ailing king became increasingly demented. The Council of State and then Queen Emma became regents. William III died at Het Loo Palace in 1890. Because Wilhelmina had not yet reached adulthood, Emma became regent for her daughter. She would remain regent until Wilhelmina&#x27;s eighteenth birthday in 1898.

==Family and issue==
Of William III&#x27;s four legitimate children, three reached adulthood, two sons from his marriage to Queen Sophie and one daughter from his marriage to Queen Emma:
* &quot;Willem&quot; Nicolaas Alexander Frederik Karel Hendrik (1840–1879), heir apparent to the throne from 1849 to his death
* Willem Frederik &quot;Maurits&quot; Alexander Hendrik Karel (1843–1850)
* Willem &quot;Alexander&quot; Karel Hendrik Frederik (1851–1884), heir apparent to the throne from 1879 to his death
* Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Maria (1880–1962), Queen of the Netherlands from 1890 to 1948

Standing at 196 cm (6&#x27;5&quot;) he was an exceptionally large and strong man. William III was known to be a philanderer and had several dozen illegitimate children from various mistresses.

<text>Homer City is a borough in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,746 at the 2020 census. Homer City is located in the Indiana metro area. The community was named for the famous Greek poet Homer by founder William Wilson in 1854. It was incorporated as a borough on Thursday, September 26, 1872.

==History==
The two treaties of Fort Stanwix (of 1768 and, after American independence, of 1784) secured the westward expansion of Pennsylvania into the region where the Borough of Homer City is now located, on land inhabited by the six Indian nations. With white settlement these new territories were initially organized as part of existing counties in eastern and central Pennsylvania. White settlers were few in the eighteenth century and encountering Indians still very much a part of daily life. Any degree of stability and safety came only after the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794). Indiana County was carved out of Westmoreland and Lycoming counties in 1803 and divided into three townships: Wheatfield, Armstrong, and Mahoning. The confluence of Two Lick and Yellow creeks (present-day Homer City) was a contender for the seat of government for the new county, but instead the &quot;extraordinary overtures&quot; of George Clymer, a local landowners and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, saw the county seat situated instead in what would become the Borough of Indiana. Center Township - the unincorporated area surrounding present-day Homer City - was created from a portion of Armstrong Township in 1807, its landscape dotted with larger and smaller family homesteads (farms) and an increasing number of mills and trading posts.

Parts of Center Township were settled early on by Scots-Irish Presbyterians as in other parts of Indiana County, but Methodist families of English and Welsh descent came to dominate the Homer City area, and they remained prominent in its civic and commercial life well into the twentieth century. William Wilson laid out the village of Homer in 1854 naming it after the Classical Greek poet. For several years, however, its post office was designated Phillips Mill (or Mills on some maps), a name derived from that of early settler Armour Phillips Sr. When the village became a borough in 1872 - with the consolidation and annexation of neighboring parcels - more and more it was referred to as Homer &quot;City&quot;.

With a post office and a stop (later station) on the Pennsylvania Railroad line, the Borough of Homer City developed along the lines of many small towns in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It traditionally offered goods and services including merchants, a bank, medical professionals, craftsmen, and schools not only to borough residents, but also to inhabitants of surrounding, rural Center Township. The township&#x27;s development took a different path. Enduring settlements beyond family homesteads awaited the establishment of villages (company towns) by coal companies in the early twentieth century. More often than not they bore the names of the companies, their owners, families and company executives (e.g., Waterman, Graceton, Luciusboro) as in other parts of Indiana County.

The general prosperity of the post-World War II era saw the greater affluence of Homer City and Center Township residents, better (wider, paved) roads and increased automobile ownership leading to the expansion of residential areas at the edges of Homer City and into the once rural farmland of Center Township - in the form of sub-developments and individually owned homesteads (non-agricultural lots). These trends have continued with newer developments such as Red Maple Drive and Mystic Rock on Route 56 in Center Township and the housing developments outside the village of Lucerne (Mines).

The Homer-Center School District has boundaries coterminous with the Borough of Homer City and surrounding Center Township. This fact, combined with the use of &quot;Homer City&quot; as a mailing address and telephone exchange, has often blurred the boundaries of the Borough and Center Township even though they remain distinct political entities. Residences and businesses beyond the confines of the Borough (and even beyond those of Center Township) can possess &quot;Homer City&quot; mailing addresses and telephone numbers. Examples include the Homer City Generating Station and Non-Lethal Technologies, both of which are referenced in this article.

A novella called The Roving Red Rangers &quot;or Laura Lamar of the Susquehanna&quot; by Charles Asbury Robinson, was set in the Homer City area. It was published by the author in 1902. It has often been erroneously understood as a work of non-fiction and given rise to mistaken notions about local history, especially when the name &quot;Laura Lamar&quot; derived from a character in this novella was suggested and adopted as the name of the local school district in the 1952.

== Contemporary Homer City ==
Businesses within the borough that provide goods and services to residents include a bank, a grocery store, a dollar store, restaurants, hair salons, physicians&#x27; offices, a distillery and other service-oriented businesses. The community is served by the Borough of Homer City Police and the Homer City Volunteer Fire Department. Among the oldest existing structures in Homer City are its churches including Homer City United Methodist Church, Homer City United Presbyterian Church, Hope Evangelical Lutheran Church, Holy Protection (a.k.a. St. Mary&#x27;s) Byzantine Catholic Church and Saints Peter and Paul Orthodox Church.

The Homer City Generating Station, located in Center Township, has the tallest chimney in the United States and the third tallest in the world.

The borough&#x27;s local radio station is 1160 WCCS &quot;The Voice of Indiana County&quot;.

Homer City gained national and international prominence in the early twentieth century as the location of the Prairie State Incubator Company - particularly after its products appeared on display at various exhibitions and trade shows across the country. After its production facilities were twice destroyed by fire, the company built a new state-of-the-art &quot;fire-proof&quot; facility but ceased production shortly thereafter. In 1920 the same building became the new home of industrial toolmaker, the Syntron Company. (Its name derived from an early product known as the SYNchronous elecTRONic hammer). It was, for many years, the single largest employer within the boundaries of the Borough of Homer City. It continued to operate, after a merger, as a division of Chicago-based FMC Corporation until June 2007. Over the last several decades Homer City Generating Station, located in Center Township, has also made national news many times. Non-Lethal Technologies, Inc. has a Homer City address, even though its physical location is near Aultman and Jacksonville. The company manufactures CS Gas that has been used to suppress protests in Bahrain, Turkey and Greece. Each CS canister produced by the company shows the address of its manufacturer

==Events and Points of Interest==
===Hoodlebug trail===
The Hoodlebug Trail traverses the Borough of Homer City, leading north through Center Township to White Township and the outskirts of Indiana Borough and south through Center Township in the direction of Black Lick. This Rails-to-Trails initiative follows the route of the former Pennsylvania Railroad line and provides recreational opportunities for walkers, runners, and cyclists. A recent project by Indiana County Parks and Trails placed helpful signage along the Hoodlebug Trail and information kiosks describing historical and natural sights located on or adjacent to the trail. The name derives from the &quot;hoodlebug&quot;, or doodlebug, a self-propelled railroad car that ran from Indiana to Blairsville on the Pennsylvania Railroad line and provided local passenger and mail service. It ceased operations in 1940. Naming the trail after this piece of local history was suggested by Homer City resident Robert McAnulty.

===Floodway Park===
Floodway Park, bounded by North Main Street, Station Street, the Center Township boundary, and Yellow Creek, is a multi-use recreational site maintained by Homer-Center Parks and Recreation. It offers visitors two softball fields with bleachers, a pavilion with electricity, a walking trail, restroom facilities, parking for events and serves as a &quot;trailhead&quot; for the Hoodlebug Trail. Its name speaks volumes about the history of this section of the borough and the origins of the park itself. It is located on a natural flood plain adjacent to Yellow Creek Park, and it represents a different approach to land use: it can be developed and used on a regular basis, but in ways that do not profoundly inhibit the flood plain nor will structures built on the plain be ruined should severe flooding occur. Prior to the Flood of &#x27;77 the area was an extension of the Main Street/Downtown Business District. C. S. Kunkle Lumber, Sesti&#x27;s Restaurant, the Colonial Hotel, and the original location of Luther Ford Sales at one point all stood where the park is now found. (A residential neighborhood was located behind the businesses, too. On the opposite side of the creek the Empire - later Homer City - Theater dating to 1913 was another prominent structure.) The entire area was decimated by the Flood of 1977 with clean-up and restoration of the landscape lasting into the 1980s and the dedication of the park in the early 1990s.

===Caboose-Museum Site===

The Caboose-Museum Site (240 N. Main St), situated on a narrow strip of land between Floodway Park and the Hoodlebug Trail, is owned and operated by the Homer-Center Historical Society. The original museum is a re-purposed, vintage Pennsylvania Railroad caboose that houses artifacts, documents and research materials related to the history of the Borough of Homer City and Center Township. The adjacent Annex (a mini-barn) is used for larger displays and storage while the grounds themselves also display additional artifacts and a commemorative walkway made up of donated engraved bricks. The Caboose-Museum is open to visitors on Saturdays and Sundays from Memorial Day through Labor day and by appointment. The Historical Society partnered with the Borough of Homer City in its &quot;Local Hero&quot; Banner Program for Veterans. Over 140 2&#x27; x 5&#x27; banners honoring the military service of local individuals and donated by family and friends are mounted on utility poles along Main Street and adjacent side streets from Memorial Day through Veterans&#x27; Day.

===The Hoodlebug SummerFest===
The Hoodlebug Festival, organized by a committee of the Homer City Area Business Association, is a festival held in early September. It hosts a variety of games and activities for local residents. Originally named SummerFest when it was held in July, the festival&#x27;s name comes from the nickname of a passenger train service that was discontinued in the 1940s and its namesake, the Hoodlebug Trail.

===Homer City Auctions===
Every Spring, an equipment sale is hosted in Homer City; along with weekly livestock auctions, and a fall feeder (calf) sale.

<text>Indiana is a borough in and the county seat of Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 14,044 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Indiana, Pennsylvania micropolitan area, about northeast of Pittsburgh. It is a part of the greater Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton combined statistical area, as well as the Johnstown and Pittsburgh media markets.

The borough and the region as a whole promote itself as the &quot;Christmas Tree Capital of the World&quot; because the national Christmas Tree Growers Association was founded there. There are still many Christmas tree farms in the area. The largest employer in the borough today is Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the second-largest of 14 PASSHE schools in the state.

==History==

Indiana takes its name from Indiana County, which in turn gets its name from the &quot;Indiana grant&quot; of the First Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Indiana was founded in 1805 to be the new county&#x27;s seat from a grant of land by Founding Father George Clymer. By 1810, it had a population of 125.

On at least one occasion, an anti-slavery mob in Indiana rescued a fugitive slave from extradition back to slavery in the South. The town was also where James Moorhead, a local abolitionist leader, published several anti-slavery newspapers. The first of these was &quot;The Clarion of Freedom&quot;, founded in 1843. Moorhead eventually sold the &quot;Clarion&quot; and founded a new anti-slavery paper, the &quot;Indiana Independent,&quot; which he published until his death in 1857. The &quot;Independent&quot; was published by his son J. W. Moorhead after his death.

The &quot;Indiana Weekly Messenger&quot; was published in the town between 1874 and 1946.

The Downtown Indiana Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Also listed on the National Register are Breezedale, Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Railway Indiana Passenger Station, Silas M. Clark House, Graff&#x27;s Market, James Mitchell House, Old Indiana County Courthouse, Indiana Borough 1912 Municipal Building, Indiana Armory, Old Indiana County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and John Sutton Hall.

==Notable people==

Indiana was the birthplace and hometown of actor Jimmy Stewart (1908–1997), who was born there and lived at 104 North 7th Street. Despite the fact that he left the area upon graduating from high school, the town always followed his career closely, with the local newspaper periodically publishing rumors in his later years that Stewart planned to return there to live. On May 20, 1983, Stewart was given a 75th birthday celebration by the town. Before Stewart&#x27;s death, a museum to his memory was opened on the third floor of the local public library, and a bronze statue of Stewart was erected in his honor at the county courthouse during his 75th birthday. The town annually holds a Jimmy Stewart film festival as part of the town&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; holiday celebration.
Environmentalist author Edward Abbey (1927–1989) was born at the Indiana hospital and raised in Indiana and near the Indiana County towns and villages of Saltsburg, Home, and Tanoma. His first novel, &quot;Jonathan Troy&quot; (1954), is set entirely in a thinly disguised Indiana, and his novel &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1988), which he called his &quot;fat masterpiece&quot;, is an autobiographical account of his growing up in this area and his imagined attempt to return home after a lifetime spent mostly in the desert Southwest. His nonfiction book &quot;Appalachian Wilderness&quot; (1970) lovingly describes Indiana and Home. There is a Pennsylvania state historical marker for Abbey.

<text>Marion Center is a borough in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 413 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The village was laid out by John Park in 1841 and named Marion after the Revolutionary War hero General Francis Marion. The &quot;Indiana Register&quot; first advertised lots for sale on September 1, 1841. Marion became incorporated as a borough in June 1869. The post office used a name distinct from the town (Brady Post Office) until December 26, 1890, when both were changed to Marion Center. In 1885, New York banker Adrien Iselin purchased the Buffalo, Rochester, and Pittsburgh Railway. A branch near the Jefferson-Indiana County Line (Indiana Junction) led south into Indiana County ending at Vintondale. The tracks from Jefferson County into Indiana County were first laid near Juneau in October 1902. Trains ran through Marion Center by April 1903. The first passenger train stopped at Marion Center on May 3, 1904. The last train, the Hoodlbug, left on June 10, 1950.

Marion Center had a vibrant community life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Two hotels were erected on Main Street in the 19th century. Hotel Marion, built in 1879 by Alexander Adams, had 15 rooms and was three stories tall. It burned in the 1920s. The second hotel, Mahoning House, at the corner of Main and Manor Streets, occupied the site of the former general store operated by McLaughlin, Kinter, and Company. Horatio Simons converted it to a hotel on June 1, 1904. It was torn down in the 1930s to make way for Harry Black&#x27;s service station. A dentist office (operated by Dr. L. N. Park) and a pharmacy (operated by William Griffith) were located on Main Street near the store of H. P. Wetzel (located at Craig and Main Streets). By 1887, Wetzel had built a store measuring 20- by . He later added an additional to the store. He was succeeded by Frank Wetzel who operated a grocery store on the site until the 1940s.

A summer normal school operated in the borough in the early 20th century. Joseph Weaver instructed students during the approximately 12-week course. Passing the superintendent&#x27;s exam upon completion of the program licensed one to teach in the county&#x27;s common schools. The first school in Marion Center, a log building on North Manor Street, burned in 1834. Its first teacher was William Work. A second school was built on the same site in 1848. A third building was erected in the 1860s. The North Manor Street site became home to the area&#x27;s high school (1916–1929). It was torn down in the late 2000s to make way for a public park (named after famous local artist, Linton Park).

Pennsylvania Route 403 runs through the center of Marion Center, entering from the south where it becomes Manor Street at the borough line. It then turns west onto Main Street and reaches its northern terminus just west of the borough at U.S. Route 119. The two main streets of the borough run perpendicular to one another: Manor Street, north–south, and Main Street, east–west. Both streets are broken up by short, one-block alleys.

Marion Center is connected to the villages of Deckers Point (via Deckers Point Road, concurrent with Main Street to the borough line), Dixonville (via South Manor Street, concurrent with PA-403 to the borough line), and Rochester Mills (via Richmond Road). Though US-119 does not pass through the borough, it connects the town to the micropolitan area of Indiana to the south and the larger borough of Punxsutawney to the north.

One unnamed tributary of Pine Run flows through the borough. It runs generally east–west and flows just south of Park Avenue, connecting to Pine Run west of the borough line and east of U.S. Highway 119. This stream has two in-flows. The first is very narrow, being small enough to easily step across, and drains the east side of the hill in the southeast section of the borough. The second drains the west side of the same hill and connects to the main flow behind the post office near its intersection with South Manor Street. All three minor water flows are perennial (though the very narrow one does dry up when rainfall is low) and have sources within the borough limits. Pine Run connects to Crooked Creek (a tributary of the Allegheny River) about five miles (8 km) south of the borough.

==Education==

The borough is part of the Marion Center Area School District. The high school (Marion Center Area High School) and elementary school (W.A McCreery Elementary School) are located west of the borough between the borough line and U.S. Route 119.

On June 21, 2002, Sam Erwin walked into the school district office with a .32-caliber pistol. One secretary was injured attempting to escape over an embankment wall outside the office building, and the assistant to the superintendent was non-fatally wounded in the right leg after being shot by the assailant in the lobby of the district office. Indiana County police said the incident concerned a dispute Erwin had with the district over his wife, Nancy Erwin (formerly Mogle), an eighth grade algebra teacher, losing her teaching position in 2001 after teaching for 21 years. Sam Erwin pleaded guilty to one count of attempted criminal homicide and one count of aggravated assault. Nancy Erwin pleaded guilty to one count of complicity to aggravated assault. As a result, she lost her teaching license.

Roosevelt ordered all banks to close for a Bank Holiday on March 4. Instead of closing, Marion Center Bank pulled its screen down half-way and continued to operate.

In 1958, Marion Center Bank added a drive-thru window to its current facility. This was the first of its kind in Indiana County. A second lane was added in 1979. Marion Center Bank expanded to a second location in Clymer on December 6, 1984. Today, the bank has seven locations across Indiana, Jefferson, Armstrong, and Cambria counties: Dayton (1997), Big Run (1997), and Punxsutawney (2000).

<text>Saltsburg is a borough in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its location is in Western Pennsylvania, in the southwestern corner of Indiana County near its border with Westmoreland County.

The town was based on the construction of salt wells and the canals and railroad tracks that passed through it. Its population was 780 at the 2020 census.

==History==

On June 20, 1769, William Gray conducted the first survey in the Saltsburg area. Early settlers of the wooded region were mainly Scots-Irish immigrants, migrating west between 1768 and 1795. The settlers did not colonize the area near the Kiskiminetas River until 1795 because of Native Americans defending their land. 
The name &#x27;Saltsburg&#x27; was adopted because of the salt grain that flourished in the area. Around the years 1795–1798, a Mrs. Deemer was the first settler to prove salt was present in the Conemaugh River, about one mile above Saltsburg&#x27;s present site, in the town now known as Moween. Deemer produced a sample of salt by evaporating the water from the river.

In January 1817 the first sale of land was made to the Congregation of Saltsburg. In 1816-1817 Andrew Boggs purchased a large amount of land, which held the first town lots. The town was named with the common consent of the first settlers for the newly thriving salt industry. The town&#x27;s religion was mainly Presbyterian, which was also the denomination of the first church built in Saltsburg. The first house was built in 1820 and now is occupied with the Presbyterian Church.

The town quickly filled with merchants in the late 1820s and became a prosperous place to reside. John Carson became the first tailor in 1827. Daniel Davis was the first blacksmith in 1828, and George Johnston was the first merchant in 1829. The population of the town continued to grow, and in 1838, the town was declared a borough. In 1840 the estimated population was 335.

The primary means of transportation in the area were on foot, carriage, train, or boat. The canal and railroad were major trade conduits for the town and the region. As the town grew it became a site for the passage of the mainline canal from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh. Coal and salt were transported along the canal and boat-building became one of the chief industries of the town. In 1835 and 1836, Robert Young, Butler Meyers, and Jacob Newhouse opened the first canal-boat construction business in the town. In 1855 the railroad bridge was built, with Major S.S. Jameson as the contractor and with the help of the principal mason John Marth. By 1864 the railroad brought an end to the canal era. The growth of the town was minimal until coalmines became prevalent in the 1870s.

Dr. John McFarland, a graduate of Jefferson Medical College, was the town&#x27;s first physician; he came to Saltsburg in 1836. McFarland was also the director of the Indiana County Medical Society and an instructor at the Saltsburg Academy. He served in the state House of Representatives from 1845 to 1846 and became one of the first directors of the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad. The first school was a log house located closer to the trestlework or railroad bridge. John Whittlesey was the first teacher, and John Bucklin was the second. The Saltsburg Academy was established in 1852.

<text>Isaac Rosenberg (25 November 1890 – 1 April 1918) was an English poet and artist. His &quot;Poems from the Trenches&quot; are recognized as some of the most outstanding poetry written during the First World War.

==Early life==
Isaac Rosenberg was born in Bristol on 25 November 1890 at 5 Adelaide Place near St. Mary Redcliffe. He was the second of six children and the eldest son (his twin brother died at birth) of his parents, Barnett (formerly Dovber) and Hacha Rosenberg, who were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Britain from Dvinsk (now in Latvia). In 1897, the family moved to Stepney, a poor district of the East End of London, and one with a large Jewish community. Isaac Rosenberg attended St. Paul&#x27;s Primary School at Wellclose Square, St George in the East parish. Later, he went to the Baker Street Board School in Stepney, which had a strong Jewish presence. In 1902, he received a good conduct award and was allowed to take classes at the Arts and Crafts School in Stepney Green. In December 1904, he left the Baker Street School, and in January 1905, started an apprenticeship with Carl Hentschel, an engraver from Fleet Street.

He became interested in both poetry and visual art, and started to attend evening classes at Birkbeck College. He withdrew from his apprenticeship in January 1911, as he had managed to find the finances to attend the Slade School of Fine Art at University College, London (UCL). During his time at Slade School, Rosenberg notably studied alongside David Bomberg, Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, Dora Carrington, William Roberts, and Christopher Nevinson. He was taken up by Laurence Binyon and Edward Marsh, and began to write poetry seriously, but he suffered from ill-health. He published a pamphlet of ten poems, &quot;Night and Day&quot;, in 1912. He also exhibited paintings at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1914.

Afraid that his chronic bronchitis would worsen, Rosenberg hoped to cure himself by relocating in 1914 to the warmer climate of South Africa, where his sister Mina lived in Cape Town. The Jewish Educational Aid Society of London helped by paying the fare.

After arriving in Cape Town in the end of June 1914, he composed a poem &quot;On Receiving News of the War&quot;. While many wrote about war as patriotic sacrifice, Rosenberg was critical of it from the outset. However, feeling better and hoping to find employment as an artist in Britain, Rosenberg returned home in March 1915. He published a second collection of poems, &quot;Youth&quot; and then after being unable to find a permanent job enlisted in the British Army at the end of October 1915. He asked that half of his pay be sent to his mother.

In a personal letter, Rosenberg described his attitude towards war, &quot;I never joined the army for patriotic reasons. Nothing can justify war. I suppose we must all fight to get the trouble over.&quot;

==First World War==

Rosenberg was assigned to the 12th Bantam Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment, a &quot;bantam&quot; being a designation for men under the usual minimum height of 5&#x27;3&quot;. After apparently declining promotion to lance corporal, Rosenberg was transferred, first, to the South Lancashire Regiment, then to the King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment (KORL). He was sent with his unit to serve on the Western Front in France, where he arrived on 3 June 1916. He continued to write poetry while serving in the trenches, including &quot;Break of Day in the Trenches&quot;, &quot;Returning We Hear the Larks&quot;, and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Dump&quot;. In December 1916, &quot;Poetry&quot; Magazine published two of his poems.

In January 1917, Rosenberg reported being sick and his family and friends asked his superiors to remove him from the front lines; he was transferred to the Fortieth Division Works Battalion and started to deliver barbed wire to the trenches. He wrote his poem &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Dump&quot; during this period. In June, he was temporarily assigned to the 229 Field Company, Royal Engineers. In September 1916, he spent ten days in London on leave. After returning to his old unit, he fell sick in October and spent two months in the 51st General Hospital. After release, he was transferred to the 1st Battalion of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment. He applied for a transfer to an all-Jewish battalion, but historians have been unable to trace his application.

On 21 March 1918, the German Army started its Spring Offensive on the Western Front. A week later, Rosenberg sent his last letter with the poem &quot;Through These Pale Cold Days&quot; to England before going to the front lines with reinforcements. Having just finished a night patrol, he was killed on the night of 1 April 1918 with another ten KORL soldiers; there is a dispute as to whether his death occurred at the hands of a sniper or in close combat. In either case, he died in a town called Fampoux, northeast of Arras. He was first buried in a mass grave, but in 1926 the unidentified remains of the six KORL soldiers were individually re-interred at Bailleul Road East Cemetery, Plot V, Saint-Laurent-Blangy, Pas de Calais, France. Rosenberg&#x27;s gravestone is marked with his name and the words, &quot;Buried near this spot&quot;, as well as – &quot;Artist and Poet&quot;.

<text>Robert Laurence Binyon, CH (10 August 1869 – 10 March 1943) was an English poet, dramatist and art scholar. Born in Lancaster, England, his parents were Frederick Binyon, a clergyman, and Mary Dockray. He studied at St Paul&#x27;s School, London and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry in 1891. He worked for the British Museum from 1893 until his retirement in 1933. In 1904 he married the historian Cicely Margaret Powell, with whom he had three daughters, including the artist Nicolete Gray.

Moved by the casualties of the British Expeditionary Force in 1914, Binyon wrote his most famous work &quot;For the Fallen&quot;, which is often recited at Remembrance Sunday services in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. In 1915, he volunteered as a hospital orderly in France and afterwards worked in England, helping to take care of the wounded of the Battle of Verdun. He wrote about these experiences in &quot;For Dauntless France&quot;, re-released as a centenary edition in 2018 as &quot;The Call and the Answer&quot;. After the war, he continued his career at the British Museum, writing numerous books on art.

He was appointed Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University in 1933. Between 1933 and his death in 1943, he published his translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. His war poetry includes a poem about the London Blitz, &quot;The Burning of the Leaves&quot;, regarded by many as his masterpiece.

==Early life==
Laurence Binyon was born in Lancaster, Lancashire, England. His parents were Frederick Binyon, a clergyman of the Church of England, and Mary Dockray. Mary&#x27;s father, Robert Benson Dockray, was a main engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway. His forebears were Quakers.

Binyon studied at St Paul&#x27;s School, London. Then he read Classics (&quot;Honour Moderations&quot;) at Trinity College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry in 1891.

Immediately after graduating in 1893, Binyon started working for the Department of Printed Books of the British Museum, writing catalogues for the museum and art monographs for himself. In 1895 his first book, &quot;Dutch Etchers of the Seventeenth Century&quot;, was published. In that same year, Binyon moved into the museum&#x27;s Department of Prints and Drawings, under Campbell Dodgson. In 1909, Binyon became its Assistant Keeper.

1913, he was made the Keeper of the new Sub-Department of Oriental Prints and Drawings. Around then, he played a crucial role in the formation of Modernism in London by introducing young Imagist poets such as Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington and H.D. to East Asian visual art and literature. Many of Binyon&#x27;s books produced at the museum were influenced by his own sensibilities as a poet although some were works of plain scholarship, such as his four-volume catalogue of all of the museum&#x27;s English drawings and his seminal catalogue of Chinese and Japanese prints.

In 1904 he married historian Cicely Margaret Powell, and the couple had three daughters. During those years, Binyon belonged to a circle of artists, as a regular patron of the Vienna Café in Oxford Street. His fellow intellectuals there were Ezra Pound, Sir William Rothenstein, Walter Sickert, Charles Ricketts, Lucien Pissarro and Edmund Dulac.

Binyon&#x27;s reputation before the First World War was such that on the death of the Poet Laureate Alfred Austin in 1913, Binyon was among the names mentioned in the press as his likely successor. Others named included Thomas Hardy, John Masefield and Rudyard Kipling, with the post going to Robert Bridges.

==&quot;For the Fallen&quot;==

Moved by the opening of what was then called the Great War and the already-high number of casualties of the British Expeditionary Force, Binyon wrote his &quot;For the Fallen&quot; in 1914, with its &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot;, the third and fourth, or simply the fourth stanza of the poem. At the time, he was visiting the cliffs on the north Cornwall coast, either at Polzeath or at Portreath. There is a plaque at each site to commemorate the event, but Binyon himself mentioned Polzeath in a 1939 interview. The confusion may be related to Porteath Farm being near Polzeath. The piece was published by &quot;The Times&quot; in September, when public feeling was affected by the recent Battle of the Marne.

Today Binyon&#x27;s most famous poem, &quot;For the Fallen&quot;, is often recited at British Remembrance Sunday services; is an integral part of Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand and of 11 November Remembrance Day services in Canada. The &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot; has thus been claimed as a tribute to all casualties of war, regardless of nation.
:&quot;They went with songs to the battle, they were young.&quot;
:&quot;Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow.&quot;
:&quot;They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,&quot;
:&quot;They fell with their faces to the foe.&quot;

:&quot;They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:&quot;
:&quot;Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.&quot;
:&quot;At the going down of the sun and in the morning,&quot;
:&quot;We will remember them.&quot;

:&quot;They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;&quot;
:&quot;They sit no more at familiar tables of home;&quot;
:&quot;They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;&quot;
:&quot;They sleep beyond England&#x27;s foam&quot;
This &quot;Ode to Remembrance&quot; comprises the central three stanzas of the seven-stanza poem &quot;For the Fallen&quot;, being preceded, and followed, by two additional stanzas. The Ode itself, as used in remembrance services, is more usually only the central stanza of the three shown above. The full poem may be found here.

Three of Binyon&#x27;s poems, including &quot;For the Fallen&quot;, were set by Sir Edward Elgar in his last major orchestra/choral work, &quot;The Spirit of England&quot;.
In 1915, despite being too old to enlist in the armed forces, Binyon volunteered at a British hospital for French soldiers, Hôpital Temporaire d&#x27;Arc-en-Barrois, Haute-Marne, France, working briefly as a hospital orderly. He returned in the summer of 1916 and took care of soldiers taken in from the Verdun battlefield. He wrote about his experiences in &quot;For Dauntless France&quot; (1918) and his poems, &quot;Fetching the Wounded&quot; and &quot;The Distant Guns&quot;, were inspired by his hospital service in Arc-en-Barrois.

&quot;Artists Rifles&quot;, a CD audiobook published in 2004, includes a reading of &quot;For the Fallen&quot; by Binyon himself. The recording itself is undated and appeared on a 78 rpm disc issued in Japan. Other Great War poets heard on the CD include Siegfried Sassoon, Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, David Jones and Edgell Rickword.

==Later life==
After the war, he returned to the British Museum and wrote numerous books on art, in particular on William Blake, Persian art, and Japanese art. His work on ancient Japanese and Chinese cultures offered strongly-contextualised examples that inspired, among others, the poets Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats. Binyon&#x27;s work on Blake and his followers kept alive the then nearly-forgotten memory of the work of Samuel Palmer. Binyon&#x27;s duality of interests continued the traditional interest of British visionary Romanticism in the rich strangeness of Mediterranean and Oriental cultures.

In 1931, his two-volume &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared. In 1932, Binyon rose to be the Keeper of the Prints and Drawings Department, but in 1933, he retired from the British Museum. He went to live in the country at Westridge Green, near Streatley, Berkshire, where his daughters also came to live during the Second World War, and he continued to write poetry.

In 1933–1934, Binyon was appointed Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. He delivered a series of lectures on &quot;The Spirit of Man in Asian Art&quot;, which were published in 1935. Binyon continued his academic work. In May 1939, he gave the prestigious Romanes Lecture in Oxford on &quot;Art and Freedom&quot;, and in 1940, he was appointed the Byron Professor of English Literature at University of Athens. He worked there until he was forced to leave, narrowly escaping the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. He was succeeded by Lord Dunsany, who held the chair in 1940–1941.
Binyon had been friends with Pound since around 1909, and in the 1930s, the two became especially close; Pound affectionately called him &quot;BinBin&quot; and assisted Binyon with his translation of Dante. Another protégé was Arthur Waley, whom Binyon employed at the British Museum.

Between 1933 and 1943, Binyon published his acclaimed translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in an English version of &quot;terza rima&quot;, made with some editorial assistance from Ezra Pound. He dedicated twenty years to his translation and finished it shortly before his death. Its readership was dramatically increased when Paolo Milano selected it for &quot;The Portable Dante&quot; in Viking&#x27;s Portable Library series. Binyon significantly revised his translation of all three parts for the project, and the volume went through three major editions and eight printings, while other volumes in the same series went out of print, before it was replaced by the Mark Musa translation in 1981.

During the Second World War, Binyon continued to write poetry including a long poem about the London Blitz, &quot;The Burning of the Leaves&quot;, which is regarded by many as his masterpiece. In 2016, Paul O&#x27;Prey edited a new selection of his poems, &quot;Poems of Two Wars&quot;, which brought together the poems written during both wars, with an introductory essay on Binyon&#x27;s work that makes the case for his later poetry to be considered as his best.

At his death, Binyon was working on a major three-part Arthurian trilogy, the first part of which was published after his death as &quot;The Madness of Merlin&quot; (1947).

He died in Dunedin Nursing Home, Bath Road, Reading, on 10 March 1943, aged 73, after an operation. A funeral service was held at Trinity College Chapel, Oxford, on 13 March 1943.

There is a slate memorial in St Mary&#x27;s Church, in Aldworth, Berkshire, where Binyon&#x27;s ashes were scattered. On 11 November 1985, Binyon was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity&quot;.

==Family==
His three daughters Helen, Margaret and Nicolete became artists. Helen Binyon (1904–1979) studied with Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious, illustrating many books for the Oxford University Press, and was also a marionettist. She later taught puppetry and published &quot;Puppetry Today&quot; (1966) and &quot;Professional Puppetry in England&quot; (1973). Margaret Binyon wrote children&#x27;s books, which were illustrated by Helen. Nicolete, as Nicolete Gray, was a distinguished calligrapher and art scholar.

<doc id="132757" wikidata="Q17141812" url="?curid=132757" title="Severn crossing">
<text>Severn crossing is a term used to refer to the two motorway crossings over the River Severn estuary between England and Wales operated by England&#x27;s National Highways. The two crossings are:
*Severn Bridge () 
*Prince of Wales Bridge (), until 2018 known as the Second Severn Crossing (&quot;Ail Groesfan Hafren&quot;).

The first motorway suspension bridge was inaugurated on 8 September 1966, and the newer cable-stayed bridge, a few miles to the south, was inaugurated on 5 June 1996. The Second Severn crossing stands more or less where the mid Severn Estuary becomes the upper estuary. It was officially renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge on 2 July 2018. From 1966 to 1996, the first bridge, from Aust on the English side to Chepstow, carried the M4 motorway. On completion of the Second Severn crossing, the motorway crossing the first bridge was renamed the M48.

The two Severn crossings are regarded as the main crossing points from England into South Wales. Before 1966 road traffic between the southern counties of Wales and the southern counties of England had either to travel via Gloucester or to take the Aust Ferry, which ran roughly along the line of the Severn Bridge, from Old Passage near Aust to Beachley. The ferry ramps at Old Passage and Beachley are still visible.

Until 17 December 2018, tolls were collected on both crossings from vehicles travelling in a westward direction only; the toll for small vehicles was £5.60. The Severn Crossing reverted to public ownership on 8 January 2018, run by National Highways.

== Railway crossings ==
The Severn Tunnel, carrying mainline trains under the Severn along the South Wales Main Line has been followed in its original route by the Second Severn Crossing. 

From 1879 until its collapse in 1960 the Severn Railway Bridge also carried trains across the Severn from Sharpness to Lydney.

==Future==
===Severn Barrage proposal===

A proposed Severn Barrage could constitute a third crossing. The Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study noted that &quot;some commentators have suggested that a barrage across the Severn estuary should carry a new road or rail link.&quot; The report concluded that additional crossings would be unnecessary. A 2022 proposal also did not include any new road or rail link. 

===2018 Third Severn Crossing proposal===
The county of Gloucestershire&#x27;s 2050 Vision was launched in 2018, and contains a proposal for a third Severn Crossing between Lydney and Sharpness. This would replicate the former Severn Bridge Railway.

<text>Brockway is a borough in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,072 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The community was laid out as &quot;Brockwayville&quot; in 1836. The borough was named for Alonzo and John S. Brockway, who came to the site in 1822. A post office called &quot;Brockwayville&quot; was established in 1829, and the name of the post office was changed to &quot;Brockway&quot; in 1925.

The Brockwayville Passenger Depot, Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

The Brockway Glass Company Inc. was founded in 1907 in by the Brockway Machine Bottle Company (which later became Brockway Glass). Brockway manufactured and sold glass containers and tubing, along with plastic products manufactured through wholly owned subsidiaries. In 1964 Brockway bought several Hazel-Atlas Glass Company factories from the Continental Can Company as part of a lawsuit settlement. In 1987 Owens-Illinois made a bid of $60 per share (worth $750million) to acquire Brockway, which was met with resistance by the FTC. After a federal district judge denied the FTC&#x27;s request for an injunction, Owens-Illinois acquired Brockway&#x27;s shares.

==2013 State Police shooting==

On Thursday, September 26, 2013, two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were serving a warrant to a resident just outside Brockway around 2:30 pm on Cemetery Road. When the troopers knocked on the door, they were answered with gunshots. One trooper was hit in the neck and chest but was pulled to safety by the other trooper. The injured trooper was life-flighted to UPMC Altoona, listed in critical condition.

The suspect retreated to his home while multiple police agencies from the surrounding area responded to the scene. He barricaded himself inside and kept police forces on scene overnight. The SERT team was on scene to provide assistance, as well as multiple Pennsylvania State Police helicopters which circled the area in case the suspect tried to flee his house. It is believed but not confirmed that officers couldn&#x27;t storm the house because the suspect was threatening to blow up a meth lab inside his residence.

Both the schools in the Brockway Area School District were locked down, and no students were permitted to leave the buildings. The lockdown began shortly after the shooting and lasted until 6:00 PM that evening. The school is located roughly two miles away from the scene. The police also asked that all residents remained inside, as this situation was still labeled as an active shooter over night. The wounded officer was eventually life flighted a second time to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center where he was in a stable, but critical condition.

The standoff ended on Friday morning, September 27, 2013. A news conference was held at 10:30 AM on the 27th from the DuBois State Police Barracks. Officials announced that the suspect was killed in the early morning standoff which lasted 11 hours. The suspect was 60-year-old Kenneth Lees. Senior Officers tried multiple times to contact and reason with Lees, but they were all unsuccessful. Around 1 AM, police forces entered Lees&#x27; home to find that he was dead due a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Lees&#x27; son was also involved in an overnight chase with officers. Police wanted to contact the son to help talk with Kenneth, but when they attempted to pull over the vehicle, he fled. Officers were led on a 25-mile chase that ended with him fleeing through the woods. One officer was injured in the endeavor but officers did eventually catch up with the man who is now in jail under charges of fleeing from police and aggravated assault.

<text>Brookville is a borough in Jefferson County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,933. Founded in 1830, it is the county seat of Jefferson County.

==History==
The area was initially settled in the late 1790s upon the arrival of brothers Joseph and Andrew Barnett, as well as their brother-in-law Samuel Scott, who together established the first settlement at the confluence of the Sandy Lick and Mill Creeks in the area now known as Port Barnett. The first non-Native American settler of the land within the eventual town limits was Moses Knapp, who built a log house at the confluence of North Fork Creek and Sandy Lick Creek (which form Redbank Creek) in 1801.

The 105th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, also known as the Wildcat Regiment, was a volunteer infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was raised by Amor A. McKnight of Brookville. The Regiment fought in several engagements, including Chancellorsville and Spotsylvania Court House.

Brookville&#x27;s main source of economic development throughout the 19th century was the lumber industry. Brookville&#x27;s many creeks and its connection to larger rivers (the Clarion to the north, which, like the Redbank, flows to the Allegheny) allowed for extensive construction of lumber mills along the watersheds and the floating of timber to markets in Pittsburgh. The town enjoyed great economic success during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, serving as home to several factories, breweries, an important railroad stop for local coal and timber, and briefly the Twyford Motor Car Company, which operated from 1905 to 1907 and produced the world&#x27;s first four-wheel drive automobile.

==Geography==

Brookville is located in west-central Jefferson County, at the confluence of the North Fork and Sandy Lick Creek, forming Redbank Creek, a westward-flowing tributary of the Allegheny River.

U.S. Route 322 (Main Street) passes through the center of town, leading southeast to Reynoldsville and west to Clarion. Interstate 80 passes through the northern side of the borough, with access from exits 78 and 81. I-80 leads east to DuBois and west to Interstate 79 near Mercer. Pennsylvania Route 28 joins US 322 as Main Street through Brookville, but leads northeast to Brockway and southwest to New Bethlehem. Pennsylvania Route 36 leads northwest from Brookville to Leeper and south to Punxsutawney.

Brookville is in the Eastern Standard Time zone. The center of town in the Redbank Creek valley is at an elevation of , but hills lining the valley rise to summits ranging from within the borough limits.

<doc id="132765" wikidata="Q5555714" url="?curid=132765" title="Heath Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Heath Township is a township in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 117 at the 2020 census, down from the figure of 124 tabulated in 2010. It was named for early Jefferson County settler Elijah Heath. Heath Township is the second-smallest municipality in Jefferson County.

==History and Recreation==
Heath Township is a popular tourist destination for avid sportsmen, with many seasonal private residences maintained by out-of-town residents, as well as a wide variety of campgrounds ranging from rustic accommodations to modern-day amenities. The Farmers Inn is a restaurant specializing in American cuisine and also maintains a petting zoo, three mini golf ranges, a candy shop and ice cream parlor, bakery, furniture and gift shops.

The municipality is the home of Clear Creek State Park, which is operated and maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

From 1912 to 2017, it was also the home of Heath Pump Station, a compressed natural gas producer owned by New York-based National Fuel Gas. The pump station also shared property with a dam that allowed Callen Run to flow into the Clarion River. The dam provided water to the engines running the station as well as a trout fishing hatchery built in 1955 and operated and maintained by the Heath Township Sportsmen&#x27;s Association. Despite a persistent natural gas odor and pump noise, anglers were undeterred from fishing that portion of Callen Run.

Heath Pump Station stopped compressing gas in 2007, with its building being torn down a decade later. Of historical note, the pump station supplied much of northcentral Pennsylvania and western New York with natural gas using a compressor pump manufactured by Snow Steam Pump Works in Buffalo, New York. The pump weighed 98 tons and had a length of 50 feet, with its 13-foot flywheel alone weighing 11 tons. Though state of the art for its time, its use was supplanted by more modern technology capable of producing more gas more efficiently, and a smaller plant was constructed in the vicinity to replace the Heath Station. That plant is known as the Eldred Compressor Station. Relics from the Heath Station were later donated to the Jefferson County Historical Society and one of the Snow engines was donated to the Western New York Gas &amp; Steam Engine Association.

The fish hatchery remains, and the sportsmen&#x27;s association keeps a supply of approved food to allow young children visiting the hatchery an opportunity to feed the fish. The dam is slated to be eventually removed from the property to allow native trout to swim from the Clarion River back up to Callen Run in warmer weather.

<text>Punxsutawney (; Lenape: &quot;&quot;)
is a borough in southern Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,769. It is located approximately northeast of Pittsburgh. Punxsutawney is known for its annual Groundhog Day celebration held each February 2, during which thousands of attendees and media outlets visit the community for an annual weather &quot;prediction&quot; by the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil.

==History==
Shawnee wigwam villages once occupied this site on the Mahoning Creek. The first settlement that included non-indigenous people was established in 1772, when Reverend John Ettwein, a Moravian Church missionary, arrived with a band of 241 christianized Lenape. Swarms of gnats plagued early settlers and their livestock for years, and are blamed for Ettwein&#x27;s failure to establish a permanent settlement there. The clouds of biting gnats eventually drove the indigenous people away.

The indigenous people called the insects (living dust and ashes), and called their village &quot;Ponkis Utenink&quot; (land of the ), from which the present name Punxsutawney evolved. One legend about the origin of the term concerned an old indigenous sorcerer-hermit who was said to have long terrorized indigenous people in the region. Eventually he was killed, his body burned, and his ashes were cast to the wind. According to the story, the ashes were transformed into minute living things that infested the swamp land. Another story about the source of the term asserted that the indigenous people compared the insect bites to burns caused by sparks or hot ashes.

The area was originally settled by the Lenape Indian tribe, and a more definitive source says the name Punxsutawney derives from a Native name in the Lenape language, Unami: &#x27;, which translates to &quot;town of the sandflies&quot; or &quot;town of the mosquitoes&quot; (&#x27;- &#x27;mosquito&#x27; + -&quot; &#x27;town&#x27;).
Alternatively, the name is said to come from another Unami term, &quot;, which means &quot;poison vine.&quot; The Shawnee and Delaware left Pennsylvania and had settled in Ohio by the end of the American Revolution.

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Keystone Marker lists that Punxsutawney was founded in 1818. In 1840 it was reported that Punxsutawney was a village of about 15 or 20 dwellings. Settlers drawn by lumbering and coal mining eventually drained the swamps and exterminated the insects. The Borough of Punxsutawney was incorporated in 1850, and had a population of 256 at that time.

In 1907, the Punxsutawney and Claysville boroughs were consolidated and incorporated as Greater Punxsutawney, resulting in a combined population of 9,058 in 1910. A high-grade bituminous soft coal was mined in the surrounding region. Shortly after 1850, mining was being supplanted by factories which included brickworks, glassworks, tanneries, foundries, ironworks, machine shops, and wood planing, flour, feed, and silk mills. By the 1930s these were mostly gone, and townspeople were dependent largely on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad repair shops north of town, and a meat packing plant, in addition to the remaining coal mining and batteries of beehive coke ovens.

In 1900, 6,746 people lived in Punxsutawney before the consolidation with Claysville. After consolidation, the population in 1910 was 9,058; in 1920, 10,311; in 1930, 9,266; prewar in 1940, 9,482; and postwar in 1950, 8,969 people lived there. The population was 5,962 at the 2010 census.

A groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil is kept in nearby Young Township, and is said to predict the weather annually on Groundhog Day, February 2. The event provided the premise for the 1993 film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, although nearly all of the film was shot in Woodstock, Illinois.

The T. M. Kurtz House, Jefferson Theater, Christian Miller House, and United States Post Office-Punxsutawney are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Timblin is a borough in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 157 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The community which would later be named as &quot;Timblin&quot; had its genesis in the arrival, during the early 1800s, of several pioneer settlers in Perry Township: James McClelland (1803), Benjamin Ions (1804), David Hamilton (1806). Elijah Ekis, Michael Lantz and William Smith then arrived in 1815. In 1843, Smith relocated with his sons to land that would later become part of Timblin. The town&#x27;s name, according to &quot;The Brookville American&quot;, would subsequently be chosen to honor Andy Timblin, the town&#x27;s postmaster during the mid-1880s. Timblin&#x27;s father, A. Timblin, had built a log cabin, in or before 1840, near the same area where the Smith family had settled, and had then begun farming the land there.

Timblin got its start as a true town circa 1883, when John A. Timblin opened a store at the site. A post office called Timblin was established in 1889.

The town grew quickly, following the 1910 completion nearby of an extension of the Pittsburg, Shawmut &amp; Northern Railroad.

In 1913, the Timblin Coal Company began its operations.

The First National Bank of Timblin was incorporated in July 1918 and opened its doors to customers on October 22 of that year. Nine thousand dollars was deposited on that first day.

In 1921, Joe Cosmano opened Cosmano&#x27;s Restaurant, a soft drink and confectionary business.

On August 1, 1922, Winn S. Heller and R. F. Mateer founded Heller &amp; Mateer, the town&#x27;s furniture store. G. H. Maxwell opened G. H. Maxwell, Clothing in December that same year.

The town then became a borough. A special election was held for Timblin residents on January 30, 1923, during which T. L. Miller was chosen as the borough&#x27;s burgess, John Milliron was elected as constable, Charles Snyder was chosen as assessor, Wayne Anderson and E. O. Weaver were elected as Justices of the Peace, David Haas was chosen as tax collector, and Amos Brosius, Harry Brosious, A. J. Case, C. C. Himes, and E. C. Snyder were elected as members of the school board. In addition, S. B. Engle, D. C. Griffith, James R. Marshall, G. H. Maxwell, Duff W. McGregor, J. C. Milliron, and Dr. L. W. Zimmerman were elected to the borough council, and N. L. Boddorf, V. G. Brosius, and J. B. Snyder were elected to the board of auditors.

==Geography==
Timblin is located in southwestern Jefferson County at (40.965989, -79.200538). The Armstrong County line forms the western border of the borough.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which , or 0.28%, are water. Timblin is in the valley of Pine Run, a west-flowing tributary of Mahoning Creek, part of the Allegheny River watershed. Two streams join Pine Run from the north in Timblin: Eagle Run, and Painter Run.

<text>Cast iron is a class of iron–carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2% and silicon content around 1–3%. Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloying elements determine the form in which its carbon appears: white cast iron has its carbon combined into an iron carbide named cementite, which is very hard, but brittle, as it allows cracks to pass straight through; grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks, and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite &quot;nodules&quot; which stop the crack from further progressing.

Carbon (C), ranging from 1.8 to 4 wt%, and silicon (Si), 1–3 wt%, are the main alloying elements of cast iron. Iron alloys with lower carbon content are known as steel.

Cast iron tends to be brittle, except for malleable cast irons. With its relatively low melting point, good fluidity, castability, excellent machinability, resistance to deformation and wear resistance, cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications and are used in pipes, machines and automotive industry parts, such as cylinder heads, cylinder blocks and gearbox cases. Some alloys are resistant to damage by oxidation. In general, cast iron is notoriously difficult to weld.

The earliest cast-iron artifacts date to the 5th century BC, and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now Jiangsu, China. Cast iron was used in ancient China to mass-produce weaponry for warfare, as well as agriculture and architecture. During the 15th century AD, cast iron became utilized for cannons and shot in Burgundy, France, and in England during the Reformation. The amounts of cast iron used for cannons required large-scale production. The first cast-iron bridge was built during the 1770s by Abraham Darby III, and is known as the Iron Bridge in Shropshire, England. Cast iron was also used in the construction of buildings.

==Production==
Cast iron is made from pig iron, which is the product of melting iron ore in a blast furnace. Cast iron can be made directly from the molten pig iron or by re-melting pig iron, often along with substantial quantities of iron, steel, limestone, carbon (coke) and taking various steps to remove undesirable contaminants. Phosphorus and sulfur may be burnt out of the molten iron, but this also burns out the carbon, which must be replaced. Depending on the application, carbon and silicon content are adjusted to the desired levels, which may be anywhere from 2–3.5% and 1–3%, respectively. If desired, other elements are then added to the melt before the final form is produced by casting.

Cast iron is sometimes melted in a special type of blast furnace known as a cupola, but in modern applications, it is more often melted in electric induction furnaces or electric arc furnaces. After melting is complete, the molten cast iron is poured into a holding furnace or ladle.

==Types==

===Alloying elements===

Cast iron&#x27;s properties are changed by adding various alloying elements, or alloyants. Next to carbon, silicon is the most important alloyant because it forces carbon out of solution. A low percentage of silicon allows carbon to remain in solution, forming iron carbide and producing white cast iron. A high percentage of silicon forces carbon out of solution, forming graphite and producing grey cast iron. Other alloying agents, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and vanadium counteract silicon, and promote the retention of carbon and the formation of those carbides. Nickel and copper increase strength and machinability, but do not change the amount of graphite formed. Carbon as graphite produces a softer iron, reduces shrinkage, lowers strength, and decreases density. Sulfur, largely a contaminant when present, forms iron sulfide, which prevents the formation of graphite and increases hardness. Sulfur makes molten cast iron viscous, which causes defects. To counter the effects of sulfur, manganese is added, because the two form into manganese sulfide instead of iron sulfide. The manganese sulfide is lighter than the melt, so it tends to float out of the melt and into the slag. The amount of manganese required to neutralize sulfur is 1.7 × sulfur content + 0.3%. If more than this amount of manganese is added, then manganese carbide forms, which increases hardness and chilling, except in grey iron, where up to 1% of manganese increases strength and density.

Nickel is one of the most common alloying elements, because it refines the pearlite and graphite structures, improves toughness, and evens out hardness differences between section thicknesses. Chromium is added in small amounts to reduce free graphite, produce chill, and because it is a powerful carbide stabilizer; nickel is often added in conjunction. A small amount of tin can be added as a substitute for 0.5% chromium. Copper is added in the ladle or in the furnace, on the order of 0.5–2.5%, to decrease chill, refine graphite, and increase fluidity. Molybdenum is added on the order of 0.3–1% to increase chill and refine the graphite and pearlite structure; it is often added in conjunction with nickel, copper, and chromium to form high strength irons. Titanium is added as a degasser and deoxidizer, but it also increases fluidity. Vanadium at 0.15–0.5% is added to cast iron to stabilize cementite, increase hardness, and increase resistance to wear and heat. Zirconium at 0.1–0.3% helps to form graphite, deoxidize, and increase fluidity.

In malleable iron melts, bismuth is added at 0.002–0.01% to increase how much silicon can be added. In white iron, boron is added to aid in the production of malleable iron; it also reduces the coarsening effect of bismuth.

===Grey cast iron===


Grey cast iron is characterised by its graphitic microstructure, which causes fractures of the material to have a grey appearance. It is the most commonly used cast iron and the most widely used cast material based on weight. Most cast irons have a chemical composition of 2.5–4.0% carbon, 1–3% silicon, and the remainder iron. Grey cast iron has less tensile strength and shock resistance than steel, but its compressive strength is comparable to low- and medium-carbon steel. These mechanical properties are controlled by the size and shape of the graphite flakes present in the microstructure and can be characterised according to the guidelines given by the ASTM.

===White cast iron===
White cast iron displays white fractured surfaces due to the presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit [plastic deformation] by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers.
It is difficult to cool thick castings fast enough to solidify the melt as white cast iron all the way through. However, rapid cooling can be used to solidify a shell of white cast iron, after which the remainder cools more slowly to form a core of grey cast iron. The resulting casting, called a &quot;chilled casting&quot;, has the benefits of a hard surface with a somewhat tougher interior.

High-chromium white iron alloys allow massive castings (for example, a 10-tonne impeller) to be sand cast, as the chromium reduces cooling rate required to produce carbides through the greater thicknesses of material. Chromium also produces carbides with impressive abrasion resistance. These high-chromium alloys attribute their superior hardness to the presence of chromium carbides. The main form of these carbides are the eutectic or primary M7C3 carbides, where &quot;M&quot; represents iron or chromium and can vary depending on the alloy&#x27;s composition. The eutectic carbides form as bundles of hollow hexagonal rods and grow perpendicular to the hexagonal basal plane. The hardness of these carbides are within the range of 1500-1800HV.

===Malleable cast iron===

Malleable iron starts as a white iron casting that is then heat treated for a day or two at about and then cooled over a day or two. As a result, the carbon in iron carbide transforms into graphite and ferrite plus carbon. The slow process allows the surface tension to form the graphite into spheroidal particles rather than flakes. Due to their lower aspect ratio, the spheroids are relatively short and far from one another, and have a lower cross section vis-a-vis a propagating crack or phonon. They also have blunt boundaries, as opposed to flakes, which alleviates the stress concentration problems found in grey cast iron. In general, the properties of malleable cast iron are more like those of mild steel. There is a limit to how large a part can be cast in malleable iron, as it is made from white cast iron.

===Ductile cast iron===
Developed in 1948, nodular or &quot;ductile cast iron&quot; has its graphite in the form of very tiny nodules with the graphite in the form of concentric layers forming the nodules. As a result, the properties of ductile cast iron are that of a spongy steel without the stress concentration effects that flakes of graphite would produce. The carbon percentage present is 3-4% and percentage of silicon is 1.8-2.8%.Tiny amounts of 0.02 to 0.1% magnesium, and only 0.02 to 0.04% cerium added to these alloys slow the growth of graphite precipitates by bonding to the edges of the graphite planes. Along with careful control of other elements and timing, this allows the carbon to separate as spheroidal particles as the material solidifies. The properties are similar to malleable iron, but parts can be cast with larger sections.

===Table of comparative qualities of cast irons===
==History==



Cast iron and wrought iron can be produced unintentionally when smelting copper using iron ore as a flux.

The earliest cast-iron artifacts date to the 5th century BC, and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China during the Warring States period. This is based on an analysis of the artifact&#x27;s microstructures.

Because cast iron is comparatively brittle, it is not suitable for purposes where a sharp edge or flexibility is required. It is strong under compression, but not under tension. Cast iron was invented in China in the 5th century BC and poured into molds to make ploughshares and pots as well as weapons and pagodas. Although steel was more desirable, cast iron was cheaper and thus was more commonly used for implements in ancient China, while wrought iron or steel was used for weapons. The Chinese developed a method of annealing cast iron by keeping hot castings in an oxidizing atmosphere for a week or longer in order to burn off some carbon near the surface in order to keep the surface layer from being too brittle.

Deep within the Congo region of the Central African forest, blacksmiths invented sophisticated furnaces capable of high temperatures over 1000 years ago. There are countless examples of welding, soldering, and cast iron created in crucibles and poured into molds. These techniques were employed for the use of composite tools and weapons with cast iron or steel blades and soft, flexible wrought iron interiors. Iron wire was also produced. Numerous testimonies were made by early European missionaries of the Luba people pouring cast iron into molds to make hoes. These technological innovations were accomplished without the invention of the blast furnace which was the prerequisite for the deployment of such innovations in Europe and Asia.

The technology of cast iron was transferred to the West from China. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, thus the use of cast-iron technology being derived from China is conceivable. Upon its introduction to the West in the 15th century it was used for cannon and shot. Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547) initiated the casting of cannon in England. Soon, English iron workers using blast furnaces developed the technique of producing cast-iron cannons, which, while heavier than the prevailing bronze cannons, were much cheaper and enabled England to arm her navy better.

Cast-iron pots were made at many English blast furnaces at the time. In 1707, Abraham Darby patented a new method of making pots (and kettles) thinner and hence cheaper than those made by traditional methods. This meant that his Coalbrookdale furnaces became dominant as suppliers of pots, an activity in which they were joined in the 1720s and 1730s by a small number of other coke-fired blast furnaces.

Application of the steam engine to power blast bellows (indirectly by pumping water to a waterwheel) in Britain, beginning in 1743 and increasing in the 1750s, was a key factor in increasing the production of cast iron, which surged in the following decades. In addition to overcoming the limitation on water power, the steam-pumped-water powered blast gave higher furnace temperatures which allowed the use of higher lime ratios, enabling the conversion from charcoal (supplies of wood for which were inadequate) to coke.

The ironmasters of the Weald continued producing cast irons until the 1760s, and armament was one of the main uses of irons after the Restoration.

===Cast-iron bridges===
The use of cast iron for structural purposes began in the late 1770s, when Abraham Darby III built The Iron Bridge, although short beams had already been used, such as in the blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale. Other inventions followed, including one patented by Thomas Paine. Cast-iron bridges became commonplace as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace. Thomas Telford adopted the material for his bridge upstream at Buildwas, and then for Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, a canal trough aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern on the Shrewsbury Canal. It was followed by the Chirk Aqueduct and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, both of which remain in use following the recent restorations.

The best way of using cast iron for bridge construction was by using arches, so that all the material is in compression. Cast iron, again like masonry, is very strong in compression. Wrought iron, like most other kinds of iron and indeed like most metals in general, is strong in tension, and also tough – resistant to fracturing. The relationship between wrought iron and cast iron, for structural purposes, may be thought of as analogous to the relationship between wood and stone.

Cast-iron beam bridges were used widely by the early railways, such as the Water Street Bridge in 1830 at the Manchester terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, but problems with its use became all too apparent when a new bridge carrying the Chester and Holyhead Railway across the River Dee in Chester collapsed killing five people in May 1847, less than a year after it was opened. The Dee bridge disaster was caused by excessive loading at the centre of the beam by a passing train, and many similar bridges had to be demolished and rebuilt, often in wrought iron. The bridge had been badly designed, being trussed with wrought iron straps, which were wrongly thought to reinforce the structure. The centres of the beams were put into bending, with the lower edge in tension, where cast iron, like masonry, is very weak.

Nevertheless, cast iron continued to be used in inappropriate structural ways, until the Tay Rail Bridge disaster of 1879 cast serious doubt on the use of the material. Crucial lugs for holding tie bars and struts in the Tay Bridge had been cast integral with the columns, and they failed in the early stages of the accident. In addition, the bolt holes were also cast and not drilled. Thus, because of casting&#x27;s draft angle, the tension from the tie bars was placed on the hole&#x27;s edge rather than being spread over the length of the hole. The replacement bridge was built in wrought iron and steel.

Further bridge collapses occurred, however, culminating in the Norwood Junction rail accident of 1891. Thousands of cast-iron rail underbridges were eventually replaced by steel equivalents by 1900 owing to the widespread concern about cast iron under bridges on the rail network in Britain.

===Buildings===
Cast-iron columns, pioneered in mill buildings, enabled architects to build multi-storey buildings without the enormously thick walls required for masonry buildings of any height. They also opened up floor spaces in factories, and sight lines in churches and auditoriums. By the mid 19th century, cast iron columns were common in warehouse and industrial buildings, combined with wrought or cast iron beams, eventually leading to the development of steel-framed skyscrapers. Cast iron was also used sometimes for decorative facades, especially in the United States, and the Soho district of New York has numerous examples. It was also used occasionally for complete prefabricated buildings, such as the historic Iron Building in Watervliet, New York.

===Textile mills===
Another important use was in textile mills. The air in the mills contained flammable fibres from the cotton, hemp, or wool being spun. As a result, textile mills had an alarming propensity to burn down. The solution was to build them completely of non-combustible materials, and it was found convenient to provide the building with an iron frame, largely of cast iron, replacing flammable wood. The first such building was at Ditherington in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Many other warehouses were built using cast-iron columns and beams, although faulty designs, flawed beams or overloading sometimes caused building collapses and structural failures.

During the Industrial Revolution, cast iron was also widely used for frame and other fixed parts of machinery, including spinning and later weaving machines in textile mills. Cast iron became widely used, and many towns had foundries producing industrial and agricultural machinery.

<text>Eleanor Butler (also known as Nell Butler or Irish Nell; born 1665) was an indentured white woman who married an enslaved African man in colonial Maryland in 1681.

==Biography==
Butler, who was of Irish origin, was an indentured servant to Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore. At around 16 years of age she announced her intention to marry a man referred to only as &quot;Negro Charles&quot;. A 1664 Maryland law outlined the legal status of a free woman who voluntarily married an enslaved man: she would serve the master of her husband until his death, and any offspring of their union would be born into slavery. Despite this, Butler was determined to be wed. The thought of a white woman becoming enslaved distressed Lord Baltimore, and he warned against the union for that reason.

Lord Baltimore petitioned Maryland&#x27;s provincial assembly to change the 1664 law, and in 1681, key provisions were repealed. The new law additionally outlawed marriages between female servants and enslaved men and provided for huge punitive fines to be levied on the enslaver (&quot;master&quot;) of any enslaved person thus wed.

Despite this, Butler and Charles married 1681, before the law went into effect. Because the new law did not apply retroactively, and perhaps also because Lord Baltimore left Maryland indefinitely in 1684, Butler and Charles lived out the rest of their lives enslaved by William Boarman, Eleanor Butler&#x27;s husband&#x27;s enslaver. They had seven or eight children, all born after the repeal of the 1664 law, but they were nonetheless born enslaved. One son, Jack, escaped and later bought his freedom from the Boarman family. The rest remained as human chattel.

In October 1770, two of their descendants, William and Mary Butler, still enslaved, filed suit for their freedom on the basis they were descendants of a white woman. Mary Butler was Nell Butler&#x27;s great-granddaughter, but the provincial court ruled against them, noting that &quot;many of these people, if turned loose, cannot mix with us and become members of society.&quot; Other suits from other descendants followed in the 1780s. In 1787, the daughter of William and Mary Butler – also named Mary – successfully sued for her freedom, but hers was a procedural victory devoid of any particular precedent. While her attorney hoped that the court would decide that any descendant of a white woman could not be enslaved, such a decision and the far-reaching effects it would have brought were not forthcoming. Instead, the court ruled that as no evidence existed of a legal union between Nell Butler and Negro Charles, the provisions of the 1664 law that condemned her and her offspring to slavery should not have applied in her case. This compromise ruling allowed Mary Butler her freedom without having any significant effect on property rights in the state.

<doc id="132794" wikidata="Q3012704" url="?curid=132794" title="Ladies of Llangollen">
<text>The &quot;Ladies of Llangollen&quot;, Eleanor Butler (1739–1829) and Sarah Ponsonby (1755–1831), were two upper-class Irish women who lived together as a couple. Their relationship scandalised and fascinated their contemporaries. The pair moved to a Gothic house in Llangollen, North Wales, in 1780 after leaving Ireland to escape the social pressures of conventional marriages. Over the years, numerous distinguished visitors called upon them. Guests included Byron, Shelley, Wellington and Wordsworth, the last of whom wrote a sonnet about them.

==Early lives==
Eleanor Charlotte Butler (11 May 1739 – 2 June 1829) was a member of the Butler family, the Earls (and later Dukes) of Ormond, as the daughter of Walter Butler, &quot;de jure&quot; 16th Earl of Ormonde and Eleanor Morres (1711–1793). Her family, whose seat was Kilkenny Castle, considered her an over-educated bookworm. She was educated in a convent in France and so spoke French.

Sarah Ponsonby (1755 – 9 December 1831), by birth member of the Ponsonby family, was orphaned as a child and lived with relatives in Woodstock, County Kilkenny. A daughter of Chambré Brabazon Ponsonby, Irish Member of Parliament and his second wife, Louisa Lyons (1730–1758). She was a second cousin of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, and thus a second cousin once removed of his daughter Lady Caroline Lamb.

Their families lived 15 miles (25 km) from each other. The two women met in 1768, and quickly became close. Over the years they formulated a plan for a private rural retreat. It was their dream to live an unconventional life together.

==Welsh home==
Rather than face the possibility of being forced into unwanted marriages, they left County Kilkenny together in April 1778. Their families found them and forcefully tried to make them give up their plans—but in vain. They moved to Wales and then sent for Sarah&#x27;s servant, Mary Caryll, who lived with and worked for them for the rest of her life. Mary died first, and they were all three buried in the same plot with the same grave marker.

Putting their plan into motion, they undertook a picturesque tour of the Welsh countryside, eventually settling in North Wales. Living first in a rented home in the village of Llangollen, they moved in 1780 to a small cottage just outside the village they called Plas Newydd or &quot;new mansion&quot;. They proceeded to live according to their self-devised system, though they could rely on only a modest income from intolerant relatives, and eventually a civil list pension. They &quot;improved&quot; Plas Newydd in the Gothic style with Welsh oak panelling, pointed arches, stained glass windows, and an extensive library, in which they received their many guests. They hired a gardener, a footman, and two maids. This led to significant debt, and they had to rely on the generosity of friends.

==Recognition and popularity==
They devoted their time to hosting a range of friends and curious visitors, extensive correspondence, private studies of literature and languages, and improving their estate. Over the years they added a circular stone dairy and created a sumptuous garden. Eleanor kept a diary of their activities. Llangollen people simply referred to them as &quot;the ladies&quot;.

After a couple of years, their life attracted the interest of the outside world. Their house became a haven for visitors travelling between Dublin and London, including writers such as Anna Seward, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott, but also the military leader the Duke of Wellington and the industrialist Josiah Wedgwood; aristocratic novelist Lady Caroline Lamb, who was born a Ponsonby, came to visit too. Anne Lister from Yorkshire visited the couple, and was possibly inspired by their relationship to informally marry her own lover. Even travellers from continental Europe had heard of the couple and came to visit them, for instance Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, the German nobleman and landscape designer, wrote admiringly about them.

The ladies were known throughout Britain, but have been said to have led &quot;a rather unexciting life&quot;. Queen Charlotte wanted to see their cottage and persuaded King George III to grant them a pension. Eventually their families came to tolerate them.

==Personal lives==

Butler and Ponsonby lived together for 50 years. Their books and glassware carried both sets of initials and their letters were jointly signed. Towards the end of their lives, they both dressed in black riding habits and men&#x27;s top hats; some visitors thought it was eccentric and outdated – especially the hair powder – but neighbours thought the clothes were practical for living outdoors.

Rumours that they were in a sexual relationship floated around during and after their lives. In 1791, a magazine described them and implied that they were in a sexual relationship. According to Patricia Hampl, they were appalled by this idea, and objected to the magazine&#x27;s characterisation to the point of consulting Edmund Burke over the possibility of suing the magazine for libel.

In sharp contrast to the writings of their contemporary Anne Lister, there is nothing in their extensive correspondence or diaries that indicates a sexual relationship. Some consider Butler&#x27;s and Ponsonby&#x27;s relationship to be a Boston marriage, or a romantic relationship between two women who chose to live together and have &quot;marriage-like relationships&quot;. Others conclude that the two had a non-sexual romantic friendship. Norena Shopland says that modern attitudes designed to distinguish same-sex relationships from a romantic friendship indicate they had a sexual relationship. According to Fiona Brideoake, the description of queer is more appropriate than the specific label of lesbian, particularly as queerness is a broad concept and significantly defined by its difference from typicality. Brideoake writes that their relationship was celebrated by the poet Anna Seward as a form of mourning the relationships that she could not form.

Eugene Coyle recounts that a &quot;succession of their pet dogs were named &#x27;Sappho&#x27;.&quot;

==Deaths and legacy ==
Mary Caryll died on 22 November 1809. Eleanor Butler died on 2 June 1829 at the age of 90. Sarah Ponsonby died two years later on 9 December 1831, age 76. They are all buried together at St Collen’s Church, Llangollen. Plas Newydd is now a museum run by Denbighshire County Council.

Butler&#x27;s Hill, near Plas Newydd, is named in honour of Eleanor Butler. The Ponsonby Arms public house, a Grade II listed building on Mill Street in Llangollen, claims to take its name from Sarah Ponsonby.

==In popular culture==
* Wordsworth wrote a sonnet about them, &quot;To the Lady E.B and the Hon. Miss P&quot;. 
* Anna Seward wrote about them in her 1796 poem, &quot;Llangollen Vale&quot;, in which she associates them with &quot;chaste provinciality&quot;. 
* The story of the two women are the subject of a chapter of Colette&#x27;s 1932 book, &quot;The Pure and the Impure.&quot; 
* The ladies appeared in a &quot;thinly-veiled biographical novel&quot;, &quot;Chase of the Wild Goose&quot; by pioneering female physician and author, Mary Gordon, originally published in 1936 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press. The book was reprinted and retitled &quot;The Llangollen Ladies: The Story of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby, Known as the Ladies of Llangollen&quot;. Gordon claims to have seen the ladies&#x27; apparitions at Plas Newydd during a visit in 1934, which inspired her to learn about their lives. As Gordon recounts in the final section of the book, &quot;The Ladies Meet Me&quot;, she believed herself to be Butler and Ponsonby&#x27;s &quot;spiritual descendant&quot;, and hailed them as the feminist progenitors of the modernist female scholars, professionals, and &quot;friends who prefer to live together.&quot; Gordon used her royalties from the book to commission a statue of Butler and Ponsonby sculpted by Violet Labouchere, and stood herself as the model for Ponsonby. The statue was installed in St. Collen&#x27;s Church, Llangollen (where the Ladies are buried with Mary Carryl) in a ceremony overseen by the minister and local mayor. 
* The ladies&#x27; story (along with their ghost story) is told in a chapter of the 2009 book, &quot;Queer Hauntings: True Tales of Gay and Lesbian Ghosts&quot; by Ken Summers. 
* In April 2011, the same month in which the first Irish civil partnerships took place under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, Irish state broadcaster RTÉ broadcast a 45-minute radio documentary about the lives of Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby entitled &quot;An Extraordinary Affair&quot;. It asked whether they were Ireland&#x27;s first openly lesbian couple.
* In 2014, Llangollen, the Ladies and Plas Newydd were featured in the introductory sequence of the BBC property buying series &quot;Escape to the Country&quot;, series 22, episode 21, &quot;North Wales&quot;.
* In February 2016, the Ladies of Llangollen were featured in episode 7 of series 3 of &quot;Mysteries at the Castle&quot; on the Travel Channel.
* In February 2020, the burial place and memorial of the Ladies were blessed at a special service for LGBT History Month at St Collen&#x27;s Church, Llangollen. A tribute to the legacy of the Ladies was given in music by Ian Shaw.
* In 2022, their dramatised story was brought to the stage in Theatr Clwyd&#x27;s production of &#x27;Celebrated Virgins: The Story of the Ladies of Llangollen&#x27;. Written by Katie Elin Salt and directed by Eleri B.Jones.
* They are referred to as &quot;a pair of Irish cousins&quot; who ran away to Wales in Learned by Heart (2023) by Emma Donoghue.
* In Zadie Smith&#x27;s novel The Fraud, protagonist Mrs Touchet repeatedly alludes to them longingly in the context of her own &quot;persuasion.&quot;

<text>Llangollen () is a town and community, situated on the River Dee, in Denbighshire, Wales. Its riverside location forms the edge of the Berwyn range, and the Dee Valley section of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with the easternmost point of the Dee Valley Way being within the town. It had a population of 3,658 at the 2011 census.

==History==

Llangollen takes its name from the Welsh &quot;llan&quot; meaning &quot;a religious settlement&quot; and Saint Collen, a 7th-century monk who founded a church beside the river. St Collen is said to have arrived in Llangollen by coracle. St Collen’s Church is the only church in Wales dedicated to St Collen, and he may have had connections with Colan in Cornwall and with Langolen in Brittany.

Above the town to the north is Castell Dinas Brân, a stronghold of the Princes of Powys. Beyond the castle is the impressive Lower Carboniferous limestone escarpment known as the Eglwyseg Rocks. The outcrop continues north to World&#x27;s End in Wrexham. The single track road north of the castle forms the Panorama Walk, and a monument to poet I. D. Hooson from the village of Rhosllannerchrugog is located near its easternmost end [Grid Ref: SJ 2459 4287].

The ancient parish of Llangollen was divided into three &quot;traeanau&quot; (&quot;traean&quot; being the Welsh for &quot;a third&quot;): Llangollen Traean, Trefor Traean, and Glyn Traean.
* Llangollen Traean contained the townships of Bachau, Cysylltau, Llangollen Abad, Llangollen Fawr, Llangollen Fechan, Feifod, Pengwern and Rhisgog.
* Trefor Traean contained the townships of Cilmediw, Dinbren, Eglwysegl, Trefor Isaf and Trefor Uchaf.
* Glyn Traean contained the townships of Cilcochwyn, Crogeniddon, Crogenwladus, Erwallo, Hafodgynfor, Nantygwryd, Pennant and Talygarth.

Valle Crucis Abbey [Grid Ref: SJ 20441 44168] was established at Llantysilio in about 1201, under the patronage of Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor of Castell Dinas Brân.

The bridge at Llangollen was built across the Dee in the 16th century to replace a previous bridge built in about 1345 by John Trevor, of Trevor Hall (later Bishop of St Asaph), which replaced an even earlier bridge built in the reign of King Henry I. In the 1860s the present bridge was extended by adding an extra arch (to cross the new railway) and a two-storey stone tower with a castellated parapet. This became a café before being demolished in the 1930s to improve traffic flow. The bridge was also widened in 1873 and again in 1968, using masonry which blended in with the older structure. It is a Grade I listed structure and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

Plas Newydd (&quot;New Mansion&quot; or &quot;New Place&quot;) high on the outskirts of the town, was from 1780 the home of the Ladies of Llangollen (the Honourable Sarah Ponsonby and Lady Eleanor Butler) and their maid Mary Carryl. They share the same grave memorial in the church.

Elevated on the opposite side of the Dee is Castell Dinas Brân, the ruins of a medieval castle built by the Princes of Powys Fadog.

The Pillar of Eliseg [Grid Ref: SJ 20267 44528] is another ancient monument located 400m NNW of Valle Crucis Abbey. Llangollen Community Hospital was completed in 1876.
==Governance==

There is an electoral ward of Denbighshire County Council of the same name. This ward includes Llantysilio community and has a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,079. Llangollen Town Council is based at Llangollen Town Hall.

==Economy==
Today Llangollen relies heavily on the tourist industry, but still gains substantial income from farming. Most of the farms in the hills around the town were sheep farms, and the domestic wool industry, both spinning and weaving, was important in the area for centuries. Several factories were later built along the banks of the River Dee, where both wool and cotton were processed. The water mill opposite Llangollen railway station is over 600 years old, and was originally used to grind flour for local farmers.

==Culture==
In the late 19th century, Llangollen had a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Llangollen Advertiser&quot;.

Llangollen hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1908. The Gorsedd ceremony was held on the Hermitage Field, next to Plas Newydd, and the circle of stones was later moved into the grounds of the hall. The eisteddfod itself took place on the old Vicarage Field at Fronhyfryd and was visited by David Lloyd George, accompanied by Winston Churchill.

===Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod===

The annual Llangollen International Eisteddfod is a large international music festival. It starts on a Tuesday and ends on the following Sunday. It opens with a parade led by the Llangollen Silver Band, in which both locals and visitors take part in dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments.

===Llangollen Fringe Festival===
The Llangollen Fringe Festival is an independent arts festival, usually held in mid July in the town hall. The Fringe includes music, comedy, theatre, dance and workshops. Artists who have taken part in the Llangollen Fringe include Clement Freud, Rhys Ifans, the Damned, Cerys Matthews, Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Juan Martín, the Black Seeds, John Cooper Clarke, Will Self, Gang of Four, Lee Scratch Perry, Victoria Coren Mitchell and Gruff Rhys.

===Dee Rocks===
Dee Rocks is a local fundraising music festival, usually held during May when the town hall is transformed into a music venue.

===Songs and nursery rhymes===
* &quot;Llangollen Market&quot;, traditional
* &quot;Ladies of Llangollen&quot;, Ian Chesterman
* &quot;Pastai Fawr Llangollen&quot; (The Great Llangollen Pie), Arfon Gwilym
* According to an anonymous rhyme, the bridge over the Dee is one of the Seven Wonders of Wales.
* The nursery rhyme &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; is frequently, but incorrectly, linked with Llangollen. Its true origins are in the United States: &quot;This is a lovely folklore story, but sadly Mary Thomas of Llangollen was not the heroine of the nursery rhyme ... The Mary of the rhyme was Mary Sawyer and the school was the Redstone Schoolhouse in Sterling Massachusetts, U.S.A.&quot;

==Transport==
Llangollen was an important coaching stop for the mail coach on the old mail route which is now the A5 from London to Holyhead.

===Buses===
Various buses serve the town, including buses to Wrexham (Arriva service 5), Barmouth (TrawsCymru service T3) and the Ceiriog Valley. Services 5 and T3 connect Llangollen to Ruabon and Wrexham, which have the closest railway stations on the national network. The Dee Valley Picturesque Bus (service 199) operates between April and November, linking Llangollen and the surrounding villages to popular local attractions including Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, Wenffrwd Nature Reserve, Horseshoe Falls, Valle Crucis Abbey, Plas Newydd house and the Horseshoe Pass.

===Railways===
The railway, operating both passenger and goods services, was extended from Ruabon, via Acrefair and Trevor, to reach Llangollen by 1865. The Ruabon to Barmouth Line became part of the Great Western Railway. However under the Beeching Axe of 1964, the line closed to passengers in early 1965, and to freight in April 1969. The line was lifted in May 1969. However, a 10-mile stretch of the line between Llangollen and Corwen has been restored and operates as the Llangollen Railway, a tourist attraction. In 2002, the Rainhill locomotive trials were re-staged on the line.

===Waterways===
The Ellesmere Canal was intended to connect the coal mines and ironworks at Ruabon and Wrexham to the canal network and thence to the sea via the River Mersey and the River Severn. The plans were altered, and instead of connecting Trevor northwards to the sea via the River Dee and southwards to the Severn, the canal ran eastwards to join the national network at Hurleston Junction on the Shropshire Union Canal near Nantwich. A feeder canal, navigable to Llangollen, was constructed from Trevor to tap water from the River Dee at Llantysilio (at the weir called &quot;Horseshoe Falls&quot;). After company mergers, the canal became part of the Shropshire Union System. Until recently it was properly called the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal, though it is now known as the Llangollen Canal.

The canal supplied enough Dee water to supply Crewe and Nantwich, and when commercial traffic failed in the 1940s, it was kept open to function as a water supply. Amongst Britain&#x27;s artificial waterways, the canal has an unusually strong flow of up to . Since the use of canals for leisure took off in the 1970s and 1980s, the route, roughly parallel to the river Dee and across the Dee Valley on the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, is an important part of Llangollen&#x27;s attraction as a holiday destination. Moorings at Llangollen Wharf and additional moorings in a marina are built at the end of the generally-navigable section, allowing visitors arriving by narrowboat to moor overnight in Llangollen. The canal then extends , north and then west, to Horseshoe Falls in a section navigable only by a horse-drawn excursion boat.

==Sport==
Llangollen on the River Dee hosts white water Slalom canoeing and kayaking, being host to International and UK events. The International Canoe Federation (ICF), the European Canoe Union (ECU) and the British Canoe Union (BCU) all hold events in Llangollen.

Cricket, football and rugby union teams play at Tower Fields, which overlooks the town and the International Eisteddfod field and pavilion.

Thermals rising up the valley sides to the south of the town are used for paragliding. Mountain bikers enjoy the hills.

Llangollen was the starting point of the first massed-start cycle race held on British roads, on 7 June 1942.

After the region around St Davids was firmly occupied by the Norman Marcher lordship of Pembroke by the early 12th century, with St Davids firmly under Norman influence thereafter, the princely Dinefwr family of Deheubarth transferred their patronage to Strata Florida, and interred many of their family members there.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
The Monastery was founded in 1164 by the Cambro-Norman Knight Robert FitzStephen (c 1123–1183). In the 12th century, Cistercian monks from Whitland Abbey, Narberth, Carmarthenshire started to construct a religious settlement on the banks of the &quot;Afon Fflur&quot; (from which the present Abbey takes its name), a short distance from the present site. This was at a time of fast expansion of the Cistercian order. 
The site of this first settlement is known as &quot;Hen Fynachlog&quot; (the Old Monastery).

Around 1164 the Abbey of Strata Florida was founded through the patronage of Rhys ap Gruffydd. In 1184, a further charter was issued by Lord Rhys, reaffirming Strata Florida as a monastery under the patronage of Deheubarth, a principality of South Wales. Several descendants of the Lord Rhys have been buried at this Abbey, including 11 princes of the Welsh royal house of Dinefwr of Deheubarth during the 12th and 13th centuries Notable burials include Prince Gruffydd ap Rhys II and poet Dafydd ap Gwilym.

The church was consecrated in 1201.

===Medieval period===
Strata Florida became an important and powerful religious centre. Around 1238, Prince Llywelyn ap Iorwerth held a council at Strata Florida. It was here that he made the other Welsh leaders acknowledge his son Dafydd as his rightful successor. Strata Florida controlled many farms throughout Wales; these &quot;granges&quot; provided the monastery with food and income. The most important primary historical source for early Welsh history, the &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, was compiled at Strata Florida.

In 1401, during the early years of Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion, Strata Florida Abbey was taken by King Henry IV and his son. The monks were deemed to be sympathetic to Glyndŵr, so they were evicted from the monastery, which was plundered. Henry IV turned the religious buildings into a military base as he planned to capture or defeat any Welsh rebel forces active in the area. By 1402 the Earl of Worcester held the Abbey for the English Crown with a garrison of several hundred men-at-arms, archers and foot soldiers. It continued to be used as a military base for further campaigns against the Welsh rebels in 1407 and 1415.

The monastic site was returned to the Cistercians with the end of the Glyndŵr rebellion.

=== Dissolution ===
Beginning in 1539, Henry VIII used his dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church in Rome to dissolve and sack the monasteries of England and Wales. Strata Florida Abbey was dissolved in 1539 by church commissioners. The buildings and their contents were valued and then sold off. The church and most of the ancillary buildings were demolished for building materials such as the window glass and stone as well as the roof tiles and lead. However, the refectory and dormitory were rebuilt as &quot;Tŷ Abaty&quot;, a house for the local gentry. The property has been owned by a number of notable families including the Stedmans and the Powells of Nanteos. Much of the former monastic lands of the Cistercian abbey at Strata Florida were given to Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex who sold them on to Sir John Vaughan, of Trawsgoed. Through his marriage to Jane Stedman, daughter of John Stedman of Ystrad Fflur and Cilcennin, he gained more land on which to create the large Trawsgoed estate.

The present parish church of St. Mary, within the boundaries of the graveyard, may have been built with stone taken from the monastic site.

== Abandonment ==

Following its dissolution, the site of Strata Florida Abbey was left to deteriorate. It was not until the coming of the railways in the late 19th century that interest in the site was rekindled. Stephen Williams, a railway engineer, was surveying a possible route through the area when he took an interest in the ruins. As Williams was a founder member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, he invited the group to the site in 1848. Following this visit the Association leased the Abbey site in order to create better displays and presentations to the public.

Williams, who was to become a leading expert on the archaeology of the Cistercian Order, was placed in charge of excavations. Over the next few years, he removed huge amounts of spoil, to uncover the majority of remains that are still on view today. Interest in the ruins brought in wealthy Victorians by railway. , a principal station on the Carmarthen Aberystwyth Line, was named after the Abbey.

About the Abbey the 1851 &quot;Illustrated London Reading Book&quot; says:

:The remains of Strata Florida Abbey, in South Wales, are most interesting in many points of view, more especially as the relics of a stately seminary for learning, founded as early as 1164. The community of the Abbey were Cistercian monks, who soon attained great celebrity, and acquired extensive possessions. They founded a large library that included national records from the earliest periods, works of the bards, and genealogies of the Princes and great families in Wales. The monks also compiled a valuable history of the Principality, down to the death of Llewellyn the Great. When Edward I invaded Wales, he burned the Abbey, but it was rebuilt A.D. 1294.

:Extensive woods once flourished in the vicinity of Strata Florida, and its burial-place covered no less than . A long list of eminent persons from all parts of Wales were buried, and amongst them Dafydd ap Gwilym, the famous bard. The churchyard is now reduced to small dimensions; but leaden coffins, doubtless belonging to once celebrated personages, are still found, both there and at a distance from the cemetery. Only a few aged box and yew-trees now remain to tell of the luxuriant verdure that once grew around the Abbey. Of the venerable pile itself, little is left, except an arch, and the fragment of a fine old wall, about forty feet high. A small church now stands within the enclosure, more than commonly interesting from having been built with the materials of the once celebrated Abbey of Strata Florida.

== Preservation ==
The site was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1919 and is now in the care of Cadw. It has a variety of ruins. The only substantive structure remaining of the monastery is the main entrance archway. The Great West Door to the Abbey Church has low walls marking the extent of the church and its six subsidiary chapels. A modern roof protects an area of excavated work medieval tiling. The small on-site museum has some of these tiles on display. One of the best-known is one depicting a medieval gentleman admiring himself in a mirror.

The graveyard next to the Abbey ruins is still used for burials. A memorial to the Welsh language poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym, who is interred here is next to an ancient yew tree. A stone memorial in the Chapter House commemorates the princes who are buried at Strata Florida. It is a replica; the original is housed in the site&#x27;s small museum.

=== Archaeological research ===
Geophysical surveys by the University of Wales, Lampeter, and its successor University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, have found several large structures. These include what is thought to be possibly the gatehouse to the Abbey&#x27;s inner precincts. There is no definitive evidence for a kiln that made tiles for the Abbey to be found in the surrounding woods.

Excavations of the possible gatehouse have revealed a number of medieval pottery tile sherds, indicating that the building may have also housed a chapel, possibly over the entrance way. The building was later reused as a residence and possibly as agricultural buildings. At some point a substantial frontage was built over the original gateway road to create space between the two flanking buildings. The structure then fell into disrepair and was lost.

A number of field boundaries have also been identified. Two leats that may have increased water flow into the Nant Glasffrwd were studied. It is believed they were used to run a mill further downstream. Iron working slag was discovered within the monastic precincts. , the excavations at Strata Florida are ongoing.
