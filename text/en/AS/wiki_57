<text>Jim Thorpe (known as East and West Mauch Chunk until 1954) is a borough and the county seat of Carbon County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. It is historically known as the burial site of Native American sports legend Jim Thorpe.

Jim Thorpe is located in the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania approximately northwest of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
===Founding===

Jim Thorpe was founded in 1818 as Mauch Chunk (), a name derived from the term &quot;Mawsch Unk&quot;, meaning Bear Place in Unami, the language of the native Lenape, possibly a reference to Bear Mountain, an extension of Mauch Chunk Ridge that resembled a sleeping bear, or perhaps the original profile of the ridge, which has since been changed heavily by 220 years of mining. The company town was founded by Josiah White and his two partners, founders of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (LC&amp;N). The town would be the lower terminus of a gravity railroad, the Summit Hill &amp; Mauch Chunk Railroad, which would bring coal to the head of the LC&amp;N Lehigh Canal for transshipment to the confluence of the Delaware River, downstream at Easton. It would thereby ship LC&amp;N&#x27;s coal to Philadelphia, Trenton, New York City, and other large cities in New Jersey and Delaware, and by ocean to the whole East Coast. Canal shipping was eventually replaced by railroad shipping.

===Coal mining and the LC&amp;N canal===

The town grew slowly in its first decade, then rapidly around 1818 grew larger as it became an anthracite coal-shipping center. (The other large city with growing coal mining in the region was Scranton, with a population of over 140,000.) Mauch Chunk is on a Lehigh River west side (right bank) flat where Mahoning Creek enters and is a tributary of the Lehigh River. The river&#x27;s left bank community of East Mauch Chunk, which has more of the houses of modern Jim Thorpe, was settled later to support the short-lived Beaver Creek Railroad, the mines which spawned it, and the logging industry. It came into greater growth when the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1885 pushed up the valley on the river&#x27;s east bank to oppose LC&amp;N&#x27;s effective transportation monopoly over the region, which extended across to northwest Wilkes-Barre at Pittston on the Susquehanna River/Pennsylvania Canal.

===Railroad growth and coal shipping===
After the Pennsylvania Canal Commission smoothed the way, Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation built the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&amp;S) from Pittston to Ashley, building the Ashley Planes inclined railway and linked that by rail from Mountain Top to White Haven at the head of the canal&#x27;s upper works, referred to as the Grand Lehigh Canal, whose navigations shortened the Lehigh Gorge, now located in the Lehigh Gorge State Park route, cutting the distance from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre and the Wyoming Valley coal deposits by over . This placed Mauch Chunk in the center of a nexus of transportation in country tough to travel through. When floods wiped out many of the upper Lehigh Canal works in 1861, the L&amp;S Railroad was extended through the gap to supplant the canal, and the so-called switchback-twisted backtrack through Avoca, with the improved engines of the day, enabled two-way steam locomotive traction and traffic despite the steep grades. Owner LC&amp;N Company&#x27;s headquarters was built across the street in Mauch Chunk from the L&amp;S Railroad&#x27;s stylish brick passenger station that was soon boarding passengers onto trains from New York and Philadelphia to Buffalo. The Central Railroad of New Jersey eventually took over the L&amp;S and the station. The Lehigh Valley Railroad arrived on the river&#x27;s east bank at East Mauch Chunk in 1855.,

===Major historical events===
Mauch Chunk was the location of one of the trials of the Molly Maguires in 1876, which resulted in the hanging of four men found guilty of murder. The population of the borough in 1900 was 4,020; in 1910, it was 3,952.
Following the 1953 death of athlete and Olympic medal winner Jim Thorpe, Thorpe&#x27;s widow and third wife, Patricia, was impatient when, after five months, the planned memorial in Shawnee, Oklahoma had yet to raise the $100,000 to honor him. The town&#x27;s citizens had paid for her, a Thorpe son and Jim&#x27;s body to be shipped from California, paid and arranged for the funeral service at St. Benedict&#x27;s Catholic church, and paid for the mausoleum costs at Fairview Cemetery. Then Gov. Johnston Murray vetoed a bill which would contribute funds to the erection of the memorial at Athletic Park. On Sept. 1st Mrs. Thorpe, saying she feared Jim would be buried in a potter&#x27;s field, shipped the body to Tulsa where she said the Chamber of Commerce was going to build a proper memorial, which was not true. When she heard that the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were desperately seeking to attract business, she made a deal with civic officials. According to Jim Thorpe&#x27;s son, Jack, Patricia was motivated by money in seeking the deal.

===Renaming to Jim Thorpe===
The two cross-river boroughs merged in 1954 and renamed the new municipality Jim Thorpe in his honor, despite Thorpe never setting foot in the Borough while alive. The municipality then obtained the athlete&#x27;s remains from his widow and erected a monument to the Oklahoma native, who began his sports career southwest, as a student at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The monument site contains his tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical markers describing his life story. The grave rests on mounds of soil from Thorpe&#x27;s native Oklahoma and from the Stockholm Olympic Stadium in which he won his Olympic medals.
On June 24, 2010, one of Jim Thorpe&#x27;s sons, Jack Thorpe, sued the town for his father&#x27;s remains, citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which is designed to return Native American artifacts to their tribal homelands. On February 11, 2011, Judge Richard Caputo ruled that Jack Thorpe could not gain any monetary award, nor any amount for attorney&#x27;s fees in the lawsuit and that for the lawsuit to continue other members of the Thorpe family and the Sac and Fox Nation would have to join him as plaintiffs. Before Jack Thorpe could respond to the ruling he died at the age of 73 on February 22, 2011. Because of his death his representatives were given more time to respond to the ruling. On May 2, 2011, William and Richard Thorpe, Jim Thorpe&#x27;s remaining sons and the Sac &amp; Fox Nation of Oklahoma joined the lawsuit, allowing it to continue. On April 19, 2013, Caputo ruled in favor of William and Richard Thorpe, ruling that the borough amounts to a museum under the law. This ruling was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on October 23, 2014. The US Supreme Court refused to hear their appeal on October 5, 2015, assuring that Jim Thorpe&#x27;s remains will stay in Carbon County.
The decision to rename the borough saw a mixed reaction by the borough&#x27;s residents, many of whom still refer to the borough as Mauch Chunk. Detractors to the new name claim that the renaming was a &quot;Tourist Lure&quot; and protested that Jim Thorpe had never even set eyes on the borough while he was alive. There were several movements to rename the borough back to Mauch Chunk, first in 1964 after the expected boost in tourism never came and another in 1992 as Jim Thorpe&#x27;s popularity waned and locals referred to renaming the borough after a dead Native American to boost tourism revenues as &quot;crass commercialism&quot; while Thorpe&#x27;s family called for his remains to be returned to Oklahoma.

===Architecture===
The history of the 1880s Mauch Chunk is reflected in the architecture that makes up its many 19th century styles. A former resident and architectural historian, Hans Egli, noted the vast range of styles: Federalist, Greek Revival, Second Empire, Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, and Richardsonian Romanesque. Most of these architectural examples remained protected and intact beneath aluminum or vinyl siding that has since been removed. Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi, renowned Philadelphia architects, conducted a little-known planning study in the 1970s that attempted to understand the dynamics of historicism and tourism, notions that have come into their own in contemporary times. While Venturi&#x27;s planning study was unique at the time, it has since become a critical factor in Jim Thorpe&#x27;s rebound as a functioning and economically stable community. Jim Thorpe tourism is based on its vintage architecture, and recreation such as hiking, paintball and white water rafting.

===Historic site preservation and modern day use===
The Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal, Old Mauch Chunk Historic District, Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, Asa Packer Mansion, Harry Packer Mansion, Carbon County Jail, Central Railroad of New Jersey Station, and St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The former Central Railroad of New Jersey railroad line through the Lehigh gorge and through Jim Thorpe is now operated as a summer tourist railroad by Reading Blue Mountain &amp; Northern Railroad. The former New York City to Buffalo Lehigh Valley Railroad across the river is a present-day very active freight hauling railroad operated by Norfolk Southern.

==Mauch Chunk Switchback Gravity Railroad==
In 1827, the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, a coal mining and shipping company with operations in Summit Hill, constructed an downhill track, known as a gravity railroad, to deliver coal (and a miner to operate the mine train&#x27;s brake) to the Lehigh Canal in Mauch Chunk. This helped open up the area to commerce, and helped to fuel the Industrial Revolution in the United States. By the 1850s, the &quot;Gravity Road&quot; (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill seekers for 50 cents a ride (equal to $ today). It is often cited as the first roller coaster in the United States. The Switchback Gravity Railroad Foundation was formed to study the feasibility of preserving and interpreting the remains of the Switchback Gravity Railroad on top of Mount Pisgah.

==Geography==

Jim Thorpe is located near the center of Carbon County at .

In the deeps of the geologic timescale the two shorelines of the Lehigh River occupied by the 19th-century towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were situated on the bottom of an ancient river-fed tarn, a mountain lake which filled the valley on the west bank and covered the relative flatlands on the east bank. The muddy bottom of that high tarn (the range then rivaling the Himalayas in size), where the waters pooled at a lower elevation amongst the twisted folds of four near-parallel ridgelines, created a level region whose settlements became the relatively flat lands on either bank of the Lehigh. The ridgelines, which run east-northeast to west-southwest, are (from north to south) Broad, Nesquehoning, Pisgah, and Mauch Chunk ridges (or Mountains)—each of which runs over west to the gaps cut by the Schuylkill River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Jim Thorpe has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.15%, is water. Jim Thorpe is north and upstream of Lehighton, below the Lehigh Gap which sunders Bear Mountain on the east bank from the extended ridge of Mauch Chunk Mountain.

The town is east of Nesquehoning, which is up a steep grade and around the bend along U.S. 209 South, and also butting up against the slopes of Mount Pisgah. This was a key element in the LC&amp;N&#x27;s planning, for the grade from the mountain ridge down to the river enabled them to fill barges quickly, using chutes and an elevated entry from a road down the ridge face. Jim Thorpe&#x27;s developed elevations range between the river slack water at above sea level— to the town&#x27;s upper streets, all below the western peak of Mount Pisgah, which tops out at above sea level.

The elevation of the Borough of Jim Thorpe ranges from at Broadway and Hazard Square downtown to above sea level northeast of the borough center near the Penn Forest Township line. It has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and average downtown monthly temperatures range from 26.5 °F in January to 71.2 °F in July. PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U The local hardiness zone is 6a.

==Transportation==

As of 2019, there were of public roads in Jim Thorpe, of which were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

U.S. Route 209, although signed as a north–south route, tends to follow an east–west route in Pennsylvania. In Jim Thorpe and Lehighton, U.S. 209 runs in directions opposite its signage—i.e., northbound U.S. 209 runs southwards and vice versa. It intersects the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension (Interstate 476) east of Lehighton, about southeast of Jim Thorpe.

Pennsylvania Route 903 has its southern terminus at U.S. 209 in Jim Thorpe. It is a north–south route that runs northeast of town, connecting to PA 115 near the Pocono Raceway, Interstate 476, and PA 534 in Penn Forest Township.

Carbon Transit provides bus service to Jim Thorpe along Route 701, which runs between Coaldale and Palmerton on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Route 702, which runs between Nesquehoning and Palmerton Monday-Friday. Carbon Transit also operates CT Flex service in Jim Thorpe, Penn Forest Township, and Kidder Township.

The town is served by the Reading, Blue Mountain, and Northern Railroad with year-round freight service. Seasonal passenger excursions to and from the town is provided by its subsidiary, the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway.

The town registered 3,920 votes to land the number 7 spot on the list. In 2012, Jim Thorpe was voted the fourth most beautiful small town in America in the Rand McNally/&quot;USA Today&quot; Road Rally series. Jim Thorpe is becoming a tourist destination, with many businesses catering to white water rafting, mountain biking, paintball and hiking. Trails in Lehigh Gorge State Park attract hikers from all over, with Glen Onoko Falls a top trail destination just north of downtown. Along with these sports, Jim Thorpe is popular among railroading fans for its passenger rail service, and is known for its extraordinary architecture.

The town is home to the Asa Packer and Harry Packer mansions. Asa Packer founded Lehigh Valley Railroad and Lehigh University; Harry was his son. The mansions sit side by side on a hill overlooking downtown. The Asa Packer Mansion is a museum and has been conducting tours since Memorial Day of 1956. The Harry Packer Mansion is a bed and breakfast; it served as the model for the Haunted Mansion ride at Walt Disney World in Florida.

Jim Thorpe is home to the Anthracite Triathlon, an Olympic-distance triathlon open to amateur and professional triathletes. The swimming portion occurs in Mauch Chunk Lake, Which has kayaking and boating rentals for the public to use as well as a beach. The bike course takes riders through the mining towns of Summit Hill, Nesquehoning, Lansford and Jim Thorpe. The running portion of the course is generally along the former alignment of a historic switchback railroad.

The Anita Shapolsky Art Foundation was established at 20 West Broadway, in a 1859 former Presbyterian church, in Jim Thorpe in 1998. There, through the organization, Anita Shapolsky exhibits abstract artists and contemporary artworks during the summer, and provides educational programs for children.

In 2022, an upstart pro lacrosse league, the Professional Box Lacrosse Association announced a franchise called the Jim Thorpe All Americans would be based there. However, no arena has yet been announced.

<text>Lansford is a county-border borough (town) in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. It is located northwest of Allentown and 19 miles south of Hazleton in the Panther Creek Valley about from Philadelphia and abutting the cross-county sister-city of Coaldale in Schuylkill County.

The whole valley was owned and subdivided into separate lots by the historically important Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, locally called the Old Company, which likely settled some structures on the lands by 1827.

Lansford grew with the development of local anthracite coal mines and was named after Asa Lansford Foster, who was an advocate for merging the small patch towns that developed in the area surrounding the anthracite coal mines.

The population was 3,941 at the 2010 census, a steep decline from a high of 9,632 at the 1930 census common to many mining towns in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

==History==
Lansford&#x27;s first school was opened in 1847 on Abbott Street. Lansford&#x27;s first church, the Welsh Congregational, was built in 1850 and still stands today on West Abbott Street.
The old No. 9 Mine and Museum in Lansford, a deep mine which operated from 1855 to 1972, is now open as a tourist attraction offering tours of the mine and a wealth of information on local mining history. A museum occupying the mine&#x27;s former Wash Shanty building on the site displays a large collection of mining artifacts.

One of the local mine bosses, John P. Jones, was murdered in Lansford, reportedly in connection with labor union strife, attributed to members of a secret society known as the Molly Maguires, many of whom were put on trial and hanged in Carbon and Schuylkill Counties during the mid- to late 1870s.

Lansford was the home of the first Commercial Cable Television system in the United States.

The Lansford Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. The town shares the border of Carbon and Schuylkill County with the abutting neighboring community of Coaldale, which is &quot;de facto&quot;, a suburban bedroom neighborhood. Lansford is 1 mile north of Summit Hill (where the first anthracite deposits mined by the Lehigh Coal Company were discovered in the 1780s); 10 miles west of Lehighton, and 6 miles northeast of Tamaqua. Lansford&#x27;s elevation is 1145 feet above sea level. It is also 36 miles northwest of Allentown and 9 miles south of Hazleton. It is located on the northwestern fringe of the Lehigh Valley and is at the southern end of the Coal Region and the Pocono Mountains.

Lansford sits on the north slope of Pisgah Mountain above and along the south bank of the Panther Creek tributary of the Little Schuylkill River, athwart US-209 west of Jim Thorpe, Nesquehoning, and the eastern extent of the Lehigh-Schuylkill drainage divide, down slope and below historic Summit Hill and east of abutting Coaldale and Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, both farther downstream and west. Nesquehoning Mountain dominates the north bank across the Panther Creek and the rich coal mines of the valley shipped coal through the long Hauto Tunnel of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) competing for the rich trade with New York City and Philadelphia.

Hugh Vrablic is the Mayor of Lansford and is assisted by a council. The town also has a fire department and a police force.

Lansford is part of the Panther Valley School District and is the home of their newly remodeled football stadium and walking track.

<text>Lausanne Township is a township in Carbon County, Pennsylvania. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The township dates back to 1808 when the first Lausanne settlement was organized with a local frontier government.

==History==
The original population of Lausanne Landing was quite variable limited to a handful of year-round settlers and varying groups of itinerant workmen from expeditions sent to log, mine, or build boats. The current town population was 237 at the 2010 census. The township was named after Lausanne, in Switzerland and the bowl shaped valley near its first settlement at Lausanne Landing has often been called the Switzerland of America.

==Geography==
The township is located along the northern border of Carbon County, with Luzerne County to the north. It lies in a valley bordered by the parallel ridges of Buck Mountain to the north and Round Head Mountain to the south. Its only village is Buck Mountain, at the base of the mountain with the same name. Historically, it began as part of the original Northampton County, which was larger than New Jersey, with a township centered at Lausanne Landing and consisted of the lands in most of what is now Carbon County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all of it land. It is part of the Lehigh River watershed.

Lausanne has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and the hardiness zones are 5b and 6a. Average monthly temperatures in Buck Mountain range from 24.4 °F in January to 69.7 °F in July.

==History==

Lausanne Township was originally as part of the original Northampton County in the &#x27;Towamensing District&#x27;, a part of the unorganized wilderness above Blue Mountain. The Towamensing District was then reorganized in 1808 when the section of the county above Blue Mountain was set out as individual townships, and Schuylkill County was created:

&quot;And a small section of southern Lausanne Twp.&quot; was to set a pattern. The township remained a nurturing organizational government through a number of additional divisions, children split off in the past to attain greater success and populations with ever diminished territory each time it suffered a division. 
;1842:Banks Township erected from the Northwestern part of Lausanne.
;1843:Carbon County created from Northern Northampton and Monroe Counties.
;1847:Packer Township set off from Lausanne.
;1863:Weatherly set off from Lausanne at this time, and becomes the third borough in the county after Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk.
;1875:Lehigh Township made up of lands along the west bank of the Lehigh River is set off from Lausanne from Glen Onoko north to the Luzerne County line, leaving a small rump community. Both are very rural.

Today, the township is a narrow strip too small to effectively grow or split, wedged against the Luzerne-Carbon County border in rough country.

<text>Lehigh Township is a township in Carbon County, Pennsylvania. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania.

The population was 479 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
The area of Carbon County, Pennsylvania that is present-day Lehigh Township was considered to be part of Lausanne Township from 1808 until 1875. It was during that year that it became known as Lehigh Township.

In 1808, a tract of forested land near the Lehigh River was owned by members of the Moravian Church. In 1824, Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company executives purchased the lumber rights to that land and built four sawmills, housing for its workers and a town store on the land in order to establish a lumber harvesting operation to support the company&#x27;s coal barge construction efforts. That first town was known as Lowrytown; it would later be known as Rockport.

==Geography==

The township is located in north-central Carbon County and is bordered to the north partially by Luzerne County. The Lehigh River forms the winding eastern border of the township, carving a gorge up to deep.

The township&#x27;s villages include Leslie Run and Rockport. The borough of Weatherly is on the western side of the township but is a separate municipality.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Lehigh Township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.12%, is water.

The township has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and the hardiness zones are 5b and 6a. Average monthly temperatures in Rockport range from 25.2 °F in January to 69.9 °F in July.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 census, there were 527 people, 193 households, and 156 families residing in the township.

The population density was 20.1 people per square mile (7.8/km). There were 237 housing units at an average density of 9.0/sq mi (3.5/km).

<text>Lehighton () is a borough in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania.

Due in part to water power from the Lehigh River, Lehighton was an early center for U.S. industrialization. The Lehigh Valley Railroad was for years a major employer up until the post-World War II era when railroad and industry restructuring led to job and population losses.

As of the 2020 U.S. census, Lehighton&#x27;s population was 5,248, down from a peak population of 7,000 in 1940. Lehighton is the most populous borough in Carbon County and still the county&#x27;s business hub. The Lehigh River, a tributary of the Delaware River, flows through Lehighton.

==History==
At the time of the first European&#x27;s encounters with historic American tribes, this area was part of the shared hunting territory of the Iroquoian Susquehannock and the Algonquian Lenape, also called the Delaware, after their language and territory along the Delaware River, peoples, who were often at odds.

Close relatives of the peoples of New England and along the St. Lawrence Valley of Canada occupied much of the coastal mid-Atlantic area in Delaware, New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania, and lower eastern New York, including Long Island. The Susquehannock confederacy&#x27;s homelands were mainly along the Susquehanna River, from the Mohawk Valley in lower New York southerly to the Chesapeake and Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley, but may have ranged into the empty lands of West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania.

The Dutch and Swedes first settled the Delaware Valley, and found the area north of the Lehigh Gap to be lightly occupied, probably by transients, but traveled regularly by the Susquehannock. This tribe traveled quite a bit according to the &quot;American Heritage Book of Indians&quot;, including being described in lofty terms by John Smith when a band visited the new Jamestown, Virginia colony. In the decades of the Beaver Wars in the mid-1600s, the Susquehannocks conquered and made the Lenape a tributary tribe — and also nearly inflicted an overwhelming defeat on the powerful Iroquois Confederacy. Shortly thereafter, the Susquehannocks suffered a reversal, falling first to epidemic disease that raged for three years which killed off perhaps 90% of their population, and a series of battles on most of their frontiers as various enemies took advantage. This vacated the southeastern and central Pennsylvania regions for the Delaware peoples. However, all tribes were thereafter displaced westwards by continued colonial growth. Delaware dominance at the time of European colonization is why William Penn&#x27;s settlers adopted Lenape Lenki (Delaware) names for landscape features, and less than a handful of Susquehannock names.

Lehighton was built on the site of the German Moravian Brethren&#x27;s mission station &quot;Gnadenhütten&quot; (cabins of grace) founded in 1746. It was established as a mission to the Lenape by Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, lower on the Lehigh River. The German name was transcribed as &quot;Canatanheat&quot; by missionary John Brainerd.

During the French and Indian Wars (Seven Years&#x27; War), Native allies of the French killed 11 missionaries during the Gnadenhütten massacre on 24 November 1755. They destroyed the mission village, and only four of the sixteen residents escaped. (During the American Revolutionary War in 1782, Pennsylvania militia raided another Moravian mission village, also called Gnadenhutten, in present-day Ohio. Suspecting the Lenape of being allied with the British, the militia killed 96 unarmed men, women, and children in what became better known as the Gnadenhutten Massacre.)

The Lehigh River was a source of water power for developing industries in the 19th century. Lehighton had silk and lace mills, a meat-packing house, shirt factory, automatic-press works, car shops, stoneworks, and foundries. In 1900, the population was 4,629 people. By 1940, it had reached 6,615.

The coming of the railroad made it easier for residents to get their products to major markets. For many years, the Lehigh Valley Railroad had a major repair facility in Lehighton. The coming of the railroad was a major economic boost for the town. It was the area&#x27;s largest company, employing several thousand workers at the repair facilities or operating and maintaining the railroad. Restructuring in the railroad industry led to the repair facilities being moved to another location. Lost jobs meant that some people had to relocate for work.

The Lehighton downtown declined after the Carbon Plaza Mall was built in nearby Mahoning Township. Suburban housing developed, pulling more businesses from downtown. After struggling for three decades, the downtown is experiencing a rebirth as people appreciate the qualities of a compact central location, royalty and historic architecture.

<text>Palmerton is a borough in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The borough&#x27;s population was 5,414 at the 2010 census.

Palmerton is located northwest of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia.

== History ==
Native Americans lived in the area that is now Palmerton for many years. Early European settlers established the villages of Hazard and Little Gap, which were part of Lower Towamensing Township. There was also an Underground Railroad station there. Palmerton was officially incorporated in 1912.

In 1912, the New Jersey Zinc Company located a Zinc smelting operation (now the West Plant) here, in order to take advantage of the anthracite coal being mined just north of Palmerton and the zinc mines in Franklin, New Jersey. The town was named after New Jersey Zinc&#x27;s then-President, Stephen S. Palmer, though Palmer was reportedly not pleased with having his name on the town.

A second location, the East Plant, was established on the other side of town in 1911. Though other industries, such as several garment manufacturing shops, came to Palmerton, the zinc company was the major employer for most of the town&#x27;s history. Much of the population came to the site, principally from Eastern Europe, in order to work in the zinc plants.

Zinc smelting was ended in 1980 due to a poor zinc market and environmental regulation. The West Plant was demolished in 2010. The East Plant continues to operate at reduced capacity, processing electric arc furnace dust into zinc calcine.

The Palmer House, a five-story Senior Citizens residence at 360 Delaware Avenue is on the site of the former Palm Theater.

The Palmerton Historic District, covering the downtown area, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 19, 2018.

<doc id="131742" wikidata="Q1181581" url="?curid=131742" title="Parryville, Pennsylvania">
<text>Parryville is a borough in Carbon County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania, and is located southeast of Lehighton and north of Bowmanstown, off Route 248 and northwest of Palmerton.

Parryville&#x27;s elevation is above sea level. The population was 416 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Located roughly six miles south of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, the history of the borough of Parryville can be traced back to the late eighteenth century, when Peter Frantz arrived on this land in 1780, and became the first man to settle there. Leonard Beltz and Frederick Scheckler then arrived in 1781, and built a stone gristmill adjacent to the Pohopoco Creek. Beltz, a native of Franklin County, had married Elizabeth Boyer, a daughter of Frederick and Susan Boyer. They raised twelve children on the property. Mrs. Beltz lived to be 105 years old.

In 1815, Beltz and Scheckler sold the mill and its related property to Jacob and Peter Stein, who improved the property by building a new hotel there.

In 1836, the Pine Forest Lumber Company, which owned extensive tracts of rich timber land in the northern part of the county and in the southern portion of Luzerne County, established its headquarters in this growing community, and built new sawmills, a lathe machining facility and paling mills adjacent to the creek. Its president was Daniel Parry, for whom the town was named, first as Parrysville and then Parryville.

In 1836, the Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company installed a line, which enabled travelers to cross the river from this place, making Parryville a terminus and shipping point. Among the companies doing business there during this time was the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, which took advantage of the creek&#x27;s access to the Lehigh River to move its coal-laden canal boats to other parts of the region. These operations were interrupted in early 1841 when a freshet on January 7 and 8 swept away the railroad track between Parryville and Penn Haven Junction, as well as boat wharves and related shipping structures. That railroad segment was never rebuilt.

New life was injected into the village when, sometime around 1855, Dennis Bauman, his brother Henry, and others, established an anthracite blast furnace there. This furnace was powered by water furnished by the Pohopoco Creek for two years, at which point company executives sold their plant to the Carbon Iron Company, which introduced steam as the company&#x27;s new power source.

Parryville became an independent school district in 1867 and was subsequently incorporated as a borough early in 1875, with Dennis Bauman serving as its first chief burgess. By 1880, the town had 657 inhabitants.

<text>Aaronsburg is a census-designated place (CDP) in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 613 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Aaronsburg was founded in 1786 by Aaron Levy, of which the town is named for him. It is the first town in Pennsylvania (and possibly in the United States) laid out by and named after a Jew. He laid out the town of right in the geographic center of the state, with hopes of it becoming a major settlement. Its orderly planned and aligned streets were designed that the town might one day be the county seat. This, however, never occurred due to the lack of water. The current county seat is Bellefonte.

Levy was a prominent Jewish merchant who immigrated to Pennsylvania from Amsterdam sometime between 1760 and 1770 to trade with the native peoples and furnished supplies to the proprietary government. After Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed in 1768, he went west in the land rush and settled at the west branches of the Susquehanna River. There he opened a store to buy and sell to local farmers and native peoples.

During the American Revolutionary War, he moved back to Lancaster. As a creditor, Levy was a major financier of the Continental Congress during the conflict, with his loans never fully being repaid.

In June 1779, Levy bought a tract of 334 acres in Center County known as the Alexander Grant warranty. Upon this he laid out and planned what would become Aaronsburg. A plot of ground named Aaron&#x27;s Square was reserved by the founder for public uses, and one of the streets was named Rachel&#x27;s Way in honor of his wife. On November 16, 1789, Levy gave to the trustees of the Salem Evangelical Church a lot upon which to erect a church and schoolhouse.

In 1949 a pageant was held to celebrate Aaronsburg&#x27;s unique history and namesake. Aaron Levy, a Jewish merchant from Philadelphia, presented members of Salem Lutheran Church with a pewter communion set as a gift. This unusual gesture inspired many, and 50,000 people descended upon Aaronsburg to commemorate it. Attendees included Ralph Bunche, Cornel Wilde, and, later, Ronald Reagan. A short film and a book &quot;The Aaronsburg Story&quot; by Arthur H. Lewis were written about this event, published in 1955.

The Aaronsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Geography==
Aaronsburg is located in eastern Centre County, in the northwest corner of Haines Township. It is bordered on the west by the borough of Millheim. It sits in the Penns Valley at the southern base of Shriner Mountain. Pennsylvania Route 45 passes through the town, leading west into Millheim and then on to State College, and east to Lewisburg on the Susquehanna River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Aaronsburg CDP has a total area of , all land.

<text>The Borough of Bellefonte is a borough in and the county seat of Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is approximately 12 miles northeast of State College and is part of the State College, Pennsylvania metropolitan statistical area. The borough population was 6,187 at the 2010 census. It houses the Centre County Courthouse, located downtown on the diamond. Bellefonte has also been home to five of Pennsylvania&#x27;s governors, as well as two other governors. All seven are commemorated in a monument located at Talleyrand Park.

The town features many examples of Victorian architecture. It is also home to the natural spring, &quot;la belle fonte&quot;. bestowed by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord during a land-speculation visit to central Pennsylvania in the 1790, from which the town derives its name. The spring, which serves as the town&#x27;s water supply, has since been covered to comply with DEP water purity laws.

The early development of Bellefonte had been as a &quot;natural town.&quot; It started with one house and a crossroad, then iron was found and the town grew.

== History ==

William Lamb sold his mill to John Dunlop in 1794. The following year, John’s father James Dunlop and John’s son-in-law James Harris (1756-1841) laid out the town that would become known as Bellefonte.

As the years went by, Bellefonte boomed and soon became the most influential town between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg.

== Bellefonte Historic District ==
The Bellefonte Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Other buildings on the National Register of Historic Places are: Bellefonte Armory, Bellefonte Forge House, Brockerhoff Hotel, Centre County Courthouse, Gamble Mill, McAllister-Beaver House, Miles-Humes House, Pennsylvania Match Company, South Ward School, and the William Thomas House. Bellefonte Academy was listed until 2008; it was destroyed by fire in 2004.

=== Bush House Hotel ===

Bush House Hotel was built in 1868-69 by Bellefonte attorney and developer Daniel G. Bush. It was one of the first hotels in the country to have electric lights. A man would stand at the train station and call out to the passengers, &quot;Walk ya&#x27; to the Bush House.&quot; The Brockerhoff House, the Haag House, and other area hotels were competitors. Many notable guests stayed at the Bush House including Thomas Edison. The Bush House burned down on February 8, 2006.

=== The Cadillac Building ===
This building was designed by pioneering female architect Anna Wagner Keichline, a native of Bellefonte, and originally served as a car dealership with a showroom on first floor, a repair shop on the second, and an office and living space on the third floor. The Cadillac Building, so named because it was originally built as a Cadillac dealership in 1916, was a mix use commercial and residential property hit by a devastating fire on December 22, 2009. Christmas tree lights in one of the apartment units were determined to be the cause.

The Cadillac Building was rebuilt in 2016 and is now home to 11 two- and three-bedroom apartment units. It remains a part of the Bellefonte Historic District.

=== Garman Opera House ===
The Garman Opera House was originally built in 1890 and hosted many notable stars of the day, including George Burns and Gracie Allen, Western performer Tom Mix, and illusionist and escape artist Harry Houdini.

The song &quot;After the Ball&quot; was said to have been first sung in public here. It was eventually also used as a movie theater, first showing silent films and then &quot;talkies.&quot; By the early 1960s, the property was converted to primarily commercial/warehouse use. In the 1990s, the building was restored and returned to its roots as a live performance venue and cinema.

The opera house was severely damaged by a fire on September 9, 2012 that also destroyed the Garman House Hotel. The cause of the fire has been ruled as arson. Preservationist groups&#x27; attempts to save the Garman were unsuccessful and the building was razed in January 2014.

Garman House was rebuilt in 2016 and is now home to 21 one and two bedroom apartment units.

=== Victorian era ===
First-time visitors who walk along the Victorian streets of Bellefonte see primarily Victorian houses. One of many examples is the Hastings Mansion, which was owned by Mrs. John Lane and was bought and remodeled by Governor Daniel H. Hastings.

In the 1800s, the first jail was built. It had a dungeon eight feet underground, which was located on the rear of the lot of the present YMCA. A second jail was on East High Street.

=== Renaissance ===
One of the town&#x27;s historic sections experienced a renaissance in 2004. The &quot;Match Factory&quot; (officially the Pennsylvania Match Company), after standing vacant since 1947, was renovated by the American Philatelic Society as their new home, one building at a time. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

===Transportation===
Bellefonte is served by the Centre Area Transportation Authority for local bus service, linking Bellefonte to various points in State College including the Nittany Mall, downtown and the Penn State main campus. The town is also served by the University Park Airport for commercial air travel.

Bellefonte does not have passenger train service, with the nearest Amtrak stations located in Lewistown (approximately 32 miles away) and Tyrone (approximately 35 miles away) and serving Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; train between Pittsburgh and New York City.

===Public safety===
The law enforcement agency in Bellefonte is the Bellefonte Police Department. The Centre County Sheriff&#x27;s office is also located in Bellefonte.

The Bellefonte Fire Department is made up of two volunteer companies: Logan Fire Company #1 and Undine Fire Company #2. Ambulance service is provided by Bellefonte EMS, which separated from Logan Fire Company in 1994.

===Early railroads===
Up until 1946 the Bellefonte Central Railroad served the town on a Bellefonte-Lemont (State College) route. Until 1933 the BCR continued the route south to Tyrone over the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s former Fairbrook Branch. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Railroad ran passenger trains from Altoona to Williamsport, after Milesburg heading into Bellefonte, then backing out to return to the Bald Eagle Valley Branch&#x27;s route to continue the trip northeast. The last Altoona - Lock Haven train was between August 1950 and 1951. The PRR also operated trains until the late 1940s from Bellefonte south to Lemont (nearest train station to State College), then east to Northumberland and Sunbury, Pennsylvania.

===Turnpikes and roads===
A turnpike was created in 1822 after ten years of construction. This turnpike, named The Northumberland and Anderson&#x27;s Creek Turnpike, connected Bellefonte to Clearfield on the west and Sunbury on the east. Today, Pennsylvania Route 550 runs through the town. Interstate 99/US Route 220 pass by the eastern outskirts of the town.

It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,722 at the 2010 census. The village claims to be the birthplace of Memorial Day.

Mathilde inherited a portion of her aunt Victoria&#x27;s estate in 1908 and brought the Columbus Chapel to the Boal Mansion from Spain in 1919 This inheritance included an admiral&#x27;s desk that family tradition says belonged to Columbus himself. The Columbus Chapel and Boal Mansion Museum are open to the public. Boalsburg originally was on the main road for travelers from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, with the David Boal tavern that housed travelers still standing today.

<doc id="131758" wikidata="Q122669" url="?curid=131758" title="Vertigo Comics">
<text>DC Vertigo, also known as Vertigo Comics or simply Vertigo, is an imprint of the American comic book publisher DC Comics. Vertigo publishes comics with adult content, such as nudity, drug use, profanity, and graphic violence, that do not fit the restrictions of DC&#x27;s main line. Its comics include company-owned series set in the DC Universe, such as &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, and &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and creator-owned works, such as &quot;Preacher&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Fables&quot;.

Vertigo originated from DC&#x27;s 1980s adult comic line, which began after DC stopped submitting &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; for approval by the Comics Code Authority. Following the success of two adult-oriented 1986 limited series, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;, DC&#x27;s output of adult comics, edited by Karen Berger, grew. By 1992, DC&#x27;s mature readers&#x27; line was editorially separate from its main line and Berger received permission to manage them under a separate imprint. Vertigo was launched in January 1993, with a mix of existing DC ongoing series and new series.

Although its initial publications were primarily in the horror and fantasy genres, Vertigo expanded to publish works dealing with crime, social commentary, speculative fiction, biography, and other genres. Vertigo also reprinted comics previously published by DC under other imprints, such as &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; and &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot;. In North America, Vertigo pioneered a publishing model in which monthly series are periodically collected into editions for bookstore sale. Vertigo became DC&#x27;s most popular and enduring imprint; several Vertigo series have won the comics industry&#x27;s Eisner Award and have been adapted to film and television.

Vertigo began to decline in the 2010s, as certain properties like &quot;Hellblazer&quot; and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; were re-integrated into DC&#x27;s main comic books, while Berger departed in 2013. Berger&#x27;s departure was followed by a series of editorial restructures. An attempted relaunch in 2018 suffered a multitude of setbacks, including numerous cancellations. DC discontinued Vertigo in January 2020 as part of a plan to publish all comics under a single banner. Most Vertigo series moved to DC Black Label until 2024, when DC revived the imprint.

==History==
=== Development ===
Vertigo originated in 1993 under the stewardship of Karen Berger, a former literature and art-history student, who had joined DC Comics in 1979 as an assistant editor. Berger edited proto-Vertigo titles from the start of her time with DC, beginning in 1981 with &quot;House of Mystery&quot;. She took over editorship of Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; run from Swamp Thing co-creator Len Wein in 1984, and in 1986 &quot;became DC&#x27;s British liaison&quot;, bringing to DC&#x27;s pre-Vertigo titles the individuals who would be instrumental in the creation and evolution of Vertigo seven years later, including Neil Gaiman, Jamie Delano, Peter Milligan, and Grant Morrison. She &quot;found their sensibility and point of view to be refreshingly different, edgier and smarter&quot; than those of most American comics writers.

Berger edited several new or revived series with these writers, including superhero/science fiction series such as &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; vol. 2, and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; vol. 2, fantasy series &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2, and horror titles &quot;Hellblazer&quot; and &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot;. She also edited limited series such as &quot;Kid Eternity&quot;, &quot;Black Orchid&quot; (Gaiman&#x27;s first work for DC) and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; limited series.

These six ongoing titles, all of which carried a &quot;Suggested for Mature Readers&quot; label on their covers, shared a sophistication-driven sensibility the comics fan media dubbed &quot;the Bergerverse&quot;. In a 1992 editorial meeting with Levitz, publisher Jenette Kahn, and managing editor Dick Giordano, Berger was given the mandate to place these titles under an imprint that, as Berger described, would &quot;do something different in comics and help the medium &#x27;grow up&#x27;&quot;. Several DC titles bearing the age advisory, such as &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, and &quot;The Question&quot; (the last two cancelled before the launch of Vertigo), did not make the transition to the new imprint.

Meanwhile, Disney Comics and former DC editor Art Young had been developing an imprint to be called Touchmark Comics, analogous to Disney&#x27;s mature-audiences Touchstone Pictures studio. This project was abandoned following the so-called &quot;Disney Implosion&quot; of 1991. Young and those works were brought into the Vertigo fold, allowing Berger to expand the imprint&#x27;s publishing plans with the limited series &quot;Enigma&quot;, &quot;Sebastian O&quot;, &quot;Mercy&quot;, and &quot;Shadows Fall&quot;.

===Initial year===
Vertigo was launched in January 1993 with a mixture of existing ongoing series continued under the new imprint, new ongoing and limited series, and single-volume collections or graphic novels. Their publishing plan for the first year involved two new titles – whether ongoing/limited series or one-shots – each month. The existing series (cover date March 1993) were &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; (starting with #33), &quot;The Sandman&quot; (#47), &quot;Hellblazer&quot; (#63), &quot;Animal Man&quot; (#57), &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (#129), and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (#64, with new writer Rachel Pollack).

The first comic book published under the &quot;Vertigo&quot; imprint was the first issue of &quot;&quot;, a three-issue series by Neil Gaiman and Chris Bachalo. The second new title was the first issue of &quot;Enigma&quot;, an 8-issue limited series initially planned to launch Touchmark, written by Peter Milligan (also author of &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;) and drawn by Duncan Fegredo, the artist from Grant Morrison&#x27;s earlier &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; limited series. The following month saw the debut of &quot;Sandman: Mystery Theatre&quot; by Matt Wagner and Steven T. Seagle, and illustrated primarily by Guy Davis, described as &quot;playing the &#x27;30s with a &#x27;90s feel... haunting, film noir-ish...&quot;, and starring original Sandman Wesley Dodds in a title whose &quot;sensibilities echo crime genre fiction&quot;. Joining it was J. M. DeMatteis and Paul Johnson&#x27;s 64-page one-shot &quot;Mercy&quot;.

New series that began in the months that followed include &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; (ongoing) by Ann Nocenti and Sean Phillips (continuing from the earlier Morrison-penned limited series), Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell&#x27;s three-issue steampunk limited series &quot;Sebastian O&quot; (another ex-Touchmark project), &quot;Skin Graft&quot; by Jerry Prosser and Warren Pleece, &quot;The Last One&quot; by DeMatteis and Dan Sweetman, &quot;Jonah Hex: Two-Gun Mojo&quot; by Tim Truman and Sam Glanzman, &quot;Black Orchid&quot; (ongoing) by Dick Foreman and Jill Thompson (continuing from the earlier Gaiman/McKean limited series), &quot;The Extremist&quot; by Peter Milligan and Ted McKeever, &quot;Scarab&quot; by John Smith with Scot Eaton and Mike Barreiro, and &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, a crossover involving several of the imprint&#x27;s ongoing series. &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; limited series was relaunched as an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber, and illustrated by Peter Gross (later also writer), Gary Amaro, and Peter Snejbjerg.

Although the books did not have a consistent &quot;house style&quot; of art, the cover designs of early Vertigo series featured a uniform trade dress with a vertical bar along the left side, which included the imprint logo, pricing, date, and issue numbers. The design layout continued with very little variation until issues cover-dated July 2002 (including &quot;Fables&quot; #1) which introduced an across-the-top layout ahead of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo X&quot; 10th anniversary celebration. The &quot;distinctive design&quot; was intended to be used on &quot;all Vertigo books except the hardcovers, trade paperbacks, and graphic novels&quot;. Berger noted that DC was &quot;very&quot; committed to the line, having put a &quot;lot of muscle behind&quot; promoting it, including a promotional launch kit made available to &quot;[r]etailers who order[ed] at least 25 copies of the February issue of &quot;Sandman&quot; [#47]&quot;, a &quot;platinum edition&quot; variant cover for &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot; #1 and a 75-cent &quot;Vertigo Preview&quot; comic featuring a specially written seven-page &quot;Sandman&quot; story by Gaiman and Kent Williams. In addition, a 16-page &quot;Vertigo Sampler&quot; was also produced and bundled with copies of Capital City Distribution&#x27;s &quot;Advance Comics&quot; solicitation index.

Vertigo publications generally did not take place in a shared universe. However, several of the early series which had begun as part of the main DC Universe had a &quot;crossover&quot; in 1993-94: &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;. The event &quot;did not yield smashing results&quot; or garnered many positive reviews, in large part due to its &quot;gimmicky&quot; nature, which ran counter to Vertigo&#x27;s quirky, non-mainstream appeal and customer-base. The event was defended as &quot;no marketing ploy&quot; by one of the event&#x27;s editors, Lou Stathis, who wrote of his dislike of the often &quot;crass manipulation&quot; of crossover events, defending &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; as having come not from marketing, but the writers&#x27; minds, and therefore being &quot;story-driven&quot; rather than manipulative. The crossover did not become an annual event, however — indeed, &quot;annuals&quot; linked to Vertigo series rarely reappeared after this event.

Works previously published by DC under other imprints, but which fit the general character of Vertigo, have been reprinted under this imprint. This has included &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, earlier issues of Vertigo&#x27;s ongoing launch series, and books from discontinued imprints such as &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; (initially under DC&#x27;s short-lived sci-fi Helix imprint) and &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (originally part of the Paradox Press line).

Two of the new ongoing series did not last long; &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; was cancelled after 16 issues, and &quot;Black Orchid&quot; continued for only 22. &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot; and most of the pre-existing series continued for several years, including &quot;Sandman&quot; which reached its planned conclusion with #75. &quot;Hellblazer&quot; was the last of the original ongoing series to be canceled, ceasing publication in February 2013 with #300.

Berger won Eisner Awards for her editing in 1992, 1994 and 1995 for her work on the proto- and early Vertigo titles &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;Shade&quot;, &quot;Kid Eternity&quot;, &quot;Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot; and &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;.

=== Middle period ===
As the imprint&#x27;s initial ongoing series came to their ends, new series were launched to replace them, with varying degrees of success. &quot;The Sandman&quot; was replaced following its completion by &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1996–2001) and &quot;The Sandman Presents&quot;, which featured stories about the characters from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s series, written by other creators. Other long-running series have been &quot;The Invisibles&quot; by Grant Morrison and various artists (1994–2000); &quot;Preacher&quot; by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon (1995–2000); &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; by Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson (1997–2002); &quot;100 Bullets&quot; by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso (1999–2009); &quot;Lucifer&quot; by Mike Carey, Peter Gross, and Ryan Kelly (2000–2006); &quot;&quot; by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra (2002–2008); &quot;Daytripper&quot; by Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá (2010); &quot;DMZ&quot; by Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli (2005–2012); and &quot;Fables&quot; by Bill Willingham, Mark Buckingham, and various other artists (2002–2015), which launched spin-offs including &quot;Jack of Fables&quot; by Willingham, Lilah Sturges (credited as &quot;Matthew Sturges&quot;), and various artists (2006–2011), and &quot;Fairest&quot; by Willingham and various artists (2012–2015).

In 2003, the Vertigo imprint celebrated its 10th anniversary by branding its books cover-dated April 2003 to February 2004 (i.e. released between February and December 2003) with the label Vertigo X. This special subtitle was debuted on the &quot;Vertigo X Anniversary Preview&quot; (April 2003), a 48-page special previewing Vertigo&#x27;s upcoming projects and featuring a short &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; story by Peter Milligan and Mike Allred. Other projects highlighted included &quot;&quot;, Jill Thompson&#x27;s first manga-ized version of the &quot;Season of Mists&quot; storyline, and Gaiman&#x27;s own return to the mythos with the hardcover &quot;&quot; collection of short stories spotlighting the seven members of the Endless (an eight-page &quot;Endless Nights Preview&quot; issue was also released before the hardcover).

Berger oversaw the entire Vertigo line, and was promoted to the position of &quot;Senior Vice President—Executive Editor, Vertigo&quot; in July 2006. Her promotion came as Vertigo was said to be equivalent to &quot;the fourth largest American comic book publisher&quot; in 2005, with Paul Levitz praising her personally as having &quot;built Vertigo into an imprint which is simultaneously one of comics&#x27; leading creative and commercial successes&quot;.

The financial success of many Vertigo titles relied not on monthly issue sales, but on the subsequent &quot;trade paperback&quot; editions that reprinted the monthly comics in volumes, which were also sold in general-interest bookshops. Vertigo&#x27;s success in popularizing this approach, beginning with &quot;Sandman&quot;, led to a wider take-up in the American comics industry of routinely reprinting monthly series in this format.

At the 2008 Comic-Con International Karen Berger outlined plans for a new &quot;sub-imprint&quot; called Vertigo Crime, a line of graphic novels, in black and white, hardcover. It was launched in 2009 with two titles: Brian Azzarello&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; and Ian Rankin&#x27;s &quot;Dark Entries&quot;, the latter featuring John Constantine. Each volume features a cover illustration by Lee Bermejo. Vertigo Crime ended as a sub-imprint in 2011.

=== Editorial changes, attempted relaunch, and discontinuation ===
Karen Berger left the company in March 2013. Berger&#x27;s position at the head of Vertigo was filled by Shelly Bond, who had begun editing for the imprint in 1993. However, in 2016, DC &quot;restructured&quot; Vertigo, eliminating Bond&#x27;s position, and oversight of Vertigo was placed under Jamie S. Rich, until May 2017 when Mark Doyle became the new editor.

In 2018, DC Comics announced a &quot;line-wide relaunch and rebranding&quot; as &quot;DC Vertigo&quot;, including 11 new ongoing titles planned for the coming year, under Doyle&#x27;s editorship. These included a new sub-imprint based on Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; with four new ongoing series, announced in March, and seven new series announced in June.

The relaunch experienced a number of complications. &quot;Border Town&quot; by Eric M. Esquivel and Ramon Villalobos dealt with immigration and Latino identity, for which Esquivel received death threats in advance of its publication. The series was well received by critics, but after four issues were published, Esquivel was accused of sexually and emotionally abusing a former partner. Villalobos and colorist Tamra Bonvillain withdrew from the project, and DC cancelled the series, including issues that were ready for publication. Meanwhile, &quot;Second Coming&quot; by Mark Russell and Richard Pace came under criticism from Christians and conservatives who considered its announced premise – in which Jesus Christ returns and lives as a roommate with a modern-day superhero – blasphemous and offensive. The series was cancelled before the first issue was published; Russell and Pace later published the series through Ahoy Comics. &quot;Safe Sex&quot; by Tina Horn and Mike Dowling was also cancelled before its debut, and later published as &quot;SFSX&quot; by Image Comics.

DC Comics discontinued Vertigo imprint in January 2020. The DC Zoom and DC Ink imprints for children and young adolescents were also eliminated. Under the new plan, all of the company&#x27;s comics were published under the &quot;DC&quot; brand, and categorized by intended reader age: DC Kids (8–12 years), DC (13+), and DC Black Label (17+). The &quot;Sandman&quot;-related titles retained their new branding as &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot;.

=== 2024 relaunch ===
In October 2024 at New York Comic Con, DC announced the Vertigo imprint would be returning after its discontinuation in 2020. Chris Conroy, editor of DC Black Label, confirmed not only the relaunch of the imprint, but also that he would also be running Vertigo as well. In addition, James Tynion IV and Álvaro Martínez Bueno&#x27;s series &quot;The Nice House by the Sea&quot; was announced to be switching from releasing under DC Black Label to releasing under Vertigo. Similarly, &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot; line of books will be folded back into the imprint as well.

==Creators==
===Editors===
In addition to Berger, several other editors have become linked to the imprint:

Art Young started out as Karen Berger&#x27;s assistant and worked on pre-Vertigo issues of &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;Skreemer&quot;, and &quot;Kid Eternity&quot;. He then left DC in 1991 to work for Disney in setting up Touchmark, before returning with those projects to Vertigo in early 1993, when he edited debut title &quot;Enigma&quot;, and later miniseries and one-shots such as &quot;Sebastian O&quot;, &quot;The Extremist&quot;, &quot;Mercy&quot;, &quot;Rogan Gosh&quot;, &quot;The Mystery Play&quot;, and &quot;Tank Girl: The Moovy&quot;. He edited all four of the &quot;Vertigo Voices&quot; titles in 1995, as well as &quot;Shadows Fall&quot;, &quot;Ghostdancing&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;, &quot;Millennium Fever&quot; and both &quot;Tank Girl&quot; miniseries. Young&#x27;s last editorial credit for Vertigo was &quot;Flex Mentallo&quot; #1 (June 1996).

Shelly Bond was Vertigo&#x27;s executive editor until 2016. Berger hired her as an assistant editor in the winter of 1992, making her the last of the original Vertigo team to join. Bond worked on many of Vertigo&#x27;s top titles over the course of her tenure, including &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;, &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;, &quot;iZombie&quot;, Paul Pope&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Liquid&quot;, &quot;Fables&quot;, Ed Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;Deadenders&quot;, David Lapham&#x27;s &quot;Young Liars&quot;, Mike Carey&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and &quot;The Invisibles&quot;. She was promoted to executive editor and vice president of Vertigo Comics in 2013, taking the place of Berger. In April 2016, Bond was fired by DC Comics after restructuring. &quot;Shelly will never get full credit for all of the amazing things she did at Vertigo&quot;, Mike Allred wrote in 2016 in a tribute to Bond that featured many of the creators she worked with over the years.

Tom Peyer was a founding editor of Vertigo. Tom was editor in 1990 with Karen Berger what would become the pillars of Vertigo: &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Sandman&quot; (taking over from Art Young), &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;. He later edited &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Kid Eternity&quot;, and &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, as well as two &quot;Vertigo Visions&quot; one-shots. Peyer left editing behind in 1994, returning to DC as a writer.

Stuart Moore edited a wide range of Vertigo titles between 1991 and 2000, including &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot;. One of his most important contributions to the line was hiring Garth Ennis to write &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. He helped start the DC imprint Helix, and brought &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; to Vertigo after Helix&#x27;s demise.

Axel Alonso began his editorial career at Vertigo editing titles like &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso&#x27;s &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, and Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon&#x27;s &quot;Preacher&quot;. He left Vertigo for Marvel Comics in 2000 and eventually ascended to the role of editor-in-chief, a title he held until 2017.

Will Dennis attended film school with Bond, who later recruited him as an assistant editor. He was promoted to editor a few months after Alonso departured for Marvel. Dennis took over the editing of &quot;100 Bullets&quot; and later edited Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Pride of Baghdad&quot; graphic novel. Dennis was responsible for bringing writers Brian Wood (&quot;DMZ&quot;) and Jason Aaron (&quot;Scalped&quot;) to Vertigo and teamed writer Andy Diggle and artist Jock on their breakout series &quot;The Losers&quot;. He was the editor who presided over the Vertigo Crime line of graphic novels.

Jonathan Vankin was hired as an editor at Vertigo in 2004 after previously writing two of the line&#x27;s Vertigo Pop miniseries and several entries in the Paradox Press &quot;Big Book&quot; series as well as several other non-comics works. He edited Harvey Pekar&#x27;s Vertigo work: &quot;The Quitter&quot; hardcover and eight issues of Pekar&#x27;s &quot;American Splendor&quot; autobiographical series. His other Vertigo editing credits include &quot;The Exterminators&quot;, Douglas Rushkoff&#x27;s &quot;Testament&quot;, novelist Denise Mina&#x27;s run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Incognegro&quot; by Mat Johnson, and &quot;The Alcoholic&quot; by novelist and essayist Jonathan Ames.

===Writers===
====Early writers====
Alan Moore is strongly associated with the imprint for his work on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and his creation of John Constantine, but he never produced work for the Vertigo imprint, having refused to work for parent company DC in the late 1980s. His &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; work and the &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; reprint-maxiseries were retroactively collected as Vertigo-issued TPBs.

Grant Morrison left &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; before the launch of Vertigo, but their work on those titles was similarly retroactively branded as &quot;Vertigo&quot; when collected. They wrote three volumes of &quot;The Invisibles&quot; between 1994 and 2000. In addition, they had produced a number of one-shots and miniseries including &quot;Sebastian O&quot; (1993), &quot;The Mystery Play&quot; (1994), &quot;Kill Your Boyfriend&quot; (1995), the Doom Patrol spin-off &quot;Flex Mentallo&quot; (1996), &quot;The Filth&quot; (2002–2003), &quot;Seaguy&quot; (2004), &quot;Vimanarama&quot; (2005), &quot;We3&quot; (2004–2005) and &quot;Joe The Barbarian&quot; (2010).

Neil Gaiman came to prominence four years pre-Vertigo with the launch of &quot;The Sandman&quot; for DC Comics, a title that became the backbone of the initial Vertigo line-up. His &quot;Death&quot; mini-series was part of the Vertigo launch, and his work on the first &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; miniseries (also released as a DC title, 1990–1991) laid the groundwork for the long-running Vertigo Universe series of the same name, which featured young wizard Timothy Hunter.

Peter Milligan contributed two titles to the Vertigo launch. His &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; was launched in 1991, pre-Vertigo, and ran 70 issues until 1996, by which time it was under the Vertigo imprint. He also wrote the creator-owned eight-issue miniseries &quot;Enigma&quot; (1993). Milligan and Brett Ewins&#x27;s 1989 mini-series &quot;Skreemer&quot; was subsequently collected by Vertigo. Milligan also wrote both a &quot;Human Target&quot; mini-series and ongoing series, the one-shots &quot;The Eaters&quot; and &quot;Face&quot; for the &quot;Vertigo Voices&quot; sub-imprint, and a number of other miniseries, including &quot;The Extremist&quot;, &quot;Tank Girl: The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, &quot;The Minx&quot;, and &quot;Vertigo Pop!: London&quot;.

Jamie Delano was the original writer of Vertigo&#x27;s flagship series &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, which spun-off from Moore&#x27;s run on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;. Moore himself recommended Jamie Delano for &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. Delano left the series in 1991, before the launch of Vertigo, and was writing the imprint&#x27;s &quot;Animal Man&quot; series at the time. His other Vertigo works included &quot;Outlaw Nation&quot;, &quot;Ghostdancing&quot;, and two &quot;Hellblazer&quot; miniseries, &quot;The Horrorist&quot; and &quot;Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood&quot;.

Garth Ennis took over &quot;Hellblazer&quot; from Delano and wrote it at the time of Vertigo&#x27;s launch. Ennis&#x27;s best-known Vertigo work was his and artist Steve Dillon&#x27;s creator-owned &quot;Preacher&quot;, which ran for 66 issues and six spin-off specials between 1995 and 2000. Ennis has also written several miniseries for Vertigo, including &quot;Goddess&quot; (1995–96), &quot;Pride &amp; Joy&quot; (1997), &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; (1997), and &quot;Adventures in the Rifle Brigade&quot; (2001–2002), as well as eight one-shot &quot;War Stories&quot; between 2001 and 2003. Two of his pre-Vertigo works — &quot;True Faith&quot; (serialized in Crisis) and the four-issue DC/Helix miniseries &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; (1996–1997) – have had collections released under the Vertigo label.

Rachel Pollack, who was writing &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; when Vertigo launched, continued on that title until #87 (Feb. 1995), the final issue. She is known for creating the first openly trans superhero, Coagula. She also penned two &quot;Vertigo Visions&quot; specials — 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Geek&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Tomahawk&quot;.

Nancy A. Collins, who wrote &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #110–138 (Aug. 1991 – Dec. 1993), also wrote the 1996 one-shot &quot;&quot;.

Matt Wagner wrote the early Vertigo series &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot; and co-wrote the &quot;Sandman Midnight Theatre&quot; special with Neil Gaiman. Wagner later wrote the 29-issue &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; series.

====Later writers====
John Ney Rieber has produced most of his output for Vertigo, working exclusively for the company between 1994 and 2000. Reiber wrote the first 50 issues of the first ongoing &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; series (May 1994 – July 1998), as well as a number of miniseries, mostly set in the wider Vertigo universe (and particularly the Sandman/Books of Magic sections) – &quot;Mythos: The Final Tour&quot; (1996–1997), &quot;Hellblazer/The Books of Magic&quot; (1997–1998), &quot;The Trenchcoat Brigade&quot; (1999), &quot;The Books of Faerie: Molly&#x27;s Story&quot; (1999). Reiber&#x27;s &quot;Shadows Fall&quot; (with artist John Van Fleet) was a self-created horror story grounded in a reality which made the tale &quot;all the more creepy than if the story was played out in the realm and scope of superheroes&quot;. Reiber&#x27;s &quot;Tell Me Dark&quot;, produced for DC, was collected in softcover by Vertigo, and he also contributed to various anthologies.

J. M. DeMatteis began his comics career on DC&#x27;s &quot;House of Mystery&quot; title over a decade before the formation of Vertigo, and later became one of the earliest Vertigo creators thanks in large part to his proposed Touchmark projects. DeMatteis&#x27; &quot;Mercy&quot; one-shot and miniseries &quot;The Last One&quot; both debuted in 1993, with reprints of two creator-owned Epic Comics projects following in subsequent years: his 1985-87 creator-owned maxiseries &quot;Moonshadow&quot; was reprinted between 1994 and 1995, with the miniseries &quot;Blood: A Tale&quot; seeing print again in 1996–7. DeMatteis also wrote fifteen issues of &quot;Seekers into the Mystery&quot; (1996–7) for Vertigo.

Mike Carey, having started his American comics career with Caliber Comics in the mid-1990s catapulted to prominence in March 1999 with the first issue of his &quot;Sandman&quot; spin-off miniseries &quot;Sandman Presents: Lucifer&quot;, which would lead to an ongoing series a year later and considerable praise and projects for Carey. A second Sandman miniseries, &quot;Sandman Presents: Petrefax&quot; (2000), soon followed, before the June 2000 debut of &quot;Lucifer&quot;. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s preferred Sandman spin-off had not had an easy time being published, due to its title and main character, but Carey was able to helm it for a Sandman - equalling 75 issues (and a 2002 one-shot: &quot;Nirvana&quot;) for 6 years. During this time, Carey also wrote the hardcover OGN &quot;Sandman Presents: The Furies&quot; (2002), over 40 issues of &quot;Hellblazer&quot; between 2002 and 2006 and a 2005 Hellblazer original graphic novel, &quot;All His Engines&quot;. He also wrote a non-Sandman miniseries, &quot;My Faith in Frankie&quot; (2004), the comic book adaptation of &quot;Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Neverwhere&quot; (2005–6) and the OGN &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (2007). In 2007 he launched the ongoing series &quot;Crossing Midnight&quot; (2007–2008) and the miniseries &quot;Faker&quot; (2007–8).

Brian K. Vaughan&#x27;s first Vertigo work was a short story in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot; #3 anthology, which led to him relaunching &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 3) (2000–2001), which lasted for 20 issues. In September 2002, his (and Pia Guerra&#x27;s) &quot;&quot; launched. It would ultimately run for 60 issues until March 2008. Vaughan also wrote the 2006 OGN &quot;Pride of Baghdad&quot; for Vertigo.

Ed Brubaker&#x27;s first Vertigo work was on the &quot;Vertigo Visions&quot; &quot;Prez&quot; one-shot (1995), and intermittent contributions to a couple of anthology titles preceded his &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; (1999), effectively laying the groundwork for his later crime comics. His next Vertigo project, the post-apocalyptic series &quot;Deadenders&quot; (2000–2001), ran for 16 issues while Brubaker wrote for both &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; for parent-company DC. His 2001 miniseries &quot;Sandman Presents: The Dead Boy Detectives&quot; told the story of some incidental Sandman characters, and was later retold by Jill Thompson in manga form (2005). Brubaker subsequently took his Vertigo/crime sensibility to work from WildStorm, Icon and the mainstream DC and Marvel universes.

Bill Willingham came to Vertigo after a plethora of small press work in 1999 to launch his poker miniseries &quot;Proposition Player&quot; (1999–2000), and contribute to the &quot;Sandman&quot; universe with a one-shot spy-spoof, &quot;Sandman Presents: Merv Pumpkinhead, Agent of D.R.E.A.M.&quot; (2000), and a single issue contribution to &quot;The Dreaming&quot; on-going series. A second &quot;Sandman&quot; one-shot, &quot;The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Dreams...&quot; (2001), also led to a 4-issue miniseries, &quot;Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad&quot; (2002). Willingham&#x27;s best-known work soon followed, with the July 2001 debut of &quot;Fables&quot; (with artist Lan Medina). In 2004, he returned to the world of the Sandman with &quot;Sandman Presents: Thessaly: Witch for Hire&quot;, and 2006 saw the debut of the Vertigo-esque magical—but mainstream DCU title—&quot;Shadowpact&quot; and &quot;Fables&quot; companion series &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;. In July 2008, with &quot;Fables&quot; nearing a major turning point in its run, Willingham relaunched &quot;House of Mystery&quot; as a Vertigo title with Lilah Sturges (then known as Matthew Sturges).

Other notable people who have written for Vertigo include Kyle Baker, Warren Ellis, David Lapham, Mark Millar, Brian Azzarello, Paul Pope, James Robinson, and Brian Wood.

===Artists===
Several artists have also produced a large amount of notable work for Vertigo, several (Steve Dillon, Pia Guerra, Eduardo Risso and Darick Robertson) mainly producing lengthy runs on individual creator-owned titles (in Guerra&#x27;s case, &quot;Y: The Last Man&quot; makes up around 80% of her output to date), but others on a number of titles. Vertigo&#x27;s main Universe titles, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot; and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, have been particularly artistically diverse, and home to many talents, while the large number of creator-owned miniseries has seen large numbers of individuals producing work for Vertigo.

Peter Gross worked on a pre-Vertigo issue of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and an early Vertigo issue of &quot;Shade the Changing Man&quot; (#36, June 1993) before penciling &amp; inking a story featuring Timothy Hunter in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; crossover &quot;Arcana Annual&quot; (Jan. 1994). This led to a regular inking role on the newly launched &quot;Books of Magic&quot; series, taking over as regular penciler and inker with #6; he would stay with the title for most of its run, writing as well as drawing its final 25 issues (1998–2000). Gross also inked Reiber&#x27;s &quot;Mythos&quot; one-shot, and provided full artwork on the first &quot;Books of Faerie&quot; miniseries (1997) and pencils on the following year&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Faerie: Auberon&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1998). After &quot;Books of Magic&quot;, Gross moved to &quot;Lucifer&quot; (beginning with #5, Oct. 2000) and penciled 56 of the remaining issues, as well as inking a handful. He also co-penciled 2005&#x27;s &quot;Constantine: The Official Movie Adaptation&quot; and several issues of Douglas Rushkoff&#x27;s &quot;Testament&quot; from 2006 to 2007.

Dean Ormston has similarly produced a disproportionate amount of his artwork for Vertigo titles, including the lion&#x27;s share of the alternate reality &quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot; series (2004–5). His first Vertigo work was as one of several pencilers in the pages of &quot;Sandman&quot; #62 (Aug 1994), and in 1995 he penciled and inked Peter Milligan&#x27;s &quot;The Eaters&quot; one-shot. His artwork appears in most (14) of the non-Peter Gross issues of Mike Carey&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and he also handled art duties for Caitlin R. Kiernan&#x27;s 4-issue &quot;The Girl who would be Death&quot; (1998–1999). In addition, he has worked on a number of single (and jam) issues of other Vertigo titles, including &quot;The Crusades&quot;, &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, &quot;Mythos&quot;, &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot; between 1994 and 2007.

Duncan Fegredo″s first major American work was on the 1991 &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; miniseries with Grant Morrison. A 1992 cover for &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; similarly fell in Vertigo territory &quot;pre&quot;-Vertigo, while Fegredo&#x27;s first &quot;true&quot; Vertigo work was also on the joint-first new series released by the imprint: Peter Milligan&#x27;s &quot;Enigma&quot;. Immediately after the end of the eight-issue series, Fegredo took over as cover artist on Milligan&#x27;s long-running &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; (issues #42–50), collaborated with Milligan on 1995&#x27;s one-shot &quot;Face&quot; (Jan) and then returned to cover duties on &quot;Shade&quot;, producing all but one of the remaining pieces of art. He produced pencils and inks for the miniseries &quot;Millennium Fever&quot; (1995) and (with Milligan) for &quot;Girl&quot; (1996). Between 1997 and 2002, he contributed artwork on fill-in issues (or to jam issues) of &quot;Crusades&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Flinch&quot;, &quot;House of Secrets&quot;, &quot;The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Dreams...&quot;, &quot;Totems&quot;, &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; and &quot;Weird Western Tales&quot;. In addition, his cover work graced the 1999 miniseries &quot;Sandman Presents: Love Street&quot;, six issues of &quot;The Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot; and the first fifteen issues of Mike Carey&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot;.

Jill Thompson, although primarily known as an artist, has also produced scripts for Vertigo, producing as writer-artist three Sandman tie-ins: &quot;The Little Endless Storybook&quot; (2001) and two manga retellings of storylines: &quot;Death: At Death&#x27;s Door&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Dead Boy Detectives&quot; (2005). Between 1993 and 1994, she penciled the first six issues of the ongoing &quot;Black Orchid&quot; series and the 4-issue miniseries &quot;Finals&quot; (1999). She has contributed ten issues each to the high-profile Vertigo series &quot;Sandman&quot; (penciling the complete &quot;Brief Lives&quot; storyline, part 7 of which was the first Vertigo issue) and &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, and penciled four of the last five issues of &quot;Seekers into the Mystery&quot;. She has produced fill-in issues of &quot;Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and contributed artwork to the anthology comics &quot;Fables&quot; #59 (in addition to a story in the hardcover OGN &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot;) and &quot;Transmetropolitan: Filth of the City&quot;.

Jon J Muth, a painter, has produced several lavish volumes for Vertigo, including writing, penciling, inking and coloring the 1998 one-shot &quot;Swamp Thing: Roots&quot;. Primarily, his Vertigo output has been in collaboration with JM DeMatteis, an issue of &quot;Blood: A Tale&quot;, the maxiseries &quot;Moonshadow&quot; (and its coda, &quot;Farewell, Moonshadow&quot; (1997)) and three issues of &quot;Seekers into the Mystery&quot;. Muth painted Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery Play&quot; (1994) and the 2002 &quot;Lucifer: Nirvana&quot; special for Mike Carey. His work also effectively ended Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series, Muth painting issue #74, the final issue of &quot;The Wake&quot; storyline, and second-to-last main issue.

The artwork of Charles Vess has infrequently but notably accompanied the words of Neil Gaiman on Vertigo projects, including the 4-issue &quot;Stardust&quot; (1997–8) miniseries, later reprinted as an illustrated hardcover book. Vess&#x27; work can also be seen in the two Shakespeare adaptations in the pages of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, the first of which (pre-Vertigo) won the comic and duo the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story, and the last of which was also the final (75th) issue of the series. Vess also contributed a story to the &quot;Fables&quot; OGN &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot;, illustrated a &quot;Books of Magic&quot; cover and produced an issue of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (2000).

Sean Phillips earliest American comics work was in the pages of pre-Vertigo &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and in May 1993 he became one of the early Vertigo artists by illustrating (with assists from Paul Peart and Sean Harrison Scoffield) the entire 16-issue run of &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; (1993–4). He drew the covers for twenty-three of the twenty-five issues of the first &quot;The Invisibles&quot; series and also returned to &quot;Hellblazer&quot; (switching from artwork and covers to just covers after around 20 issues) between 1995 and 1998. He drew three issues of &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; (1994), the one-shot &quot;Hell Eternal&quot; (1995) and the miniseries &quot;The Minx&quot; as well as inking most of Michael Lark&#x27;s work on &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. He penciled four issues of the final &quot;Invisibles&quot; series between 1999 and 2000, produced covers for the &quot;Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood&quot; miniseries, and shared art chores with John Bolton on the 2001 miniseries &quot;User&quot;.

John Bolton, another frequent Gaiman collaborator has rarely worked with that author directly for Vertigo, but has utilised his characters, including in the OGN &quot;Sandman Presents: The Furies&quot; and the &quot;Books of Magic&quot; lead-in &quot;Arcana&quot; Annual. He also contributed to the &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot; annual, and the &quot;Fables&quot; OGN &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot;. With Sean Phillips, he produced the artwork for Devin Grayson&#x27;s 2001 miniseries &quot;User&quot;, and individually fully illustrated the OGN&#x27;s &quot;Menz Insana&quot; (1997) and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (2007).

Other artists include Chris Bachalo, Mark Buckingham, Guy Davis, Phil Jimenez, Jock, Warren Pleece and Liam Sharp.

====Cover artists====
Inarguably the name most associated with Vertigo&#x27;s cover output is the artist who provided &quot;all&quot; of the covers to the Vertigo&#x27;s highest profile series (&quot;The Sandman&quot; series (1989–96)): Dave McKean. The first 46 of these covers were created for the DC imprint, but McKean&#x27;s work also includes a number of Sandman-spin-off issues, miniseries and galleries. These include the two &quot;Death&quot; miniseries and all 60 issues of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1996–2001). He provided the first 24 DC published covers to &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and all 22 covers to the 1993-1995 &quot;Black Orchid&quot; Vertigo series (which spun off from his (and Gaiman&#x27;s) 1988 DC miniseries). He produced the first cover for &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot; and his work was featured in a 1997 artbook incorporating his &quot;Sandman&quot; covers, &quot;Dust Covers: The Collected Sandman Covers, 1989–1997.&quot;

In addition, McKean&#x27;s artwork also graced the inside pages of the public service comic &quot;Death Talks about Life&quot; (1994), an issue of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (#8), two issues of the DC-published &quot;Hellblazer&quot; (#27 with Gaiman and #40 with Delano) and his and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s OGN &quot;Mr. Punch&quot; (1994). The duo&#x27;s &quot;Black Orchid&quot; was similarly produced for DC, but was retroactively deemed a Vertigo title.

Brian Bolland and Glenn Fabry have also produced a large number of iconic covers for the Vertigo line, Fabry probably being best known for his work on one title: Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon&#x27;s &quot;Preacher&quot; (and the spin-off miniseries). Bolland, one of the very earliest British creators whose work was brought to America, drew the first 63 covers for &quot;Animal Man&quot;, mostly for DC, but also the first six Vertigo issues before handing over to a succession of other artists. Bolland also drew the cover for Vertigo&#x27;s first &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; issue and for the entire second and third volumes of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Invisibles&quot; (1997–2000) (and in addition provided artwork for the TPB collections of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; run, and all volumes of &quot;The Invisibles&quot;). Bolland provided covers for three issues of Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; run (1995), and miniseries including &quot;Vamps&quot; (1994–5), both Vertigo &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (1995–1996) miniseries and &quot;Blood + Water&quot; (2003) as well as the one-shot &quot;Zatanna: Everyday Magic&quot; (2003). Bolland also wrote and illustrated stories for the anthology titles &quot;Heartthrobs&quot; and &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; (1999) and OGN &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot;, as well as providing a cover each for the &quot;Gangland&quot; and &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot; anthologies. With issue #12, Bolland took over cover duties (from &quot;Fables&quot; cover artist James Jean) on &quot;Fables&quot; spin-off &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, which he continues to produce as of June 2008. Fabry, in addition to his &quot;Preacher&quot; covers, provided covers for Ennis&#x27; miniseries &quot;Adventures in the Rifle Brigade: Operation Bollock&quot; (2001–2002) and most of that authors first run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; (1992–94) - which included the first Vertigo issue - as well as his return to the title in 1998–1999. In addition, Fabry has also penciled a couple of short &quot;Hellblazer&quot; stories for various specials, and drew the covers for the &quot;Hellblazer: The Trenchcoat Brigade&quot; miniseries. He contributed to the multi-artist &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; special &quot;I Hate It Here&quot; and provided three covers each to the ongoing &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; (2002) and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (2001); covered the complete &quot;Scarab&quot; (1993–1994) miniseries, all 19 issues of &quot;Outlaw Nation&quot; and one issue each of the anthology titles &quot;Gangland&quot;, &quot;Heartthrobs&quot; and &quot;Weird War Tales&quot;. Between 2005 and 2006, Fabry fully illustrated Mike Carey&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Neverwhere&quot;, having previously collaborated with the man himself on a story in the 2003 OGN &quot;Sandman: Endless Nights&quot;. At the start of 2008, he provided a cover for an issue of &quot;Exterminators&quot;, before taking over from Lee Bermejo as on-going cover artist on, again, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;.

Other notable cover artists include Dan Brereton, Tim Bradstreet, Duncan Fegredo, James Jean, Dave Johnson and J. G. Jones.

<doc id="131773" wikidata="Q1183567" url="?curid=131773" title="Lemont, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lemont is a census-designated place (CDP) in College Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States, and is the location of the only remaining granary in Pennsylvania. It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,270 at the 2010 census. It is part of Happy Valley and the larger Nittany Valley.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area came towards the end of the last glacial period. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle for thousands of years. Nearby archaeological sites suggest campsites and jasper mines have been in the area since approximately 8000 to 3500 BC. The Delaware, Iroquois, Mingo, and Shawnee were among the native inhabitants who began establishing settlements, farms, and trails throughout the surrounding valleys.

James Potter led the first recorded expedition Spring Creek in 1764. Upon reaching an overlook on Mount Nittany, he exclaimed &quot;By heavens, Thompson, I have discovered an empire!&quot; The first White settlers in present day Lemont arrived in 1789, setting up farms, a grits mill, and a saw mill.

The land that would make up the village, historically known as “The End of the Mountain,” was bought by Centre Furnace ironmaster Moses Thompson in 1870. As the iron industry flourished in Centre County, so to did the Bellefonte Central Railroad. Lemont was given its French name as a stop between Bellefonte and Lewisburg in 1885. Although a plan to extend a line from Lemont to Scotia via State College never came to fruition, students, faculty, and visitors would use Lemont&#x27;s train station, and catch a buggy to connect to State College or University Park. Lemont would grow as a prominent railway town and crossroads between the Penns and Nittany Valleys with banks, blacksmiths, a general store, jewelry stores, clinics, schools, hotels, and churches opening up along the main streets.

In Spring of 1885 the Lemont Hotel, owned by Thompson&#x27;s son, burned down. The insurance money he acquired was used to build the John I. Thompson Grain Elevator and Coal Sheds . As trucking was replacing freight hauling the granary shut down in the 1950s. In the 1970s a Penn State student doing a study of Lemont wrote &quot;The once very important buildings have been neglected and deteriorating.&quot; In 1994 the Lemont Village Association purchased the lot for preservation.

===Historic district===
The Lemont Historic District is home to many historic homes and businesses. The John Thompson Coal Sheds and Granary is the last remaining wooden grain elevator in Pennsylvania and is being restored by the Lemont Village Association. Lemont Elementary School, built from 1938 to 1939 as College Township School, is a limestone building that overlooks the village. The State College Area School District is considering closing the school; however, many district residents are opposed. The Friends of Lemont School was organized to spearhead an effort to combat the closure and sponsored an on-line petition to keep the neighborhood school. According to the State College school board meeting minutes of June 16, 2017 there will be a hearing to close Lemont Elementary school on July 24, 2017, prior to the board meeting.

==Culture==
The Art Alliance of Central Pennsylvania was formed in 1968, and has been housed in the former home of the Lemont Band ever since.

The Lemont Village Green hosts many community events, including small concerts and the Strawberry Festival a tradition dating back to 1982. The festival attracted 1,000 visitors in 2024 and featured railroad speeder rides on the historic tracks.

==Geography==
Lemont is bordered by Houserville to the north, Shiloh to the northeast, Squirrel Hill to the west, and Dalevue to the south. The southwestern end of Mount Nittany rises above the eastern edge of the village.

Spring Creek, a northward-flowing tributary of Bald Eagle Creek part of the larger Susquehanna River watershed, connects the village to Houserville and Big Hollow to the north, and Oak Hall and Boalsburg to the south.

Lemont is served by Spring Creek Elementary in Houserville and Mount Nittany Middle School in Panorama. The village is part of the State College Area School District.

==Sports==
The village is represented by the Lemont Ducks, although the Ducks play at the Community Fields in State College. The team is a part of the Centre County Baseball League, Pennsylvania&#x27;s oldest amateur baseball league, which began in 1932. Spencer Bivens played for the Lemont Ducks for a time before signing to the San Francisco Giants in Major League Baseball.

Miles Township is home to McCalls Dam State Park. The park is in a remote location on a dirt road between R. B. Winter State Park on Pennsylvania Route 192 and Eastville on Pennsylvania Route 880. In the winter months the park can only be accessed by snowmobiling or cross-country skiing.

McCalls Dam State Park has a small camping area and a small picnic area with a few tables and charcoal grills. There are no modern restroom facilities at the park, and visitors are asked to carry out all trash as there is no trash pick up at the park.

The park is named for the splash dam that Johnny McCall built on White Deer Creek in 1850. He used the waters that flowed from the dam to power a sawmill. Sixteen years later the dam was rebuilt to provide water for a series of splash dams that were used to float white pine logs to the sawmills on the West Branch Susquehanna River at Watsontown. The park&#x27;s facilities were originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1933. The mill and dam are long since gone, but they are remembered along with Johnny McCall in the name of McCalls Dam State Park.

<text>Park Forest Village is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Patton and Ferguson townships, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 8,831 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Park Forest Village, created in 1956, was the first large suburban development near State College. This neighborhood won several national awards for its design, which moved away from the straight streets and clear cutting typical of post World War II suburban developments. The use of gracefully curved streets and the retention of trees established a pattern for future developments everywhere.

The subdivision was originally developed on of land known as part of the Barrens in Patton Township by J. Alvin Hawbaker, a well-known real estate developer in State College. Mr. Hawbaker&#x27;s assistant designer was a noted architect/landscape architect Carl W. Wild, who insisted on focusing on street tree-plantings to define each street and maintaining as many naturally growing trees, as possible. Through their company, Park Forest Enterprises, they created the cul de sac and curved streets design of Park Forest Village which ended up yielding more housing units per square mile than the conventional city grid pattern. Park Forest Village also utilized several localized parks so that common recreation areas would be accessible to each neighborhood in the subdivision. The landscaping of each homesite also retained as many native trees on the original land as possible, giving each property abundant trees and a mature, long-term, lived in look as opposed to young sapling trees planted at the time most conventional homes were constructed that took years to grow and mature. As the building of the subdivision progressed, utility lines were buried so that telephone and power line poles became unnecessary, giving the streets a cleaner design and look. J. Alvin Hawbaker also pioneered the &quot;Gallery of Homes&quot; real estate marketing approach, which resulted in the sale of thousands of housing units within the area now known as Park Forest Village.

==Geography==
Park Forest Village is located in southern Centre County at (40.801060, -77.909423). The eastern end of the community touches the northwestern corner of the borough of State College.

<text>Patton Township is a township in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Happy Valley and the larger Nittany Valley.

Patton Township is served by the Patton Township Police Department, Alpha Fire Company, and Centre LifeLink EMS. Alpha Fire Company maintains one of its two substations in Patton Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.07%, is water.

Patton Township is bordered by Huston Township to the northwest, Benner Township to the northeast, College Township to the southeast, Ferguson Township to the south, and Halfmoon Township to the southwest.

==History==
Patton Township was established in 1794 and named after Colonel John Patton, a revolutionary officer, who co-owned the Centre Furnace, along with Colonel Samuel Miles. The Peter Gray family and the Conrad Hartsock family were the earliest settlers to the area. They came to the Half Moon Valley in 1788, from Frederick County, Maryland, and settled in what is now Patton Township. The early days were strongly influenced by Methodism. As soon as Peter Gray had a roof on his log cabin, he began Sunday School classes, and founded what is today Grays United Methodist Church. These settlers also made pilgrimages to church at Warriors Mark, a 12-mile distance, because that was the nearest regular preaching point in the valley.

Iron mining had begun in the early days of Patton Township, affording supply of ore for Centre Furnace. Scotia, a company town established by Andrew Carnegie, was one of the largest mining operations in the area. Scotia&#x27;s population peaked at 400 in the 1890s before the mines closed in 1911. Lumber was sourced from the Scotia Barrens for a sawmill in Waddle from 1910 until 1915.

In 1927 Woodycrest would begin as an unplanned community out of W.A. Strouse&#x27;s 65-acre farm. Strouse sold plots of land for $20 to $50 each. At the time the main road from Woodycrest to State College was a dirt road that meandered from College Heights to Waddle. In 1930 Patton Township recorded it&#x27;s lowest population (442) prior to the construction of North Atherton Street and Skytop Mountain Road from Downtown State College to Martha&#x27;s Furnace in 1932. In the same year, Lytle&#x27;s addition, an affordable working class community, was annexed by Borough of State College from College Township. As prices in Lytle&#x27;s addition rose, residents moved into Woodycrest.

In 1956 construction began in Park Forest, a planned community split between Ferguson and Patton Townships that would grow to become the most populous census-designated place in Centre County. In 1967 Park Forest Elementary School was built and Park Forest Middle School followed in 1971 in Park Forest&#x27;s North End. In 1968 construction began in Toftrees, a medium-density planned community north of Woodycrest. In 1990 construction began in Gray’s Woods, a planned community near the ghost town Scotia. Gray&#x27;s Woods Elementary School would be built in 2002.

==History==
Thomas Ferguson, who, in 1791, bought of land for 300 pounds in gold and silver coins, is credited with founding Pine Grove Mills. In 1800, he dammed Slab Cabin Run and built the first of the mills that would eventually give the town its name. According to local tradition, a grove of pine trees separating the sawmill from the gristmill along the run provided the rest of the name.

John Patton Jr., son of Centre Furnace ironmaster Col. John Patton, laid out the town of Pattonville at the east end of Pine Grove Mills in 1815, and the entire village went by Pattonville for a time.

The post office, founded in 1809, was continually known as the Pine Grove Mills post office, however, and the town eventually reverted to the original name.

The village celebrated its bicentennial in 2001. This included the publication of a book.

In June 2018, a farmers market began in the parking lot of St Paul Lutheran Church.

Beginning in 2018, the Centre Region Planning Agency, a department of the Centre Region Council of Governments, led the development of a small area plan alongside residents and Ferguson Township staff. On November 4, 2019, the Ferguson Township Board of Supervisors approved and adopted the plan. Early in 2020, the Board of Supervisors voted to create a standing committee to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the plan.

==History==

Squire Clement Beckwith laid out the town in 1850 and named it to honor his daughter, Matilda. Why he chose to call it Port Matilda is not clear, but the name may have reflected his hope that the town would eventually be connected to the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Branch of the Pennsylvania Canal. While the canal did not reach Port Matilda, the Bald Eagle Railroad did, and the community became a market center in the Bald Eagle Valley for agricultural and lumber products.

===Industrial history===
Port Matilda was home to McFeely Brick Co., located on Brick St. at the east end of the town adjacent to the railroad. The company was based in Latrobe, Pennsylvania and founded by Fred McFeely, the grandfather of children&#x27;s television personality Fred Rogers. The company was later owned by General Refractories, which closed the Port Matilda plant in 1959. Its primary product was silica fire brick made from ganister rock, using beehive kilns. Its bricks were typically stamped &quot;Vulcan&quot;.

<doc id="131790" wikidata="Q7235295" url="?curid=131790" title="Potter Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Potter Township is a township in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Penns Valley and the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,614 at the 2020 census. Communities in Potter Township include Black Hawk, Centre Hill, Colyer, Fruittown, Old Fort, Potter Mills, Red Mill, and Tusseyville.

==History==
===Indigenous Peoples===
The first inhabitants of Potter Township came towards the end of the last glacial period. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle for thousands of years. The Delaware, Iroquois, Mingo, and Shawnee were among the native inhabitants who began establishing settlements, farms, and trails throughout the surrounding valleys and water gaps.

Many of the trails paved by Native Americans are now major roads and highways, including the Kishacoquillas Path, named after a Shawnee chief. The path traversed from present-day Milesburg to Lewistown passing through Old Fort, Potter Mills, and over the Seven Mountains. The path is now Pennsylvania Route 144.

===European colonization (1764-1874)===
In 1764, using trails established by Native Americans, James Potter, a general and politician from County Tyrone, Ireland, led the first recorded expedition of present-day Centre County, which was part of the frontier that separated the colonists from Indigenous communities. 

In 1774 Potter built a log home in the area. In 1777 Potter established Potter Fort (now known as Old Fort) by building a stockade surrounding his home and the nearby spring.

Iroquoian warriors began raiding illegal European settlements resulting in the Big Runaway in the summer of 1778. Two American soldiers were killed in these raids a mile east of Old Fort. Settlers in Penns Valley fled to Fort Augusta at Sunbury alongside other settlers near the West Branch Susquehanna River.

In 1788 James Potter established a log house and tavern Potter Mills along the banks of Sinking Creek. By 1817 the hamlet had five mills. By 1874 Potters Mills had 48 residents, it has since grown to a population of 263.

===Grange Fair and Rhoneymeade (1874-present)===
Potter Township hosts the Grange Encampment and Fair garnering over 200,000 visitors, 1,000 tents, and 1,500 RV&#x27;s, bringing in $2.6 million in 2017. The fair began as a picnic in 1874 organized by Leonard Rhone to inform other grangers of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry.

Leonard Rhone&#x27;s historic homestead is home to Rhoneymeade Arboretum and Sculpture Garden. In 1986 the homestead became the first property to be permanently conserved by the ClearWater Conservancy.

===Colyer Lake and sawmill===

William Colyer built a sawmill near Tussey Mountain providing lumber for the nearby communities and fueling the local iron furnaces. A post office and general store were built to serve the community now known as Colyer. In the 1960s a dam was built on Sinking Creek by the Pennsylvania Fish Commission creating Colyer Lake.

===State College Area Connector Project===
During a press conference in 2019 Gov. Tom Wolf announced that the state would fund a project to replace or upgrade a section of Route 322 in Potter Township. The section stretched from Potter Mills to the Mount Nittany Expressway, and ran through Tusseyville, Colyer, and a section of Harris Township. An alternate route was proposed that traveled from Potter Mills to Interstate 99, going through Red Mill, Centre Hill, Old Fort, and Black Hawk Gap, before joining I-99 in Spring Township.

The project came under scrutiny due to the high cost upwards of $800 million. The connector project is expected to cause damage to or destroy important farmlands, soils, and other habitats. Homes, barns, and historic sites are also at risk of demolition. The project poses a risk to the local Amish community, and other people who don&#x27;t drive cars. Signs pitched alongside Route 322 in Potter Township protested the project. One sign read, &quot;SAVE COLYER&quot;, and &quot;NO Divided Families or Farms.&quot;

<text>State College is a borough and home rule municipality in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a college town, home to the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University.

State College is the largest designated borough in Pennsylvania. It is the principal borough of the six municipalities that make up the State College area, the largest settlement in Centre County and one of the principal cities of the greater State College-DuBois Combined Statistical Area with a combined population of 236,577 as of the 2010 U.S. census. In the 2010 census, the borough population was 42,034.

==History==
State College evolved from a village to a town to serve the needs of Pennsylvania State College, which was founded in 1855 as Farmers&#x27; High School of Pennsylvania. State College was incorporated as a borough on August 29, 1896, and it has grown with the college, which was renamed The Pennsylvania State University in 1953.

In 1973, State College adopted a home rule charter which took effect in 1976; since then, it has not been governed by the state&#x27;s Borough Code, although it retains &quot;Borough of State College&quot; as its official name.

The university has a post office address in University Park, Pennsylvania. When it changed its name from Penn State College to Penn State University in 1953, its president, Milton S. Eisenhower, sought to persuade the town to change its name as well. A referendum failed to yield a majority for any of the choices proposed as a new name, so the town remains State College. After this, Penn State requested a new name for its on-campus post office in the HUB-Robeson Center from the U.S. Postal Service. The post office, which has since moved across an alley to the McAllister Building, is the official home of ZIP Code 16802 for University Park.
==Geography==
===Topography===
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. It is surrounded by large tracts of farmland and an expanse of Appalachian Mountain ranges and forests. Its location within a valley makes it prone to frequent rain and snowfall. State College is in the Susquehanna watershed and is prone to flooding. State College is also in the Centre Region and Happy Valley which is part of the larger Nittany Valley. The Nittany Valley is part of Pennsylvania&#x27;s geologic ridge-and-valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. It is located at the approximate geographic center of Pennsylvania. The borough is bordered by Ferguson and College Township.

====Neighborhoods====
The Borough of State College has twelve neighborhoods and half of University Park. The Highlands have around ten thousand people, making it the largest neighborhood in the borough, followed by Downtown and Orchard Park. The Highlands are a mix of apartments, townhouses, single-family homes, businesses, and parks. The neighborhood features working class areas like Lytle Hill and Marvin Gardens, and student areas like Frat Row. The Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District includes parts of Holmes-Foster, the Highlands, and the West End. Holmes-Foster and the West End were two of the first neighborhoods to be developed due to their proximity to Downtown, University Park, and the Bellefonte Central Railroad. Part of College Heights makes up the College Heights Historic District which was created in 1935 and features the College Heights Service Station. It took six annexations from College Township from 1930 to 1968 to officially bring the South End and Nittany Hills (also Penfield) neighborhoods in the borough. Vallamont and Penfield are the least populated neighborhoods, both of which are in the foothills of Mount Nittany on the east side of town. Parkway, short for Westerly Parkway Plaza, is home to State High, the Delta Program, the Westerly Parkway Wetlands, and the Parkway Plaza Apartments, which were built in the 1960s. Orchard Park is home to the South Hills School of Business &amp; Technology. Residents of Downtown (99%), the West End (96%), and Orchard Park (89%) are largely renters; whereas Greentree (93%), College Heights (70%), and Penfield (68%) residents are predominately homeowners.

====Downtown====
Downtown bring in over two million tourists a year, and features 25 major festivals, including Arts Fest, Latin Festival, Fall Festival, and First Night festival. The neighborhood is home to Schlow Library, Memorial Field, Sydney Friedman Park, MLK Plaza, the State Theater, and several murals and art installations including the Calder Way Fresco, Dreams Take Flight, and the MLK Plaza mural depicting King&#x27;s 1965 speech at Penn State.

The 2010s saw a construction boom downtown, with several mixed-use towers developed, including Rise, Metropolitan, Fraser Centre, and Here State College, and others. Unlike older towers, many of the newer buildings are mixed-use, with retail on the ground floor, offices on the next couple floors up, and apartments on the top floors.

The Downtown area has seen large protests over past the couple of decades, particularly at the Allen Street Gates and the Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza. In recent years, marches for May Day, Black Lives Matter, trans rights, and against United States complicity in Israeli war crimes in Palestine have taken place in the Downtown streets.

====University Park====


University Park is the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, and its split between the Borough of State College and College Township. It is home to Old Main, Penn State&#x27;s first building of major significance, completed in 1863; Palmer Museum of Art, visual arts facility and cultural resource for Penn State and local community; and Penn State Creamery, the world&#x27;s largest university creamery. University Park is also home to Beaver Stadium, the second-largest stadium in the Western hemisphere and the home of Penn State Nittany Lions football and the Bryce Jordan Center, home of the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Penn State basketball and other indoor sports and entertainment events; although these structures are located in College Township.

====Historic Districts====


The Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District with 727 contributing buildings, and College Heights Historic District with 278 were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Houses come in popular early twentieth-century architectural styles including Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Bungalow. The historic Camelot house is also in the Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District while the College Heights Service Station and College Heights School are in the College Heights Historic District.

==Climate==

With a period of record dating back to 1893, the lowest temperature recorded was on February 10, 1899, and the highest was on July 17, 1988, and July 9, 1936.

Weather in State College is strongly influenced by the mountain and valley topology of the area. The surrounding mountains cause significantly lower temperatures in the winter, and make summer heat waves much rarer than in the rest of the state. Precipitation is about 20% lower than areas at comparable elevations, again due to the surrounding mountains. Snowfall typically occurs between October and April, but has happened as late as June.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 census, there were 42,034 people, 12,610 households, and 3,069 families residing in the borough. The population density was .

The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.71.

The age distribution of the borough was overwhelmingly influenced by its student population: 5.1% of the population was under the age of 18, 70.6% from 18 to 24, 13.1% from 25 to 44, 6.5% from 45 to 64, and 4.7% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years.

The median income for a household in the borough was $23,513, and the median income for a family was $58,953. The per capita income for the borough was $13,336. 46.9% of the population and 9.8% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 10.6% of those under the age of 18 and 2.2% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

==Parks and recreation==

In 1914, the State College School Board purchased a sinkhole along Fraser and Nittany avenues to build a football field and track in the “natural amphitheater.” During the Great Depression the project received a $40,000 grant from the Works Progress Administration, $5,000 from the school district, and additional federal funds. The sinkhole was originally nicknamed &quot;The Hollow&quot;, though it would later be named Memorial Field in dedication to State College High School graduates killed in both World Wars. In September 1937, the stadium hosted its first football game between State College and Yeagertown. State College would win 52–7 in front of an audience of 3,000 spectators. $500,000 was spent on drainage to protect against flooding in the former sinkhole. In 1966 the area between Memorial Field and the post office was turned into a parklet. Originally named Central Parklet, the parks name was changed in 2009 to Sidney Friedman Park after Altoona-born business owner and real estate mogul Sidney Friedman passed away.

Community Field features public tennis courts and baseball fields. The Lemont Ducks play at the Community Fields in State College. The team is a part of the Centre County Baseball League, Pennsylvania&#x27;s oldest amateur baseball league, which began in 1932.

The Westerly Parkway Wetlands Education Center was transformed from a drainage basin into a functional, sustainable wetland.

<doc id="131809" wikidata="Q1133206" url="?curid=131809" title="Atglen, Pennsylvania">
<text>Atglen is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. According to the 2020 census, its population is 1,311.

==History==

Present-day Atglen was originally a wilderness where Native Americans made paths that cut across this area when they traveled from Paxtang in present-day Harrisburg to present day New Castle, Delaware to trade with the Swedes and later the English. The Great Minquas Path was one of these trails.

===18th century===
In 1717, Sadsbury Township was organized. It covered a large territory, including in whole or in part the present-day townships of Sadsbury, West Sadsbury, West Caln, Valley, East Fallowfield, West Fallowfield, and Highland; the boroughs of Atglen, Parkesburg, Modena, and South Coatesville; the city of Coatesville; and parts of Lancaster County. In August 1728, several inhabitants petitioned the court to separate Sadsbury from Fallowfield because of the former&#x27;s size. In November of that year, the township was subdivided into East and West Sadsbury, and in 1729, upon the division of Chester County into Lancaster and Chester counties, the line between the two divisions of the township was made to conform to the county line.

Drawn by the township&#x27;s farmland during the mid-18th century, more settlers arrived to Atglen. The Native Americans&#x27; trails became horse tracks and later wagon tracks as farmers shipped their goods to market in Philadelphia; Newport, Delaware; and New Castle, Delaware. The old Provincial Highway, as authorized by the government, was laid out in 1730. Newport Road, leading to the ore mines at Cornwall in Lebanon County, was laid out in 1796.

In 1720, Presbyterians formed the area&#x27;s earliest organized religious group: what is known today as the Upper Octorara Presbyterian Church. They were followed by the Quakers who in 1724 founded the Sadsbury Meeting House. A year later, English settlers formed St. John&#x27;s Church.

Andrew Moore (1688–1753), who had been influential with Samuel Miller in founding Sadsbury Meeting House, built a tub mill on his property.

===19th century===
The original settlement in the town&#x27;s current location was known as Penningtonville, and a post office by that name was established there in 1842. However, by the 1870s, the name Atglen was in common usage. In 1876, the court in West Chester made an official decree incorporating the village of Penningtonville as the &quot;Borough of Atglen.&quot;

<text>20 Forthlin Road is a National Trust property in Allerton in south Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is the house in which Paul McCartney lived for several years before he rose to fame with the Beatles, and it is labelled by the National Trust as &quot;the birthplace of the Beatles&quot;. It was also the home of his brother Mike and the birthplace of the trio the Scaffold, of which Mike was a member.

== History ==
The house was built in 1949 and owned by the local authority, and the McCartney family moved into it in 1955 when Paul was at secondary school.

In 1965, Paul bought his father Jim a house in Heswall, a wealthy part of the Wirral.

The house has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1995. The Trust markets the house as &quot;the birthplace of the Beatles&quot;, since this is the place where the Beatles composed and rehearsed their earliest songs.

Unlike Lennon&#x27;s childhood home Mendips, 20 Forthlin Road does not have an English Heritage blue plaque and is currently ineligible to receive one. English Heritage issue a plaque once the figure has &quot;been dead for 20 years, or has passed the centenary of their birth&quot;.

In February 2012, both this house and Lennon&#x27;s childhood home at 251 Menlove Avenue were Grade II listed by Historic England.

The home was featured in an edition of Carpool Karaoke, which aired on the 22 June 2018, episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;. Corden visited there with Paul McCartney, who said it was his first visit to the home since he moved away in his late teens.

<text>Coatesville is a city in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 13,350 at the 2020 census. Coatesville is approximately 39 miles west of Philadelphia. It developed along the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike beginning in the late 18th century. It spans U.S. Route 30, the &quot;Main Line&quot; highway that runs west of Philadelphia.

Coatesville developed in the early 20th century with the growth of the Lukens Steel Company and other industry. Its population declined after industrial restructuring, which reduced these jobs. Lukens was bought by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1997. In 2002, Bethlehem was bought by the then Ohio-based International Steel Group (ISG). Mittal Steel Company acquired ISG and merged with Arcelor to form ArcelorMittal. In 2020, Cleveland-Cliffs acquired the United States operations of ArcelorMittal.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Varying cultures of Native Americans lived in this area. The first known settlement in the area which would be known as Coatesville was a historic Lenape village built along the West Branch of the Brandywine River. This settlement was a post for fur trading with the earliest American settlers. The Brandywine River has featured prominently in the history of Coatesville.

William Fleming, originally from Scotland, is one of the earliest landowners on record. He built a log cabin in the area of Harmony Street and 5th Avenue and owned about of land bordering the Brandywine River.

Moses Coates, a prosperous farmer and the namesake of Coatesville, bought the cabin from Fleming&#x27;s son in 1787. With the economy rising in the years after the United States gained independence, Moses Coates&#x27; son-in-law, Jesse Kersey, came up with a plan to develop the area by selling frontage on the recently completed Lancaster Turnpike which crossed through their land. The Lancaster Turnpike was the first toll road in the U.S., authorized in 1792 and completed in 1795. A tollgate was located within the present-day Coatesville city limits. Because Coatesville was located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Lancaster on the turnpike, it became a popular stopping place.

Pierre Bizallion, a French fur trader, settled in the area in the early 18th century. He was said to serve as an interpreter between William Penn and Native American peoples. The Veterans Administration Hospital now occupies a large piece of the roughly of land that was once owned by Bizallion.

===19th century===
Before Coatesville became a city, the only one in Chester County, it was called Bridge-Town, after the two bridges crossing the Brandywine River. A village named &quot;Midway&quot;, named after its station owned by the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad midway between Philadelphia and Lancaster, was formed in 1834 on the western bank of the Brandywine. The village of Midway and the village of Bridge-Town merged in 1867 to become the borough of Coatesville. Coatesville citizens voted to become a city in 1915.

Coatesville exploited the natural energy of the Brandywine River. Jesse Kersey, Moses Coates&#x27; son-in-law, partnered with the ironmaster Isaac Pennock and purchased over of Moses Coates&#x27; farm along both sides of the Brandywine River in 1810. They formed the Brandywine Iron Works and Nail Factory, the forerunner of Lukens Steel. Charles Lukens, MD, married Isaac Pennock&#x27;s daughter Rebecca in 1813. Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1825, Rebecca Lukens took over the operations of the mill, purchasing it from her mother. She directed operations through a period of turmoil and market panic, developing it into a prosperous mill. Rebecca Lukens was one of the first women to operate a major corporation in the United States.

===20th century===

As Lukens Steel grew so did Coatesville, eventually becoming known as the &quot;Pittsburgh of the East.&quot; By the beginning of the 20th century the population had grown to 6,000, attracting immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe to its industrial jobs, as well as both black and white migrants from the rural South. Tensions rose in the city as the population rapidly became more diverse.

In August 1911, steelworker Zachariah Walker was lynched in Coatesville; he had left his wife and children in Virginia while seeking better work. This African-American man was accused of killing Deputy Constable/Coal and Iron Policeman Edgar Rice, a popular figure in town. Walker claimed self-defense and was hospitalized after his arrest. He was dragged from the hospital and burned to death in front of a mob of hundreds in a field south of the city. Fifteen men and teenage boys were indicted, but all were acquitted at trials. The lynching was the last in Pennsylvania and is said to have left a permanent stain on the city&#x27;s image.

Walker&#x27;s murder was investigated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which called for an end to lynching nationwide. Pennsylvania passed a state anti-lynching law in 1923. But, even after passage of an anti-lynching House bill in the 1920s, no federal law was passed because of the power of the Democratic southern bloc in the Senate. At that time, it represented only white southerners; African Americans had been disfranchised in the South since the turn of the century.
Racial violence was spreading all across America during the Red Summer of 1919 and the local African-American community was on edge. On July 8, 1919, the black community of Coatesville formed a large armed protection group to prevent the rumoured lynching of a rape suspect. When the armed group surrounded the jail to prevent the attack, they learned that there was no suspect and no lynch mob.

In 1929, the Coatesville VA Medical Center was built with an original mission to provide neuropsychiatric care to veterans. In 2013, the Medical Center, with its distinctive architecture of Colonial Revival and Classical Revival, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Medical Center now provides a range of health care services to more than 19,000 Veterans in Pennsylvania and Delaware.

The school system expanded to keep up and the religious community became more diverse, with Roman Catholic churches founded and Beth Israel Congregation, one of Chester County&#x27;s few synagogues. In 1932 there were a total of 22 churches of various denominations in the city.

After World War II the steel industry began a long decline, but in the 1960s Lukens Steel was still the largest employer in Chester County, with over 10,000 workers. It finally started to restructure due to industry changes, was sold several times, and its workers were reduced in number to 5,000 and eventually to 2,000.

===21st century===

Since the turn of the century, Coatesville has invested in redevelopment, encouraging private projects. It has torn down public housing and encouraged new single family and townhouse developments. A new Marriott Courtyard hotel, built along Route 82 on the outskirts of Coatesville, opened in May 2012. 

The redevelopment plans have generated controversy. The city was involved in a 5-year eminent domain dispute with a local landowner in neighboring Valley Township. It was resolved without the need to seize the property, but displeasure with the events resulted in the city voters turning out four incumbent city councilpersons in the November 2005 general elections. Two of the four new councilpersons are ordained Pentecostal and Methodist ministers, respectively. The city council fired the city solicitor, and accepted the resignation of the city manager (who had negotiated with the Valley Township landowner). The assistant manager, police chief, and city treasurer also resigned.

A series of arsons took place in the city from 2007 to early 2009. A December 2008 fire at a Strode Avenue home resulted in the death of Irene Kempest, an 83-year-old World War II Holocaust survivor. A fire the following month on the 300 block of Fleetwood Street burned 17 row houses, causing $2 million in damage and leaving dozens of people homeless.
By March 2009, police had arrested six suspects in the fires. A total of nearly 70 fires occurred during this period. On June 8, 2010 one man, pleading no-contest due to mental illness, was sentenced to a 60-year prison sentence for five of the fires, one of which resulted in Kempest&#x27;s death. Another man pleaded guilty to the Fleetwood Street fire and eight others, receiving a sentence of 12.5 to 25 years with an order to pay $2.5 million in restitution. Twenty of the nearly 70 fires over the two-year span remain unsolved.

In 1969, Lukens Steel forged steel beams for the World Trade Center during its construction in New York City. Some of these trident beams, known as &quot;trees&quot;, remained standing after the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. Ten of the &quot;trees&quot; that remained were transported to Coatesville on April 15, 2010. They are to be used as a part of the proposed National Iron and Steel Heritage Museum.

Twenty-one sites including the Coatesville Historic District, Clement Atkinson Memorial Hospital, High Bridge, Abram Huston House and Carriage House, Lukens Historic District, Lukens Main Office Building, National Bank of Coatesville Building, Terracina, Carver Court, and Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center are resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Butter family also had paper mills in the area, and Frederick Bicking from Winterburg, Germany, was the patriarch of the Bicking paper families. Around the time of the American Revolution, Milltown became more commonly known as Downingtown after the prominent businessman Thomas Downing, a Quaker immigrant in 1717 from Bradninch, Devon, England, who owned a number of those mills. The burough was officially named Downingtown in 1812.

The borough is located along the Lincoln Highway (now part of U.S. Route 30), which runs from the East Coast to the West Coast. It was an early westward road in the wagon days as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. The Lincoln Highway was the first paved road to cross the nation from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike started in the early 1940s and was completed in the early 1950s; it runs north of US 30, bypassing Downingtown.

Circa 1700, early English settlers built what has become known as the Downingtown Log House. In 1713, owner Joseph Hickman sold the -story, 21-foot, 9-inch × 25-foot structure to Thomas and Mary Moore. Thomas Moore moved from the Log House in 1729 and died in 1738.

Thomas Downing acquired the Log House in 1739. It remained in the Downing family until 1940, when Thomas W. Downing died and left it to the borough of Downingtown. The borough did some restoration work to the Downingtown Log House in 1947. It served as the home to the Downingtown Chamber of Commerce from 1950 until 1988. But the Log House was deteriorating as Route 30 had been built close to it. Located below street level, the house suffered water damage due to runoff from Route 30 and vibration from traffic weakened the structure.

From 1988 until 1990, the Downingtown Historical Society relocated the house and did an extensive restoration with money raised for the project. It now sits approximately west of its original location, from the Route 30 sidewalk, and slightly above street level.

In 1904, John S. Trower and William A. Creditt, prominent black Philadelphians, founded the Downingtown Industrial and Agricultural School (DIAS) in Downingtown, to serve as an academic and vocational high school for African-American youths to prepare them for work. Creditt was pastor of the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia, and Trower, a successful caterer and one of the wealthiest black businessmen in the nation, was a member of his congregation. Believing the North needed a school like the Tuskegee Institute, the men found land in Chester County and built the school on a 100-acre campus. They both served as principals until their respective deaths, both in 1921. Originally a private, non-denominational school, in 1907 DIAS began to be state supported. Students were admitted from major northeastern cities. Among its trustees in the early decades was Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York. The school operated until 1993. A new facility was constructed on the property and opened in 2002 as the Chester County campus of the Delaware County Community College.

The borough has initiated some widespread and continuing renovation in downtown, particularly to the streetscape; private owners have similarly renovated many commercial buildings. There has also been residential development on recovered industrial lands (brown fields) in the southeastern part of the borough. Downingtown is the location of some large regional and national businesses, including First National Bank of Chester County, and Victory Brewing Company, and formerly DNB First (acquired by S&amp;T Bank in 2019).
President Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train passed through Downingtown. The famous Irish patriot and martyr Theobald Wolfe Tone briefly lived here in 1795.

The County Bridge No. 124, Downingtown Log House, East Lancaster Avenue Historic District, General Washington Inn, and Roger Hunt Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>An extranet is a controlled private computer network that allows communication with business partners, vendors and suppliers or an authorized set of customers. It extends intranet to trusted outsiders. It provides access to needed services for authorized parties, without granting access to an organization&#x27;s entire network.
It can be implemented securely, either with dedicated links or as a VPN. 

==Enterprise applications==
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several industries started to use the term &#x27;extranet&#x27; to describe centralized repositories of shared data (and supporting applications) made accessible via the web only to authorized members of particular work groups - for example, geographically dispersed, multi-company project teams. Some applications are offered on a software as a service (SaaS) basis.

For example, in the construction industry, project teams may access a project extranet to share drawings, photographs and documents, and use online applications to mark-up and make comments and to manage and report on project-related communications. In 2003 in the United Kingdom, several of the leading vendors formed the Network for Construction Collaboration Technology Providers (NCCTP) to promote the technologies and to establish data exchange standards between the different data systems. The same type of construction-focused technologies have also been developed in the United States, Australia and mainland Europe.

==Advantages==
* Exchange large volumes of data using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
* Share product catalogs exclusively with trade partners
* Collaborate with other companies on joint development efforts
* Jointly develop and use training programs with other companies
* Provide or access services provided by one company to a group of other companies, such as an online banking application managed by one company on behalf of affiliated banks
*improved efficiency: since the customers are satisfied with the information provided it can be an advantage for the organization where they will get more customers which increases the efficiency.

==Disadvantages==
* Extranets can be expensive to implement and maintain within an organization (e.g., hardware, software, employee training costs), if hosted internally rather than by an application service provider.
* Security of extranets can be a concern when hosting valuable or proprietary information.
* Partner and customer access may result in contentious or controversial debates

<text>East Goshen Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 18,421 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The ten square miles of land that is now the township of East Goshen was part of a larger tract purchased from William Penn in Wales in September 1681. Settlers, finding the land beautiful and productive, named the area Goshenville, or &quot;the Land of Goshen.&quot;

The blacksmith shop located on North Chester Road was built in 1699. It was here in the early years that wagon wheels were re-rimmed, farm implements repaired, and horses shod. As part of East Goshen&#x27;s tricentennial in 1982, the blacksmith shop was renovated and restored.

East Goshen Township was incorporated in 1817 when Goshen was divided, forming East and West Goshen townships.

The Goshenville Historic District, Goodwin Acres, and Ellis Williams House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Resources ==
East Goshen Township owns a park located on Paoli Pike. Facilities at the park include the Hicks Pavilion with a brick barbecue.

There are areas in the park for sports such as baseball, softball, and soccer fields, four sand volleyball courts, six tennis courts with wind screens and hitting backboard, two full-size basketball courts with additional baskets for shooting around, a equipped fitness trail, a children&#x27;s activity area, a putting green, and a gazebo.

The park has many passive areas for sunbathing, reading, frisbee throwing, etc. The park is also a popular place for walkers and joggers. It has restroom facilities and water fountains. Parking space has been enhanced and all facilities are planned and installed with the idea of maintaining a harmony with nature. The park closes at dusk and drinking alcohol is prohibited.

The park was named &quot;The Best Family Park&quot; by &quot;Best of the Main Line&quot;, a magazine that rates the best places and food in the Philadelphia Main Line area.

As of 2016, the Board of Supervisors approved application to the Chesco Municipal Grant Program for a Paoli Pike Trail. The 2.7-mile trail would connect East High School with the “Town Center” between Boot Road and North Chester Road and then the entire network of trails in the Township Park and Applebrook Park. This trail is envisioned as part of a much larger 750-mile trail network that would connect most of suburban Philadelphia. About 300 miles of this trail network, including the Chester Valley Trail, have already been constructed as of 2016.

==Points of interest==

Nantmeal was named by Welsh immigrants from the village of Nantmel in Radnorshire, now part of Powys. The Welsh name, Nantmel, means &#x27;the valley of Mael&#x27;, a tenth-century prince. The incorrect belief that it means &#x27;Honey Brook&#x27; is based on a confusion between the personal name &#x27;Mael&#x27;, and the Welsh word &#x27;mêl&#x27;, &#x27;honey&#x27;. The Thomas Bull House was built sometime between 1783 and 1796; Bull was a stonemason and the manager of Samuel Van Leer&#x27;s Reading Furnace; he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Revolutionary War.

Reading Furnace straddles French Creek, which forms part of the boundary between East Nantmeal and Warwick townships. The site began as an iron furnace in 1736 and later owned by the Van Leer family. It was developed as a farm in the early 19th century, and was then remodeled as a country estate for Arthur Pew in 1936. The remodeled mansion (1812) was designed by architect R. Brognard Okie.

Reading Furnace forms a significant part of the history of the early iron industry and of the families Nutt, Rutter, Savage, Branson, Van Leer and Potts.

Welkinweir (the Grace and Everett Rodebaugh Estate) is a preserve encompassing three buildings, gardens, ponds, natural wildlife habitat, trails, wetlands and woods. Grace and Everett Rodebaugh purchased the aging farm in 1935 as a weekend retreat and summer home. They retained architect Fridtjof Tobiessen to &quot;make the mansion livable.&quot; This may be the only significant residential commission of Tobiessen, whose principal works were public schools, memorials, and churches.

Brower&#x27;s Bridge, Nantmeal Village Historic District, Thomas Bull House, Warwick Furnace Farms, and Welkinweir are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>East Pikeland Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7,079 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Pike&#x27;s Land was the first name given to a grant of by William Penn to Joseph Pike from County Cork, Ireland, in 1705. It was eventually sold by Pike&#x27;s descendants and in 1838 was split in two parts, East Pikeland and West Pikeland.

East Pikeland was directly involved in the Revolutionary War, especially during the Philadelphia campaign of 1777 and 1778. It was a source of provisions for the Continental Army from its farms, mills and cottage industries. Military importance came in 1775 with the authorization by the Committee of Safety in Philadelphia to form the Continental Powder Works at French Creek. This gunpowder manufacturing complex was a key element in a system of munitions supply that involved the Warwick and Reading iron furnaces near the headwaters of French Creek, which together with other furnaces such as Hopewell produced cannon and ammunition for Washington. The prime location of the mill on the creek with its long millrace was not forgotten after the war. Some of the mill buildings were reconstructed and over the next 150 years, continued to operate variously as oil, saw, grist and spoke mills.

Mr. E. Kimber established the French Creek Boarding School for Girls in the 1830s and gave his name to the Village of Kimberton. East Pikeland today retains over 150 historically significant structures and sites. Those located in the historic Kimberton Village are the Kimberton Inn, the girls&#x27; school, Chrisman&#x27;s Mill (now the Kimberton Post Office), the Kimberton Train Station and Pennypackers Mill. The Zion Lutheran Church on Route 724 holds the distinction of being the second oldest Lutheran Church in the United States, Rapps Bridge, and the Silver Bridge iron bridge on Hares Hill Road both have historic significance.

East Pikeland Township has seen considerable change since the early part of the 20th century. The area around Kimberton saw expanded housing areas, as did the corridors near Routes 23 &amp; 724. Only the main roads were paved, according to a 1938 map. The reason for the growth in the township over the years has been an influx of population that has found East Pikeland Township an attractive and practical place to live. The suburbanization of the township, as most areas, occurred as the availability of automobiles made the general population mobile. 

In 1940, the township population was 976. Space to house the ever-increasing population came from the conversion of lands that had traditionally been dairy or wheat farms. Although some farms remain today, the predominant land use pattern in the central portion of the township is residential. The spread of suburban development has occurred primarily in the French Creek valley, along Cold Stream Road. 

Since World War II, the township has developed townhouse complexes, shopping centers, and industrial sites, including the Cromby Power Station (PECO) and shopping centers along Routes 23 &amp; 724. The closing of the remaining one and two room school houses occurred in the 1950s, in favor of the regional school system.

East Pikeland Township is a township of the second class operating under the Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code. The Board of Supervisors is the governing body, with three members elected at large by the voters for staggered six-year terms. They are responsible for both the legislative and executive functions of the township. The township manager is appointed by the board and is responsible for the day-to-day business activities of the township. The manager coordinates the work of all operating departments and is directly responsible to the Board of Supervisors.

The Continental Powder Works at French Creek, Hare&#x27;s Hill Road Bridge, George Hartman House, Kimberton Village Historic District, Prizer&#x27;s Mill Complex, and Rapps Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>East Vincent Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 6,821 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (1.10%) of which is water. The township is partially located in the Hopewell Big Woods.

==History==
In 1686, Dr. Daniel Coxe received a land patent from William Penn. Major Robert Thompson and he owned what is now East and West Vincent. In 1733, the German Reformed Congregation of Vincent Township was formed. Two years later, in 1735, the Vincent Mennonite Meeting was formed. In that same year, Garrett Brumbaugh established a tavern on Ridge Road.

In 1737, Nicholas Kaiser opened a grist mill near the mouth of Pigeon Creek, which was the beginning of the township&#x27;s formation. However, nine years later in 1746, all lands in Vincent were leased and were not available for sale, because of a land dispute. There were 46 renters.

In 1754, another tavern opened along Ridge Road, courtesy of Michael Cyfer. Today, the tavern is the reportedly haunted restaurant Seven Stars Inn. Four years later, the German Reformation Congregation constructed a log church, which was dedicated May 27. John Phillips Leydich served as the first pastor of the facility. Today, the ground is site to the East Vincent United Church of Christ.

Around 1760, John Young built a house on Cooks Glen Road, which still stands today, and is known for being one of the oldest houses in the area. The 1760s brought about a boom of development to the area, with Peter Stager and Edward Parker opening up establishments. The former built the Benjamin Custard Inn on Schuylkill Road. Today, it is the White Hall Inn. The latter&#x27;s was a tavern near a ford on the Schuylkill River. They both opened in 1768. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington and his troops forded the Schuylkill River behind the Parker Tavern. Between 1786 and 1790, a 100-year-long dispute was settled in the courts, allowing property to finally be sold. By this time, 90 renters and a total population of 430 existed. In 1800, Frederick Sheeder moved to East Vincent. A year later, Henry Parker built a house opposite the tavern that bore his name.

In 1821, a tragedy struck East Vincent when the German Reformed Church split because of temperance caused by revival meetings. Just that year, John C. Guldin had become the fifth pastor of the church. Between 1823 and 1824, the township gained morale, as the Schuylkill Navigation Company built dams, lakes, and canals to carry water between Pottsville and Philadelphia, decreasing hardship in Vincent.

Native Americans called the area &quot;The Dark Valley&quot; because of the numerous trees and undergrowth. During the American Revolution, Gen. George Washington and many of his troops camped at Malin Hall here. They were preparing for a September 16, 1777, encounter with British General William Howe. The Continental Army also camped near White Horse Inn on Swedesford Road. Because of bad weather, however, the &quot;Battle of the Clouds&quot; was never fought.

<text>Easttown Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 10,984 at the 2020 census. The township, which lies in the western half of Philadelphia&#x27;s Main Line suburbs, comprises predominantly parts of two unincorporated areas: Devon and Berwyn. A small portion of the township has a Paoli address.

==History==
The land that eventually became Easttown Township was once part of the Welsh Tract, a large expanse of land promised by William Penn to a group of Welsh Quaker settlers in which they would be able to speak and conduct business in the Welsh language. Whilst the autonomous entity envisaged by some was never formed, it left its mark in the many Welsh place names that still exist, such as the census-designated place (CDP) Berwyn in Easttown and adjacent Tredyffrin Township. The township is believed to have been incorporated in 1704 since that is the earliest date it has been found to be referred to in official records. However, a delineated community of that name appears in Thomas Holme&#x27;s c. 1687 map.

Whilst the originators of the Welsh Tract were Quakers, the earliest settlers in the portion that became Easttown Township were mostly Anglicans. St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church, just past the eastern edge of the township, was constructed in 1715 by Welsh Anglicans when the original church sent them a minister.

Revolutionary War leader Anthony Wayne was born and lived in Waynesborough house, in the western part of the township. He—or at least part of him—is buried at St. David&#x27;s.

A Revolutionary War skirmish that occurred along a ridge in the center of the township was the only engagement of that war in the township. The name of the British commander, Banastre Tarleton, was later given to a nearby mansion: Tarleton.

Two sites in the township are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Waynesborough and Roughwood. The cluster of buildings that forms the village of Leopard, identified as a &#x27;Significant Historic Cluster&#x27; in the Chester County Historic Sites Survey (1979–1982), is eligible for listing as well. In addition, the Waterloo Mills Historic District has been designated. Although St. David&#x27;s Church is just over the line in Newtown Township, the church building and its graveyard (most of which is in Easttown) are listed together in the National Register.

Easttown, along with neighboring Tredyffrin Township, was the site of the Berwyn School Fight, a boycott and legal campaign by local Black families to resist attempts to segregate public schools by race.

Easttown Township is said to have the most-litigated zoning law in Pennsylvania, largely as a result of its efforts to avoid being swallowed up by the expansion of the suburbs of Philadelphia. At least two major cases about minimum lot size were handed down by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court: &quot;Bilbar Construction&quot; upheld the township&#x27;s minimum lot sizes, while &quot;National Land and Investment Co.&quot; struck them down as &#x27;exclusionary&#x27; seven years later. &quot;National Land&quot; further held that a municipality may utilize zoning measures that are substantially related to the protection and preservation of the municipality&#x27;s proper interest in providing for the general welfare of its residents, but Easttown&#x27;s zoning did not pass the test. Ironically, despite the developer-litigants&#x27; claimed interest in allowing poor people to live in Easttown, they built only houses that sold at well over the average value in Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which 0.12% is water.

The township is bordered by Radnor township (to the east), Tredyffrin township (to the north), Willistown township (to the west) and Newtown township (to the south).

==Demographics==

<text>Exton is a census-designated place (CDP) in West Whiteland Township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its population was 5,622 at the 2020 census. The Exton Square Mall and Main Street at Exton are both located within Exton along with several other shopping centers, making Exton the major shopping district in Chester County.

==History==
Exton lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 30 (formerly the Lancaster Road, and later the Lincoln Highway) and Pennsylvania Route 100 (Pottstown Pike). Beginning in the late 18th century, the Lancaster Road became a major transportation route between Philadelphia and the west, while what is now Route 100 was a regional north–south route to Pottstown. A theory exists that Exton was named as the &quot;X&quot; on the map, denoting this intersection, though more likely the village was named after one of the several Extons in the United Kingdom.

In the late 1940s, Exton became home to the Newcomen Society of the United States. The campus of the learned society was built overlooking farmland on Newcomen Road, and featured offices, a printing shop, library and museum, guest houses, a chapel and a belltower with a carillon. The Newcomen Society (since dissolved) sold the property in the late 1990s, but its campus remains an Exton landmark serving as the headquarters of another business.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Exton has a hot-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot; on climate maps.
