Maidencreek Township was founded in December 1746, and was named after a creek that runs diagonally through the township. Quakers who settled the area in 1732 lived peacefully among the Lenape Indians until roughly 1800, when Quakers began moving west.

Over the next 100 years, German and, later, Scots Welsh, and Irish settlers purchased and moved into the areas that the Quakers left behind. The Germans were the first arrive, and established German, then known as Deutsch or Dutch, as the region&#x27;s predominant language. German remained the primary language in the area until the beginning of the 20th century. One room schools instructed students in German as their primary language, and English as their second language as part of the curriculum.

Farming was the primary means of living well into the early 20th century when roadways, housing development,s and commercial and industrial development began to predominate in the 1980s.

<doc id="131381" wikidata="Q3632939" url="?curid=131381" title="Talker">
<text>A talker is a chat system that people use to talk to each other over the Internet. Dating back to the 1980s, they were a predecessor of instant messaging.
A talker is a communication system precursor to MMORPGs and other virtual worlds such as &quot;Second Life&quot;. Talkers are a form of online virtual worlds in which multiple users are connected at the same time to chat in real-time. People log in to the talkers remotely (usually via Telnet), and have a basic text interface with which to communicate with each other.

The early talkers were similar to MUDs with most of the complex game machinery stripped away, leaving just the communication level commands – hence the name &quot;talker&quot;. ew-too was, in fact, a MUD server with the game elements removed.

Most talkers are free and based on open source software.

Many of the online metaphors used on talkers, such as &quot;rooms&quot; and &quot;residency&quot;, were established by these early pioneering services and remain in use by modern 3D interfaces such as &quot;Second Life&quot;.

==History of talkers==
===Early Internet talkers===
In the school year of 1983–1984, Mark Jenks and Todd Krause, two students at Washington High School in Milwaukee, wrote a software program for talking among a group of people. They used the PDP-11 at the Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) central office. After searching around the PDP-11 files and directories, Mark found the PDP-11 program talk, and decided that they could do better. The system had approximately 40 300–2400 bit per second modems attached to it, with a single phone number and a hunt group. The talk program was named TALK and was written to handle many options that are seen in IRC today: tables, private messages, actions, moderators and inviting to tables. Another talk server called NUTS, which stood for Neil&#x27;s Unix Talk Server, was released in 1993 and became fairly popular on Unix systems. Its command system was broadly based on the Unaxcess BBS and being room based it took a lot of inspiration from MUDs too. The source code was given away and became the basis of a huge number of variants and rewrites during the 1990s.

&quot;Cat Chat&quot; was the first Internet / JANET talker, created in 1990.

===Talker hosting===
In 1996, talker.com was formed, the first server to sell space for talkers, later giving it the name Dragonroost. The server had over 90 talkers on it at one time, during the mid-1990s boom of talkers. A number of other hosts started up as alternative hosting companies to talker.com. Talker.com ceased hosting any other talkers besides its owners&#x27; on September 28, 2009.

<text>Reading ( ; ) is a city in and the county seat of Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown. Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.

Reading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Coal Region to major East Coast markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as &quot;The Pretzel City&quot; because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.

According to 2010 census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000. Reading&#x27;s poverty rate fell over the next decade. Reading&#x27;s poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city&#x27;s residents were below the poverty line, or less &quot;than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.&quot;

Reading is located southwest of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia.

==History==
===18th century===


Lenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than , it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.

In 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County. The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.

During the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.

James Wilson practiced law in Reading from 1767 until 1775.

By the time of the American Revolution, the area&#x27;s iron industry had a total production exceeding England&#x27;s. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington&#x27;s troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War. During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.

Philadelphia was the nation&#x27;s capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic. President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.

===19th century===

In 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 spectators came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.

According to census data, Reading was among the nation&#x27;s most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.

The Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.

Future Supreme Court Justice William Strong lived and practiced law in Reading from 1832 to 1857.

The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&amp;R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed. The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.

The Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city&#x27;s prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery&#x27;s opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds, the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer &quot;Brass Era&quot; companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.

Reading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.

Following more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.
In 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.

===21st century===
In December 2007, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show featured Reading as one of the top four &quot;Up and Coming Neighborhoods&quot; in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom. The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading&#x27;s proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.

Amtrak Thruway bus service operated by Krapf Coaches runs from the BARTA Transportation Center in Reading to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, with an intermediate stop in Pottstown.

Reading and the surrounding area is serviced by the Reading Regional Airport, a general aviation airfield. The three-letter airport code for Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.

Freight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad. Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading. The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton. The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.

Passenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.

In the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA&#x27;s R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading. In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing. In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia. In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City. In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.

<text>Shillington is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. With a population of 5,475 at the time of the 2020 census the borough is nestled amongst other suburbs outside Reading. It is perhaps best known for being the location of the homestead to Pennsylvania&#x27;s first governor, Thomas Mifflin, and as the childhood home of American author John Updike. Many of Updike&#x27;s stories take place in the fictional town of Olinger, a lightly-disguised version of Shillington, and in its environs.

==History==
Shillington began in 1860 as part of Cumru Township, when local landowner and borough namesake Samuel Shilling sold some of his lots for residences. The area had an inn, originally built in 1762, called the Three Mile House because it was from Reading on the Lancaster Pike. The inn was a popular stop for farmers going to the city&#x27;s markets, and later it sat near a horse racing track built by Aaron Einstein in 1868.
A post office opened in Shillington in 1884. On August 18, 1908, the Quarter Session Court officially incorporated the borough of Shillington as a separate municipality from Cumru Township with a population of 450. Later that year Shillington elected its first official, Adam Rollman, as chief burgess. Borough council meetings were held in various locations over the years until the present town hall was completed in 1932 by order of town election commissioner Steven Myers.

Much of the borough&#x27;s present land was occupied by Angelica Farm which would be established as an almshouse, or poorhouse, in 1824. The alms house was replaced by Bern Township&#x27;s Berks Heim in 1952. The buildings of the Governor Mifflin School District now occupy most of land that was once part of the almshouse. The most notable current visible remnant of the poorhouse is a stone wall that is within short walking distance down the road from John Updike&#x27;s old home. Updike&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Poorhouse Fair&quot;, is set in a fictional building based on Shillington&#x27;s poorhouse. Many of Updike&#x27;s earliest stories were set in the fictional version of Shillington named Olinger, and some of them were collected in the volume &quot;Olinger Stories.&quot;

Angelica Farm was also the historical home of Thomas Mifflin, the first governor of Pennsylvania and 11th President of the Continental Congress.

<text>Spring Township is a township in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 28,396 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous municipality in Berks County after Reading.

==History==
In 1850, the Township of Cumru included about 33,000 acres of land, with a population of 3,853, making it the most populous district in the county outside of Reading. In area, this was the largest township. In the decade before, two unsuccessful attempts were made to divide Cumru on account of its great extent. In 1850, a third attempt was made. The petition called for a division line situated to the west of the line requested in previous petitions, beginning at the “Harrisburg Bridge” and extending southward to the Lancaster County lines, at the corner of Brecknock Township, and it was inscribed by only 45 taxable inhabitants of the township. The court appointed Aaron Albright, Richard Boone and Michael K. Boyer as commissioners to inquire into advisability of the proposed division. The commissioners, after viewing Cumru Township, divided it and recommended the western part to be designated as a new township under the name of “Spring”. The name was derived from a large fresh water spring in the central portion of the area. Because of the limestone fissures under the ground, the spring periodically appeared and disappeared. The early settlers, who used it for their daily water supplies, referred to it as the “Sinking Spring”. The boundary lines of the township were described as enclosing some 15,000 acres. The report was presented for these boundaries on August 5, 1850. The Court confirmed the report on November 23, 1850, and formed the new township calling it the Township of Spring.

Wertz&#x27;s Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.3 km2), of which 18.2 square miles (47.2 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.22%) is water. Since it extends from near the Schuylkill River in the northeast to the Lancaster County border in the southwest, the township&#x27;s terrain varies considerably. Most is drained to the Schuylkill, except for the southwestern end, which is in the Susquehanna watershed and drains via the Conestoga River. While much of the north is low-lying, much of the southwest is mountainous. The Cacoosing Creek forms the natural northwestern boundary and flows into the Tulpehocken Creek, which in turn forms the natural northeastern boundary.

<text>Wernersville is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,776 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Wernersville is located at (40.329941, -76.080701).

==History==
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Wernersville was a noted resort community. City dwellers (especially from Philadelphia and New York City) traveled out to Wernersville, a stop on the Reading Railroad to rest and partake of the cool mountain air of South Mountain. A number of large resort hotels were erected for this purpose including Galen Hall, Bynden Wood, Grand View and the Highland Hotel. Some were advertised as sanatoriums, specializing in rest cures for illnesses such as tuberculosis. The most famous of these was Dr. Robert Walter&#x27;s Mountain Park (aka Walters Park). Most of these resort hotels have since disappeared due to fire, demolition, or have been transformed into buildings for institutional purposes. Some cottages once associated with the resorts are now private homes.

In 1891, the Wernersville State Hospital opened as the State Asylum for the Chronic Insane. The original hospital buildings remain standing and the State Hospital is still active.

Wernersville was once the location of the Jesuit Novitiate and Juniorate of St Isaac Jogues for the Society&#x27;s Maryland Province, before the novitiates of the New York, Maryland and eventually New England provinces merged and it was relocated in 1993 to Syracuse, New York. As the numbers of religious declined and the Juniorate wing was closed, half of the large building was dedicated around 1974 to a Spiritual Center for retreats for lay people. But, again as religious numbers further declined, the Center took over the entire building. However in August of 2021, the Spiritual Center closed. In March 2023, the Phoebe Center bought the entire property for senior living at all degrees: independent, full-care etc. in the current building as well as in newly constructed cottages. A Jesuit cemetery remains on the grounds.

The Lerch Tavern and Wertz Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Wyomissing is a borough in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States, adjacent to Reading. The borough was incorporated on July 2, 1906. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,114, compared to 10,461 at the 2010 census. The growth was significantly larger between 2000 and 2010 largely because of its merger in January 2002 with neighboring Wyomissing Hills. Wyomissing is the most populous borough in Berks County.

The borough is recognized as a Tree City USA and selected as a &quot;Contender&quot; for the best places to live in Pennsylvania by &quot;Money&quot; magazine.

==Geography==

Wyomissing is located in central Berks County at (40.332742, −75.964603). It is bordered by the city of Reading to the northeast and southeast, by West Reading directly to the east, by the borough of Shillington and Cumru Township to the south, by Spring Township to the west and northwest, and by Bern Township to the north. From south to north, the west side of Wyomissing is bordered by the unincorporated communities of Montrose Manor, Lincoln Park, West Wyomissing, West Lawn, Whitfield, and Colony Park. Directly to the north, in Bern Township, is the unincorporated community of Greenfields.

The northeastern boundary of Wyomissing with Reading is formed by Tulpehocken Creek and a small portion of the Schuylkill River. Wyomissing Creek flows from southwest to northeast towards the Schuylkill, through the southern part of the borough.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.47 percent, is water.

In the vicinity of the Knitting Mills, formerly the Vanity Fair complex, average monthly temperatures range from 30.6 °F in January to 75.9 °F in July. The climate locally and in the surrounding area is classified by the Köppen climate classification system as hot-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfa&quot;). The local hardiness zone is 7a, bordering on 6b.

==History==
The original inhabitants of Wyomissing are Lenape Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name &quot;Wyomissing&quot; is from the Delaware language, meaning &quot;peaceful/long fish/pike&quot;. Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to William Penn in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.

===19th century===
In 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Reading lumber dealer Thomas P. Merritt acquired . Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and Levi Walter Mengel joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun and Janssen along the Reading Railroad just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as &quot;The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries. Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills. This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.
In 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners.

===20th century===
On July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing. Between 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949–1950 saw the largest annexation, with the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.
The borough evolved during this period from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called &quot;Woodmill Commons&quot;.

In 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.

==Economy==
Wyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to Reading and its highway access. The Berkshire Mall is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes 422 and 222, providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater Philadelphia and Berks County region.

Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including Penn Entertainment, the second-largest gaming company in the U.S., Boscov&#x27;s, one of the last family-owned department store chains in the nation, and Carpenter Technology Corporation. UGI and VF Corporation have major operations in the borough. Sovereign Bank was previously headquartered here. Sovereign was acquired by Santander Group, which maintains its regional office at the same location in the borough. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Citibank are developing data backup centers using the region&#x27;s close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the East Coast.

In 2024, Macy&#x27;s opened a new store in Wyomissing at Broadcasting Square replacing a former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store. This is the company&#x27;s first store in Berks County.

Wyomissing is located at the junction of U.S. Route 222 and U.S. Route 422, which pass concurrent through the borough on the Warren Street Bypass freeway. US 222 heads south as a freeway toward Lancaster and north as a freeway toward Allentown while US 422 heads west on Penn Avenue toward Lebanon and east on the West Shore Bypass freeway toward the central part of Reading and Pottstown. Pennsylvania Route 12 begins at US 222/US 422 in Wyomissing and continues northeast along the Warren Street Bypass toward the northern part of Reading and Pricetown.

Other notable local roads in Wyomissing include Park Road, Paper Mill Road, State Hill Road, and Wyomissing Boulevard.

Wyomissing is served by multiple Berks Area Regional Transportation Authority (BARTA) bus routes including 12, 14, 15, and 16, which serve residential and business areas in the borough and connect the borough to the BARTA Transportation Center in Reading and other points in Berks County.

Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) operates freight trains through Wyomissing. The borough is home to the Wyomissing Junction between the Harrisburg Line running from Harrisburg to Philadelphia and the Reading Line running from Wyomissing to Bethlehem. Wyomissing was proposed to be the western terminus of a section of the Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) passenger rail service. The SVM project would have extended both ends of SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Line, with one end extended from the Philadelphia area to Berks County. The project was ultimately rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program. In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of SEPTA&#x27;s Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along the existing NS line, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.

<text>Altoona ( ) is a city in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 43,963 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Altoona metropolitan area, which includes all of Blair County and was recorded as having a population of 122,823. 

Altoona was established in 1849 by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Having grown around the railroad industry, the city has worked to recover from industrial decline and urban decentralization experienced in recent decades. The city is home to the Altoona Curve baseball team of the Eastern League, which is the AA affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball team. They play at Peoples Natural Gas Field in Altoona. The Altoona Symphony Orchestra has called Altoona home since 1928. Prominent landmarks include the Horseshoe Curve, the Railroaders Memorial Museum, the Juniata Shops of the Altoona Works, the Mishler Theatre, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, and the Jaffa Shrine Center.

==History==
===Etymology===
One explanation of the city&#x27;s name is that the word Altoona is a derivative of the Latin word &quot;altus&quot;, meaning high.

That explanation is contradicted by Pennsylvania Place Names. One history named a Colonel Beverly Mayer of Columbia, Pennsylvania, a civil engineer of the Pennsylvania Central Railway, as the person who named Altoona after the city of Altona in the Duchy of Holstein, which became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1864 and of Germany in 1871. The German Altona, which is today a district of Hamburg, lies on the right bank of the Elbe and is an important railway and manufacturing center.

Popular belief has it that the Hamburg district of Altona owes its name to its close vicinity to Hamburg. Supposedly, Hamburg&#x27;s merchants considered their rival to the west &#x27;all zu nah&#x27; (&#x27;far too close&#x27;), which over time became Altona.

In 1849, David Robinson sold his farm to Archibald Wright of Philadelphia, who transferred the property to his son, John A. Wright, who laid it out in building lots, became one of the founders of Altoona, and is considered another person who may have named the city. According to his own statement, he had spent considerable time in the Cherokee country of Georgia. Here he had been attracted to the name Allatoona, which he believed meant &quot;the high lands of great worth.&quot; An 1883 publication favored the Cherokee derivation, stating that &quot;Its name is not derived from the Latin word altus nor from the French word alto, as has frequently been asserted and published, but from the beautiful, liquid, and expressive Cherokee word Allatoona.&quot;

For 60 days in 2011, the city officially changed its name to &quot;POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot; in exchange for $25,000 as part of a marketing gimmick for the movie of the same name.

===Founding and growth===

Prior to European settlement, the Altoona area was inhabited by the Iroquois Confederacy. Altoona was founded by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1849 as the site for a shop and maintenance complex. Altoona was incorporated as a borough on February 6, 1854, and as a city under legislation approved on April 3, 1867, and February 8, 1868.

In late September 1862, Altoona was home to the War Governors&#x27; Conference which brought together 13 governors of Union states. This body gave early approval to the Emancipation Proclamation. The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, its population approximately 2,000 in 1854, 10,000 in 1870, and 20,000 in 1880. The demand for locomotives during the Civil War stimulated much of this growth, and by the later years of the war, Altoona was known as a valuable city for the North. Altoona was also the site of the first Interstate Commission meeting to create and design the Gettysburg National Cemetery following the devastating Battle of Gettysburg. The centrality and convenience of the town&#x27;s rail transportation brought these two important gatherings to the city during the war.

===Horseshoe Curve===
Horseshoe Curve, a curved section of track built by the Pennsylvania Railroad, located at MP 242 on the NS Pittsburgh line, has become a tourist attraction and National Historic Landmark. The curve was built to help trains cross the Allegheny Ridge, a barrier to westward trade. Construction of the Erie Canal in New York 20 years earlier had diverted much port traffic from Philadelphia to New York City, feeding that city&#x27;s commercial dominance. Because the curve was an industrial link to the western United States, Horseshoe Curve was a primary target of eight Nazi saboteurs who had landed during World War II from U-boats of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during Operation Pastorius.

At its peak in the early 20th century, PRR&#x27;s Altoona Works complex employed about 15,000 people and covered three miles (5 km) in length, of yards and of indoor workshop floor space in 122 buildings. The PRR built 7,873 of its own locomotives at the Works, the last in 1946. PRR shaped the city, creating the city&#x27;s fire departments and moving the hospital to a site nearer to the shop&#x27;s gates. Today, the fire department employs 65 people and is the largest career department between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. PRR sponsored a city band and constructed Cricket Field, a sports complex. In 1853, the PRR built the Mechanic&#x27;s Library, the first industrial library in the nation, which exists today as the Altoona Area Public Library. With the decline in railroad demand after World War II, things began to decline. Many treasures of the city&#x27;s history disappeared, including the Logan House Hotel and railroad shops.

Horseshoe Curve is a popular tourist attraction, particularly for train aficionados. There is a funicular that takes visitors to a viewing area, or it can be reached by climbing 194 steps to the top.

===1949 tornado===
On May 22, 1949, at about 6 pm, a tornado moved through the southern part of Altoona. According to the &quot;Altoona Mirror,&quot; the tornado touched down near Sugar Run Road in the Canan Station area of Allegheny Township and cut a swath of destruction through the southwestern portion of Altoona. Houses lost shingles and there was extensive tree damage in the Eldorado and Llyswen sections of town.

Another tornado touched down in Morrisons Cove, south of Altoona. Houses were unroofed and barns were destroyed in the Henrietta and Millerstown area. A 17-year-old girl was injured in Henrietta. The damage done by these tornadoes is consistent with winds of .

A map made by Ted Fujita in 1974 of all of the tornadoes in the U.S. between 1930 and 1974 shows these two tornadoes mapped as F1 tornadoes on the Fujita Scale.

===Present===
Altoona is one of the dual seats of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona–Johnstown. The Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament was made a cathedral and rechristened from St. John&#x27;s Church in 1851.

The &quot;Altoona Mirror&quot; newspaper, founded in 1876 by Harry Slep, is Altoona&#x27;s oldest media outlet. Today, the newspaper has a daily circulation of 32,000 and a Sunday circulation of 39,000. Approximately 13,000 people read the online edition of the newspaper each day.

Altoona is home to the world&#x27;s oldest wooden roller coaster, the Leap-The-Dips, located in Lakemont Park.

In December 2024, after a 4 day nationwide manhunt, Luigi Mangione was arrested for allegedly killing Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson at a local McDonald&#x27;s.

==Geography==

Altoona lies at the base of Brush Mountain within Logan Valley and Pleasant Valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Altoona is situated in the Allegheny Mountains.

===Neighborhoods===

The main sections of Altoona are Downtown Altoona, Center City, Logantown, Fairview, Juniata, Wehnwood, Calvert Hills, 5th Ward, Westmont, Eldorado, East End, Dutch Hill, Pleasant Valley, Hileman Heights, 6th Ward, Mansion Park, Llyswen, Garden Heights, and Highland Park. Some significant neighborhoods are Little Italy, Gospel Hill, Toy Town, Columbia Park, Knickerbockers, and Curtin. Some areas within Logan Township, outside the city limits but still considered sections of Altoona, are Lakemont, Greenwood, Bellmeade, Westfall, Newburg, and Red Hill. Many of the older districts consist of a mix of rowhouses and individual homes, which were a common building style in railroad towns in order to provide for worker and manager housing, respectively.

====Downtown====
The downtown is the cultural and commercial center of Altoona and straddles the famous railroads. As is typical of a traditional city layout, the downtown is centrally located and contains significant development in all directions. Much of the area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Downtown Altoona Historic District. Popular landmarks include the Mishler Theatre, the Penn Alto Building (formerly the Penn Alto Hotel), the Gable&#x27;s Building, City Hall, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, and Eleventh Avenue itself.

Altoona has several notable churches, including the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament at the corner of 13th Street and 13th Avenue, the building on the corner of 12th Street and 14th Avenue that previously housed the First Presbyterian Church, and the First Lutheran Church on the corner of 14th Street and 12th Avenue. The Station Medical Center, formerly known as the Station Mall, was a downtown mall built during the 1970s in place of many old railroad shops. The downtown contains most of what is known as Altoona&#x27;s Little Italy district.

Because of the geography of the area, exact or natural boundaries for Downtown are not present. Therefore, Downtown is generally defined by what the city has zoned as Central Business: between 13th Avenue and the PRR Expressway, and from 7th Street to 16th Street. However, it is common for areas within Logantown and Center City to be expressed locally as &quot;downtown&quot;.

The Texas Hot Dog was originally created in downtown Altoona in 1918, although the Paterson, New Jersey Texas Hot Dog location, which opened in 1924, is more famous.

=====Architecture=====
The commercial core of the downtown includes many multistory residential, commercial, and mixed-use facilities designed at the turn of the 20th century in a mix of Victorian, Edwardian Baroque, and Neo-Romanesque styles. This style features high ceilings, resulting in taller buildings than is typical for the number of floors. The high ceilings are typically made of either tin or plaster, although sometimes a drop ceiling is utilized.

Individual homes originally provided housing to managers and executives of the PRR and have structural similarities to Victorian or Edwardian mansions, but built very narrow and tall. These are sometimes used as double or triple family apartments or even converted into commercial space. Outside of the commercial core is a mosaic of multistory commercial structures, mixed-use facilities, single story commercial structures, apartment buildings, multiunit housing, and single-family homes.

The U.S. post office in Altoona contains two oil-on-canvas WPA-commissioned murals painted by Lorin Thompson in 1938, titled &quot;Pioneers of Altoona&quot; and &quot;Growth of the Road&quot;. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Altoona falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July, although extremes in temperature have ranged from in 1904 to in 2011. Total precipitation is greatest in September and least in February.

The per capita income for the city was $15,213. About 12.9% of families and 17.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.1% of those under age 18 and 9.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Historically, the sole economic force driving the growth of Altoona into a City was the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). While the various local railroad shops still employ over a thousand people, they are no longer the driving economic engine of the area as they once were.

The top field of employment in Altoona and the metro area is the healthcare industry. Facilities include: UPMC Altoona with its many local facilities that employ thousands, Healthsouth Rehabilitation Hospital and its several local facilities, James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, dozens of doctors offices, and over 20 nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Altoona serves as the corporate home to Sheetz, a rapidly growing convenience store and gasoline chain with over 600 locations in the Northeast.

Altoona also serves as the headquarters to the candy company Boyer. Famous for their Mallo Cup, the company was founded in 1936, 42 years after the founding of The Hershey Company in Hershey.

Another massive employer is the retail and service industries. Altoona is the linchpin of the Tri-City Region. Its location along I-99 draws from a large trade area over a wide geographic area that extends to State College and Johnstown and over south along I-99 past I-70.

Altoona draws the retail customers into the region because of its centralized location. Retail areas include:
* Downtown region.
* The 17th Street corridor including what remains of the Station Mall.
* Certain large zoned sections along Logan Boulevard and 6th Avenue.
* The Logan Valley Mall which is a major retail staple of the area.
* Approximately stretch of Pleasant Valley Boulevard and Valley View Boulevard as they converge into Plank Road, consisting of numerous stores and shopping centers. This area plus Route 764 which runs through Altoona and the northern and southern suburbs is known as the &quot;Green Banana&quot;.
* The Logan Town Centre which is the newest shopping center in the area and sits directly next to I-99.

===Industry===
As is typical in many Rust Belt cities, the economic downturn of the railroad resulted in the closure of many of the downtown&#x27;s landmark stores and industries. The simultaneous rise in prominence of the automobile shifted commercial development to the suburbs of Altoona. However, through recent revitalization efforts, Altoona&#x27;s downtown maintains a significant level of economic vitality and hosts few office and residential vacancies. The downtown maintains a significant focus on pedestrian-oriented development, as evidenced by the presence of more pedestrian bridges and underpasses across the railroad tracks (connecting the two parts of downtown) than automobile crossings.

Penn State Altoona has purchased several downtown buildings, including the former Playhouse Theater building, the six-story Penn Furniture building, and the former WRTA building. The university has turned them into the Devorris Downtown Center, the Aaron Building and the Kazmaier Family Building. Recently, Sheetz has added another building to Penn State Altoona called The Sheetz Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence on the former site of a department store behind the Amtrak Station. The university provides a flow of resources into the downtown, aiding in revitalization efforts. As an example of the university&#x27;s value to the downtown&#x27;s economy, the installation of the Blue Lot near the Wolf Court Building has improved the economic attraction of downtown by offering up to three hours of free parking. A bike path connecting the Campus to Downtown Altoona has also been built.

==Sports==

The city is home to the Altoona Curve, a Minor League Baseball franchise. The Curve began play in 1999 and are the Double-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The team plays in the Eastern League at Peoples Natural Gas Field.

The Altoona Mountain Citys were a Major League Baseball franchise that played in Altoona in 1884. They folded after 25 games with a 6–19 record.

In the early 20th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad constructed a large sports complex at the intersection of Chestnut Avenue and Seventh Street. It was named Cricket Field in an attempt to appeal to Cricket-loving British investors. Cricket did not catch on with the Altoona populace, so its close relative baseball became the choice for Cricket Field. Well known baseball players as Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson played at Cricket Field, and the stadium was also the venue for numerous other sporting events, musical competitions, marching units, and activities. A commercial plaza and the Pennsylvania State Parole &amp; Probation stands today on the site of the former Cricket Field.

Altoona was the site of a board track called Altoona Speedway from 1923 to 1931. The track was the site of the fatal injuries of three Indianapolis 500 winners during the 1920s, claiming the lives of Howdy Wilcox (1919 winner) on September 4, 1923; Joe Boyer (1924 winner) on September 2, 1923; and Ray Keech (1929 winner) on June 15, 1929.

Altoona Area School District&#x27;s Mansion Park Stadium fields sporting events for both its constituents schools, Bishop Guilfoyle High School and various amateur athletic district events. Mansion Park has also been the site of a 1992 Pittsburgh Steeler intrasquad scrimmage, the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college soccer championships, University of Pittsburgh preseason football practices and the 1995 PIAA Soccer Championships. Musical events have included the Beach Boys, Up With People, the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, the Penn State Blue Band, the Ohio State Pride of the Buckeyes Band, the University of Notre Dame Band of the Fighting Irish, the University of Illinois Marching Illini and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Marching Band In early 2010, a new scoreboard featuring a video display board with an improved stadium sound system was erected thanks to the generosity of local sponsors.

==Education==
===Primary education===

Altoona has three high schools, one public and two parochial.

The public school district for all of the city limits is the Altoona Area School District. Altoona Area High School houses grades 10–12. D.S. Keith Junior High and Theodore Roosevelt Junior High merged in 2008 to become the Altoona Area Junior High School. Roosevelt was torn down and the ground on which it stood was constructed into the new field for the new junior high. D. S. Keith was turned into residential apartments.

Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona–Johnstown operates and/or sponsors area Catholic schools. Bishop Guilfoyle High School is one of the private parochial schools serving grades 9–12. Great Commission Schools is the second private parochial school having grades K–12. 

Altoona High is much larger than Bishop Guilfoyle, graduating around 500 students annually, while Guilfoyle graduates around 70.

===Colleges and universities===

Altoona is the location of the Pennsylvania State University, Ivyside Park campus, also known as Penn State Altoona. This is the third largest of the Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses. The college has approximately 3,903 students as of the 2014–15 school year.

Altoona also has several technical schools. The Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center (GACTC) is located on 16th Street next to the high school and offers a variety of technical classes for both Junior High and High School students throughout Blair County, as well as high school graduates seeking a technical degree. YTI Career Institute has a campus in Logan Hills on Fairway Drive. South Hills Business School has a campus located on 58th Street.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Altoona is a major center on the Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s (NS) Pittsburgh Line. In Altoona, helper engines are added to heavy trains to give them extra power up and over Horseshoe Curve west of town. The Juniata Heavy Repair Shop Complex, originally built by the Pennsylvania Railroad, is the primary repair and maintenance facility on NS. On an average day, 60 to 80 trains pass through Altoona. The historical importance to the railroad industry and the current high level of railroad activity has made Altoona a mecca for railfans for over 60 years, with the Railroaders Memorial Museum and the Horseshoe Curve being popular spots. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; stops at Altoona station once daily in each direction.

Local bus service in the city is provided by AMTRAN. In 2007, AMTRAN customers suffered a major loss in service due to cuts in state funding. In May of that year, Governor Rendell visited Altoona to discuss plans intended to rectify this situation.

Roadway service primarily consists of I-99, which provides access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the south and I-80 to the north; and US 22, which provides east–west service and direct access to Pittsburgh to the west and Harrisburg to the east. Local roadways in Altoona tend to be given numerical names, and &quot;Streets&quot; are aligned northwest–southeast and &quot;Avenues&quot; are aligned northeast–southwest.

The Altoona–Blair County Airport provides commercial air service for Altoona, offering daily flights to Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

===City services===
Altoona and the Altoona Area are serviced by several companies for emergency services. Given that Altoona is entirely encompassed by Logan Township, and some small areas within the city are belonging to the Township, City and Township services often intermingle. Given the close proximity to Hollidaysburg and Duncansville Boroughs as well as Allegheny and Blair Townships, City, borough and township services will often assist or be called in place of each other.

The Altoona Police Department services the city. APD is about 66 strong, and the precinct is located on 16th St downtown. Logan Township Police Department services all areas of Logan Township. However, since the township encompasses the city, in order to be centrally located the precinct is located in the city on 7th Avenue. LTPD is 16 strong.

The Altoona Fire Department supplies fire and Quick Response Service to the city, as well as Haz-Mat response for Blair County. The department is also a part of the IAFF, local 299. There are also several Volunteer Companies located just outside the city limits on all sides.

AMED or the Altoona Mobile Emergency Department provides EMS services for both Altoona and Logan Township as well as many surrounding areas in Blair County including Bellwood, Tyrone, and Roaring Spring. AMED has several online and several offline ambulances on duty at the main station 430 on 7th Avenue and 10th Street as well as an additional online ambulance at 480 in Lakemont.

==History==

In 1830, Samuel Duncan, recognizing the excellent possibilities for land development, purchased land on the western banks of the stream which traversed the area and plotted a town, which he named Duncansville. About the same time, Jacob Walters laid out plots of land on the eastern side of the stream and called his settlement Walterstown. Confusion and some rivalry existed between the two settlements. Both Duncan and Walters agreed that a common name should be used for the two places. They decided to cast lots to select the name to be used. The people of both settlements declared a holiday and arranged quite a celebration for the occasion. All assembled at the wooden bridge separating the two towns. A coin was tossed and fortune favored Duncan, thereby uniting the two communities under the name of Duncansville.

==History==

During the late 18th century, Patrick Cassidy, a native of Newry, Ireland and an American soldier in the American Revolutionary War, purchased three hundred acres of land in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. This is now known as Blair County. C. 1793, where he constructed a small town on the land, which he named for his home.

A half-century later, Newry flourished as the Allegheny Portage Railroad began to carry passengers from Hollidaysburg across the Alleghenies to Johnstown. Newry&#x27;s location made it a suitable stop for the railroad and this new influx of visitors stimulated the economy of the town. This prosperity lasted from the 1830s to the 1850s, when the railroad closed.

During the following century, the town decreased in population and quietly shifted from an urban to a rural center until the 1950s, when migration of Altoonans from the north began to increase the size of Newry and gave it a more suburban character.

==Businesses and institutions==

The majority of Newry&#x27;s businesses are found along the main north-south road, Old Route 220: just north of the town, a storage company and a small motor vehicles store; within Newry, several crafts shops and an electronics repair store; and immediately to the south, the largest business in the town, Leighty&#x27;s, which comprises a convenience store, a computer systems, parts, and repair store, a golf driving range, a hunting outfitter, a flea market, a flower store, a gas station, and a bathroom and kitchen remodeling store.

Along Patrick Lane, the southmost east-west road in the town, are located a post office, a small apartment building, a furniture store, a used home appliances and furniture store, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish, a Roman Catholic parish, and an elementary school.

==Education==
The school district is Hollidaysburg Area School District.

==Events==
The two yearly events celebrated by the community, both held by St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish, are the Lenten fish fries, held in the cafeteria of the school, and the summer festival, held near the end of July or early August on the school playground and in the gymnasium. Both attract visitors from across the Altoona metropolis and greatly benefit the church and school.

==Surrounding areas==
To the north of Newry, Old Route 220 leads to Duncansville and then to Altoona and other points north.

To the west, the Puzzletown Road curves to the southwest through a few miles of housing developments and into Puzzletown, where it becomes Knob Run Road, continues south-southwest up the Appalachian Plateau, up the mountain of Blue Knob and reaches the town of the same name.

To the south, 220 leads through Leamersville and East Freedom, near McKee, and intersects with Interstate 99; it leads eventually to Bedford.

To the east, the Catfish Road goes through a few miles of sparse farmland, interrupted by a few houses and a monastery, until it intersects Route 36, which leads north to Hollidaysburg and south to Roaring Spring.

<text>The ITU Radio Regulations (RR) is a basic document of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) that regulates on law of nations scale radiocommunication services and the utilisation of radio frequencies. It is the supplementation to the ITU Constitution and Convention and in line with the ITU International Telecommunication Regulations (ITR). The ITU RR comprise and regulate the part of the allocated electromagnetic spectrum (also: radio frequency spectrum) from 9 kHz to 300 GHz.

==Definitions==
The &quot;Radio Regulations&quot; define:
* the allocation of different frequency bands to different radiocommunication services;
* the mandatory technical parameters to be observed by radio stations, especially transmitters;
* procedures for the coordination (ensuring technical compatibility) and notification (formal recording and protection in the Master International Frequency Register) of frequency assignments made to radio stations by national governments;
* other procedures and operational provisions.

===Service types===
&quot;Radio communication services&quot; (or &quot;sradiocommunication services&quot;) are sub-divided into &quot;space-based radiocommunication&quot;, involving the use of one or more space stations or the use of one or more reflecting satellites or other objects in space; and &quot;terrestrial radiocommunication&quot;, which excludes space radiocommunication and radio astronomy.

The ITU Radio Regulations sets out the definitions of some 40 radio services including such services as the fixed service, the mobile service, the land mobile service, the broadcasting service, the standard frequency and time signal service, various satellite services.
Further sub-sets of some of these internationally defined services are often created at the national level. For example, within the land mobile service, a country may choose to define such services as paging, dispatch two-way radio service, cellular mobile telephone service, trunked mobile radio service, etc. Many of these definitions are based upon the nature of the service being provided rather than the international concept of a radiocommunication service. In other words, the term &quot;service&quot; can be used in these two different ways. No matter what definitions are adopted in a given country, with some specific exceptions which are allowed for in the ITU RRs, the use of the spectrum must fit in with the international definitions of radio services.

==Update==
The drafting, revision and adoption of the &quot;Radio Regulations&quot; is the responsibility of the World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) of the ITU, meetings of which are typically held every three or four years.

Recent WRCs are:
* Geneva, 1995 (WRC-95) 
* Geneva, 1997 (WRC-97) 
* Istanbul, 2000 (WRC-2000) 
* Geneva, 2003 (WRC-03) 
* Geneva, 2007 (WRC-07) 
* Geneva, 2012 (WRC-12) 
* Geneva, 2015 (WRC-15) 
* Sharm el-Sheikh, 2019 (WRC-19) 

The most recent published version of the &quot;Radio Regulations&quot;, the &quot;Edition of 2016&quot; contains the complete texts of the &quot;Radio Regulations&quot; as adopted and revised by WRC-15, including all articles, appendices, resolutions, and a subset of the recommendations issued by ITU-R (previously known as the CCIR) (those &quot;recommendations&quot; which have a mandatory nature, as a result of being cited in the &quot;Radio Regulations&quot;).

The &quot;Edition of 2020&quot;, adopted and reviewed by the WRC-19, is scheduled for publication in October 2020.

<text>Roaring Spring is a borough in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,392 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Altoona, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area

==History==

The Roaring Spring Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Portions of the text below were adapted from a copy of the original nomination document.

Roaring Spring was established around the Big Spring in Morrison&#x27;s Cove, a clean and dependable water source vital to the operation of a paper mill. Prior to 1866, when the first paper mill was built, Roaring Spring had been a grist mill hamlet with a country store at the intersection of two rural roads that lead to the mill near the spring. A grist mill, powered by the spring water, had operated at that location since at least the 1760s. After 1867, as the paper mill expanded, surrounding tracts of land were acquired to accommodate housing development for new workers. The formalization of a town plan, however, never occurred. As a result, the seemingly random street pattern of the historic district is the product of hilly topography, a small network of pre-existing country roads that converged near the Big Spring, and the property lines of adjacent tracts that were acquired through the years for community expansion. The arterial streets of the district are now East Main, West Main, Spang and Bloomfield, each of which leads out of the borough to surrounding townships. Two of these streets — Spang and East Main — meet with Church Street at the district&#x27;s main intersection called &quot;Five Points.&quot; The boundaries of the district essentially include those portions of Roaring Spring Borough which had been laid out for development by the early 1920s. This area encompasses or 55 percent of the borough&#x27;s area of . Since the district&#x27;s period of significance extends to 1944, most of those buildings erected after the 1920s were built as infill within the areas already subdivided by the 1920s. In the early 1960s, the borough began to annex sections of adjacent Taylor Township, especially to the east around the then new Rt. 36 Bypass.

Daniel Mathias (D. M.) Bare laid out Roaring Spring&#x27;s first 50 building lots in 1865 after he and two partners decided to locate the region&#x27;s first paper mill near the spring.[3] These lots were located within and around the so-called village &quot;triangle&quot; defined by West Main, Spang, and East Main Streets. By 1873, the borough contained about 170 lots and 50 buildings, which included the paper and grist mills, three churches, a company store, a schoolhouse, and one hotel. The population stood at about 100. The triangle remained the industrial, commercial and retailing core of the town until 1957 when the bypass of Main Street, PA Rt. 36, was built to the east of town through Taylor Township. As is true of many American small towns, many village merchants along with new businesses have since relocated to the new highway. The village core retains only a few shops and professional offices, but still holds the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company and Roaring Spring Water Bottling Company, all of the historic church buildings, the public library(formerly the Eldon Inn), the borough building, the post office(earlier moved from farther up East Main St.). The elementary school (former junior-senior high school) was demolished in 2010.

== Geography ==

Roaring Spring is located at .

The town features a natural spring, which empties out into a pond, which is known to locals as the &quot;Spring Dam&quot;. The &quot;Spring Dam&quot; also contains many large fish. The water is very clear, allowing visitors to see all the way to the bottom of the pond.

== Education ==
It is in the Spring Cove School District.

Roaring Spring is home to the Spring Cove School District administration offices. The school district consists of two elementary schools (Spring Cove Elementary and Martinsburg Elementary), the Spring Cove Middle School and Central High School. The district serves Taylor, Freedom, Huston, and North Woodbury Townships as well as the towns of Roaring Spring and Martinsburg. The district web site is http://springcove.schoolnet.com/.

<text>Williamsburg in Morrisons Cove, is a borough in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,241 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Altoona, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Before the first settlers arrived in the vicinity of what was later called the Big Spring, this area was part of the hunting grounds of the Lenape and Shawnee. On July 6, 1754, a treaty was signed at Albany, New York between the Iroquois and the William Penn heirs, opening up portions of the west for settlement. However, British policy forbidding western expansion was in effect until after the American Revolution.

The massacre of Captain William Phillips&#x27; Rangers took place near Williamsburg in July 1780. Ten men were murdered after surrendering to a party of Indians.

On September 17, 1789, George Reynolds took out a patent from the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for a large tract of unsettled land surrounding the Big Spring which flows into the Juniata River.

The borough was founded in 1790 by Jacob Ake. Originally called Aketown, it is the oldest borough in the current borders of Blair County. The name change was in honor of William Ake, Jacob&#x27;s son. By 1810, there were 34 houses in the village; the census of 1820 notes an inn, a distillery, and the presence of one slave. The Main Line of the Pennsylvania Canal was completed in 1832 and opened on November 28 when the packetboat &quot;John Blair&quot; left Huntingdon, for the west. The Blair County Children&#x27;s Home was located in Williamsburg for many years until its destruction by fire. Today, the borough is approximately 30 blocks, centered on High and Second Streets. This comprises the Williamsburg Historic District, listed by the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Nearby places also listed are Etna Furnace, to the north, and the Daniel Royer House, to the southwest in Royer.

Originally served by a canal along the Frankstown Branch Juniata River, the canal was abandoned in 1872. In the following year, the Pennsylvania Railroad completed a branch line from Hollidaysburg to Williamsburg along the old canal towpath. It would eventually be extended to Petersburg in 1900, completing a bypass of the main line known as the Hollidaysburg and Petersburg Branch. The railroad supplied passenger service on the branch until 1933. Freight service would continue until 1982, when Conrail abandoned the line through Williamsburg. It is now the Lower Trail (&quot;vide infra&quot;).

The Blair County Children&#x27;s Home, established in 1902, was located in Williamsburg, PA for many years until it was destroyed by fire on Aug. 2, 1975.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Williamsburg has a total area of , all land. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Williamsburg and the surrounding area sits on a 550 feet thick bed of sandstone, divided into medina white, red, and gray, with beds of red shale. Below that is the Oneida band, a 500 foot thick bed of greenish gray, iron speckled and very hard sandstone.

Williamsburg is accessed by Pennsylvania Route 866, approximately fifteen miles from Altoona to the west and thirteen miles from Huntingdon to the east. The streets are laid out in a grid pattern; going from the Frankstown Branch southward are First (or Front) Street, Second Street, Third Street, and Fourth Street (east side of the borough only). Union Street and Academy Alley/Sage Hill Drive follow the same direction of Fourth Street, if it continued. The main street is High Street, which runs through the center of the borough. Going east from High Street are Spring, Liberty, and Locust Streets; going west are Plum, Black, and Taylor Streets, with Dean Street just over the municipal line in Woodbury Township.

Union Street was named in honor of the federal union; Liberty Street for American liberty. Locust and Plum were named for trees. Black, Taylor and Dean were named for three Blair County judges born in Williamsburg. Academy Alley borders the school property. A small cross street along the eastern side of the high school, is named Blue Pirate Street, after the school mascot.

The Frankstown Branch of the Juniata River borders the borough. Piney Creek flows into this river to the west of the borough, and Clover Creek to the east. Across the river is Robeson Extension, usually considered part of Williamsburg, but actually lying in Catharine Township. Street names from the borough extend into the Extension, with the addition of Recreation Drive (borders the ballfields) and Home Street (borders Grace Pointe Community Church, former site of the Blair County Children&#x27;s Home). The Williamsburg Farm show is held at the complex in Robeson Extension.

Approaching Williamsburg on Route 866 from the northwest, after crossing the Frankstown Branch two natural landmarks can be seen on the left. One is locally named Indian Rocks and is a series of exposed ridges of tall chimney like stone formations (one larger than the others). The other is a flat rock outcropping locally named Table Rock. Native American legends are associated with these rock formations. A hiker standing on top of Table Rock has a view over the entire town.

On the south side of Williamsburg is a large natural spring locally named the Big Spring. This water source is the reason steel tycoon Charles Schwab wanted to build a steel mill in Williamsburg. Ultimately, Schwab built a paper mill and a housing development on the east side of Williamsburg, referred to as Schwab Town in the early years. The Big Spring is a favorite photography location for wedding parties.

Wilmer Stultz was born on a farm on Piney Creek Road, south of Williamsburg. After his father died when he was age 14, his mother moved with Wilmer into Williamsburg where they lived on Spring Street (named after the Big Spring). He was an aviator who piloted Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger across the Atlantic. In July 1928, Earhart accompanied Stultz to Williamsburg, where a gigantic welcome celebration was held including Stultz, Earhart, and Lou Gordon riding through the town in an open convertible and accompanied by state police escorts. In July 1929, Earhart attended Stultz&#x27;s funeral in Williamsburg after he died in an airplane accident on Long Island. He is buried, with his wife, in the Presbyterian Cemetery near the Big Spring.

==Recreation==
The Lower Trail (pronounced like &quot;power&quot;) is a rail trail that passes through Williamsburg. The Williamsburg trailhead allows the user to access to Alexandria, east, and Flowing Springs, west. The trail is crushed limestone (paved through and near the borough) with grass on both sides. The Lower Trail offers access to the Frankstown Branch along much of its length. The river is a prime fishing location for trout and other game fish. Many historical points of interest, especially involving the Pennsylvania Canal and the Pennsylvania Railroad, are located along the trail. Other trailheads are in Ganister and Mount Etna.

The Mid State Trail overlaps the Lower Trail in Williamsburg and exits via borough streets to the ridgetop of Tussey Mountain. The trail is marked with red-orange blazes on utility poles through the borough and Woodbury Township. Once off-road, the blazes appear on trees along the trail. The trail runs from the New York line to the Maryland line, with planned extensions both north and south. There are also a few spur trails on the system.

The Upper Juniata River Water Trail passes through Williamsburg. Currently mapped from the Juniata&#x27;s confluence with the Susquehanna up to Flowing Spring, the water trail offers boaters, especially canoe and kayak enthusiasts, over of river recreation. There is a carry-in/out boat access point in Williamsburg at the Lower Trail trailhead. Trail managers are looking to extend the trail upstream to the White Bridge behind Geeseytown.

<text>Sayre is a borough in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. It is the principal city in the Sayre, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. It lies southeast of Elmira, New York, and southwest of Binghamton. It is currently the largest city in Bradford County. In the past, various iron products were made there. In 1900, 5,243 people lived there; in 1910, 6,426 people lived there, and in 1940, 7,569 persons made their homes in Sayre. The population was 5,403 at the 2020 census.

Sayre is part of the Penn-York Valley (&quot;The Valley&quot;), a group of four contiguous communities in New York and Pennsylvania: Waverly, New York; South Waverly, Pennsylvania; Sayre; Athens, Pennsylvania, and smaller surrounding communities with a combined population near 35,000.

== History ==
In May 1870, a Waverly banker named Howard Elmer, along with Charles Anthony and James Fritcher, bought the Pine Plains area between Waverly and Athens. Elmer convinced Asa Packer to locate a new railroad repair facility on the Pine Plains for the expanding Lehigh Valley Railroad, which was making a push north to connect to the Erie Railroad at Waverly. Robert Heysham Sayre, president of the Pennsylvania and New York Railroad, helped cement the deal. The town was named in his honor. Sayre was incorporated on January 27, 1891.

In 1904 when the locomotive shops were built at Sayre, the main shop building was believed to be the largest structure in the world under one roof, but held that title for only a brief time. The railroad operated from 1870 until 1976, but maintenance facilities were shifted away before that. With the decline of industry, population has declined since 1940.

The Pennsylvania Guide, compiled by the Writers&#x27; Program of the Works Progress Administration, described Sayre in 1940 and emphasized the economic and social significance of the railroad, noting that Sayre:

==Geography==
Sayre is located at (41.983567, -76.520845) in a river valley in the Allegheny Plateau just north of the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chemung River, along with Athens, Pennsylvania, South Waverly, Pennsylvania, and Waverly, New York. Together, these small towns make up the greater area known as the Penn-York Valley, or just &quot;the Valley&quot;. The New York / Pennsylvania border cuts through the valley. There is no physical border between the towns, as the grid of streets and avenues blend seamlessly from one town to another. Sayre is bounded on the east and west by Athens Township, on the south by the borough of Athens, on the northwest by South Waverly, and on the north by Waverly, New York.

Pennsylvania Route 199 passes through the borough as Keystone Avenue, Mohawk Street, and Spring Street, ending at Interstate 86 just over the state line in Waverly, New York. Via I-86, it is northwest to Elmira, New York, and by New York State Route 17 (future I-86) it is east to Binghamton, New York.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.67%, is water.

Donehoo, and two visiting professors, A.B. Skinner and W.K. Moorehead while excavating a burial mound. The skeletons were reported to be at or above in height, possessing skulls that had horn-like protuberances just above the eyebrows, but were claimed to have been lost, misplaced, or stolen while en route to the American Investigation Museum. Neither Donehoo, Skinner, nor Moorehead described the discovery of any human skeletons at Sayre exhibiting gigantism or horned protrusions in their official excavation reports

<text>Warren Township is a township in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 959 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The first Euro-American settlers in the township bought tracts of land beginning in the 1790s and moved into a forested wilderness from their New England homes. The Providence, Rhode Island–based company Brown &amp; Ives was a major player in recruiting settlers, especially to the southern half of the town. Parley Coburn represented the company&#x27;s interests for nearly 40 years, until his death in 1860. He was proud of the fact that at his death he had finally sold the last of the lots. It had been a difficult task because money was scarce, the original lot prices were high, and developing a living from the earth was difficult. In some instances, Brown &amp; Ives held mortgages into the third generation of a family on the land.

<text>Wyalusing is a borough in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 596 as of the 2010 census.

== History ==
The history of Wyalusing dates back centuries. It was originally known as &quot;M&#x27;chwihilusing&quot;. The Wyalusing Path was a historic trace that ran from what is now Wyalusing to the Native American village of Canaserage (what is now Muncy, on the West Branch Susquehanna River). Before 1750, Wyalusing was known as &quot;Gahontoto&quot; and was home to the Tehotachsee tribe of Native Americans. Eventually, this small tribe was completely wiped out by the Cayuga tribe.

In the spring of 1765, the Moravian Christian Munsees, a group of absolute pacifists, founded a settlement Friedenshütten (Tents or Cabins of Peace) in what is now Wyalusing. This settlement lasted for several years, but was finally abandoned when the group led by David Zeisberger moved to Schoenbrunn (near Gnadenhutten, Ohio) in 1772. In 1792, the chief of the Cayugas and approximately 20 other families rebuilt the town.

In the 19th century, the town began to prosper as it became a shipping area for logs and other items on the Susquehanna River. In 1820, the construction of the Welles Mill along Wyalusing Creek made Wyalusing a prime area for people to farm and raise crops. In 1887, Wyalusing became a borough. Many of the buildings constructed in the late 19th century and early 1920s are still part of Main Street today.
Wyalusing is home to one of the biggest beef processing plants on the East Coast. Cargill regional beef Wyalusing is located just a couple miles outside of town. This plant was originally started in the late 1970s by the local Taylor family as a small meat processing plant. It eventually grew into a multimillion-dollar business that employs over 1,200 people from the surrounding area. Cargill is one of the biggest suppliers of ground beef to large grocery chains such as Wegmans, Giant, Shop Rite and more. In 2002, the Taylor family sold the business to the Cargill corporation, one of the largest privately owned companies in the United States.
