<text>North East is a borough in North East Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States, northeast of Erie. Its name from its position in the northeastern corner of Erie County, despite being near the extreme northwest of Pennsylvania. The population was 4,114 at the 2020 census, down from 4,294 in 2010. Fruit growing was an early economic endeavor, and is still to this day, as this is a popular area especially for cherries and grapes. There is an annual Cherry Festival in the summer and an annual Wine Country Harvest Festival in autumn. It is part of the Erie Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the northernmost town in Pennsylvania.

==History==
Before 1650, the area was settled by the Eriez, a relatively peaceful tribe; however, they were destroyed by the Seneca.

As part of the Erie Triangle, it was only in 1792 that the locale became part of Pennsylvania. However, North East did not receive its first settlers until 1794, still, several years before the county (Erie) and township (North East) was organized. Originally the North East Township was called &quot;Lower Greenfield&quot; being downstream from Greenfield Township. The first road was built in 1797 from present-day Freeport at the mouth of Sixteenmile Creek to present-day Colt Station now in Greenfield Township. That road was extended in 1798 to where French Creek forks (present-day Wattsburg). In 1800 a road from the village of North East to Wattsburg was opened, it paralleled, but ran east of, the first one from Freeport. 

This first recorded settler of the region was Joseph Shadduck from Brattleboro, Vermont in 1795. The land that the borough occupies was originally purchased from the state by a Mr. Brown, who sold it to a land speculator, a Mr. Gibson. William Dundas was the first to settle in the borough area, who&#x27;s property was later sold in 1806 to Henry Burgett, who turned the dwelling into a tavern. This property, prior to the sale, is claimed to be the site of the first sacrament to the Lord&#x27;s Supper in Erie County on Sunday the 27th of September 1801. A more &quot;pretentious&quot; tavern was built in 1808 by Lemuel Brown, located where the Haynes House is today.

Originally called Burgettstown, the name was changed in 1819 to Gibsonville until it was incorporated in 1834 as the borough of North East.

In 1798 the first school was formed. 

Its first high school, Lake Shore Seminary, was established in 1870 as a collaborative effort of the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches. In 1884, a fire destroyed two-thirds of the town&#x27;s business district.

In 1983, Short&#x27;s Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1990 the entire old central business district was added to the register.

==History==
Waterford is said to contain the only statue of George Washington wearing a British uniform, but in reality, he had been sent by the Governor of Virginia and is wearing the uniform of an officer in the Virginia Militia. In December 1753, at age 21, Washington was asked by Governor Dinwiddie to carry a British ultimatum to the French on the Ohio frontier. Washington delivered the message at Fort Le Boeuf in present-day Waterford. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French to abandon their development of the Ohio Country to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War in North America.

The area roughly bounded by North Park Row, High Street, West First Street, and Walnut Street comprises the Waterford Borough Historic District. The Eagle Hotel and Waterford Covered Bridge, along with the Waterford Borough Historic District are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Belle Vernon is a borough in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is situated along the Monongahela River, abutting two other counties, Westmoreland to the north and Washington across the river. As of the 2020 census, Belle Vernon had a population of 1,025.
&quot;Bellevernon&quot;, as it was originally spelled, was laid out in 1813 by Noah Speers in northwestern Fayette County. French for &quot;beautiful green&quot;, this was the name chosen by both Noah Speers for his little community on the Monongahela River and later by his son Louis, who founded a town with nearly the same name just up the hill (North Belle Vernon). Directly across the river lies the borough of Speers, anchoring the far side of the landmark I-70 bridge as the east bridge abutments lie in adjacent Rostraver Township.

==Geography==
Belle Vernon is located at (40.126936, −79.868285), nestled in the northwestern corner of Fayette County, with abutting borders on Washington County, to the west across the river, and Westmoreland County to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 20.29%, is water.

==Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods==
Belle Vernon has three land borders with Washington Township to the southeast and the Westmoreland County neighborhoods of North Belle Vernon to the north and Rostraver Township to the northwest.

Across the Monongahela River to the south in Washington County, Belle Vernon runs adjacent with the aforementioned borough of Speers as well as Dunlevy.

==History==

Noah Speers was the father of Louis M. Speers, born in a log cabin on the Speers homestead/Gibsonton farm in 1810. The younger Speers played a large role in the development of Belle Vernon. During his lifetime, the population grew to about 700, and there was a steam ferry connecting Belle Vernon with Allen Township across the river. The little hamlet boasted five dry goods stores, four groceries, two glasshouses with 87 employees, a boot and shoe, cabinet, chair, wagon, saddle/harness, blacksmith/tanning shops, and two sawmills. Louis Speers owned a sandbank outside of town which produced the best quality glass sand. He also owned a large coal works and a large boat yard with more than 50 employees. Louis resided on the northwest corner of Main and 2nd streets.

Boat hulls were built at his boatyard (owned in partnership with a man named Morgan Gaskill), located on 3rd Street in the 1830s and 1840s. Several steamboats are noted to have come from the yard, including the &quot;Minstrel&quot;, which in 1842 fell off its building docks killing one and injuring 10. The &quot;St. Anthony&quot; bound for Galena, Illinois, and the &quot;Cassandra&quot; headed to Knoxville, Tennessee, came from the Belle Vernon yard. Two boats bound for customers in Pittsburgh were the &quot;Alert&quot; and the &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1847).

In 1853, Mr. Speers built a sawmill with partner William Latta, a boat builder, below the mouth of Speers Run. It was destroyed by fire in 1877 and rebuilt by his son William F. Speers. William, who spent three months in Libby Prison during the Civil War, left the army after attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. William went bankrupt soon after completing the new mill and sold it to the Belle Vernon Saw and Planing Company in 1880.

The small village of Speers across the river, laid out in 1860 by a kinsman, gets its name from the same family. North Belle Vernon, in Westmoreland County, was laid out in 1872 by Louis and was incorporated in 1876. Louis died two years later in 1878 and is buried at the Rehoboth Presbyterian Church Cemetery.

Samuel Dougherty, a carpenter, is claimed to have built the first dwelling in North Belle Vernon on Broad Avenue near Spring Alley. He was justice of the peace, council member, school director, and judge of election, all at the same time. The first two industries were a foundry in 1873 on Broad Avenue above Spring Alley and a flour mill on Speer Street in 1874. Most of these early buildings surrounded the intersection of Short Street and Broad Avenue. Lots were not sold until 1900 and the area beyond Arch Street then began to build up.

<doc id="132515" wikidata="Q1132976" url="?curid=132515" title="Brownsville, Pennsylvania">
<text>Brownsville is a borough in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States, first settled in 1785 as the site of a trading post a few years after the defeat of the Iroquois enabled a resumption of westward migration after the Revolutionary War. The trading post soon became a tavern and inn and was receiving emigrants heading west, as it was located above the cut bank overlooking the first ford that could be reached to those descending from the Allegheny Mountains. Brownsville is located south of Pittsburgh along the east bank of the Monongahela River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Brownsville has a total area of , of which is land and , or 10.47%, is water—most of which is the Fayette County half of the Monongahela River between the community and the flatter lands of West Brownsville on the opposite shore in Washington County. As a community, the town is the central population center for a number of outlying hamlets geographically tied to the town for the same reasons they were founded nearby: western Pennsylvania has far more hills and steep slopes than flats or gentle sloping terrains suitable for settlement. This keeps Brownsville at the nexus of the transportation infrastructure which grew up during its history. While no longer a passenger depot, Brownsville and West Brownsville share an important railway bridge, creating a balloon loop that allows the turning of complete coal trains. The limited-access toll road PA Route 43 connects the town to strategic points and southern Pittsburgh at Clairton. PA Route 88, hugging the river, connects to towns up and down the Monongahela Valley. The historic National Road (now U.S. Route 40) reached East Saint Louis, Illinois, and connected the town to the immigrants arriving in the port of Baltimore traveling west on the Cumberland Turnpike and the National Road.

From its founding, well into the 19th century, as the first reachable population center west of the Alleghenies barrier range on the Mississippi watershed, the borough quickly grew into an industrial center, market town, transportation hub, outfitting center, and riverboat-building powerhouse. As a trading post, it was a gateway destination for emigrants heading west to the Ohio Country and the new United States&#x27; Northwest Territory, and later for travelers heading westwards on the various Emigrant Trails both to the Near West and later the Far West. As an outfitting center, the borough provided the markets for the small-scale industries in the surrounding counties, as well as for Maryland shipping goods over the pass by mule train via the Cumberland Narrows toll route.

Brownsville became a major center for building steamboats through the 19th century, producing 3,000 boats by 1888.

The borough developed in the late 19th century as a railroad yard and coking center, with other industries related to the rise of steel in the Pittsburgh area. It reached a peak of population of more than 8,000 in 1940. Postwar development took place in suburbs, as was typical of the time. The restructuring of the railroad and steel industries caused a severe loss of jobs and population in Brownsville, beginning in the 1970s. The borough had a population of 2,331 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
In pre-Columbian times, the right bank of the Monongahela River held several mounds where iron-rich red stone predominated, now believed to have been constructed by a branch of the Mound Builders cultures, but believed by colonials to have been forts. This led to the area near the river crossing being called Redstone Old Fort in various colonial government records and later Fort Burd when an arms cache was built there. By the time the region first became known to Dutch colonists and traders and the French in the 1640s, the lands were largely unoccupied, but under the management of one tribe or shared by several groups of Iroquoian peoples, likely the Erie people or Wenro people and possibly shared with the Seneca, the Shawnee people and the Susquehannocks. With all the rivers and streams tributary to the Monongahela, Youghiogheny, and Allegheny Rivers, there is little known about the region&#x27;s precise role in the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, but when French, Dutch and Swedish fur traders penetrated to the Greater Ohio Basin in the 1640s and 1650s, the one thing that seemed clear to those observers was that the lands later termed the Ohio Country seemed empty and unpopulated.
In the 17th century, several provincial Virginians and Marylanders confirmed the emptiness of the region. Before the 1750s, the area was &quot;colonized&quot; by weakened remnant tribes such as the Delaware and the few Erie and the Susquehannock survivors that the Iroquois allowed to move there as tributary peoples (climbing the gaps of the Allegheny). These migrations occurred over the 70 to 80 years before the French and Indian War in the 1750s, where today&#x27;s historians usually report the lands were long held as &quot;hunting territories&quot; of the powerful Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. During the Revolution, the Iroquois were divided whether to back the colonies or the mother country, and mostly did neither, attempting to stay neutral. Nonetheless, in 1778, agitated by British officers lobbying for frontier attacks, mixed parties of Tories (Loyalists) and Iroquois committed atrocities in 1778, so Washington sent the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, which broke the power of the Iroquois and reopened the Ohio Country to homesteader settlement. As a river crossing, the closest to the pass that reached the Monongahela, the town saw many settlers passing by.

Because colonial settlers believed that the earthwork mounds were a prehistoric fortification, they called the settlement Redstone Old Fort; later in the 1760s and 1770s, it became known as &quot;Redstone Fort&quot; or &quot;Fort Burd&quot;, named after the officer who commanded the British fort constructed in 1759. The fort was constructed during the French and Indian War on the bluff above the river near a prehistoric earthwork mound that was also the site of historic Native American burial grounds.

In 1774, a force from the Colony of Virginia garrisoned and occupied the stockade during Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War against the Mingo and Shawnee peoples. It commanded the important strategic river ford of Nemacolin&#x27;s Trail, the western path to the summit; this was later improved and called &quot;Burd&#x27;s Road&quot;. It was an alternative route down to the Monongahela River valley from Braddock&#x27;s Road, which George Washington helped to build. Washington came to own vast portions of the lands on the west bank of the Monongahela; the Pennsylvania legislature named Washington County after him.
Entrepreneur Thomas Brown acquired the western lands in what became Fayette County, Pennsylvania, around the end of the American Revolution. He realized the opening of the pass through the Cumberland Narrows and the end of the war made the land at the western tip of Fayette County a natural springboard for settlers traveling to points west, such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio. Many travelers used the Ohio River and its tributary, the Monongahela. Eventually the settlement became known as &quot;Brownsville&quot; after him. In the 1780s, Jacob Bowman bought the land on which he built Nemacolin Castle; he had a trading post and provided services and supplies to emigrant settlers.

Redstone Old Fort is mentioned in C. M. Ewing&#x27;s &quot;The Causes of that so called Whiskey Insurrection of 1794&quot; (1930) as the site of a July 27, 1791, meeting in &quot;Opposition to the Whiskey Excise Tax,&quot; during the Whiskey Rebellion. It was the first meeting of that illegal frontier insurrection.

Brownsville was positioned at the western end of the primitive road network (Braddock&#x27;s Road to Burd&#x27;s Road via the Cumberland Narrows pass) that eventually became chartered as the Cumberland toll road, then the National Pike (the federal government&#x27;s first ever road project), and later present-day U.S. Route 40, one of the original federal highways.
As an embarkation point for travelers to the west, Redstone/Brownsville, blessed by several nearby wide and deep river tributaries that could support building slips, soon became a 19th-century center for the construction of riverine watercraft, initially keelboats and flatboats, but later steamboats large and small. The entire region sprouted small industries using local coal and iron deposits, selling iron fittings and products to outfitting settlers about to embark on the river. After 1845, its boats were used even by those intending to later take the Santa Fe Trail or Oregon Trail, as floating on a poleboat by river to St. Louis or other ports on the Mississippi River was generally safer, easier and far faster than overland travel of the time.

A large flatboat-building industry developed at Brownsville, exploiting the flats across the river in present-day West Brownsville to erect building slips. This was followed by its rapid entry into the building of steamboats: local craftsmen built the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 1814, the first steamboat powerful enough to travel down the Mississippi River to New Orleans and back. Earlier boats did not have enough power to go upstream against the river&#x27;s current. Brownsville developed as an early center of the steamboat-building industry in the 19th century. The Monongahela converges with the Ohio River at Pittsburgh and allowed for quick traveling to the western frontier. From 1811 to 1888, boatyards produced more than 3,000 steamboats. Steamboats were gradually supplanted in the passenger-carrying trade after the American Civil War as the construction of railroad networks surged, but concurrently grew important locally on the Ohio River and tributaries as tugs delivering bargeloads of minerals to the burgeoning steel industries growing up along the watershed from the 1850s. Steamboat propulsion would not be replaced by diesel-powered commercial tugs until the technology matured in the mid-20th century.

The first all–cast iron arch bridge constructed in the United States was built in Brownsville to carry the National Pike (at the time a wagon road) across Dunlap&#x27;s Creek. See Dunlap&#x27;s Creek Bridge. the bridge is still in use.

After the 1853 completion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to the Ohio, outfitting emigrant wagon trains in Brownsville declined in importance.
Yet the rise of the steel industry in the Pittsburgh area led Brownsville to develop as a railroad yard and coking center, generally integrated into other towns within the valley, so Brownsville and West Brownsville were tied to regional operations. While no one yard had space enough to be large, each township along the river shared resources and functioned as an elongated yard system. With its new role as railroad center and coking center together with the decline of outfitting, the town gradually lost its diverse mix of businesses, but, nonetheless, generally prospered during the early 20th century through the 1960s. Brownsville tightened its belt during the Great Depression, but the local economy resumed growth with the increased demand for steel during and after World War II, when many infrastructure projects improved and rerouted U.S. Route 40 over the new high-level Lane Bane Bridge, clearing up a perennial traffic congestion problem.
In 1940, 8,015 people lived in Brownsville. Its postwar growth led to the development of cross-county-line suburbs such as Malden, Lowhill, and Denbeau Heights (Denbow Heights), which were mainly bedroom communities within commuting distance. After the OPEC oil embargo of 1973–1974 triggered a recession, together with the restructuring of the steel industry and loss of industrial jobs, Brownsville suffered a severe decline, along with much of the Rust Belt. Generally, the region has declined in population and vitality ever since.
By 2000, the population was 2,804, as younger people had moved away to areas with more jobs. Brownsville has a handful of buildings that are condemned or boarded up. Abandoned buildings include the Union Station of the railroad, several banks, and other businesses. The sidewalks around the town are still intact and usable.

Brownsville attracted major entertainers in the early postwar years who also were performing in nearby Pittsburgh. According to Mike Evans in his book &quot;Ray Charles: The Birth of Soul&quot; (2007), the singer developed his hit &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; as part of an after-show jam in Brownsville in December 1958.

==Trivia==

In 2019, Brownsville served as the primary filming location for the coming-of-age comedy-drama web television series &quot;I Am Not Okay with This&quot;, which became available on Netflix in 2020.

==Geography==
Brownsville is located at (40.020026, −79.889536), situated on the east (convex) side of a broad sweeping westward bend in the northerly flowing Monongahela River on the northwestern edge of Fayette County. The river&#x27;s action eroded the steep-sided sandstone hills, creating shelf-like benches and connecting sloped terrain that gave the borough lowland areas adjacent to or otherwise accessible to the river shores. Much of the borough&#x27;s residential buildings are built above the elevation of the business district.

The opposite river shore of Washington County is, uncharacteristically for the region, shaped even lower to the water surface and is generally flatter. A small hamlet called West Brownsville developed on the western shore, with a current population of 992. Historically the area was a natural river crossing, and it was the site of development of a ferry, boat building and a bridge to carry roads. When the nascent United States government appropriated funds for its first road building project, in 1811 Brownsville was chosen as an early intermediate target destination along the new National Road. Until a bridge was built across the river, Brownsville was the western terminus.

Redstone Creek is a local tributary stream of the Monongahela River, entering just north of Brownsville. Its color came from the ferrous sandstone that lined its bed, as well as the sandstone heights near the Old Forts. The creek was wide enough for settlers to build, dock and outfit numerous flatboats, keelboats, and other river craft. Its builders made thousands of pole boats that moved the emigrants who settled the vast Northwest Territory. Later Brownsville industry built the first steamboats on the inland rivers, and many hundreds afterwards.

Colonists used the term &quot;Old Forts&quot; for the mounds and earthworks created by the prehistoric Mound Builders cultures. Archeologists and anthropologists have since determined that many prehistoric Native American cultures in North America along the Mississippi River and its tributaries built massive earthworks for ceremonial, burial and religious purposes over a period of thousands of years prior to European encounter. For instance, the Mississippian culture, reaching a peak about 1150 CE at Cahokia in present-day Illinois, had sites throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, and into the Southeast. Archaeological research is ongoing working to tie the local mounds and others regionally close to a particular era and culture.

==Features==
Dunlap&#x27;s Creek Bridge (1839) under part of the level stretch of Market Street, carrying old U.S. Route 40 over Dunlap&#x27;s Creek in Brownsville, is the nation&#x27;s oldest cast iron bridge in existence. (Capt. Richard Delafield, engineer; John Snowdon and John Herbertson, foundrymen)

The Flatiron Building (c. 1830), constructed as a business building in thriving 19th-century Brownsville, is one of the oldest, most intact iron commercial structures west of the Allegheny Mountains. Over its history, it has housed private commercial entities as well as public, such as a post office. It is the unofficial &quot;prototype&quot; for the flatiron buildings seen across the United States. The most notable is the Flatiron Building in Market Square in New York City.

After nearly being demolished, the building was saved by the Brownsville Area Revitalization Corporation (BARC). Throughout two decades, via private and public grants, BARC has restored the Flatiron Building as an historic asset to Brownsville. The Flatiron Building Heritage Center, located within the building at 69 Market Street, holds artifacts from Brownsville&#x27;s heyday, as well as displays about the community&#x27;s important coal and coke heritage. The Frank L. Melega Art Museum, located with the Heritage Center, displays many examples of this local southwestern Pennsylvanian&#x27;s famous artwork, depicting the coal and coke era in the surrounding tri-state region.

In addition to the Dunlap&#x27;s Creek Bridge, Brownsville is the location of other properties on the National Register of Historic Places. They are Bowman&#x27;s Castle (Nemacolin Castle), Brownsville Bridge, St. Peter&#x27;s Church, and Thomas H. Thompson House. There are two national historic districts: the Brownsville Commercial Historic District and Brownsville Northside Historic District.

==Education==
The Brownsville Area School District serves Brownsville as well as several nearby communities. Schools within the district are:

* Brownsville Area High School (9–12)
* Brownsville Area Middle School (6–8)
* Brownsville Area Elementary School (K–5)

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Brownsville is located on the banks of the Monongahela River, a major tributary of the Ohio River, one of North America&#x27;s most important waterways. The Monongahela is fully navigable at Brownsville, and offers inexpensive barge transportation to Chicago, New Orleans, St. Marks in Florida, Minneapolis, Tulsa, Kansas City, Houston, and Brownsville, Texas, on the border with Mexico. The shipyards of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, provided Captain Richard King of Brownsville, Texas (founder of the King Ranch), with powerful new-built riverboats to navigate the fast currents of the Rio Grande in 1849.

Brownsville is connected to the satellite community of West Brownsville (in Washington County) by the Brownsville Bridge completed in 1914, which spans the Monongahela River. In 1960, the Lane Bane Bridge was constructed just downstream, and path of U.S. Route 40 was moved to the new high-level structure and new four lane highway by-passing old Route 40 until the two merged in the small bedroom neighborhood known locally as Malden. In the heyday of Conestoga wagon migration travels and with the congestion of Brownsville&#x27;s hilly terrain, the flat lands about Malden just two-to-three further on offered rare open spaces for west-bound travelers to camp and recuperate from the rigorous mountain descent.
Before the highway construction of the late 1950s was completed in the early 60s, two additional branchlike housing concentrations existed, the lined either side of &quot;California Road&quot; which intersected Old U.S. 40 in the heart of the small business district at landmarks, Paci&#x27;s Restaurant and Cuppies Drive-In Theatre; the former set in a 17th-century stone Inn. The fourth concentration of housing extended from beside and beyond Cuppies Drive-In for over a mile either side of U.S. 40, now once again, single lane secondary highway. The community has few stores and several housing developments sited along a hilly plateau above the river valleys. The California Area High School is in part sited within parts of Malden.

<text>Connellsville is a city in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States, southeast of Pittsburgh and away via the Youghiogheny River, a tributary of the Monongahela River. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 7,031 at the 2020 census.
== History ==
During the French and Indian War, a British army commanded by General Edward Braddock approached Fort Duquesne and crossed the Youghiogheny River at Stewart&#x27;s Crossing, which is situated in the middle of what is now the city of Connellsville.

Connellsville was officially founded as a township in 1793 then as a borough on March 1, 1806, by Zachariah Connell, a militia captain during the American Revolution. In February 1909, balloting in New Haven and Connellsville resulted in these two boroughs joining and becoming the first city in Fayette County on May 12, 1911.

Due to the city&#x27;s location in the center of the Connellsville Coalfield, coal mining, coke production, and other accompanying industries became the major sources of employment and revenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Connellsville became known as the &quot;Coke Capital of the World&quot; due to the amount and quality of coke produced in the area&#x27;s many beehive ovens.

In August of 2016, the city was hit with a major rainstorm that flooded the local community known as Dutch Bottom, along with several other areas. The city received help from neighboring communities and FEMA. The city recovered after nearly 2 years, and most of the affected area in Dutch Bottom is no longer habitable due to terms of agreements with FEMA and others to buy out the affected area.

==Parks and trails==
The Youghiogheny River Trail, a part of the Great Allegheny Passage, runs through Connellsville. The trail provides a significant portion of the town&#x27;s income and has provided a recent resurgence to the town, the likes of which have not been seen since Connellsville was known as the &quot;Coke Capital of the World&quot;. In 2023, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro chose to use Connellsville as the backdrop for his launch of the state&#x27;s new &quot;Office of Outdoor Recreation&quot;.

East Park was created by the Works Progress Administration. Laborers transformed what had been a city garbage dump along Connell Run, near Wills Road, into East Park. The park was dedicated on October 12, 1940. Its location in a hollow contributes to many unique features, which include an underground entrance tunnel along Connell Run, a castle lookout up above, a large outside stage bandshell, many stone walls and pillars, and a waterfall at one end.

==Transportation==


===Railroads===
Connellsville has the distinction of having been served at one time by five railroads: the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Western Maryland Railroad, the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Norfolk and Western Railroad.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX Transportation) entered Connellsville on the right (east) side of the Youghiogheny River. This main line originated in Baltimore, passed through Cumberland, Maryland heading west followed the river to Pittsburgh, then continuing on to Chicago.

The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Southwest branch from Greensburg entered Connellsville from Connellsville Township, crossing Route 119 and the North End, then crossing the Youghiogheny on a trestle in the middle of the town; this line terminated in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The line has been abandoned, and the trestle was demolished in the late 1980s. It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed. This line is now operated by the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad.

The Western Maryland Railroad&#x27;s line crossed the Alleghenies from Cumberland and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny River, connecting with two separate railroad companies. The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad&#x27;s line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh. This was in direct competition with the B &amp; O directly across the river. The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western Railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia railroad bridge.

The Norfolk &amp; Western branch was acquired by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, which built a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX, which severed the old line across the bridge. This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition. Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the right of way acquired for other uses. The former Western Maryland Railroad and Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie lines are now the part of the Youghiogheny River Trail.

Amtrak&#x27;s provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and other points in between.

===West Penn Railways===
Historically, the mining and steel working Connellsville-Greensburg-Scottdale-Jeannette-Mt Pleasant-Irwin-Latrobe area was served by a 339-mile interurban trolley system, the wide track gauge West Penn Railways. It operated until 1952. Before the better economy of the area plus improved roads allowed more ownership and use of automobiles, the run every hour 5 cents a ride bright orange West Penn trolleys provided reliable local transportation.

===Transit center===
The Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation transit center hub is located at the Connellsville Airport in Lemont Furnace, about halfway between Fayette&#x27;s two largest urban centers, Connellsville and Uniontown. 

===Roads===
The main route through Connellsville is U.S. Route 119, which links Connellsville with nearby cities Uniontown and Greensburg, and provides access to many of the business on the outskirts of the city. Pennsylvania Route 201 ends in Connellsville, and PA 711 serves as the main street through downtown before heading into the local mountains.

==History==
The land where Dawson was developed had belonged to John Smilie, who held multiple public offices in the government of Pennsylvania and was a member of Congress when he died in December 1812. The property remained in a trust as a part of Smilie&#x27;s estate, until his last child died in 1851, when the property was sold.

The &quot;bottom land&quot; where Dawson is situated was acquired by John Smilie&#x27;s granddaughter, Sarah Huston Dawson, and her second husband, George Dawson.

The Smilie farm, except the river bottom, was sold to Stewart Strickler. The bottom land was sold to George Dawson, who used it for purposes of cultivation. The Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad was located through the tract, and upon the opening of the line Dawson&#x27;s Station was established at this point. A post office was established at the same time.

The property passed, in the division of the Dawson estate, to Mrs. Alfred [Elizabeth Dawson] Howell, and in 1866 a town plat was laid out and surveyed by Martin Dickson for Mr. Howell.

Alfred Howell arranged for the tract to be duly surveyed and laid out into building lots, and so conducted his enterprise as in the course of a few years to erect a prosperous and desirable village, with churches, public schools, etc., upon what was before, and but for his business foresight and energy would have remained, merely an uninhabitable portion of an old farm.

<text>Ohiopyle is a borough in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 38 at the 2020 census. While Ohiopyle has a tiny year-round population, it is often filled with tourists on the weekend, who come for the outdoor recreation opportunities at the surrounding Ohiopyle State Park, as well as the Great Allegheny Passage bicycle trail which connects with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath trail to form a continuous 335-mile off-road trail from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. The borough of Ohiopyle is served by the Uniontown Area School District.

==History==

===Native Americans===
The first known group of people to inhabit the Ohiopyle area were the Monongahela, a clan of the Mound Builders. These Native Americans disappeared from the scene just as European colonists were beginning to arrive in North America. As the east coast was settled, the Native Americans who lived closer to the Atlantic Ocean were exterminated or forced to flee to the west. Various tribes inhabited the Ohiopyle area at this time, preceding their ultimate removal following the French and Indian War. One of the few remnants of American Indian culture that can be found in the area is in the name. &quot;Ohiopyle&quot; is derived from the Lenape phrase &quot;&quot; which means &#x27;it turns very white&#x27;, referring to the frothy waterfalls.

===French and Indian War===
The colonial powers of New France and the British Thirteen Colonies fought for control of the trading routes in the Ohio River Valley in what was at the time the northwestern frontier of America. The French were the first to explore the upper reaches of the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. They built several forts in what is now western Pennsylvania, including Fort Duquesne in what is now Pittsburgh. Fort Duquesne was built on the remains of Fort Prince George which the French had seized from the British. George Washington was sent by the colonial governor of Virginia to try to retake the all-important fort at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. He was on two expeditions that passed through the Ohiopyle area. Washington tried to use the Youghiogheny River as a means to reach Fort Duquesne quickly, but was forced to abandon the river passage by the waterfalls in the Ohiopyle area. Still Washington pressed on to the Pittsburgh area. His troops encountered and routed a small party of French soldiers in the Battle of Jumonville Glen. One of these soldiers escaped to Fort Duquesne. Washington was forced to quickly build a fort to prepare for the oncoming French attack. Fort Necessity is just to the southwest of Ohiopyle State Park. The colonial forces of Washington were overwhelmed by the French and their Indian allies in the Battle of the Great Meadows at Fort Necessity. These battles are considered the opening shots of the French and Indian War which would spread to the Old World and become the Seven Years&#x27; War. The loss at Fort Necessity marked Washington&#x27;s only military surrender. The British ultimately won the French and Indian war and the French were forced to leave western Pennsylvania.

===Pennsylvania or Virginia?===
In 1763 King George III declared the area an Indian reserve and required all European settlers to leave. The settlers refused to leave, and King George bought the land from the Iroquois in 1768. The land was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. The dispute of the territory lasted through the American Revolution and was not resolved until 1784.

===Whiskey Rebellion===
The Whiskey Rebellion was a major test for the new government of the United States following the Revolution. The citizens of western Pennsylvania, mostly near Washington, Pennsylvania, were not pleased with the excise tax on liquor and distilled drinks. This tax had been proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, passed by Congress, and signed into law by President Washington in 1791. The tensions of the whiskey tax intensified over the next three years and in 1794 there was a state of insurrection in the area. Thirteen thousand militiamen under the direct command of George Washington were sent to put down the insurrection. They passed through the Ohiopyle area on their way to arrest the rebels. The rebels &quot;could never be found,&quot; according to Thomas Jefferson, but the militia rounded up twenty prisoners, clearly demonstrating Federal authority in the national government. The men were imprisoned, where one died, while two were convicted of treason and sentenced to death by hanging. Washington, however, pardoned them on the grounds that one was a &quot;simpleton&quot; and the other &quot;insane.&quot; The military suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion set a precedent that U.S. citizens who wished to change the law had to do so peacefully through constitutional means; otherwise, the government would meet any threats to disturb the peace with force.

===Lumbering and tourism===
The earliest settlers to the Ohiopyle area were farmers, trappers and hunters. The population of the area expanded after the building of the National Road in 1811. This road that passed near Ohiopyle increased the accessibility of the area and connected it to eastern markets. Lumbering became the dominant industry. Cooperages, tanneries, salt mining and coal mining were some of the smaller industries in the area.

The construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Western Maryland Railroad greatly accelerated the progress of the lumbering operations in Ohiopyle. Both railroads had stations in the borough. Several narrow gauge railroads were built up into the surrounding mountains. These smaller railways were able to efficiently transport lumber to the sawmills and rail stations of Ohiopyle.

The railroads also brought tourists to Ohiopyle. The round trip ride from Pittsburgh to Ohiopyle was one dollar. Tourists flocked to the area to see the waterfalls and stay at the resorts that quickly sprouted up along the Youghiogheny River. The resorts had boardwalks, dancing pavilions, bowling alleys, fountains, tennis courts, and hiking trails. The rise of the automobile brought about the end of the resorts at Ohiopyle. The buildings were torn down and the forests were allowed to regrow.

In 1963, Ohiopyle entered the current chapter of tourism. Wilderness Voyageurs, under the ownership of Lance Martin, began commercial whitewater rafting on the Youghiogheny River. This was the first commercial whitewater rafting company east of the Mississippi River. In 1963, 400 people experienced the rapids of the Lower Youghiogheny, in 2007 over 100,000 people came to &quot;shoot the rapids&quot; in rafts, kayaks, and canoes. Ohiopyle is also near Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s masterpiece, Fallingwater, built in 1936, and this nearby attraction brings tourists through the town.

<text>Perryopolis is a borough in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 1,705 at the 2020 census.

==History==
George Washington purchased here when land first became available. He visited in 1770 and said, &quot;as fine a land as I have ever seen, a great deal of rich meadow; it is well watered and has a valuable mill seat.&quot; The mill would eventually be completed in 1776. Once the mill was finished, it encouraged other business to come to the area to support and augment the business of the mill.

Washington hoped to develop the remainder of Perryopolis, drawing up plans for the streets to be laid out in the shape of a wagon-wheel. Washington&#x27;s estate sold the land after his death; in 1814 Perryopolis, previously known as &quot;New Boston&quot;, was officially laid out using Washington&#x27;s plans and named for Oliver Hazard Perry for his victory on Lake Erie during the War of 1812.

In the late 19th century, the area around Perryopolis was first mined for coal. Until the 1950s, coal industries would be the area&#x27;s primary economic activity, served by the Washington Run branch of the P&amp;LE Railroad that continued on to Star Junction. However, Perryopolis developed differently from other nearby mining towns. Instead of housing laborers, Perryopolis was mainly inhabited by foremen and white collar workers who were associated with the mining industry.

The Karolcik Building, St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic Church, Searight&#x27;s Fulling Mill, and Youghiogheny Bank of Pennsylvania are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Perryopolis is located in northern Fayette County at (40.085969, -79.752088). Pennsylvania Route 51 passes through the west side of the borough, leading north to Pittsburgh and south to Uniontown.

<text>Point Marion is a borough in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States, and is located less than one mile north of West Virginia at the confluence of the Monongahela and Cheat rivers. Approximately three miles north of Point Marion is Friendship Hill National Historic Site, home of early American politician Albert Gallatin. Point Marion was settled in the mid-18th century and named in 1842 for its geographic location and Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;. The population was 1,152 at the 2020 census, a decline from the figure of 1,159 tabulated in 2010. It is served by the Albert Gallatin Area School District.

==History==

EARLY HISTORY

The region’s original inhabitants from AD 1050 to 1635 were the Iroquoian related Monongahela Culture tribes. Two archeological sites from these tribes exist locally today: 1) several miles to the south of Point Marion in Morgantown, WV, and 2) two miles to the north at Dunkard Creek. This Aboriginal culture, which peaked about AD 1300 and dominated all of southwestern Pennsylvania, disappeared by the 1630s.

But a short time later, by the mid 1600s, the Iroquois related Shawnee tribe from what would later become upstate New York began expanding westward and southward into western Pennsylvania and the Ohio River valley regions. This included what would later be Point Marion and Fayette County, but which would be known at that time as the &quot;Hunting Grounds&quot; of the Iroquois Confederation.

1700s

European Settlement

The first Europeans arrived at what would become Point Marion in 1723 when Jacques Cheathe, a Quebec native of French Huguenot origin, reached an agreement with the local Natives to trap, fish, and hunt there. In 1724 he established a trading post near the point and became the first settler to live there.

In 1751 a mix of English and German settlers started moving in, and after the French and Indian War, France relinquished its claim of the region to Great Britain in 1763. As more American colonial settlers then began to move into this frontier area, a Colonel George Wilson was granted 108 acres where the French trading post once stood.

The English surveyors Mason and Dixon were charged with surveying the southern border of Pennsylvania. Beginning south of Philadelphia, they worked their way westward over mountainous virgin forest, setting engraved limestone markers imported from England along the way. In doing so, they crossed the Cheat River and then the Monongahela River less than one mile south of Point Marion in October 1767 and concluded their survey soon afterwards about twelve miles west of the Monongahela River.

Once the British pushed out the French in 1763, the future Point Marion region became part of Monongalia County, Virginia. But after the American Revolutionary War, Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed in 1773 to abide by the recent Mason-Dixon line survey, and it became part of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Finally, in 1783, Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County, where Point Marion remains today.

An example of the future Point Marion region’s early frontier settlement is the Forks of Cheat Baptist Church, founded two miles south of the point with twelve members (reflecting multiple families) by Reverend John Corbly of Ireland on November 7, 1775. The original log-built structure was burned down during a Native American raid in the late 1700s but was rebuilt in 1803. Now sitting on the present-day West Virginia side of the state line, the church’s name refers to the fork the Cheat and Monongahela rivers, in other words, the point of modern-day Point Marion. Notably, this is the oldest still active church west of the Allegheny Mountains, and each July members celebrate this fact by flying the British Union Jack flag to celebrate its colonial era founding. As for Reverend Corbly, in 1882 his wife and children were massacred across the river in neighboring Greene County by Indians, a reflection of western Pennsylvania frontier life at that time.

George Washington’s Visit

In 1784, General George Washington (who later became U.S. President in 1789) visited the point. Washington passed through the area while going to inspect land in Washington County PA he had been granted many years earlier by the British as reward for his efforts in helping to expel the French in the 1750s. On September 24th, 1784, Washington recorded in his journal: &quot;Crossed in Cheat at the mouth as it was too much swelled up to attempt to ford a little higher up. This Cheat, at the mouth, is about 125 yards wide. The Monongahela is nearly double that. The color of the Cheat is dark, the other is clear.&quot; Those who know Point Marion today can attest to the distinct separation of the river waters where they meet at the point and that the Cheat is still dark, which would seem to confirm that George Washington himself indeed walked the ground of the future Point Marion. Of course, at that time the town did not yet exist, but Pennsylvania had officially designated the Monongahela River as a public highway, and boats and ferries moved up and down the river. And at the point during Washington’s time, travelers could stop at Morgan’s Tavern, established by Morgantown, Virginia (now West Virginia) founder Zackquill Morgan.

In 1788, and only four years after George Washington’s visit to the area, Swiss immigrant Albert Gallatin (future United States Secretary of Treasury under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison) purchased land only four miles downstream and built a country estate that would become known as Friendship Hill. One of his friends who later visited him there was General Lafayette, , for whom Fayette County is named. The property is now maintained as a national historic site by the National Park Service, while Gallatin’s name lives on in the area through the Albert Gallatin Area School District.

1800s

In 1801, the family of the aforementioned Colonel George Wilson sold the land at the point to a Jacob Sadler. Eventually, the land was subdivided into lots, and on March 15, 1842, it was auctioned to the public. As part of this sale, the first lot purchaser was permitted to choose the future town’s name, and thus for $100, a Seth Stafford chose to name it after the Revolutionary War hero General Francis Marion, who&#x27;s biography was popular at that time. Finally in 1844, the town of Point Marion was officially founded as a &quot;Borough&quot;.

In 1847, ferry service between Greene County and Fayette County and adjacent to Point Marion was started by Ambrose Dillinger, which his family continued to operate it until 1931 (due to bridges it only then became obsolete).

Since Point Marion’s founding, the state of Virginia lay just one mile to the south, but as a result of the Civil War, it became West Virginia in 1863. By 1867, Point Marion was growing, and had eleven dwellings and one store. During this period, the chief industry was lumber. Logging was conducted upstream along the Cheat River, and the logs were floated down to Point Marion, where they were milled and processed into various products, before being sent downstream for sale. The Monongahela River was still the most important method to transport goods, and locks were gradually built along the river.

In 1879, the Point Marion lock was built, which was a major event, as it made the town accessible by river year-round. As a result of improved river travel as well as railroad access not long afterward, between the 1890s and the start of the Great Depression, Point Marion became a summer destination for some of Pittsburgh’s well-off residents, and in response, several hotels, and restaurants as well as a park were constructed. Paddlewheel steamboats and showboats with entertainment from Pittsburgh became a regular event.

In 1890, the McClain brothers founded a sand and gravel business, initially to supply needed materials for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The business expanded from there and operated for many decades, with barges, dredges, and a company steamboat plying the two rivers around the point.

1900s

In 1900, a commercial building boom began, which created a town core. And in 1907, Penn Street was laid with bricks, making it the first paved street. Newly arrived Italian immigrants dominated this construction. However, a massive fire in 1922 destroyed half of the town buildings, and they had to be rebuilt. The glass industry also commenced in Point Marion in 1900, and soon six different companies operated small plants. Many of their workers were Belgian trained hand-blown glass artisans, and these French speaking immigrants from Belgium’s Walloon Region founded Saint Hubert’s Catholic Church in 1909 (rebuilt in 2005), honoring the popular seventh century Saint Hubert, who is buried back in their local region of Belgium. These two new ethnic groups, (French speaking) Belgians and (South) Italians, brought Catholicism to Point Marion for the first time, and added to the diversity of the town&#x27;s long-time ethnic British (English, Scots-Irish, Welsh) and German descended Protestant inhabitants.

Then, in 1923, Leon Houze, who had arrived from Belgium, consolidated three of the companies into the Houze Convex Glass Company.  This became Point Marion’s largest employer for over one hundred years, until closing in 2004. But during its heyday, it was an important specialty glass manufacturer in the United States, and in the 1950s their hand-blown windows were even installed in the White House. Woolworths sold specialty lamps nationwide which came from Houze Glass. When President Nixon visited China, he took glass trays made at Houze Glass. And President Gerald Ford had ashtrays on Air Force One that were hand crafted at Houze Glass.

In 1909 Cheat River Bridge was inaugurated on July 5th. This was the first bridge to be built into Point Marion and was significant to the development of the region. In 1910, planning began for the Lake Lynn Dam and Power Station just upstream on the Cheat River at the state line. WWI caused it to be halted, but it recommenced in 1925, Cheat Lake was created, and the power station began operation in 1926. The dam itself is 1,000 feet long and 125 feet high.

Also in 1926, a new and advanced Point Marion Lock and Dam was opened on the Monongahela River, which operates to this day.

In 1930 Albert Gallatin Memorial Bridge was built. Designed in Kansas City and constructed with Pittsburgh steel, it enabled direct access to Greene County and resulting in development between the two counties and their peoples. Previously, ferries were used.

In 1937 and in what was considered eventful, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s train passed through Point Marion.

In 1967, the Fort Martin Power Plant commenced operation on the Monongahela River just across the state line. While providing jobs, the power plant also altered the landscape. It also increased the number of tugboats with barges of coal seen on the river, headed to the power plant.

21st CENTURY

Today, as in the past, Point Marion straddles two states and two regions: Fayette County and Pennsylvania, of which it is a part, and Morgantown, West Virginia, of which it is adjacent to, and to which it remains deeply connected. Indeed, as Morgantown housing has become more expensive, Point Marion has to a small degree become a ‘bedroom community’ for some residents.

Within the early years of this century, both bridges that were built in the early 20th Century were replaced.

The former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad that once ran through Point Marion was repurposed in 2008 by Fayette County via Federal Funds into what’s known as the Sheepskin Trail.

In 2011 the $2.2 billion Longview Power Plant began operation just across the state line, which further changed the local landscape and skyline.

In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase of previously not seen wildlife such as bald eagles, Canada geese, wild turkeys, coyotes, and black bears. Both Canada geese and bald eagles now live year-round along the Cheat River. Small flocks of wild turkeys can be seen roaming the hillsides. Eastern coyotes, which began migrating into Pennsylvania in the 1960s, are occasionally sighted and more often heard in the Point Marion valley. And black bears have been sighted multiple times, from Walnut Street to Stewartstown Road to the ballpark.

Like many small towns in the region, Point Marion is quieter than in past decades, with fewer local businesses. However, the Boat Launch at the town park continues to draw recreational boaters and fishermen from both Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Also, town church events, events such as the annual car show, and the especially the annual ‘Albert Gallatin Regatta’ held on the river, along with a parade and fireworks, help keep the community connected.

<doc id="132554" wikidata="Q7406155" url="?curid=132554" title="Saltlick Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Saltlick Township is a township that is located in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,042 according to the 2020 census, a decline of twelve percent from the 2010 census, and eighteen percent from the 2000 census. It is served by the Connellsville Area School District.

Indian Head, Millertown, Champion, Maple Grove, White, Clinton, and Melcroft are unincorporated communities in the township.

== History ==

According to historian Franklin Ellis, the first settlers arrived in what is now Saltlick Township around the time of the American Revolution, with a few possibly arriving earlier. At that time, the area was heavily timbered.

The township was originally part of Bullskin Township until the two were separated, and Saltlick (or Salt Lick, as Ellis refers to it) Township created, in 1797. The name referred to numerous salt licks along Indian Creek.

==Geography==
Saltlick Township occupies the northeastern corner of Fayette County, with Westmoreland County to the north and Somerset County to the east. Pennsylvania Routes 381 and 711 cross the center of the township, following the Indian Creek valley. The western side of the township sits on the crest of Chestnut Ridge, while the eastern side is on the parallel and higher Laurel Hill.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.01%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the decennial census of 2020, there were 3,037 people in the township, of which 97% were White, none were Black and 0.4 were Hispanic or Latino alone. There were 1,597 housing units, of which 79% were occupied.

In 2019, nearly two-thirds of the children in Saltlick Township were living in poverty, according to the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;. 
== Industry ==
Agriculture was the major industry in the township&#x27;s early days. Farmers mined coal on their own land for local use. The first industrial building was probably a mill, erected by Christian Perkey around 1780. The first store was probably that of Andrew Trapp, which may have been in operation as early as 1799. Over the next several decades, a number of sawmills and small distilleries were established.

Robindale Energy&#x27;s Rustic Ridge No. 1 Mine extracts coal beneath Saltlick Township and neighboring Donegal Township under a five-year permit granted in 2016. The underground deep mine employed about 100 people as of January 2022. Attempts to extend the permit and expand operations in 2022 met with controversy.

==History==
&quot;The name &quot;Springhill&quot; was given by Col. George Wilson, the earliest settler on Georges Creek (at its mouth, in what is now Nicholson township), who had come here from Springhill, in Augusta [County], Va., and had given that name to the new region in which he settled. That was while all the Monongahela country was included in Cumberland County; and the &quot;old&quot; Springhill township of that county embraced an immense territory, covering all the southern part of what is now Fayette, all of Greene, and the south part of the present county of Washington.&quot;

Spring Hill Township was formed in 1771 when the area was part of Bedford County. It contained all of what is now Greene County, part of Washington County and nearly all of Fayette County.

When Westmoreland County was formed from Bedford County in 1773 Springhill Township was one of its eight original townships.

Springhill Township was one of the original townships of Fayette County, having been erected by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the county at the first term, held in December 1783.

<text>Uniontown is the largest city in and the county seat of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States, southeast of Pittsburgh. The population was 9,984 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==

 southeast of Uniontown is Fort Necessity, built by George Washington during the French and Indian War (part of the international Seven Years&#x27; War) as well as the site of the Battle of Jumonville Glen, where the North American branch of the war began.

Uniontown lies within the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains at an elevation of 999 feet (304 meters) above sea level. The city rests at the base of Chestnut Ridge, the westernmost ridge of the Appalachian Mountains.

Founded in 1776, Uniontown was known as &quot;the Town of Union&quot; by Henry Beeson, a Quaker born in Virginia in 1743 who had settled in the area in 1768, buying tracts of land and running a sawmill. On July 4 (coincidentally, the same day the United States Declaration of Independence was adopted), Beeson published a plat of quarter-acre plots near his mill to be allocated by lottery on July 20 to purchasers prepared to build houses on them.

In early years, the town was sometimes unofficially called &quot;Beesonstown&quot;, though not by Beeson. In 1783, Fayette County was erected and divided into townships, of which Union Township contained the namesake town. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1796 under the name Uniontown and separated from Union Township, which was split in 1851 into the North Union and South Union townships.

The National Road, also known as the Cumberland Road, was routed through Uniontown in the early 19th century, and the town grew along with the road (now US 40). Uniontown&#x27;s role in the Underground Railroad in the antebellum years is commemorated by a marker on the corner of East Main Street and Baker Alley. Residents helped slaves escaping from the South to freedom.

In the late nineteenth century, the town grew based on the development of coal mines and the steel industry. Uniontown was the site of violent clashes between striking coal miners and guards at the local coke works during the bituminous coal miners&#x27; strike of 1894. Fifteen guards armed with carbines and machine guns held off an attack by 1,500 strikers, killing five and wounding eight.

The Columbia Rolling Mill, an iron and steel works, was located in Uniontown from 1887 to 1895. The mill was the town&#x27;s top industry at that time. During the Coal Boom of the early part of the 20th century, Uniontown was home to at least 13 millionaires, the most (per capita) of any city in the United States. &quot;Coal barons&quot; and Carl Laemmle, the president of Universal Films, sponsored the famous Uniontown Speedway board track from 1916 to 1922. It was a mile and a quarter raceway.

As with most of Western Pennsylvania, Uniontown&#x27;s economy waned during the region&#x27;s deindustrialization of the late 20th century, when the steel industry restructured and many jobs went elsewhere, including offshore. This decline continued into the 21st century, and the population is about half its peak of 1940.

The only United States Navy ship named for the city was , a renamed from &quot;Chattanooga&quot; on August 16, 1944.

In 1967, Uniontown was the birthplace of the McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac sandwich. In 2007, the Big Mac Museum was opened in North Huntingdon Township in Westmoreland County, to the disappointment of some Uniontown residents. According to a McDonald&#x27;s spokesperson, the decision was based on logistics and access, but Uniontown residents complained in an article that was published in &quot;The Herald-Standard.&quot;

The Uniontown Downtown Historic District, Gallatin School, John S. Douglas House, John P. Conn House, and Adam Clarke Nutt Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city is above sea level and rests at the base of Chestnut Ridge, the westernmost ridge of the Appalachian Mountains to the east. The National Pike or Cumberland Road crossed over the mountains and passed through the area which became the center of Uniontown.

<text>Washington Township is a township in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,899 at the 2020 census, down from 3,902 at the 2010 census.

Arnold City, Fairhope, Lynnwood, Gillespie, Naomi and Brownstown are communities in the township.

==History==
A significant part of the prehistory of Washington Township is the Locus 7 Site, located north of Fayette City, where it is believed that members of the Monongahela tribe may have lived as far back as AD 600. 
Washington Township is an original Fayette County township, created from Rostraver Township when Fayette County was erected from Westmoreland County in 1783. It originally included Perry and Jefferson townships.

Washington Township&#x27;s most prominent historical figure is Colonel Edward Cook. Settling in what was then Westmoreland County, he was granted and first built a small log cabin and a small store. In 1772, he began building his home (still standing today), the first stone building west of the Allegheny Mountains. Built entirely out of limestone from his property, it was finished in 1776.

Colonel Cook was among General Washington&#x27;s personal friends and on two occasions at least entertained Washington in the old stone mansion. A local legend claims that on one of the occasions, Washington was journeying that way to visit his lands in Washington County and stopped at Col. Cook&#x27;s for a brief rest. Cook was at that time engaged in reviewing a body of militia nearby and knew nothing of the arrival of his distinguished guest. Word of the arrival was whispered to the men before it reached the colonel, and when he observing the commotion learned what was in the wind, he relaxed all discipline and set off unceremoniously for the house. The militiamen followed at the double-quick and hurrahing enthusiastically for General Washington brought him to the porch and evoked from him in reply a good natured and fatherly speech which the soldiers cheered to the echo. There is no documented evidence, however, that this event occurred.

After 1770, Washington visited southwestern Pennsylvania one last time, in September 1784. Washington kept an account of the journey that provides details of where he stopped each day, who he met with and what they talked about, in addition to specifically where he went, what he saw, and did. Each and every stop along the way is mentioned. In one passage he mentions traveling through or across Cook&#x27;s land, but he makes no mention of stopping to talk to Cook or that he even saw him at any time during the 1784 journey. The second mention of Cook, later in his diary, mentions Cook had a large house, and again, nothing about stopping there, speaking to Cook, or there being a militia group present at any time during his time in SW Pennsylvania. Cook and Washington may have known each other however they shared very different viewpoints about the Virginia-Pennsylvania rivalry and counter claims over whether the region belonged to Virginia or Pennsylvania, and would have been rivals in the land acquisition and speculation business.

Cook was a member of the Provincial Congress convened in Carpenter&#x27;s Hall, Philadelphia, June 18, 1776, that drafted the first declaration of independence presented to Congress, June 25, 1776 (see &quot;Journal of Congress, vol. ii, p. 230); was a member of the State Constitutional Convention that convened September 28, 1776; and was the first commissioner of exchange and appointed sub-lieutenant of Westmoreland County, March 21, 1777.

On January 5, 1782, he was appointed lieutenant of Westmoreland County to succeed Col. Archibald Lochry, who had been captured and killed while on an Indian expedition. This office gave him command of the militia of the county and the management of its military fiscal affairs. It was from this appointment that Col. Cook received his military title.

He aided in fixing the boundaries of Fayette County and was a member of the commission that located the county seat. On November 21, 1786, he was appointed justice of the peace with a jurisdiction that reached into Washington County. On April 8, 1789, he was appointed president of the Court of Common Pleas and Quarter Session. He was associate judge of Fayette County in 1791, and from 1796 to 1798 treasurer of Westmoreland County.

He was conspicuous in the Whiskey Insurrection and having been prominent in some of the meetings of the insurgents, his arrest was ordered. Before any action could be taken, however, he appeared on November 6, 1794, before Thomas McKean, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and in the presence of William Bradford, Attorney General of the United States, voluntarily entered into recognizance to the United States for his appearance before the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States at the next special session of the Circuit Court held for the district of Pennsylvania &quot;then and there to answer such charges of treasonable and seditious practices and such other matters of misdemeanor as shall be alleged against him in behalf of the United States and that he will not depart that court without license.&quot;

Having taken this bold and honorable course, he quietly awaited the result which was simply that nothing was found against him and he was not molested in person but some cavalrymen belonging to the army that came out to quell the insurrection visited his home and did considerable damage, nearly demolishing his distillery, knocking in the heads of liquor casks and spilling a vast amount of whiskey.

The Col. Edward Cook House and the Locus 7 Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Howe Township is a township in Forest County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 201 at the 2020 census, down from 405 in 2010.

==Geography==
The township occupies the northeastern corner of Forest County. It is bordered to the north by Warren County, to the east by Elk County, and at its northeast corner by McKean County. Tionesta Creek, a westward-flowing tributary of the Allegheny River, crosses the northern part of the township. Pennsylvania Route 666 follows the creek through the township, passing the unincorporated communities of Mayburg, Balltown, Porkey, Minister, Truemans, and Lynch. Pennsylvania Route 948 crosses the northeastern corner of the township, following the South Branch of Tionesta Creek and passing through the unincorporated community of Brookston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land.

==Population==

Howe Township houses the Cornell Abraxas juvenile detention facility, a 274-bed long-term correctional institution for substance abusers. Because the residents of this facility are counted as Howe Township residents by the U.S. Census Bureau, most statistics about the township are heavily skewed and not representative of the non-institutionalized population. Of the 405 people in the township at the 2010 census, 227 were between the ages of 15 and 19.

Thus, Howe Township variously arises on lists that rank Pennsylvania&#x27;s municipalities by characteristics (income, demographics, etc.) as the &quot;most&quot; or &quot;least&quot; in a category. For instance, according to raw census data, Howe Township is both the state&#x27;s poorest municipality when judged by per capita income and one of the youngest, with a median age of 18.6.

==Sherman Lighthouse==

The Sherman Memorial Lighthouse, located on a 22.5-acre island in the Allegheny River, about 60 miles southeast of Erie. It opened in time to help the Forest County community of Tionesta celebrate its 150th birthday. The 75-foot-tall lighthouse is on a 25-foot-high mound of soil on what used to be called Hunters Island, and has now been renamed Lighthouse Island.

It ultimately will share the island with the planned Pennsylvania Hunting and Fishing Museum. Most lighthouses are more functional than decorative inside, but Sherman Lighthouse is different. It is finished and decorated as a showcase for the Sherman family memorabilia and to display a collection of more than 280 lighthouse replicas.

The octagon-shaped tower is made of timber instead of masonry or concrete. The 25-foot-tall aluminum and glass lantern room is equipped with the kind of beacon that a small regional airport would use. There are 76 steps in the spiral stairs that lead up the tower.

==Notable people==
Tionesta was the childhood home of Howard Zahniser, who became a conservationist and eventually the executive director of The Wilderness Society in Washington, D.C., and in that capacity wrote the Wilderness Act of 1964, which today permanently preserves from all forms of development more than 111 million acres of federal public lands all across America. Zahniser graduated from Tionesta High School in 1924, and in August 2001 a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission roadside marker was installed along U.S. Route 62 just north of Tionesta along the Allegheny River near the Allegheny Islands Wilderness honoring Zahniser, his deep-rooted connection to Tionesta, and his life work for wilderness.

Tionesta was the hometown of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient O. O. Spence, killed during the Indian Campaign in 1876.

<text>Chambersburg is a borough in and the county seat of Franklin County, in the South Central region of Pennsylvania, United States. It is in the Cumberland Valley, which is part of the Great Appalachian Valley, and north of Maryland and the Mason-Dixon line and southwest of Harrisburg, the state capital. According to the United States Census Bureau, Chambersburg&#x27;s 2020 population was 21,903. When combined with the surrounding Greene, Hamilton, and Guilford Townships, the population of Greater Chambersburg is 66,340 people. The Chambersburg, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area includes surrounding Franklin County, and in 2010 included 149,618 people.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, Chambersburg Borough is the thirteenth-largest municipality in Pennsylvania and the largest borough as measured by fiscal size as of 2016. Chambersburg Borough is organized under the Pennsylvania Borough Code and is not a home-rule municipality.

Chambersburg&#x27;s settlement began in 1730, when water mills were built at Conococheague Creek and Falling Spring Creek. The town developed on both sides of these creeks. Its history includes episodes relating to the French and Indian War, the Whiskey Rebellion, John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, and the Civil War. The borough was the only major northern community burned down by Confederate forces during the war. Residents charged the Confederates with war crimes.

Chambersburg is served by the Lincoln Highway, U.S. 30, between McConnellsburg and Gettysburg. U.S. 11, the Molly Pitcher Highway, passes through it between Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, and Hagerstown, Maryland. Interstate 81 skirts the borough to its east. The town lies approximately midpoint on US Route 30 between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The local topography reflects both flatter areas like Philadelphia and mountainous areas like Pittsburgh. Downtown Chambersburg has occasional events such as Food Truck Festival and Apple Fest.

== History ==
=== European settlement ===
Native Americans living or hunting in the area during the 18th century included the six Iroquois tribes of a confederacy known as the Iroquois League or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, the Lenape, and the Shawnee. The Lenape lived mostly to the east, with the Iroquois to the north, and the Shawnee to the south. Their traders, hunters, and warriors traveled on the north-south route sometimes called the &quot;Virginia path&quot; through the Cumberland Valley, from New York through what became Carlisle and Shippensburg, then through what would become Hagerstown, Maryland, crossing the Potomac River into the Shenandoah Valley.
Benjamin Chambers, a Scots-Irish immigrant, is credited with settling &quot;Falling Spring&quot; in 1730. He built a grist mill and saw mill by a then- waterfall where Falling Spring Creek joined Conococheague Creek. The creek provided power for the mills, and soon a settlement grew and became known as &quot;Falling Spring&quot;.

On March 30, 1734, Chambers received a &quot;Blunston license&quot; for , from a representative of the Penn family. European settlement in the area remained of questionable legality until the treaty ending the French and Indian War in 1763, because not all Indian tribes with land claims had signed treaties with the British colonial government.

The Penn family encouraged settlement in the area in order to strengthen its case in a border dispute with the Maryland Colony, which had resulted in hostilities known as Cresap&#x27;s War. This dispute was not settled until 1767, with the border survey that resulted in the Mason-Dixon line. Chambers traveled to England to testify in support of Penn&#x27;s claims. To maintain peace with the Indians, Penn sometimes arranged for European settlers to be removed from nearby areas. In May 1750, Benjamin Chambers helped remove settlers from the nearby Burnt Cabins, named after an incident.

The area was first classified as part of Chester County, then Lancaster County (as that was created from Chester County&#x27;s western area). Then Lancaster County was split, with its western portion renamed as Cumberland County; finally another split (this time of Cumberland County) established Franklin County in 1784. (Adams County adjoins it on the east).

The Great Wagon Road connecting Philadelphia with the Shenandoah Valley (and an east-west branch through Hagerstown and Cumberland, Maryland to the Ohio Valley known as Nemacolin&#x27;s Path) passed nearby. In 1744, the road was completed through Harris&#x27;s Ferry, Carlisle, Shippensburg, and Chambersburg to the Potomac River. In 1748 a local militia was formed for protection against Indians, with Benjamin Chambers named as its colonel.

Chambersburg was still considered frontier during the French and Indian War. Benjamin Chambers built a private stone fort during the war, which was equipped with two 4-pounder cannons. Fighting and troop movements occurred nearby. The area&#x27;s population dropped from about 3,000 in 1755 as the war began, to about 300 during the conflict. Most settlers did not return until after 1764 (when the peace treaty was signed between Great Britain and France).

Because Chambers&#x27;s fort was otherwise lightly defended, officials attempted to remove the cannons to prevent them from being captured by Indians and used against other forts. However, the attempted removal failed. One of the cannons still remained in 1830, when it was fired to celebrate Independence Day that year.

The Forbes Road and other trails going to Fort Pitt passed nearby as well. The Forbes Road developed into part of the main road connecting Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and much later into US 30. Chambersburg developed as a trading and transportation hub at the crossroads of Forbes Road and the Great Wagon Road.

Fighting continued in the area after the war. The Enoch Brown school massacre took place during Pontiac&#x27;s War, when Native Americans were trying to expel European Americans from the area. The Black Boys rebelled against British troops stationed at Fort Loudon.

The town of Chambersburg was platted or laid out in 1764. Lots were advertised for sale on July 19 in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Pennsylvania Gazette.

The first settlers were Scots-Irish Presbyterians; German Protestants came soon afterward. Relatively few Quakers and English Protestants (who made up a large proportion of early Pennsylvania settlers generally) settled as far west as Chambersburg. However, blacks lived in Chambersburg almost from the settlement&#x27;s beginning. Benjamin Chambers owned a black female slave sometime before the French and Indian War and twenty slaves were recorded as taxable property in 1786.

The earliest church was established by Scots-Irish Presbyterians in 1734. Chambers gave the congregation land in 1768, for an annual rent of only a single rose. Later, the First Lutheran Church and Zion Reformed Church both organized in 1780 under similar terms, so these three churches came to be known as the &quot;Rose Rent Churches&quot;. A Catholic community organized in 1785. St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church dates its founding to members purchasing a log cabin from the expanding Catholic congregation in 1811, and the congregation continued and expanded through 1830. The Mt. Moriah First African Baptist Church dates to 1887. The Jewish cemetery dates back to 1840.

=== 1775–1858 ===

In June 1775, soon after the Battle of Lexington, local troops were raised to fight the British in the American Revolution under the command of Benjamin Chambers&#x27;s eldest son Captain James Chambers, as part of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment. These troops were among the first non-New Englanders to join the siege of Boston, arriving on August 7, 1775. James Chambers fought for seven years during the revolution, reaching the rank of Colonel of Continental Army troops on September 26, 1776. His two brothers, William and Benjamin Jr., each served for much of the war and reached the rank of captain. James Chambers commanded local troops at the Battle of Long Island, and at White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. He was part of the rear guard covering the retreat from Brooklyn, and was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine while facing Hessian troops under General Knuphausen at Chadds Ford.

During the Whiskey Rebellion, local citizens raised a liberty pole in support of the rebels, and to protest conscription of soldiers to put down the rebellion. Nevertheless, these citizens were censured in a town meeting and removed the pole the next day. President George Washington, while leading United States troops against the rebels, came through town on the way from Carlisle to Bedford, staying overnight on October 12, 1794. According to tradition, Washington lodged with Dr. Robert Johnson, a surgeon in the Pennsylvania line during the Revolution. This march was one of only two times that a sitting president personally commanded the military in the field. (The other was after President James Madison fled the British occupation of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.) After sending the troops toward Pittsburgh from Bedford under General Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee, Washington returned through Chambersburg sometime between October 21 and 26. James Chambers was appointed a Brigadier General of Militia during the Whiskey Rebellion.

Chambersburg was incorporated on March 21, 1803, and declared the County Seat when the State Assembly established a formal government. The first courthouse was John Jack&#x27;s tavern on the Diamond (town square) in 1784, with a permanent courthouse built in 1793, and the first county jail built 1795. The &quot;Old Jail&quot; was built in 1818, survived the fire of 1864 and is the oldest jail building in Pennsylvania. It was originally used as the sheriff&#x27;s residence and had the longest continuous use of any jail in the state, operating until 1971. Today the Old Jail is a museum and home to the Franklin County – Kittochtinny Historical Society. The county&#x27;s gallows still stand in the jail&#x27;s courtyard. From 1786 to 1879 there were five executions in Franklin County totaling six 6 felons – five for murder and one for rape.

Much of the town&#x27;s growth was due to its position as a transportation center, first as the starting point on the Forbes Road to Pittsburgh. The U.S. Congress placed Chambersburg on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh postal road in 1803. The road was rebuilt as the Chambersburg-Bedford Turnpike in 1811. The Cumberland Valley Railroad was built in 1837 and was the area&#x27;s center of economic activity for nearly 100 years. Until the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s main line in 1857, the fastest route from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was by stagecoach from Pittsburgh to Chambersburg, and then by train to Philadelphia.

=== Civil War era ===
==== Underground Railroad / John Brown ====
By 1859, Chambersburg&#x27;s active community of free and enslaved blacks and sympathetic whites had attracted a stop on the Underground Railroad. Several schools taught black children, although such activity was illegal in Virginia and other slave states further south. John Brown stayed in an upstairs room at Mary Ritner&#x27;s boarding house between June and October, 1859 while preparing for his raid on Harpers Ferry (then in Virginia). Several of his fellow raiders stayed in the house as well, and four of them escaped capture and briefly visited the house after the raid. The house still stands at 225 East King Street. While in Chambersburg, Brown posed as Dr. Isaac Smith, an iron mine developer, and bought, shipped, and stored weapons under the guise of mining equipment.

Brown (using the name John Smith) and John Henry Kagi met with Frederick Douglass and Shields Green at an abandoned quarry outside of town to discuss the raid on August 19. According to Douglass&#x27;s account, Brown described the planned raid in detail and Douglass advised him against it. Douglass also provided $10 from a supporter, and had helped Green – a future raider – locate Brown.

==== First two Confederate occupations, selective burnings ====

During the American Civil War on October 10, 1862, Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, with 1,800 cavalrymen, raided Chambersburg, destroying $250,000 of railroad property and taking 500 guns, hundreds of horses, and enslaving &quot;eight young colored men and boys.&quot; They failed, however, to accomplish one of the main targets of the raid: to burn the railroad bridge across the Conococheague Creek at Scotland, five miles (8 km) north of town.

During the early days of the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, a Virginia cavalry brigade under Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins occupied the town and burned several warehouses and Cumberland Valley Railroad structures and the bridge at Scotland. From June 24–28, 1863, much of the Army of Northern Virginia passed through Chambersburg en route to Carlisle and Gettysburg, and General Robert E. Lee established his headquarters at a nearby farm.

==== July 30, 1864 devastation ====

The following year, Chambersburg was invaded for a third time, as cavalry, dispatched from the Shenandoah Valley by Jubal Early, arrived. On July 30, 1864, a large portion of the town was burned down by Confederate Brig. Gen. John McCausland for failing to provide a ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold. The local bank had sent its reserves out of town for safekeeping.
Among the few buildings left standing was the Masonic Temple, which had been guarded under orders by a Confederate member of the Masons. &quot;Norland&quot;, the home of Republican politician and editor Alexander McClure, was burned although it was well north of the main fire. Early had ordered the ransom as compensation for those residents of the Shenandoah Valley whose homes has been burned by Union Brig.-Gen. David Hunter. He also burned the Virginia Military Institute.
According to McCausland report the only death occurred when one of his soldiers was killed in the vicinity of the town after his troops left and no citizens lost their lives. One black Chambersburg resident was burned to death when Confederates set his house on fire and then refused to allow him to leave, trapping him in the flames. Another man was asked by the Confederates if he had ever educated &quot;niggers&quot;; after replying that he had, the Confederates burned his house down. Subsequently, &quot;Remember Chambersburg&quot; became a Union battle cry. The Property damage was $713,294.34 + Personal Property damage was $915,137,24 totaling $1,628,431.58 of which 50% was paid by State approbation, first by an Act of Legislature Feb 15, 1866, $500,000.00 and the second under the Act of Legislation May 27, 1871; under the last named act claiments [numbering 650] each had a certificate for amount of his loss but claims payable only when said claims were paid by the United States Government 
=== Civil War Legacy ===

==== Accusations of war crimes ====
Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early was accused of war crimes for ordering Chambersburg burned. The actual burning divided two of his cavalry commanders, because when Maryland-born Gen. Bradley Johnson saw the behavior of Gen. McCausland&#x27;s troops in Chambersburg, he refused to participate in a similar burning at Cumberland and Hancock, Maryland not far to the south, so both those towns survived despite likewise not paying ransoms. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. William W. Averell, although initially misdirected toward Baltimore and thus late to arrive to prevent the atrocities, also pursued the Confederates, who sustained several defeats and lost most of the Shenandoah Valley by November. Furthermore, when the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865, Early escaped to Texas by horseback, where he hoped to find a Confederate force still holding out. He proceeded to Mexico, and from there, sailed to Cuba and Canada. Living in Toronto, he wrote his memoir, &quot;A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence, in the Confederate States of America&quot;, which focused on his Valley Campaign and was published in 1867.

==== Chambersburg&#x27;s Reconstruction ====

A combination of state and private funding rebuilt Chambersburg. However, many new buildings were erected quickly and not initially built to the original standards. It took more than 30 years to fully restore the town&#x27;s housing stock to pre-Civil War standards. As discussed further below, Chambersburg was the site of one of the 69 schools established by Pennsylvania to educate children orphaned by the war, and which remained when all other such were closed decades later. Known as &quot;The Scotland School for Veterans Children&quot; after the 1890s, it remained open until 2010 and graduated more than 10,000 children during its lifetime.

==== Memorialization of Civil War ====

Since people from Chambersburg had relatives on both sides during the war, and the war devastated the town, the town event also became a part of the town&#x27;s identity. On July 17, 1878, 15,000 people attended dedication of Memorial Fountain in the town&#x27;s center, which honors the Civil War soldiers, and later Chambersburg&#x27;s fighters in other wars. A statue of a Union soldier stands next to the fountain, facing south to guard against the return of southern raiders.

To this day, the Civil War burning of Chambersburg remains a part of the town&#x27;s historic identity and yearly memorial events are held, especially near July 30.

Chambersburg has also recently been the subject of study on how people have historically perceived and responded to war tragedies.

The largest sectors by payroll were manufacturing companies such as T B Wood&#x27;s Inc., Manitowoc cranes, retail trade, and health care and social assistance. Despite suburban growth, much of the economy of the area is still largely based on agriculture.

Chambersburg&#x27;s retail sector has grown quickly since 2006 with the opening of retail stores near the newly built Exit 17 of Interstate 81. Several restaurants new to the region have also opened.

The town also hosts a professional football team, the Chambersburg Cardinals, that plays in the Gridiron Developmental Football League. People in the area speak in Pittsburgh English or with a Central Pennsylvania accent, over-pronouncing &quot;O&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;s&quot;.

Journalist David Brooks in 2001 used Chambersburg and Franklin County to typify Republican &quot;Red America&quot;. According to Brooks, there is little obvious income inequality and people don&#x27;t define their place in society by their income level. They value the work ethic and are anti-union, anti-welfare, pro-free market, and religious social conservatives.

== Government ==
The municipal government operates under the Pennsylvania Borough Code, with the town council holding both legislative and executive authority. The ten council members are elected from five wards; two from each ward with staggered four-year terms. The mayor administers the police department and can cast tie-breaking votes on the council. Other departments are administered by the Borough Manager. The current Borough Manager is Jeffrey Stonehill. The municipal budget of Chambersburg is abnormally large for a borough of its size, and the borough is one of only a few municipalities nationwide to have a municipal electric and gas utility. As a result of these in-house facilities, Chambersburg has the 14th largest municipal budget in the state.

Walter Bietsch became Mayor on January 2, 2018.

As of January 2020, the town council members are:

Sharon A. Bigler, 4th Ward (D)

== Education ==

=== Wilson College ===
Wilson College is a private, Presbyterian-related, liberal arts college founded in 1869 as a women&#x27;s college and named for its first major donor, Sarah Wilson of Chambersburg. The college has about 800 undergraduate students and is known for its Women With Children, Veterinary Medical Technician, and Equestrian programs. Once an all women&#x27;s school, it began admitting male students in 2013. In 2009, the school opened the first &quot;green&quot; campus building, housing the science and technology department and featuring a full-length waterfall which begins on the third floor and ends in the building&#x27;s basement.

=== Public schools ===

Chambersburg Area Senior High School (CASHS), which is home to the CASHS men&#x27;s tennis team, is a public school with around 2,400 students in grades 9–12, drawn from the borough of Chambersburg and the surrounding townships of Hamilton, Greene, Lurgan, Letterkenny and Guilford. CASHS is accredited by the Middle States Association and has occupied its current facilities since 1955. Principal Dr. Barry Purvis was recognized as the 2006 High School Principal of the Year by the Pennsylvania Association of Elementary and Secondary School Principals.

Until August 2011, J. Frank Faust Junior High School was the only public junior high school for eighth and ninth grade students of the Chambersburg Area School District. It served about 1400 students. J. Frank Faust is now a middle school for Chambersburg area students in the north. CAMS NORTH. It has 6th through 8th grade.

Chambersburg Area Middle School SOUTH was the only middle school, but as of August 2011, it became CAMS SOUTH, 6th through 8th grade. During the 2001–02 school year, CAMS was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.

The Franklin County Career and Technology Center is also located in Chambersburg. FCCTC is a school designated for students and adults to learn vocational trades while still learning core subjects in school. The school offers training in about 20–30 different concentrations. There are currently six different school districts with students attending FCCTC: Chambersburg, Fannett-Metal, Greencastle-Antrim, Shippensburg, Tuscarora, and Waynesboro.

The Chambersburg school district includes seventeen elementary schools. Many school are being upgraded, rebuilt, or closed because of out-of-date buildings and lack of space. As of July 2008, the current School Board President is Stanley Helman. Other members include Anne Boryan, Renee Sharpe, Norman Blowers, Lori Leedy, Fred Rice, Dave Schiamanna, and Joe Tosten. One seat is currently being filled after the resignation of the previous board president, Dr. Thomas Orndorff.
=== Scotland School for Veterans&#x27; Children ===
The Scotland School for Veterans&#x27; Children (SSVC) was a state owned school that offered tuition-free residential education for children of Pennsylvania residents who are veterans or are currently serving in the U.S. armed forces. Scotland School was founded in 1863 after two orphaned children begging for food knocked on the door of Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor, Andrew Gregg Curtin of Centre County north of Chambersburg. Governor Curtin and his wife realized the orphaned children of Pennsylvania&#x27;s many soldiers had been forgotten. He established 70 &#x27;Soldier&#x27;s Orphan Schools&#x27; across the state. Over time, the number of eligible students declined, and in 1895 all of the schools closed except that located in the unincorporated village of Scotland about four miles (6 km) north of Chambersburg. The name was changed to Scotland School for Veteran&#x27;s Children, then the Pennsylvania Soldiers Orphans Industrial School, and eligibility criteria changed to provide an education to any child of any veteran, whether that veteran was living or deceased (so the school&#x27;s founding date is sometimes 1895). It had about 300 students in grades 3–12, annually. More than 10,000 students were educated at the school before it closed in 2009, when Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislators concurred in the decision of Governor Ed Rendell to remove funding. The campus contains about 70 buildings including residential cottages.

=== Private schools ===
Private schools include Corpus Christi, a Catholic school with 310 students and over 20 teachers and Cumberland Valley Christian School, a private Christian kindergarten through twelfth grade academy located in Chambersburg. Cumberland Valley Christian School is affiliated with the Open Door Church and has approximately four hundred students. Other private schools include the Montessori Academy of Chambersburg (22 months-12th grade, non-sectarian) and Shalom Christian Academy (K-12, Mennonite affiliation) a pre-K through twelfth grade academy with approximately five hundred students, and several elementary schools with Mennonite, Baptist, Brethren, Christian Science, and other religious orientations.

=== Library ===

Coyle Free Library has roots going back to 1891, when a library of 166 books was organized by the local &quot;Afternoon Club&quot;. A member of the club, Blanche Coyle, left a bequest of $30,435 (~$ in ) in 1915 to construct a library building. The building was completed in 1924, located at the corner of Second and Queen Streets. Later the library was made part of the Franklin County Library and began to receive funds from the County and State, though the &quot;Afternoon Club&quot; still donated funds through at least 1979. The building it currently occupies is a former post office.

== Media ==

=== Newspapers ===
The &quot;Chambersburg Public Opinion&quot; is the only daily newspaper published in town, and has weekday circulation about 17,000. It was founded in 1869 and is now owned by Gannett.

=== Television and radio ===
Franklin County is in the Harrisburg-Lancaster-York television market. Television reception can be poor because of the surrounding mountains. Harrisburg PBS station WITF-TV rebroadcasts via low-powered translator W34FM-D. All Harrisburg TV stations are available off air and on cable. WHTM is the first network affiliated television station to establish a bureau in Chambersburg. WDVM-TV and WWPB broadcast from nearby Hagerstown, Maryland.

Chambersburg shares a radio market, the 165th largest in the United States, with Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, and Hagerstown, Maryland.

<doc id="132579" wikidata="Q1185633" url="?curid=132579" title="Greencastle, Pennsylvania">
<text>Greencastle is a borough in Franklin County in south-central Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,251 at the 2020 census. Greencastle lies within the Cumberland Valley of Pennsylvania.

==History==
James Patton, who came to America at age 17 and moved to North Carolina in 1793, started the settlement of Canogege (spelled &quot;Conegoge&quot; by George P. Donahoo). Patton said in an 1839 letter to his descendants that the place was &quot;settled by a moral and orderly people.&quot;

Greencastle was founded in 1783 by John Allison from the Barkdoll House. The town was named after Greencastle, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It was originally composed of 246 lots. By 1790 there were about 60 houses in Greencastle, homes to approximately 400 people. The town of Greencastle had grown by the mid-nineteenth century to 1,125 residents.

===Latter Day Saint settlement===
In 1845, following the succession crisis in the Latter Day Saint movement, Sidney Rigdon (one of the three main contenders along with James Strang and Brigham Young for leadership of the Latter Day Saints following the death of Joseph Smith) took his followers to Pennsylvania and formed a Rigdonite Mormon settlement at Greencastle. This settlement had approximately 200 followers. They founded the New Jerusalem settlement between Greencastle and Mercersburg, published the &quot;Conochoheague Herald&quot; newspaper in Greencastle, and made plans for the construction of a temple. The Rigdonite Mormon settlement at Greencastle only lasted a few years; some former Rigdon followers went to Utah to join Brigham Young, while William Bickerton, who had opposed Rigdon&#x27;s move to Greencastle, would eventually reorganize the remaining Pennsylvania branch of the Latter Day Saint movement in Pittsburgh as the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite).

===Civil War===
Early in the Civil War, Greencastle and neighboring Franklin County communities raised the 126th Pennsylvania Infantry. In the summer of 1863, the war touched close to home when Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia invaded southern Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign. From mid-June to early July, those residents of Greencastle who had not fled to safety lived under Confederate rule. On July 2, concurrent with the Battle of Gettysburg in neighboring Adams County, Captain Ulric Dahlgren&#x27;s Federal cavalry patrol galloped into Greencastle&#x27;s town square, where they surprised and captured several Confederate cavalrymen carrying vital correspondence from Richmond. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee&#x27;s army began its retreat to Virginia on July 4 and 5. He sent John D. Imboden&#x27;s cavalry to escort a large wagon train carrying Confederate wounded. The train, nearly in length, wound its way through the streets of Greencastle, where a few men of the town attacked the wagon train with axes and hatchets. They succeeded in disabling several wagons before Confederate cavalry chased them away.

===Modern era===
Following the war, Greencastle grew considerably in the late 19th century during the Industrial Revolution, having several industrial factories built inside the town limits, including the Crowell Manufacturing Company, which constructed farming equipment.

In 1902, Greencastle businessman Philip Baer began a tradition where the town holds a triennial social event known as &quot;Old Home Week&quot;. Every three years, Greencastle townspeople and former residents come together for one week in August in a town-wide reunion to reminisce and fellowship. The most recent Old Home Week Celebration occurred in 2022; the next one will be in 2025.

The Greencastle Historic District, Mitchell-Shook House, and Martin&#x27;s Mill Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Greencastle contains many Christian church congregations with longstanding heritage and rich history. The present-day Methodist church has origins dating back to 1805 when Christian Newcomer conducted services in the area.

==Geography==
Greencastle is located in southern Franklin County and is surrounded by Antrim Township. U.S. Route 11 passes through the western side of the borough as Antrim Way, leading north to Chambersburg, the county seat, and south 11 miles to Hagerstown, Maryland. Pennsylvania Route 16 passes through the center of the borough as Buchanan Trail, leading east to Waynesboro and west to Mercersburg. Interstate 81 passes just east of the borough limits, with access from Exit 3 (US-11) to the south and Exit 5 (PA 16) to the east. I-81 leads northeast to Harrisburg and south past Hagerstown to Winchester, Virginia.

Greencastle is home to Jerome King Park, a playground created by David D. King in memory of his brother for the Old Home Week celebration of 1923. The town&#x27;s other local park—Antrim Township Park, a park with trails connecting to Martin&#x27;s Mill Bridge—opened in the early 2000s.

Martin&#x27;s Mill Bridge underwent a million dollar repair in 2016 to preserve the structure of the bridge while reducing and protecting against weather and decay. The efforts received the Abba G. Lichtenstein Medal for artistic merit and innovation for the restoration of the bridge.

Beside the Greencastle-Antrim School District&#x27;s campus lies Tayamentasachta or the &quot;school farm.&quot; Originally, this was purchased with the intent of expanding the school, but the district decided instead to renovate and utilize the farm for student and community learning. The farm was officially named Tayamentasachta in 1970, which was the traditional Indian name for the nearby stream.

Multiple historical buildings and community groups exist in Greencastle, including the Alison-Antrim Museum and Greencastle Area Youth Foundation (GAYF). The GAYF utilizes the High Line Train Station to host clubs and youth groups such as Scouts BSA.

<text>Mercersburg is a borough in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough is southwest of Harrisburg, the state capital.

Due to its location in a rural area, it had a relatively large percentage of African-American workers who had been enslaved from the Revolution. It was called &quot;Black Town&quot; in the early 19th century before incorporation under its current name. Refugee African Americans escaping from slavery in the South also settled here, and the area was known as &quot;Little Africa&quot;.

==History==
Mercersburg was platted in 1780. The borough was named after Hugh Mercer, a general and hero in the American Revolutionary War. A post office has been in operation at Mercersburg since 1812.

Located near the southern border of Pennsylvania, the rural community became a place of refuge during the antebellum years for escaped African Americans who had been enslaved in the South. Some came to the area via the Underground Railroad. After the American Revolution, Pennsylvania had abolished slavery. In this area were communities of free African Americans who had worked in agriculture. It was relatively easy for refugees to join their communities after passing over the border of Maryland.

This settlement was called &quot;Black Town&quot; in early years, before being incorporated in 1831. The rural area outside of town was referred to by locals as &quot;Little Africa&quot; because of its relatively large concentration of African Americans in this time period. Some were refugees who had settled here after escaping from slavery in the South.

In later years, black folks moved away from here as they were at risk from slavecatchers, especially after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, which had more stringent rules against free states. Many African Americans moved to Philadelphia, which had a large and free black community, which helped new arrivals get settled. Philadelphia also provided more job opportunities.

In 2010, 6.49% of the population was of African American descent, a total of 1,561 persons.

The Mercersburg Historic District, Lane House, and Mercersburg Academy are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Tuscarora School District===
The Tuscarora School District covers an area of , stretching north-south from just south of 40 degrees north latitude to the Maryland border and from east of the 78 degree west longitude line to just west of Chambersburg. The district is located within the borders of Franklin County in south-central Pennsylvania. It includes the borough of Mercersburg and Montgomery, Peters, St. Thomas and Warren townships. The school district primarily encompasses a rural agricultural area with a total population of approximately 17,000 people.

The district consists of four K-5 elementary schools (Saint Thomas, Mountain View, Mercersburg, Montgomery), one grades 6-8 middle school (James Buchanan MS) and one grade 9-12 high school (James Buchanan High School). Tuscarora, the name of the mountain on the western boundary, was named for the Tuscarora Nation, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe. They had lived in this area for a period after migrating from the Carolinas about 1713 after disastrous warfare. They continued to migrate north to present-day New York, where about 1722 they declared their migration over. They were accepted as the sixth nation of the Iroquois League, or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, the powerful confederacy of five nations that occupied much of the territory west of the Hudson River and into northern Pennsylvania.

Colonists adopted the Lenape language term for Conococheague Creek, which flows through the district on its way from the Path Valley south to the Potomac River. The local Delaware people, properly known as Lenape, named it for &quot;clear water&quot;.

<text>Orrstown is a borough in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 214 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Orrstown was founded in 1833 by the Orr brothers. It is surrounded by Southampton Township in Franklin County, on the old state road from Shippensburg to Upper Strasburg. Settlements were made in that neighborhood as early as 1738. Before the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad, horses and cattle were annually driven down the state road (now Pennsylvania Route 533/Orrstown Road) to eastern markets. The town was laid out in 1833, by John, William and James Orr. At first, they called it &quot;Southampton&quot;, after the township; but in 1835, when application was made for a post office to be called Southampton, the Post Office Department refused because there was already a post office of that name. George Chambers, who represented the area in Congress, named the post office &quot;Orrstown&quot;, and the name has since been attached to the town.

It was incorporated as a borough on May 3, 1847, and in 1878 the town had one hotel, two stores, one carriage factory, and four churches: Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Brethren and Winebrennerian. The populations was then 325.

<text>St. Thomas Township is a township in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,917 at the 2020 census.

It is the birthplace of both Baseball Hall of Fame member Nellie Fox, and United States Army brigadier general and legislator, Charles Thomas Campbell.

==History==
The Franklin Furnace Historic District, Chambersburg and Bedford Turnpike Road Company Toll House, and Woodland are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The account of the township&#x27;s formation was lost when the Confederates burned the county seat Chambersburg in 1864, but according to the recollection of older citizens the township was organized ca. 1818 on territory taken from Peters and Hamilton townships. The area was settled in the 1740s by, among others, Col. John Armstrong, John Campbell, and John Dixon. There were several Campbell families among the early settlers, and an eighteenth-century map labels the village simply &quot;Campbells&quot;. It was later called &quot;Campbelltown&quot;, a designation that prevailed for many years until, at the suggestion of William Archibald, it received the official designation &quot;St. Thomas&quot;, purportedly still honoring Thomas Campbell, who had laid out the village. The name &quot;Saint Thomas&quot; was reportedly a joke concerning Thomas Campbell&#x27;s tendency to swear. The organization of the town appears to have been concurrent with the organization of the St. Thomas or &quot;Campbeltown&quot; Presbyterian Church in 1818. Not long afterwards local Evangelical Lutheran and German Reformed congregations joined the Presbyterians in the erection of a church building, which the three congregations shared from 1829 until 1854.
==Geography==
The township is in west-central Franklin County, in the Great Appalachian Valley, but extending northwest to include the first four ridges of the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains: from east to west, Front Mountain, Broad Mountain, Little Mountain, and Blue Mountain. Conodoguinet Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, rises in the extreme western corner of the township, at the juncture of Little and Blue mountains. The rest of the township is drained by tributaries of Conococheague Creek, part of the Potomac River watershed.

U.S. Route 30 crosses the township, leading east to Chambersburg, the county seat, and west to McConnellsburg. It passes through the unincorporated community of St. Thomas at the center of the township. The community of Williamson is at the southern corner of the township, where Back Creek joins Conococheague Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.06%, is water.

==History==
The region around Antietam Creek had been home to Native Americans, primarily Susquehannock and Lenape, for thousands of years prior to settlement by Anglo-Europeans in the mid-18th century. Beginning in 1749 and again in 1751, a certain John Wallace obtained several warrants for the land on which the center of the town now stands. In 1797, John Wallace, a son of the original Scottish settler, laid out the town of Waynesburg in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. The place originally incorporated as Waynesburg borough on December 21, 1818, however that charter was repealed March 30, 1825. When reincorporated in January 30, 1831, the borough was given the name &quot;Waynesboro&quot;. It is one of several dozen towns, cities, and counties named after General Anthony Wayne, a hero of the American Revolution.
During the Civil War, Waynesboro played a part in the Gettysburg campaign in June and July 1863. In the week before the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate Major General Jubal Early&#x27;s division of Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s corps of the Army of Northern Virginia passed through the community on its way northward. After the battle, General Robert E. Lee rode through the border community with his retreating forces.
Numerous stone grain mills are in the area: Welty&#x27;s Mill, Shank&#x27;s Mill, Hopewell Roller Mill and others. Most of them still standing and in use.

It was known for the manufacture of engines, boilers, grinders, threshers, boring machines, bolt cutters, wood and iron workers&#x27; vises, nut facers, etc. There were also foundries and machine shops and manufacturers of lumber products. Local companies included Frick Company, Geiser Manufacturing, Waynesboro Knitting Mill, Connie&#x27;s Sportwear, Freeman&#x27;s Shoes, Landis Machine Company, and Landis Tool Company. The population of the borough had its greatest increase between 1880 to 1920 when the when the borough grew fivefold from just under 1,900 to almost 10,000.

<text>Valley-Hi is a borough in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 7 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Land around Valley-Hi Eagle Lake was purchased by developer Jack Gothie in the 1960s who was originally intending to develop a new ski resort there due to its easy access from the Pennsylvania Turnpike and U.S. Route 30. The ski resort was not built, but he did retain the land and built houses around the lake. Following the construction of a bypass of two tunnels along the Turnpike, Gothie received compensation and an additional piece of land. A piece of road that was intended for public access was blocked by Gothie in 1973.

Valley-Hi borough was established in late 1973 when Gothie and a group of residents petitioned Fulton County to create the county&#x27;s second borough (after McConnellsburg). Gothie claimed the proposal was wanted so that police and fire services could be provided to the residents of his development. His intent was to keep the access road to the borough and any municipal services private and owned by the Valley-Hi Development Corporation (later renamed Valley-Hi Development Association). An application was submitted and with no objections from the county nor Brush Creek Township, the township from which the borough would be created, the borough was incorporated on December 31, 1973. However, the Fulton County commissioners later filed a challenge to the original petition claiming the state election code requires voting districts to have at least 100 voters thus a borough mayor, council members, and other offices could not be elected. The borough&#x27;s status was in limbo through the late 1970s with the Fulton County commissioners wanting to dissolve it but Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania judges ruling to reinstate it, with the final ruling coming in September 1980. Jack Gothie would be elected to serve as mayor or councilman of the borough until his death in 1997.

<text>Greensboro is a borough in Greene County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 266 at the 2020 census, up from 260 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Greensboro is located in southeastern Greene County at (39.792911, -79.912087). It is situated on the west bank of the Monongahela River, opposite New Geneva and the mouth of George&#x27;s Creek. It is bordered by Monongahela Township in Greene County to the north and west, and by Nicholson Township in Fayette County to the south and east, across the Monongahela. The county and township border follows the center of the river. The closest road bridges over the river are the Masontown Bridge on Pennsylvania Route 21, north of Greensboro by road, and the Albert Gallatin Memorial Bridge on Pennsylvania Route 88 at Point Marion, south of Greensboro.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which are land and , or 26.06%, are water.

==History==

===The beginning of settlement===

Like much of the region, Greensboro can trace its roots back to Native American settlement, to the Mingo tribes of the Northern Iroquois. What was to later become Greensboro was first known to the Mingo as &quot;Delight&quot;, so named in recognition of the rich farmland that stretched along the banks of the Monongahela River. As early as 1752, settlers from the east and south began to stake their claims in the lands along the Monongahela. The first white settler of Delight was explorer-trader John Badolet, who was a close friend of John Minor. Minor was the leader of the first group to settle in the area presently known as Mapletown, to the northwest of Greensboro in Monongahela Township.

In the early 1780s, Elias Stone bought Delight and divided it into blocks and streets; these still carry their original names. On February 9, 1790, Stone&#x27;s growing village was named &quot;Greensburgh&quot; (later changed to &quot;Greensboro&quot;) in honor of the Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, for whom Greene County was also named when it was formed from Washington County in 1796. Due to its advantageous geographic location along the river, it quickly became an early trading center for settlers and travelers heading north to Pittsburgh and to points West.

Albert Gallatin, a partner in Albert Gallatin &amp; Company and later the Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, purchased lots in Greensburgh in 1795. He also purchased a great deal of land in Fayette County, including what was to become later the town of New Geneva, directly across the river from Greensburgh. On a trip to Washington, D.C., Gallatin met a group of German glassblowers who were heading to Kentucky to form their own company. He urged them to consider settling in Greensburgh instead of Kentucky. With Gallatin&#x27;s assistance, the group settled in nearby New Geneva and operated the New Geneva Glass Works there until about 1805. Around that time, Gallatin was appointed the Secretary of the Treasury and sold his interest in the glassworks to his partners. The remaining partners moved the operation across the river to the northern section of Greensburgh, which consequently took on the name of Glassworks.

===Early development===

Glassmaking was the primary industry for many Monongahela River towns, including the city of Pittsburgh as well as small towns such as New Geneva and Greensboro, for several decades preceding the Civil War. The late 18th-early 19th century New Geneva/Greensboro glassworks proved that quality glass, natural resources, and transportation networks could be effectively harnessed. After the Civil War, the manufacture of stoneware became Greensboro&#x27;s leading industry, in addition to a prosperous clay tile manufacturer who specialized in roofing tiles. The mid 19th-century Greensboro stoneware potteries were among the most productive in the eastern United States. Talented artisans and craftsmen, along with the excellent nearby clay banks produced a distinctive blue-gray stoneware which had a large market. Due to its location at the head of the slack waters of the Monongahela, Greensboro&#x27;s influence as a commercial and manufacturing center expanded far beyond its small boundaries.

By the 1850s, the slack water system of locks and dams had been developed by the Monongahela Navigation Company (later acquired by the Army Corps of Engineers), allowing for year-round travel from Pittsburgh to the Greensboro area. This permitted Greensboro to become a shipping point not only for southern Greene County but for parts of what is now northern West Virginia as well. Its growing industrial, commercial, and transportation significance in the mid-19th century helped transform the town into a social and cultural center. In the 1880s, Greensboro essentially lost the pottery and clay tile market due to more efficient producers, and with the extension of slack water transportation to Morgantown became a more localized port.

During this period, many of the present churches in the community were established, with the Greensburgh Lutheran Church forming first. Other churches soon followed, such as the Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, and eventually, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. As was the tradition for early churches, particularly Protestants, most of these groups began meeting for worship in a member&#x27;s home, or during fair weather outside under large tents, with &quot;circuit riders&quot; as pastors until formal church structures could be built and an established clergy formed.

===The industrial era and today===

Around the start of the 20th century came industrialization, and Western Pennsylvania&#x27;s role was vital in the transformation of the national economy. A part of the Klondike coal seam, which extends through most of eastern Greene County and western Fayette County, the Greensboro area was rich in the mineral that made the region famous around the world. Greensboro, being a community already established with the conveniences, commerce and trade, suddenly found itself as a growing cultural and economic hub for many growing &quot;coal patch towns&quot; sprouting up in the area during the area Coal Rush.

Coal became King, and with Western Pennsylvania as his capital, it was only logical that Greensboro became part of this movement. Indeed, the Penn-Pitt neighborhood was originally company housing for miners, as were the nearby Seventh Pool and Poland Mines areas, and countless others, many of which are lost to history today. Thousands of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe flooded into the region and brought with them new customs, traditions, and culture.

Coal also became Ruler. History has shown that any growth industry using thousands of underskilled, undereducated immigrant workers provides fertile ground for the lust of greed and opportunism. Many mines and their owners sought to capitalize on this and found ways to maximize their profits. As such, many workers found themselves &quot;selling their soul to the company store&quot;, earning meager pay for a dangerous day&#x27;s wage, only to be spent on company goods and rent in the patch towns created by these very companies, effectively making these workers willful individuals of &quot;wage slavery&quot;. During this period the formation of unions such as the UMWA became more prevalent and necessary to represent the workers. Through the growth of the UMWA and events such as the &quot;Red Neck Revolution of 1921&quot; an era of wage slavery began to end.

At one point, the Greensboro area was famous for the Robena mine, known as the largest mine in the world at the peak of its production in 1946. Robena also became famous for a more tragic reason: in December 1962 37 miners died in an explosion at Robena No. 3, illustrating how precarious this work truly was.

Coal defined the region and the lives of those who inhabited it, and made not only Greensboro and the Monongahela Valley prosperous, but the nation as well. Yet this period was not to last, and as the coal seams became tapped out and the processes outdated and replaced with modern mechanical technology, communities like Penn-Pitt and Poland Mines began to fade as their reason for existence ceased.

While coal (followed by healthcare) currently remains the backbone for much of the economy of Greene County, Greensboro and other communities have been migrating away from such dependency and see benefits in non-industrial sources of employment in sectors such as ecotourism, agritourism, and community-supported agriculture (CSAs), as well as fishing, hunting, hiking and boating.

==Historic industries==

===Pottery===

Early in the town&#x27;s history, pottery became an important part of Greensboro&#x27;s economic base, with the first operation owned and operated by Alexander Vance. Vance settled in Greensboro in the early 19th century, while still very young, and began a small pottery trade operation with his brother James. The stoneware was manufactured from local red clay and had a very distinctive coloring. The Vances eventually began to expand their operations, bringing in David Boughner, who took over the business in 1819 when the Vances left for Ohio. Boughner was the first operator to fire the stoneware in a salt kiln.

Although Boughner&#x27;s operation may have been among the earliest and most advanced stoneware operation in the area, it was by no means the only one. James and William &quot;Leet&quot; Hamilton arrived from New Brighton, Pennsylvania, in 1850 and started a pottery manufacturing company of their own. The remains of their endeavors, which operated under the name James Hamilton and Company, can still be found along Water Street.

The original James Hamilton and Company did not last long, however, and in 1866 was sold to Leet&#x27;s son Frank and a son-in-law named John Jones. Together Frank Hamilton and Jones expanded the business and began selling their wares on a grander scale. Hamilton and Jones was located on Diamond Street and for many years was the only rival to the cross-town operation of James Hamilton.

The company was also known as Star Pottery for a period of time, as well as the Union Works. The business continued to produce pottery for over thirty years and its reputation was widespread, although it never actually surpassed its rival in production. Eventually competition began to wear away at the profitability of the company, with a devastating fire in 1897 destroying the plant and forcing operations closed. Although the company attempted to move into the Williams and Reppert plant across town, efforts to start anew were futile. James Hamilton remained in control of his firm until 1880. A share of the business had been sold in 1866, but he continued to hold the majority interest for the next fourteen years until he sold out completely to Thomas Reppert and W.T. Williams. In 1884, Reppert purchased the entire business from Williams, making himself the sole proprietor. Williams was able to buy back into the business once again in 1890. Together Reppert and Williams manufactured stoneware for dealers in at least four states.

However, by the beginning of World War I, all significant production had ended and 1916 generally marks the end of stoneware manufacturing in Greensboro.

===Glass===
Albert Gallatin and several of his partners in Albert Gallatin &amp; Co. founded the &quot;glassworks district&quot; with the help of German glassblowers Christian Kramer, Boltzer Kramer, John Gabler, Adolf Eberhart, Lewis Reitz and George Reppert.

Gallatin first met the glassblowers in 1792 at Tomlinson&#x27;s Tavern in the mountains of Maryland. The glassworkers had left the recently closed Amelung Works of Frederick, Maryland, and were planning on migrating to Mays Landing, Kentucky, to set up a new glass factory. Gallatin reputedly persuaded them to establish a glassworks on his land in New Geneva.

The glassblowers went to see both New Geneva and the Mays Landing site. When notes were finally compared New Geneva was chosen. After much discussion, a co-partnership was entered into between Gallatin and James A. Nicholson on the one hand and the German glassblowers on the other. This partnership lasted until 1803, during which time the New Geneva Glass Works produced window glass for the early pioneers as well as bottles, bowls, and other items.

Following his appointment to the cabinet, Gallatin determined to withdraw from the glass firm and advertised on May 7, 1803, in &quot;The Tree of Liberty&quot; (a Pittsburgh newspaper), &quot;Sale by Auction...One undivided half of the New Geneva Glassworks, a ferry across the Monongahela River, sundry lots and dwelling houses in the town of Greensboro.. .&quot;

The Germans continued operations at New Geneva until 1807, when they moved the works to present-day glassworks near Greensboro because of the discovery of an outcrop of coal at that place.

The use of coal instead of the wood used at New Geneva greatly facilitated glass production, and its great abundance at Greensboro along with the nearby sand deposits supplied the works with most of the necessary raw materials until they closed in 1849.

Managed by the Kramers and operated by the Kramers and the other German families, the old glassworks produced window glass, with individual glassworkers blowing bottles, bowls and ornaments as gifts for family and friends. All of them worked for wages, dividing the profits at year&#x27;s end.

Glass was loaded on barges from the special wharves built behind the works and shipped up and down the Monongahela, supplying the early settlers with what was once a luxury west of the Alleghenies, glass windows.

==Current preservation and revitalization efforts==

Greensboro is a municipality that realizes the importance of keeping its past alive through the generations. Residents, elected officials, and community groups regularly work together to educate, promote, and conserve the rich history of this small rural community. In order to do this, both public and private partnerships have been established to meet the community&#x27;s diverse needs. The many historical and conservation projects completed by the Greensboro community exemplify the fostering of private and public partnerships in a rural community. To date, over $3 million has been invested in projects that preserve and protect the history of this community.

Dating back to 1985 which coincidentally was the year of the 1985 Election day floods, the community identified the need to begin documenting their history. This began by first establishing the Historic District that now surrounds and protects much of the community. In 1987, Greensboro native Betty Longo began to record, in longhand, the memories of Mary Black Carr, an elderly resident of the community. These memoirs have proven to be a strong historical thread of the community. Beginning with these early acts of preservation, Greensboro has worked collectively to maintain its heritage by using all resources available. In 1987, the residents formed a Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Planning Committee to deal with the changes coming because of the dismantling of Lock #7.

In building these partnerships, success has been achieved through the dedication of a handful of hard-working residents. Most recently, the Nathanael Greene Historical Foundation with support from borough council has been the organizer of historical preservation efforts.

In specific instances such as the preservation of the Log House, a partnership was first formed with the Army Corps of Engineering to relocate and restore the log cabin home. A partnership was also formed with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry&#x27;s Civilian Conservation Corps to provide the labor needed to perform the restoration work on the building. These partnerships proved vital to the success of reopening the Log House not only as an historical building within the community, but also as a meeting facility that is available for community use. The efforts of this community prevented the destruction of this valuable historic asset, which now provides a location for the annual community Christmas Party and can be rented out for private functions. The nominal fees associated with renting the Log House help to provide additional revenue for the municipality.

Other projects include the preparation of a Historic District Homeowners Manual, the establishment of a municipal website that provides a summary of Greensboro history, the use of grant funds to build a boat launch, and the refurbishing of 28 homes using state funds. In addition, community festivals that display many of the historical artifacts are conducted yearly, and a comprehensive plan is underway with five neighboring municipalities. This community continues to strive to preserve their history and to educate their residents about their past while working to improve their future.

===Historic District===

The Greensboro Historic District was established in 1995 and is roughly bounded by County, Second, Walnut, Front and Clear streets and the Monongahela River. The Greensboro Historic District is a defined area of with a concentration of buildings, structures, and sites that contribute to the significance of the borough in terms of its importance in industry, commerce, architecture, archeology, and transportation. While the district&#x27;s industrial and transportation significance are largely contained in the 19th century, its commercial and architectural significance extend into the early 20th century. Five other buildings within the borough outside the historic district boundaries are also included as having historical significance.

Within the Greensboro Historic District boundaries are 36 buildings, 29 of these are considered contributing. The wharf, built around the time of the Civil War, is also located within the District, as well as an archaeological site containing the location of the James and Hamilton Company pottery works.

The historic significance of the district is its architecture, which is representative of local vernacular architecture and displays elements of various popular styles ranging from the Italianate of the early 19th century to the Bungalow style of the early 20th century. Many dwellings are of the Queen Anne style. Few, if any, southwestern Pennsylvania towns can boast the range of architecture from its period of settlement to the 20th century as can be found in Greensboro. The period of significance for the district is 1750 to 1949. The structures contain a mix of commercial business, religious uses, a theater, and residential dwellings.

In addition to the Greensboro Historic District, the Greensboro Public School, Alexander V. Boughner House, Peters-Graham House, James Parreco House, and James Jones House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Nemacolin is a census-designated place (CDP) in Greene County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded as a company town around the workings of a Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company that owned and operated a coal mine in 1917. The name reflects a noted Amerindian ally Chief Nemacolin, who showed the Virginia and Pennsylvania settlers how to cross the successive Allegheny barrier ridges via the Cumberland Narrows and the Nemacolin Trail—which Braddock Expedition widened into a wagon road through the mountains. The population of the CDP was 937 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The land upriver from Brownsville along the eastern border of Greene County was acquired by the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. (YS&amp;T) which planned, zoned, populated, and built the community, complete with a movie theater, tennis courts, amusement hall (in the fashion of the times in blue-collar company towns, part pool hall, part beer garden), and swimming pool near the borough of Carmichaels. At one time, Youngstown Sheet and Tube was the largest steel company in the nation. Establishing the town well after the United Mine Workers flexed their muscles in the strikes of the 1890s–1900s and after its riot troubles in Youngstown in 1916, it is also likely the company had a hand in establishing the local school and one or more churches and likely issued invitations and recruited the medical practitioners operating various health clinics.

The mine, established outside the town, was one of many large mines atop the Pittsburgh Coal Seam on the west bank of the Monongahela River. It was operated as a subsidiary under the Buckeye Coal Company which grew and benefited as being directly on the railroad route running upriver (south) to West Virginia and was able to load both river coal barges and freight trains with its output. It is thought by some to have been the largest coal mine in the United States in 1919, and was rated at being the second most productive in Greene County in the 1940s war years. The mine after operating for nearly 70 years, shut down production in 1986, and was sealed (safed) 2–3 years later.

==Geography==
Nemacolin is located in the southeastern corner of Cumberland Township at (39.877676, −79.925858), on the west bank of the Monongahela River, which forms the eastern border of Greene County.

== History==
Rices Landing is a small rural town located along the western bank of the Monongahela River, approximately south of Pittsburgh. One of the first visitors to the area was George Washington. Tale has it that in 1755, while he was traveling to Fort Duquesne, he and his men camped in this area, just across from Pumpkin Run on the other side of the river after he crossed.

In 1786, John Rice purchased land on the east side of Enoch&#x27;s Run, and at about the same time, Abijah McClain purchased land on the west side. John Rice named the community he built &quot;Rices Landing&quot;, while Abijah McClain called his settlement &quot;Newport&quot;. In 1801, Benjamin Franklin mapped out the area and combined the two communities under the name &quot;Rices Landing&quot;. Enoch&#x27;s Run was renamed &quot;Swan Run&quot; before it eventually took the name it holds today, Pumpkin Run.

Rices Landing officially incorporated in April 1903. The availability of valuable resources such as trees, clay, sand, coal and transportation allowed the community to thrive. Shops, trading posts, taverns, and other businesses once lined its busy streets. It was so prosperous that it was regarded as the &quot;Gateway to Western Pennsylvania&quot; by frontier settlers.

Although things have quieted today, the residents still see their community as a charming and respectable community that was once the talk of the frontier world.

Rices Landing is the former home of US Olympic wrestler and four-time state champion Cary Kolat. Kolat attended Jefferson-Morgan High School. He is known as being one of the best wrestlers in history, going 137–0 in high school and 111–7 in college. Kolat won many international medals and competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Established in 1903, Rices Landing is a town rich in tradition. The center of industry in Rices Landing during the First and Second World Wars was the W. A. Young and Sons Foundry and Machine Shop, which is still in existence. The foundry was used to make many different items for the war effort and will undergo construction in the coming year. The town was in the heart of the steel industry, with many coal mines located in and around the town. Many of these mines and industry are no longer around. Rices Landing is home to Pumpkin Run Park, which is owned and maintained by the borough. The park opens on Memorial Day and closes on Labor Day. Located in the downtown area is the Greene River Bike and Walking Trail, which is a continuing project that reaches from Fredericktown to Crucible.

The Rice&#x27;s Landing Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

==Government==
Rices Landing&#x27;s local government is made up of five council members and the mayor of the town. Council members Mark L. Teegarden, Sr. (President), William M. Kozich, and Brennan Kozich.

==Education==
Some of Rices Landing is a part of the Jefferson-Morgan School District, which is located on 1334 Jefferson Road in Jefferson. The small, rural school offers one-on-one experience between students and teachers. Jefferson-Morgan consists of two schools: an elementary school ranging from grades K-6, and a middle and high school combined. The school colors are orange and black. In 2005, Jefferson-Morgan launched the campaign, &quot;Classrooms for the future,&quot; which focuses on bringing technology to the classroom. The campaign allows teachers to use technology as a teaching tool to better prepare students for the real world.

The other part of Rice&#x27;s Landing is part of the Carmichaels Area School District.
