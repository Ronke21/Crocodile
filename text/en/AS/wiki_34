<text>Defiance is a city in and the county seat of Defiance County, Ohio, United States. The population was 17,066 at the 2020 census. It is located at the confluence of the Auglaize and Maumee rivers about southwest of Toledo and northeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana, in Ohio&#x27;s northwestern corner.

==History==
The city contains the site of Fort Defiance, built by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne in August 1794 during the Northwest Indian War. Wayne surveyed the land and declared to General Charles Scott, &quot;I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it.&quot; Using the fort as a base of operations, Wayne ordered his troops to destroy Native American crops and villages within a radius of around the fort. Today a pair of cannons outside the city library on the Maumee River overlook the confluence and mark the location of Fort Defiance, along with a mounded outline of the fort walls. The city was named after Fort Defiance.

From Fort Defiance, the U.S. forces moved northeast along the Maumee River to fight the decisive Battle of Fallen Timbers near the current town of Maumee, Ohio. This victory secured for the United States the Northwest Territory, now the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.

Fort Winchester was built on the same spot during the War of 1812, but it was a larger fort that extended southward somewhat along the Auglaize River. Historical plaques in the sidewalks mark the full extent of Fort Winchester.

In 1822, Defiance was laid out as a town. In 1845, it was made the county seat of the newly created county, and it became a city in 1881.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Defiance lends its name to a distinct end moraine from the Wisconsin glaciation. As Cushing et al. point out, &quot;The Defiance moraine represents the last notable stand of the glacial front in this region.&quot; The moraine varies in width from , and according to Leverett, &quot;it is like a broad wave whose crest stands above the border of the plain outside it.&quot;

<doc id="129153" wikidata="Q1265164" url="?curid=129153" title="Earl Marshal">
<text>Earl Marshal (alternatively marschal or marischal) is a hereditary royal officeholder and chivalric title under the sovereign of the United Kingdom used in England (then, following the Act of Union 1800, in the United Kingdom). He is the eighth of the great officers of State in the United Kingdom, ranking beneath the Lord High Constable of England and above the Lord High Admiral. The dukes of Norfolk have held the office since 1672.

The marshal was originally responsible, along with the constable, for the monarch&#x27;s horses and stables including connected military operations. As a result of the decline of chivalry and sociocultural change, the position of earl marshal has evolved and among his responsibilities today is the organisation of major ceremonial state occasions such as the monarch&#x27;s coronation in Westminster Abbey and state funerals. He is also the leading officer of arms and oversees the College of Arms. He is the sole judge of the High Court of Chivalry.

The current earl marshal is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk, who inherited the position in June 2002. There were formerly an Earl Marshal of Ireland and an Earl Marischal of Scotland.

==History==
The office of royal marshal existed in much of Europe, involving managing horses and protecting the monarch. In England, the office became hereditary under John FitzGilbert the Marshal (served c.1130–1165) after The Anarchy, and rose in prominence under his second son, William Marshal, later Earl of Pembroke. He served under several kings, acted as regent, and organised funerals and the regency during Henry III&#x27;s childhood. After passing through his daughter&#x27;s husband to the Earls of Norfolk, the post evolved into &quot;Earl Marshal&quot; and the title remained unchanged, even after the earldom of Norfolk became a dukedom.

In the Middle Ages, the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Constable were the officers of the king&#x27;s horses and stables. When chivalry declined in importance, the constable&#x27;s post declined and the Earl Marshal became the head of the College of Arms, the body concerned with all matters of genealogy and heraldry. In conjunction with the Lord High Constable, he had held a court, known as the Court of Chivalry, for the administration of justice in accordance with the law of arms, which was concerned with many subjects relating to military matters, such as ransom, booty and soldiers&#x27; wages, and including the misuse of armorial bearings.

In 1672, the office of Marshal of England and the title of Earl Marshal of England were made hereditary in the Howard family. In a declaration made on 16 June 1673 by Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, the Lord Privy Seal, in reference to a dispute over the exercise of authority over the Officers of Arms the powers of the Earl Marshal were stated as being &quot;to have power to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; [and] to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places&quot;. Additionally it was declared that no patents of arms or any ensigns of nobility should be granted, and no augmentation, alteration, or addition should be made to arms, without the consent of the Earl Marshal.

The Earl Marshal is considered the eighth of the Great Officers of State, with the Lord High Constable above him and only the Lord High Admiral beneath him. Nowadays, the Earl Marshal&#x27;s role has mainly to do with the organisation of major state ceremonies such as coronations and state funerals. Annually, the Earl Marshal helps organise the State Opening of Parliament. The Earl Marshal also remains to have charge over the College of Arms and no coat of arms may be granted without his warrant. As a symbol of his office, he carries a baton of gold with black finish at either end.

In the general order of precedence, the Earl Marshal is currently the highest hereditary position in the United Kingdom outside the Royal Family. Although other state and ecclesiastical officers rank above in precedence, they are not hereditary. The exception is the office of Lord Great Chamberlain, which is notionally higher than Earl Marshal and also hereditary. The holding of the Earl Marshalship secures the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s traditional position as the &quot;first peer&quot; of the land, above all other dukes.

The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, but the Act provided that the persons holding the office of Earl Marshal and, if a peer, the Lord Great Chamberlain continue for the time being to have seats so as to carry out their ceremonial functions in the House of Lords.

==Earls Marshal of England, 1386–present==
==Deputy Earls Marshal of England==
The position of Earl Marshal had a Deputy called the Knight Marshal from the reign of Henry VIII until the office was abolished in 1846.

&quot;Deputy Earls Marshal&quot; have been named at various times, discharging the responsibilities of the office during the minority or infirmity of the Earl Marshal. Prior to an Act of Parliament in 1824, Protestant deputies were required when the Earl Marshal was a Roman Catholic, which occurred frequently due to the Catholicism of the Norfolks.

<text>Delaware is a city in and the county seat of Delaware County, Ohio, United States. It is located near the center of Ohio, about north of Columbus as part of the Columbus metropolitan area. The population was 41,302 at the 2020 census. Delaware was founded in 1808 and was incorporated in 1816.

==History==
While the city and county of Delaware are named for the Delaware tribe, the city of Delaware itself was founded on a Mingo village called Pluggy&#x27;s Town. The first recorded settler was Joseph Barber in 1807. Shortly afterward, other men started settling in the area (according to the Delaware Historical Society); namely: Moses Byxbe, William Little, Solomon Smith, Elder Jacob Drake, Thomas Butler, and Ira Carpenter. In 1808, Moses Byxbe built the first framed house on William Street. Born in Delaware County in 1808, Charles Sweetser went on to become a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1849 to 1853. On March 11, 1808, a plan of the city was filed, marking the official founding of the town. Byxbe and the others planned the city to be originally on the east bank of the river, but it was switched to the west bank only a few days after the first plan was filed.

Even though Delaware was still a small community, in 1812, when the capital of Ohio was moved from Chillicothe, Delaware and Columbus were both in the running and Delaware lost by a single vote to Columbus. However, following the War of 1812, settlers began arriving in Delaware in greater numbers. Among some of the earliest settlers were the parents of Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th President of the United States. The Hayes home no longer stands, but a historical marker in front of a BP station marks the location. In 2018, the Rutherford B. Hayes Comes Home committee announced plans to raise $125,000 to get a statue of Hayes placed at the corners of William and Sandusky streets and a bust of Hayes to be placed at Rutherford B. Hayes High School. Committee Chairman Bill Rietz said that the committee would like to raise the money by October 4, 2019, Hayes&#x27; 197th birthday. The statue was successfully erected on October 4, 2019. It is a 125% scale depiction of the president, which stands at about 10 feet including its pedestal.

In the early days of the town, a sulfur spring was discovered northwest of Joseph Barber&#x27;s cabin. By 1833, a hotel was built as a health spa near the spring. However, the Mansion House Hotel was a failure, and by 1841, citizens began raising funds to purchase the hotel property with the intent of giving it to the Ohio and North Ohio Methodist Episcopal Conference of the Methodist Church for the purpose of a Methodist college. With that effort, Ohio Wesleyan University was founded in 1844.

Railroads came to the area in April, 1851 as Delaware served as a stop on the Cleveland Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. Additional rail lines were added to serve Delaware providing access to major cities and markets throughout the country by the late 1890s. At the turn of the century, Delaware could boast of its own electric street railway system. In the early 1930s, electric inter-urban service was provided by the Columbus, Delaware and Marion system.

===During the Civil War===
During the Civil War, Delaware was the home to two Union training camps. The first on the west side of the Olentangy River for white recruits of the 96th and 121st Ohio Volunteer Infantry were mustered into service. The second, on the east side of the Olentangy River was for African-Americans joining the army in Ohio in the 127th Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry - later renamed the 5th Regiment United States Colored Troops.

==Geography==

<doc id="129162" wikidata="Q2233834" url="?curid=129162" title="Powell, Ohio">
<text>Powell is a city in Delaware County, Ohio, United States, located 14 miles (21.5 km) north of the state capital of Columbus. Powell had an estimated population of 14,163 at the 2020 census. Founded in the early 1800s, it is now a suburb of Columbus.

==History==

===Early history===
Present-day Powell is located on land that was once a vast wilderness sparsely populated by Native Americans including the Huron, Wyandot, Miami, Delaware, Ottawa, Shawnee, Mingo, and Erie people. The region was surveyed by French Canadian and European explorers beginning in the 17th century; with Great Britain, France, and the Iroquois League claiming ownership of the land during periods of the 1600s and 1700s. By the 18th century, the land became part of that what is historically known as Ohio Country. During the American Revolution, the states of Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia claimed portions of the land during western expansion of the United States. The Land Ordinance of 1785 opened up the region to settlement by American pioneers, including veterans of the American Revolutionary War who had received bounty land warrants as compensation for their services. In 1787, the region was established as the Northwest Territory.

===Settlement and growth===
The first settlers arrived in present-day Powell on May 1, 1801. At the time, the land was deeded to Thomas R. Hall. By 1813, records indicate that the settlement became known as &quot;Middlebury&quot;, in possible reference to early settlers having come from Middlebury, Connecticut. Today, Powell maintains references to its heritage as Middlebury with multiple streets and housing developments applying the name.

The population of Middlebury remained small, with historical records suggesting that settlers held trades and occupations consistent with other small towns of time period. The settlement included farmers, milliners, buggy makers, and blacksmiths. In 1839, deed owner Thomas R. Hall purchased additional nearby land, and later opened a general store. Middlebury was renamed for him in 1850, becoming &quot;Hall&#x27;s Corner&quot;. According to historical records, a variant of this new name has been recorded as &quot;Hall Corners&quot;. In 1857, Hall&#x27;s Corner applied for an official post office, which required the approval of a judge. The village was renamed Powell in honor of the judge who approved the request.

The Columbus and Toledo Railroad (C&amp;T) arrived in Powell in 1872, which provided new opportunities for settlers. The primary purpose of the railroad was to transport coal from Appalachia to regions beyond Columbus. After merging with two other railroads in 1899, C&amp;T became part of the Hocking Valley Railway. As of 2021, much of the line still operates as the Columbus Subdivision freight line, owned by CSX Transportation.

Powell was incorporated as a municipality in 1947, and was later known as the &quot;Village of Powell&quot;. The population remained small until the late 1980s, when residential development expanding from the northern Columbus metropolitan area reached Powell. In 20 years, the population grew almost 1,500%, from 378 to over 6,000. In 2000, Powell officially became a city.

Between the years 2000 and 2010, Powell&#x27;s population nearly doubled again, largely due to the 2002 annexation of approximately 1,000 acres along the Sawmill Parkway extension north of Seldom Seen Road for the development of the Golf Village community.

===Liberty Township Separation Movement of 1995===
On February 21, 1995, Powell Village Council members voted 5-1 in favor of an ordinance requesting Delaware County Commissioners withdraw the Village of Powell from Liberty Township. The decision was made without soliciting a community vote, which prompted residents to mount a referendum drive in hope of placing the separation issue on the November ballot. The separation of Powell from Liberty Township would have left the Village without fire department services, and would have impacted master planning efforts of the community. Proponents of the separation insisted that Liberty Township was too dependent on inside millage; the approximately $95,000 yearly that Powell residents were paying into Liberty Township&#x27;s general fund.

Powell Village residents needed 74 signatures to place the issue on the November ballot. A group of residents from The Chase and The Retreat subdivisions collected 179 signatures and submitted them to village clerk Doris Moore, on March 8, 1995. However, the Village Council refused the petition, citing a technicality with Ohio Revised Code section 731.32. Dan Boyle, organizer of the referendum movement and then president of The Chase Homeowner&#x27;s Association, insisted that the petition had been properly executed according to local charter section 6.10, entitled &quot;Initiative and Referendum Petition Procedures.&quot;

Following the Council&#x27;s decision to refuse the petition, Powell resident and attorney Lawrence Walker urged Delaware County Prosecutor W. Duncan Whitney and Powell Mayor Jane VanFossen to take action. Mayor VanFossen ultimately decided that the Clerk of Council failed to perform her obligation of processing the petition, an action that therefore voided the separation legislation of the Council; Ordinance No. 93-54. Due to significant public interest generated in the wake of the petition, Powell&#x27;s Village Council agreed to place the issue on the ballot of the August 8 special election. Of the 384 residents in Powell that voted on the separation, 98 (26%) voted for the separation, and 286 (74%) voted against the separation. Powell was subsequently not removed from the Township, and an amicable relationship between the City of Powell and Liberty Township has continued ever since.

==Geography==
The city sits between the Scioto and Olentangy Rivers, about 14 miles (21.5 km) north of the state capital of Columbus, centered on the intersection of State Route 750 and C.R.9; known as Liberty Street within the City of Powell. This intersection is commonly referred to by residents as the &quot;Four Corners&quot;. It sits within Liberty Township, the site of the first settlement in Delaware County, Ohio. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Huron is a city in Erie County, Ohio, United States, located at the mouth of the Huron River on Lake Erie. The population was 6,922 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Sandusky micropolitan area.

==History==
Huron Township was at the center of the &quot;Firelands&quot; region of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The first permanent settler in the area that became Huron Township was a Quebec-born trapper, trader and interpreter named John Baptiste Flammand (or, &quot;Flemming&quot;; and often misspelled &quot;Flemmond&quot;), who established a trading post about 1805, approx. two miles inland upon the east bank of the Huron River. Other French traders had preceded him, including Gabriel Hunot in the 1780s.

Huron Township was established in 1809. Huron Village was later established between 1821 and 1824, when a town plat was surveyed, and port facilities at the mouth of the Huron River were developed; and the village quickly became a major shipbuilding center in the 1830s. [The current community of Huron is sometimes mistaken to have been the same as the &quot;town plat of Huron&quot; (also known as &quot;the old County Seat&quot; village), which was established about 1814, and was actually within the present Milan Township (formerly known as Avery Township before 1821).]

The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad greatly expanded Huron&#x27;s port on the east bank of the Huron River beginning in 1880. The first cargo of iron ore at the W&amp;LE docks was received May 21, 1884. The port is still in use today, accepting cargoes of iron ore and limestone from lake freighters. Huron was also the home port of several commercial fishing fleets before unbridled lake pollution decimated the industry on Lake Erie by the early 1970s. Water quality in Lake Erie has greatly improved as a result of strong environmental controls since then and sport fishing has increased in popularity in the area. However, the Lake faces new threats from algal blooms and several invasive species such as zebra mussels and Asian carp that may impact sport fishing in the future.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Demographics==
The median income for a household in the city was $59,766, and the median income for a family was $73,068. Male full-time, year-round workers had a median income of $51,003 versus $41,667 for female full-time, year-round workers. The per capita income for the city was $29,213. About 2.5% of families and 5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.6% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.

===2010 Census===
As of the 2010 census, there were 7,149 people, 3,073 households, and 1,988 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,710 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 96.4% White, 0.9% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.3% from other races, and 1.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.3% of the population.

There were 3,073 households, of which 29.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.6% were married couples living together, 10.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 35.3% were non-families. 29.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.84.

The median age in the city was 43.9 years. 22.7% of residents were under the age of 18; 6.7% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 22% were from 25 to 44; 30.2% were from 45 to 64; and 18.4% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.1% male and 51.9% female.

==Economy==
Commercial and industrial development of Huron had historically been centered around the riverfront port area. By the early 1960s a busy downtown business district had developed, serving local residents and summer tourists. However, with improvements to U.S. Route 6 and Ohio Route 2 bypassing the downtown area and enabling quicker travel to larger neighboring cities, downtown Huron went into decline. Starting in 1967, the City of Huron embarked on a controversial urban renewal program with funding from various programs of the U.S. federal government, such as the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the State of Ohio. The city purchased, in some cases by eminent domain, and demolished 38 commercial buildings and private homes. It then built a municipal marina, called the Huron Boat Basin, as the focal point of a new downtown. While the &quot;Boat Basin&quot; has become a popular community park and gathering place, extensive redevelopment of the downtown area did not occur as quickly as envisioned. New industry and commercial development has more recently occurred on the southern and western city limits and suburbs.

===ConAgra site renewal===
On July 18, 2006, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) announced the purchase of the ConAgra Foods facility in Huron. Concurrently, ConAgra Foods announced the closure of the grain elevator. The 19.8-acre (80,000 m2) parcel is a key piece of Huron&#x27;s waterfront. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Division of Watercraft has completed a public boating and fishing access site with launch ramps, docks and parking facilities. The City of Huron assumed title to the former grain silos and flour mill and received a grant to demolish the building, which was completed in August 2012. It envisions a future riverfront development to include restaurants, retail stores, condominiums and greenspace.

On January 8, 2012, much of the former Con-Agra mill structure was demolished by implosion in a public event attracting media attention and a large crowd. The former grain silos were removed by manual demolition.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
The Huron City School District has three schools for each level of public education:
* Woodlands Elementary School
* McCormick Junior High School
* Huron High School

Huron City Schools sports teams are known as the &quot;Tigers&quot;. The Huron Tigers have recorded numerous athletic successes for both boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; scholastic sports competitions.

===Postsecondary===
BGSU Firelands, a branch campus of Bowling Green State University, is located just west of the city limits. A separate college of the Bowling Green State University system, BGSU Firelands has been a regional campus of Bowling Green since 1968. Over 2,000 students in 2006 were enrolled for a wide variety of associate, bachelors and graduate degree programs. Huron was also the home of the &quot;Huron Playhouse&quot;, formerly a division of Bowling Green State University&#x27;s Department of Theater and Film before becoming an independent, non-profit corporation.

<doc id="129170" wikidata="Q2668473" url="?curid=129170" title="Kelleys Island, Ohio">
<text>Kelleys Island is both a village in Erie County, Ohio, and the island which it fully occupies in Lake Erie. The island has a total area of and was formed by glacial action on limestone and dolomite.

As of the 2020 census it has a year-round population of under 300 and is primarily a vacation destination with a large seasonal influx of visitors and workers.

==History==
Kelleys Island was previously occupied by Native Americans of the area. During the beginning of the War of 1812, the island was used as a military rendezvous post, first by the British and later by the U.S. Military. The British originally called it Sandusky Island. Later the United States took it over and officially designated it as Island Number 6 and Cunningham Island. During the early 19th century, the island was mostly uninhabited. 
It was renamed as Kelleys Island in 1840 by brothers Datus and Irad Kelley, who had purchased nearly the entire island.

After the Kelley brothers purchased the land, there was commercial development through extraction of the island&#x27;s limestone and lumber resources, and the population began to grow with workers and families. There was also growing of grapes as a commodity crop. As of the 2010 census, the island&#x27;s population was 312.

Today, Kelleys Island is primarily a vacation destination, and is visited by thousands of people each summer. Notable attractions include its various beaches, parks, and campgrounds. Several ferries provide regular transport to the mainland for most travelers; the island also features a number of marinas, as well as a small airfield for private planes. It is the largest of the American Lake Erie Islands, and is a part of the Sandusky, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

===Native Americans and Inscription Rock===
Kelleys Island is a Devonian limestone and dolomite ridge carved during the Pleistocene era. The first known occupants of Kelleys Island were Algonquian and Iroquoian, possibly including Erie, who travelled through the area to fish and at times lived in the area until 1656.

On the south shore of the island (near what is now the downtown-village area), there is a large limestone rock featuring petroglyphs carved over a number of years by these and earlier indigenous inhabitants; it was later named &#x27;Inscription Rock&#x27; by scholars in the mid-19th century. The Kelleys Island Historical Association relies on the Henry Rowe Schoolcraft investigations, which dated the carvings to roughly 1643. He theorized that the rock was used by members of &quot;seasonal&quot; Native American tribes, to impart information to one another about how the hunting had been in the area, and where their group would next be traveling.

Many different items and scenes are cut into the large flat top side of the rock, which measures by 21 feet (10 by 6 m). Over time, most of the inscriptions on this rock have been eroded away. The indigenous peoples who are thought to have inscribed these images are said to have been annihilated about 1665 by Iroquois nations from the New York area, who were trying to conquer territory to control the fur trade.

===Early European settlers===
This island is called &quot;Sandusky Island&quot; on maps produced in the latter half of the 18th-century. (Prior to U.S. occupation of this area, the name &quot;Cunningham&#x27;s Island&quot; seems to have been applied to present-day &quot;Catawba Island&quot;, which was then also a true island.) In the late 1790s the Connecticut Land Company surveyed the south east shore of Lake Erie. A more thorough survey was completed in 1806, when this island was officially designated as &quot;Island Number 6&quot;. Later the name &quot;Cunningham&#x27;s Island&quot; was used to refer to this island.

There is a legend that the first European American resident of this island was a man named &quot;Cunningham&quot; (supposedly a &quot;Frenchman&quot; or French-speaking Canadian). He was said to have traveled to the island in 1803 with the intention of making his home there, at a time when it was still inhabited by Native Americans. For a while, Cunningham enjoyed friendly relationship with the native people: he built a log cabin near their village, socialized with their hunters, and traded goods with them on a regular basis. But (as the legend goes) Cunningham had a disagreement with the Native Americans, and a group tore down his home, stole all his possessions, and attempted to kill him. He escaped to the Ohio Peninsula via canoe, but died shortly afterward from his wounds. For many years after his death, the island was known as Cunningham Island. [ However, the legend of Mr. Cunningham might instead apply to present-day Catawba Island, which seems to have been formerly named &quot;Cunningham&#x27;s Island&quot; by the British, prior to 1804.) (*-Also note that the surname &#x27;Cunningham&#x27; is not typically of French origin, but is recorded as of Scottish origin.)] Prior to the War of 1812, several other white adventurers are documented as trying to settle this island, but all of them were eventually being driven away, either by the native people, or by the incoming U.S. pioneers and land-owners. By the time the war had ended, the few remaining Native Americans had finally also vacated the island.

During the War of 1812, the west shore of Cunningham Island was developed as a military rendezvous post by US General William Henry Harrison. In 1818, a man named Killam briefly attempted to start a logging company, but abandoned the island after the large steam-powered boat he used to transport wood to the mainland wrecked and sank. Around 1826, people slowly began settling on the island; by 1830, six families made up its entire population.

About the year 1833, Ben Napier, a Scottish-American veteran of the War of 1812, claimed ownership of this &quot;Cunningham Island&quot; (and also nearby Put-in-Bay), through squatters rights. Napier and his associates often bullied the incoming pioneer settlers, sometimes hijacking their cabins and stealing or killing their livestock. Napier was eventually legally ousted after the court system ruled that he had no ownership rights. In April 1842, he was sentenced to five years in the penitentiary for making false claims of ownership while under oath. Napier was the father of both Nelson Napier, captain of the PS &quot;Alpena&quot; when she sank with no survivors in October 1880, and Joseph Napier, a Life-Saving Service station keeper.

===Acquisition by the Kelleys===
In 1830, John Clemons and his brother began mining the island&#x27;s limestone, and opened its first quarry. They built a dock on the north side in order to ship the rock to the American mainland. Shortly afterward, brothers Datus and Irad Kelley became aware of the island&#x27;s potential worth, and slowly began purchasing its land in parcels.

Datus and Irad Kelley were born in Middlefield, Connecticut, on April 24, 1788, and October 24, 1791, respectively. Datus moved to Rocky River, Ohio, in 1811, working as a surveyor and sawmill owner. Irad moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1812, eventually becoming a successful merchant, postmaster, sailor, and real-estate investor. Irad Kelley first became aware of the island after being forced to seek shelter there while transporting goods via sloop sailboat from Detroit to his shop in Cleveland. On August 20, 1833, the two began purchasing parcels of land on Cunningham Island at the rate of $1.50 per acre. They eventually owned the entire island, and in 1840 changed its name to Kelleys Island. By this time, the population had risen to 68 people.
The brothers quickly began improving and expanding the island&#x27;s docks to export limestone, fruit, and red cedar lumber. Soon, 16 limestone kilns were producing lime. The village&#x27;s various industries hired a number of immigrants (including young children), many of whom would work on the island during the summer and return to their homeland during the winter. Among the nationalities working on the island at that time were Irish, Poles, Slavs, Macedonians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, Italians, and Portuguese. Datus Kelley encouraged sobriety, and paid his employees bonuses for abstaining from &quot;intoxifying liquors&quot;.

The quarries were the origin of the Kelley Island Lime &amp; Transport Company, which was once the largest producer of limestone and lime products in the world, operating between 1896 and the early 1960s. Numerous ruins of these operations and quarries now dot the island.

In 1842, Charles Carpenter (son-in-law of Datus Kelley) of Norwich, Connecticut, began growing and harvesting grapes for wine on Kelleys Island. By the early 20th century, the island was annually producing 500,000 gallons of wine per year.

The small village grew quickly, and soon a library and post office were erected. In 1901, the Estes Schoolhouse was built at a cost of $15,000.

===Recent history and modern day===
Kelleys Island is heavily forested except for several residential areas, some for year-round residents, others for summer vacationers. Some small farms and a small limestone quarry still operate on the island. Each summer since 1974 (typically in August), the island hosts a weekend-long homecoming festival, which includes a theme parade featuring both locals and vacationers, a picnic, and a number of food and craft booths.
Kelleys Island has a cemetery located on Division Street, about a mile north from the center of downtown. Although the cemetery is relatively small, several hundred people are buried or have memorial headstones there. Burials include that of Datus Kelley.

In 1975, on the island&#x27;s southern shore were designated as a historic district, the Kelleys Island South Shore District, and added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1988, the district was renamed to the Kelleys Island Historic District and expanded to include the entire island.

Kelleys Island is one of 20 members of the Great Lakes Islands Alliance, which includes islands in the US and Canada. Other member islands include nearby Middle Bass, South Bass, and Pelee as well as Lake Michigan&#x27;s Beaver and Washington Islands, Lake Ontario&#x27;s Amherst, Howe, Simcoe, and Wolfe Islands, Lake Huron&#x27;s Bois Blanc, Drummond, Les Cheneaux, Mackinac, Manitoulin, Neebish, St. Joseph, and Sugar Islands, Lake Superior&#x27;s Madeline Island, and Lake St. Clair&#x27;s Harsens Island.

==Tourism==
Kelleys Island is primarily a vacation destination. It is one of only 17 islands in the Great Lakes that has a year-round population.

===Beaches and wildlife===
Kelleys Island features a number of public beaches. Many areas allow swimming, boating, and fishing.

In August 2010, a report from The Nature Conservancy in conjunction with the US Fish and Wildlife Service U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, and several other non-profit agencies listed Kelleys as the 7th most ecologically threatened island in the Great Lakes. The reasons given for the island&#x27;s poor ecological health included &quot;development, tourism and recreation, marinas and resorts, increased roads and buildings, incompatible agricultural practices and invasive species.&quot;

===Businesses===
The most common types of establishments on Kelleys Island are pubs and restaurants, almost all of which have a summer season from May into September. The island also features a coffee shop, miniature golf course, several small general/convenience stores, and a large number of gift shops. No liquor is sold on the island outside of bars or restaurants, but several shops do sell beer and wine.

The island is also home to The Kelley&#x27;s Island Wine Company, established in 1872 and at one time one of the nation&#x27;s largest wineries. It stopped operation after two major fires eventually destroyed its facility during the Prohibition era. The &#x27;ruins&#x27; of portions of the late-19th-century winery are still standing on the island. In 1982 the Zettler family re-established The Kelley&#x27;s Island Wine at the site of one of the oldest stone cottages on the island, known as the Nicholas Smith house (built c. 1865).

===Camps===

Kelleys Island State Park contains a large campground.

Camp Patmos, a Christian youth camp, is located on the northeast side of the island. Camp Patmos was purchased in 1952 from Nativity B.V.M. Parish of Cleveland as the site of a faith-based summer camp for youth.

The Erie County 4H Camp is located on the north side of the island.

==Transportation==
===Ferries===
The first ferry to regularly serve the island was the Neuman Ferry, founded in 1907 by John Paul Neuman. The boat originally provided transport from Lakeside, Ohio to what is now East Harbor State Park on Catawba Island (which is actually a peninsula). Eventually, he began service to the islands as well, including Kelleys. At its peak, the company operated a fleet of four ferries: the &quot;Commuter&quot;, the &quot;Corsair&quot;, the &quot;Kelleys Islander&quot;, usually running out of Marblehead; and the &quot;Challenger&quot; running out of Sandusky. The company folded in the first decade of the 21st century due to financial mismanagement, excessive growth with low market share, and steep price competition by the recently established Kelleys Island Ferry.

The Kelleys Island Ferry is the only line that runs year-round (weather permitting) between the island and the mainland. The line is owned by James &quot;Jim&quot; Palladino and his family. Palladino was tied by local media to the Cleveland Mafia. He was arrested in 1992 for being a felon in possession of over 60 firearms (it is illegal for an individual in Ohio to own any guns if previously convicted of a felony). After the Neuman Ferry line closed, Palladino had purchased several boats from the company, as well their dock on the island. The private ferry runs to Marblehead, Ohio every half-hour during the tourist season, with the ride lasting approximately 25 minutes.

A competing ferry line named the Jet Express runs during the season multiple times daily from Sandusky, and Cedar Point to Kelleys Island. The boat line started in 1988; it operates from May through September. It is a passenger-only ferry, and does not carry vehicles. The Jet Express runs from Sandusky, Ohio and makes stops at Cedar Point, Kelleys Island, and Put-In-Bay. The Jet Express boat takes approximately 25 minutes for the trip from Sandusky.

===Airport===
The east side contains a small public airport, called the Kelleys Island Land Field Airport (FAA LID: 89D). It features a terminal building, a single runway, and a parking area for planes.

===Highways===

Kelleys Island is served by Ohio State Route 575. The route was created in 1937 and has not changed since, and is one of Ohio&#x27;s only state highways to be disconnected from the rest of the system.

===Other===
Due to the island&#x27;s small size, many people use bicycles, golf carts and motor scooters as their regular transportation while there. Automobiles can be transported to the island via ferry; though most roads are modern, some streets on the north side as well as near the quarries are unpaved.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Geology===
Kelleys Island consists of Middle Devonian (Eifelian Stage) limestones and dolomites, the Lucas Dolostone, and the Columbus Limestone. The Lucas Dolostone is intensely dolomitized. With the exception of localized algal mounds and stromatoporoids, it is sparsely fossiliferous. Several species of stromatoporoids, which represent four genera, have been recorded from the Lucas Dolostone of Kelleys Island. The Lucas Dolostone accumulated within coastal subtidal to peritidal mudflats. These mudflats were permanently submerged and progressively buried beneath muddy shoal and lagoonal sediments as relative sea level rose and the shoreline shifted westward during the Eifelian Stage.
Overlying the Lucas Dolostone, is the Columbus Limestone, which consists of the lowermost Bellepoint Member, middle Marblehead Member, and uppermost Venice Member. The Bellepoint Member consists of wackestones and packstones, which accumulated as muddy shoals and contain a large number of rugose corals, gastropods, rostroconchs, and brachiopods. The Marblehead Member consists of a lower, thick-bedded, cherty, dolomitic, heavily-burrowed mudstone deposited in lagoonal conditions below mean wave base. These mudstones grade upward into thinner bedded, sparsely fossiliferous packstones and grainstones of this member&#x27;s upper part that accumulated as subtidal shoals. A rippled, hardground surface forms the top of the Marblehead Member This hardground represents either a period of subaerial erosion or the lack of sediment accumulation at a shallow depth for a significant interval of time. The Marblehead Member is overlain by mudstones and wackestones of the uppermost Venice Member of the Columbus Limestone. This member accumulated below wave base in the open sea after relative sea level rose again.

The Devonian limestone and dolomite that comprise Kelleys Island has been deeply eroded and scoured by the Laurentide Ice Sheet over the Pleistocene. On the island, the largest exposure of glacial grooves and striations created by glacial erosion is preserved in Glacial Grooves State Memorial, which is associated with Kelleys Island State Park. Within the Memorial, giant glacial grooves in a depression about wide and deep are exposed in an outcrop about long. Near the east edge of the outcrop, a number of the grooves are relatively straight, smooth, and exhibit striated surfaces. Farther west, the path of the individual grooves becomes far more tortuous, and striations are less distinct and fewer in number.

Munro-Stasiuk and others argue that the giant glacial grooves and the depression, in which they lie, were eroded by highly turbulent, high velocity, sediment-laden meltwater flows. Judging from similar tortuous, giant, glacial grooves, which are found all over, and between, the Lake Erie islands on high and low areas, the erosional features are interpreted to have formed during a subglacial meltwater megaflood that took place before or near the Last Glacial Maximum.

<doc id="129190" wikidata="Q784786" url="?curid=129190" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">
<text>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (), often simply referred to as the Charter in Canada, is a bill of rights entrenched in the Constitution of Canada, forming the first part of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The &quot;Charter&quot; guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and guarantees the civil rights of everyone in Canada. It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights. The &quot;Charter&quot; was proclaimed in force by Queen Elizabeth II of Canada on April 17, 1982, as part of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

The &quot;Charter&quot; was preceded by the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, enacted in 1960, which was a federal statute rather than a constitutional document. The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; exemplified an international trend towards formalizing human rights protections following the United Nations&#x27; &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;, instigated by the country&#x27;s movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II. As a federal statute, the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; could be amended through the ordinary legislative process and had no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;, showing reluctance to declare laws inoperative. Between 1960 and 1982, only five of the thirty-five cases concerning the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; that were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada resulted in a successful outcome for claimants. The relative ineffectiveness of the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The British Parliament formally enacted the &quot;Charter&quot; as a part of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; at the request of the Parliament of Canada in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

The &quot;Charter&quot; greatly expanded the scope of judicial review, because the &quot;Charter&quot; is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;. Canadian courts, when confronted with violations of &quot;Charter&quot; rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. The &quot;Charter&quot;, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada&#x27;s parent country the United Kingdom, was based upon Parliamentary supremacy. As a result, the &quot;Charter&quot; has attracted both broad support from a majority of the electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power. The &quot;Charter&quot; applies only to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.

==Features==

Under the &quot;Charter&quot;, people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the &quot;Charter&quot; does not define the corporation as a &quot;legal person&quot;), but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6) only to citizens of Canada. The rights are enforceable by the courts through section 24 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the &quot;Charter&quot; and might damage the reputation of the justice system. Section 32 confirms that the &quot;Charter&quot; is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.

===Exceptions===
Section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, known as the &quot;limitations clause&quot;, allows governments to justify certain infringements of &quot;Charter&quot; rights. If a court finds that a &quot;Charter&quot; right has been infringed, it conducts an analysis under section 1 by applying the &quot;Oakes&quot; test, a form of proportionality review. Infringements are upheld if the government&#x27;s objective in infringing the right is &quot;pressing and substantial&quot; in a &quot;free and democratic society&quot;, and if the infringement can be &quot;demonstrably justified&quot;. The Supreme Court of Canada has applied the &quot;Oakes&quot; test to uphold laws against hate speech (e.g., in &quot;R v Keegstra&quot;) and obscenity (e.g., in &quot;R v Butler&quot;). Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the &quot;Charter&quot; are guaranteed.

In addition, some &quot;Charter&quot; rights are subject to the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot; (section 33). The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7 through 15 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly. In the past, the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of Quebec (which did not support the enactment of the &quot;Charter&quot; but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a strike and to protect an exclusively heterosexual definition of marriage, respectively. In 2021, the government of Ontario under Premier Doug Ford invoked the notwithstanding clause in order to push through Bill 307, the &quot;Protecting Elections and Defending Democracy Act&quot;, doubling the amount of time election advertisements could run to 1 year from 6 months. In 2006, the territory of Yukon also passed legislation that invoked the notwithstanding clause, but the legislation was never proclaimed in force.

=== Rights and freedoms ===
The rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the &quot;Charter&quot; include:

====Fundamental freedoms====

;Section 2: lists what the &quot;Charter&quot; calls &quot;fundamental freedoms&quot; namely freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and of other media of communication, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association. In case law, this clause is cited as the reason for the religious neutrality of the state.

====Democratic rights====
Generally, the right to participate in political activities and the right to a democratic form of government are protected:
;Section 3 : the right to vote and to be eligible to serve as member of the House of Commons and provincial and territorial legislative assemblies.
;Section 4 : the maximum duration of the House of Commons and legislative assemblies is set at five years.
;Section 5 : an annual sitting of Parliament and legislatures is required.

====Mobility rights====

;Section 6: protects the mobility rights of Canadian citizens which include the right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada. Citizens and permanent residents have the ability to move to and take up residence in any province to pursue gaining livelihood.

====Legal rights====
Rights of people in dealing with the justice system and law enforcement are protected:

;Section 7: right to life, liberty, and security of the person.
;Section 8: freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
;Section 9: freedom from arbitrary detention or imprisonment.
;Section 10 :right to legal counsel and the guarantee of habeas corpus.
;Section 11: rights in criminal and penal matters such as the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
;Section 12 :right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment.
;Section 13 :rights against self-incrimination.
;Section 14 :right to an interpreter in a court proceeding.

====Equality rights====

;Section 15 :equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.

====Language rights====
Generally, people have the right to use either the English or French language in communications with Canada&#x27;s federal government and certain provincial governments. Specifically, the language laws in the &quot;Charter&quot; include:

;Section 16: English and French are the official languages of Canada and New Brunswick.
;Section 16.1: the English and French-speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights to educational and cultural institutions.
;Section 17: the right to use either official language in Parliament or the New Brunswick legislature.
;Section 18: the statutes and proceedings of Parliament and the New Brunswick legislature are to be printed in both official languages.
;Section 19 :both official languages may be used in federal and New Brunswick courts.
;Section 20 :the right to communicate with and be served by the federal and New Brunswick governments in either official language.
;Section 21 :other constitutional language rights outside the &quot;Charter&quot; regarding English and French are sustained.
;Section 22 :existing rights to use languages besides English and French are not affected by the fact that only English and French have language rights in the &quot;Charter&quot;. (Hence, if there are any rights to use Aboriginal languages anywhere they would continue to exist, though they would have no direct protection under the &quot;Charter&quot;.)

====Minority language education rights====

;Section 23: rights for certain citizens belonging to French and English speaking minority communities to have their children educated in their own language.

====Other sections====
The remaining provisions help to clarify how the &quot;Charter&quot; works in practice.

;Section 24 :establishes how courts may enforce the &quot;Charter&quot;.
;Section 25 :states that the &quot;Charter&quot; does not derogate existing Aboriginal rights and freedoms. Aboriginal rights, including treaty rights, receive more direct constitutional protection under section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.
;Section 26 :clarifies that other rights and freedoms in Canada are not invalidated by the &quot;Charter&quot;.
;Section 27 :requires the &quot;Charter&quot; to be interpreted in a multicultural context.
;Section 28: states all &quot;Charter&quot; rights are guaranteed equally to men and women.
;Section 29: confirms the rights of separate schools are preserved.
;Section 30: clarifies the applicability of the &quot;Charter&quot; in the territories.
;Section 31: confirms that the &quot;Charter&quot; does not extend the powers of legislatures.
;Section 34: states that Part I of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, containing the first 34 sections of the act, may be collectively referred to as the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

==History==
Many of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the &quot;Charter&quot;, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus, and the presumption of innocence, have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights. Many of these rights were also included in the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the &quot;Charter&quot;, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, applicable only to the federal government, and could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament. Moreover, the courts chose to interpret the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; only sparingly, and only on rare occasions applied it to find a contrary law inoperative. Additionally, the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada.

The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater interest within the government in constitutional reform. Such reforms would not only improve the safeguarding of rights, but would also amend the Constitution to free Canada from the authority of British Parliament (also known as &quot;patriation&quot;), ensuring the full sovereignty of Canada. Subsequently, Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including Walter Tarnopolsky. Strayer&#x27;s report advocated a number of ideas that would later be evident in the &quot;Charter&quot;, including the protection of language rights; exclusion of economic rights; and the allowance of limitations on rights, which would be included in the &quot;Charter&quot;″s limitation and notwithstanding clauses. In 1968, Strayer was made the director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office, followed in 1974 by his appointment as assistant deputy Minister of Justice. During these years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.

=== &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; ===
Meanwhile, Trudeau, who had become Liberal leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal and provincial governments discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation, resulting in the Victoria Charter in 1971, which was never implemented. Trudeau continued his efforts, however, promising constitutional change during the 1980 Quebec referendum. He succeeded in 1982 with the passage of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; in the British Parliament, which enacted the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; as part of the Constitution of Canada.

The inclusion of a charter of rights in the patriation process was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980, where he announced his intention of a just society and constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include: fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of movement, democratic guarantees, legal rights, language rights and equality rights. However, Trudeau did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal gained popular support, provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers. The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges, should courts be called upon to enforce rights. Additionally, the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada&#x27;s old form of government. At a suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau&#x27;s government thus agreed to a committee of senators and members of Parliament (MPs) to further examine the bill as well as the patriation plan. During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television, while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the draft charter″s flaws and omissions and how to remedy them. As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the &quot;Charter&quot;, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of civil libertarians, judges could now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of &quot;Charter&quot; rights in certain circumstances, something the &quot;Charter&quot; was not originally going to provide for.

As the process continued, more features were added to the &quot;Charter&quot;, including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees, and recognition of Canada&#x27;s multiculturalism. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on the justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.

In its decision in the &quot;Patriation Reference&quot; (1981), the Supreme Court ruled there was a constitutional convention that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the &quot;Charter&quot;″s merits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the federal attorney general Jean Chrétien, Ontario&#x27;s justice minister Roy McMurtry, and Saskatchewan&#x27;s justice minister Roy Romanow. Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have jurisdiction over property) and from the New Democratic Party, also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property.

==== Quebec ====
Quebec did not support the &quot;Charter&quot; (or the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;), with conflicting interpretations as to why. The opposition could have owed to the Parti Québécois (PQ) leadership being allegedly uncooperative because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec. This could have owed to the exclusion of Quebec leaders from the negotiation of the Kitchen Accord, which they saw as being too centralist. It could have also owed to objections by provincial leaders to the accord&#x27;s provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment. The PQ leaders also opposed the inclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights. The &quot;Charter&quot; is applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the constitution. However, Quebec&#x27;s opposition to the 1982 patriation package led to two failed attempts to amend the constitution (the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec&#x27;s political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.

=== Following 1982 ===
While the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was adopted in 1982, it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15) came into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities.

==== Amendments ====

The &quot;Charter&quot; has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding Aboriginal land claims, while section 16.1 was added in 1993. There have also been a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the &quot;Charter&quot;, including the failed Charlottetown Accord of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the &quot;Charter&quot; to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec&#x27;s distinct society, and would have added further statements to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights, and about minority language communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the &quot;Charter&quot;″s individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.

==Interpretation and enforcement==
The task of interpreting and enforcing the &quot;Charter&quot; falls to the courts, with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter. Litigation involving the charter may be referred to as a Charter challenge.

With the &quot;Charter&quot;″s supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism. However, under section 24 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials. Courts have since made many important decisions, including &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot; (1988), which struck down Canada&#x27;s abortion law, and &quot;Vriend v Alberta&quot; (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province&#x27;s exclusion of sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds of discrimination violated the equality rights under section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read the protection into the law.

Courts may receive &quot;Charter&quot; questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a criminal law that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the &quot;Charter&quot;, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government. A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case &quot;Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot; (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of Prince Edward Island initiated the &quot;Provincial Judges Reference&quot; by asking its provincial Supreme Court a question on judicial independence under section 11.

In several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the &quot;Charter&quot;, including the Oakes test (section 1), set out in the case &quot;R v Oakes&quot; (1986); and the Law test (section 15), developed in &quot;Law v Canada&quot; (1999) which has since become defunct. Since &quot;Reference Re BC Motor Vehicle Act&quot; (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of fundamental justice (i.e., natural justice or due process) under section 7 have been adopted.

=== Purposive and generous interpretation ===
In general, courts have embraced a purposive interpretation of &quot;Charter&quot; rights. This means that since early cases, such as &quot;Hunter v Southam Inc&quot; (1984) and &quot;R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd&quot; (1985), they have concentrated less on the traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the &quot;Charter&quot; was adopted in 1982. Rather, focus has been given towards changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose. This is tied to the &quot;generous interpretation&quot; of rights, as the purpose of the &quot;Charter&quot; provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.

Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg (2003) has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined. The approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician Ted Morton and political scientist Rainer Knopff have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they believe in the validity of the living tree doctrine, which is the basis for the approach (and the tradition term for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), they argue &quot;Charter&quot; case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied correctly, Morton and Knopff (2000) claim, &quot;the elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow.&quot; The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same, but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to &quot;create new rights&quot;. As an example, the authors note that the &quot;Charter&quot; right against self-incrimination has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.

=== Other interpretations ===
Another general approach to interpreting &quot;Charter&quot; rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections, such as the U.S. Bill of Rights (which had influenced aspects of the &quot;Charter&quot;) and the Constitution of South Africa. However, international precedent is only of guiding value and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the U.S. Bill of Rights as being &quot;born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances&quot;.

Advocacy groups frequently intervene in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the &quot;Charter&quot;. Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian Labour Congress, the Women&#x27;s Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), and REAL Women of Canada. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.

A further approach to the &quot;Charter&quot;, taken by the courts, is the dialogue principle, which involves greater participation by elected governments. This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.

==Comparisons with other human rights documents==

Some Canadian members of Parliament saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy. Hogg (2003) has speculated that the reason for the British adoption of the Human Rights Act 1998, which allows the European Convention on Human Rights to be enforced directly in domestic courts, is partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian &quot;Charter&quot;.

The Canadian &quot;Charter&quot; bears a number of similarities to the European Convention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document. Because of this similarity with European human rights law, the Supreme Court turns not only to the United States Constitution case law in interpreting the &quot;Charter&quot;, but also to European Court of Human Rights cases.

===Canadian &quot;Charter&quot; vs. U.S. &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;===
The core distinction between the U.S. &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; and the Canadian &quot;Charter&quot; is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively. However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right. In contrast, rights under the U.S. Bill are absolute, thus a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights. Canada&#x27;s fundamental justice (section 7) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is the U.S. equivalent.

Freedom of expression (section 2) also has a wider-ranging scope than the freedom of speech guaranteed under the U.S. First Amendment (1A). For instance, a form of picketing, though involving speech that might have otherwise been protected, was deemed as disruptive conduct and not protected by the U.S. 1A, but was considered by the Supreme Court in &quot;RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.&quot; (1986). The Supreme Court would rule the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, as fully protected under section 2 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, after which section 1 would be used to argue the injunction against the picketing as just.

The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the U.S. For example, the Supreme Court has upheld some of Quebec&#x27;s limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.

The un-ratified Equal Rights Amendment in the U.S., which garnered many critics when proposed, performs a similar function to that of the &quot;Charter&quot; section 28, which received no comparable opposition. Still, Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of section 28, which had not been part of the original draft of the Charter.

Another difference from the U.S. Bill of Rights is that the &quot;Charter&quot; does not provide any right to possess firearms. In 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously rejected a constitutional challenge to the federal &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, ruling that it was within the federal criminal law power.

=== Comparisons to other documents ===
The &quot;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&quot; has several parallels with the Canadian &quot;Charter&quot;, but in some cases the &quot;Covenant&quot; goes further with regard to rights in its text. For example, a right to legal aid has been read into section 10 of the &quot;Charter&quot; (right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay &quot;if he does not have sufficient means&quot;.

Canada&#x27;s &quot;Charter&quot; has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the &quot;Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; and with the &quot;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&quot;. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into the rights to security of the person (section 7) and equality rights (section 15) to make the Charter similar to the &quot;Covenant&quot;. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.

The &quot;Charter&quot; itself influenced the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa. The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. Likewise, Jamaica&#x27;s &quot;Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms&quot; was also influenced, in part, by Canada&#x27;s &quot;Charter&quot;.

==The &quot;Charter&quot; and national values==

The &quot;Charter&quot; was intended to be a source of Canadian values and national unity. As Professor Alan Cairns noted, &quot;the initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity&quot;. Pierre Trudeau himself later wrote in his &quot;Memoirs (1993)&quot; that &quot;Canada itself&quot; could now be defined as a &quot;society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom&quot;, and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.

The &quot;Charter&quot;″s unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights. According to author Rand Dyck (2000), some scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights, &quot;was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned&quot;. Through the mobility and language rights, French Canadians, who have been at the centre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not confined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based), which would polarize the country along regional lines. The &quot;Charter&quot; was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty.

Former premier of Ontario Bob Rae has stated that the &quot;Charter&quot; &quot;functions as a symbol for all Canadians&quot; in practice because it represents the core value of freedom. Academic Peter Russell has been more skeptical of the &quot;Charter&quot;″s value in this field. Cairns, who feels the &quot;Charter&quot; is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians, and that the &quot;Charter&quot; was meant to shape the Canadian identity, has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians. It has also been noted that issues like abortion and pornography, raised by the &quot;Charter&quot;, tend to be controversial. Still, opinion polls in 2002 showed Canadians felt the &quot;Charter&quot; significantly represented Canada, although many were unaware of the document&#x27;s actual contents.

The only values mentioned by the &quot;Charter&quot;″s preamble are recognition of the supremacy of God and the rule of law, but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP Svend Robinson brought forward a failed proposal before the House of Commons of Canada that would have amended the &quot;Charter&quot; by removing the mention of God, as he felt it did not reflect Canada&#x27;s diversity.

Section 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found 86% of Canadians approved of this section.

==Criticism==
While the &quot;Charter&quot; has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82 percent of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999, the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum. According to columnist David Akin (2017), while most Liberals support the &quot;Charter&quot;, most Conservatives, most New Democrats, most Indigenous people, and Québécois see the &quot;Charter&quot; as &quot;problematic&quot; and &quot;something to be challenged in order to be Canadian&quot;.

One left-wing critic is professor Michael Mandel (1989), who wrote that, in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel&#x27;s view, limits democracy. Mandel has also asserted that the &quot;Charter&quot; makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights. He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the &quot;Charter&quot;, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians. The labour movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the &quot;Charter&quot; to support various forms of union activity, such as the &quot;right to strike&quot;.

Conservative critics Morton and Knopff (2000) have raised several concerns about the &quot;Charter&quot;, notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book &quot;The Charter Revolution &amp; the Court Party&quot; (2000), Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Pierre Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly gay rights and women&#x27;s rights.

Political scientist Rand Dyck (2000), in observing these criticisms, notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most laws challenged on &quot;Charter&quot; grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups, Dyck points out that &quot;the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply. All such groups have experienced wins and losses.&quot;

Political philosopher Charles Blattberg (2003) has criticized the &quot;Charter&quot; for contributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and group levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, Blattberg claims the &quot;Charter&quot; injects an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to realize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the &quot;Charter&quot; undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document. Finally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much &quot;thicker&quot; (less abstract) than rights.

<doc id="129194" wikidata="Q203690" url="?curid=129194" title="Brian Epstein">
<text>Brian Samuel Epstein ( ; 19 September 1934 – 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur who managed the Beatles from 1961 until his death in 1967.
Epstein was born into a family of successful retailers in Liverpool, who put him in charge of their music shop, where he displayed a gift for talent-spotting. He first met the Beatles in 1961 at a lunchtime concert at Liverpool&#x27;s Cavern Club. Although he had no experience of artist management, Epstein put them under contract and insisted that they abandon their scruffy image in favour of a new clean-cut style. He also attempted to get the Beatles a recording contract, eventually securing a deal with EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label.

Within months, the Beatles were international stars. Some of Epstein&#x27;s other young discoveries had also prospered under his management. They included Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Tommy Quickly, Cilla Black and The Big Three. In 1967, he died of a combined alcohol and barbiturate overdose, ruled as accidental, at the age of 32.

==Ancestry==

Epstein&#x27;s grandfather, Isaac Epstein, was Lithuanian-Jewish. He arrived in Britain in the 1890s at the age of eighteen, from what was then part of the Russian Empire. His grandmother, Dinah, was the daughter of Joseph, a draper, and Esther Hyman, who had emigrated from Russia to Britain circa 1871/72 with their eldest son, Jacob. The Hymans had six other children.

Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900. In 1901, Isaac and Dinah were living at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool, with Isaac&#x27;s sister Rachael Epstein, above the furniture dealership that he founded. Dinah and Isaac&#x27;s third child, Harry Epstein, would become Brian Epstein&#x27;s father. 

Eventually the family moved to a larger home in the Anfield area of Liverpool, at 27 Anfield Road. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded Epstein and Sons. He enlarged the furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms. Paul McCartney&#x27;s father once bought a piano from them. Epstein&#x27;s mother Malka (nicknamed &quot;Queenie&quot; by her family, as Malka means &quot;queen&quot; in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield Veneering Company. Harry and Queenie married in 1933.

==Early life==

Brian Epstein was born on 19 September 1934 at 4 Rodney Street, Liverpool. Harry and Queenie also had another son named Clive, who was born 22 months after his older brother. During World War II the Epsteins moved to Southport, where two schools expelled Epstein for laziness and poor performance, but the family returned to Liverpool in 1945. The Epsteins lived at 197 Queens Drive, Childwall in Liverpool, and remained there for the next 30 years. The family was aided by a live-in nanny.

Epstein&#x27;s parents moved him from one boarding school to another, including Clayesmore School in Dorset, Liverpool College, and a Jewish school in Kent. He spent two years at Wrekin College in Wellington, Shropshire, where he was taught the violin. At Wrekin, Epstein suffered from the strict culture, possibly in part as a result of his suppressed homosexuality. Epstein fell in love with the arts, particularly theatre, and it was his one consistently successful school subject. His favourite book as a child was Pamela Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Swish of the Curtain&quot;. Shortly before his 16th birthday he sent a long letter to his father stating that he wanted to become a dress designer, but Harry Epstein was adamantly opposed, and after serving a six months&#x27; apprenticeship at another company his son finally had to &quot;report for duty&quot; at the family&#x27;s furniture shop on a £5 per week wage.

In December 1952, Epstein was conscripted to do his national service as a data entry clerk into the Royal Army Service Corps, and was posted to the Albany Street Barracks near Regent&#x27;s Park in London in spring 1953, where he was often reprimanded for not collecting his army pay. Epstein used this posting to explore London&#x27;s high culture for the first time and also visited local relatives. By January 1954, Epstein had seen numerous Army psychiatrists, who recommended an early medical discharge.

After returning to Liverpool, he was put in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and in 1955 was made a director of NEMS. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had in his possession. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. On returning home he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him to go to London to study.

In autumn 1956, Epstein enrolled in a two-year course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney, and Peter O&#x27;Toole, but Epstein dropped out after the third term, saying that he had become &quot;too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn&#x27;t like being a student at all.&quot; He said in 1964 that he &quot;felt like an old man at the age of 21&quot;. He also revealed that he would have liked to produce a theatre play, or even act, &quot;in something by Chekhov&quot;, or a &quot;straight drama&quot; by John Osborne.

In late April 1957, while a RADA student, Epstein was arrested for soliciting an undercover police officer for sex near the Swiss Cottage tube station. (Homosexual sex for men was illegal in Britain at this time.) He appeared in a Marylebone courthouse the next day and pleaded not guilty. He was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation. While still serving probation in May 1958, he was assaulted by a casual sex partner in Liverpool and extorted for hush money. Epstein reported the encounter to the police, forcing him to testify in court and reveal his sexual orientation to his family. The court barred the press from revealing Epstein&#x27;s identity during the trial. His assailant was sentenced to serve two years in jail, and Epstein was not charged.

After his withdrawal from RADA, Epstein returned to Liverpool, where his father put his son in charge of the record department of the family&#x27;s newly opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street. Epstein worked &quot;day and night&quot; at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in Northern England. The Epsteins opened a second store at 12–14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put in charge of the entire operation. He often walked across the road to the Lewis&#x27;s department store (which also had a music section) where Peter Brown was employed. He watched Brown&#x27;s sales technique and was impressed enough to lure him to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales. Through his work in the record department at NEMS, Epstein gained considerable knowledge of the pop music business.

==The Beatles==

Epstein first noticed the Beatles in issues of &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; and on numerous posters around Liverpool created by his commercial artist associate Tony Booth, before he asked &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; editor Bill Harry who they were. Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the magazine at NEMS, with the Beatles featured on the front page of its second issue. The Beatles had recorded the &quot;My Bonnie&quot; single with Tony Sheridan in Germany, and some months after its release Epstein asked his personal assistant Alistair Taylor about it. Epstein&#x27;s version of the story was that customer Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the &quot;My Bonnie&quot; single, which made Epstein curious about the group. Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein&#x27;s story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in &quot;Mersey Beat&quot;—with McCartney saying, &quot;Brian knew perfectly well who the Beatles were; they were on the front page of the second issue of &quot;Mersey Beat&quot;&quot;. On 3 August 1961, Epstein started a regular music column in the &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; called &quot;Stop the World—And Listen To Everything in It: Brian Epstein of NEMS&quot;.

The Beatles were due to perform a Thursday lunchtime concert at The Cavern Club on 9 November 1961. According to club owner Sytner, Epstein had visited the club quite a few times previously on Saturday nights, once asking Sytner to book a group for his twenty-first birthday party. Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch the Beatles perform. The club allowed Epstein and Taylor to enter without queuing. They bypassed the line of fans at the door and heard Bob Wooler, the resident disc jockey, announce a welcome message over the club&#x27;s public address system: &quot;We have someone rather famous in the audience today. Mr Brian Epstein, the owner of NEMS ...&quot; Epstein later talked about the performance: &quot;I was immediately struck by their music, their beat and their sense of humour on stage—and, even afterwards, when I met them, I was struck again by their personal charm. And it was there that, really, it all started&quot;.

After the performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the dressing room (which he later described as being &quot;as big as a broom cupboard&quot;) to talk to the group. The Beatles, all regular NEMS customers, immediately recognised Epstein, but before he could congratulate them on their performance George Harrison said, &quot;And what brings Mr Epstein here?&quot; Epstein replied with, &quot;We just popped in to say hello. I enjoyed your performance.&quot; He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, said, &quot;Well done, then, goodbye&quot; and left. Epstein and Taylor then went for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor what he thought about the group. Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were &quot;absolutely awful&quot;, but there was something &quot;remarkable&quot; about them. Epstein sat there smiling for a long time before exclaiming, &quot;I think they&#x27;re tremendous!&quot; Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor&#x27;s arm and said, &quot;Do you think I should manage them?&quot;

The Beatles played at The Cavern Club over the next three weeks, and Epstein was always there to watch them. He contacted Allan Williams (their previous promoter/manager) to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to the group, but Williams advised Epstein &quot;&quot; because of a Hamburg concert percentage that the group had refused to pay.

===Management contract===
In an afternoon meeting with the group at NEMS on 3 December 1961, Epstein proposed the idea of managing the Beatles. John Lennon, George Harrison, and Pete Best arrived late for the meeting, as they had been drinking at a local pub. McCartney also did not arrive on time because he had just got up and was &quot;taking a bath&quot;, as Harrison explained. Epstein was upset, but Harrison placated him by saying, &quot;He may be late, but he&#x27;ll be very &quot;clean&quot;.&quot; Lennon had invited Wooler to be at the meeting so that he could give his opinion of Epstein, but he introduced Wooler by saying, &quot;This is me dad.&quot; Epstein was reticent throughout the short meeting, only asking if they had a manager. After learning that they had not, he said, &quot;It seems to me that with everything going on, someone ought to be looking after you.&quot; He had further meetings with the group on 6 and 10 December 1961.

McCartney, Harrison, and Best were under 21 and therefore needed the consent of their parents to enter into a contract. Best and his mother—Mona Best, owner of the Casbah Coffee Club—were impressed with Epstein&#x27;s professional image as were the other Beatles, because he was a businessman, wore expensive suits, and owned a large car. Best&#x27;s mother said that Epstein &quot;could be good for them [the Beatles]&quot;. McCartney&#x27;s father was sceptical about a Jewish manager and warned his son to be careful about finances. Lennon&#x27;s aunt and guardian, Mimi Smith, was against the idea, believing that Epstein would lose interest when something else attracted his attention, but Lennon, who had just turned 21, ignored his aunt&#x27;s advice.

The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24 January 1962, giving Epstein 10 to 15 per cent of their income. They signed a new contract in October 1962 which gave Epstein 15, 20, or 25 per cent of revenues, depending on how much he helped the band earn. The Beatles would then share any income after various expenses had been deducted. Epstein then formed a management company, NEMS Enterprises, telling his parents that managing the group was only a part-time occupation and would not interfere with the family business.

The Beatles signed Epstein&#x27;s first management contract, but Epstein did not. He later told Taylor, &quot;Well, if they ever want to tear it up, they can hold me but I can&#x27;t hold them&quot;. (English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance.) The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group&#x27;s gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed out that he had been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.

In 1963, Epstein advised the creation of Northern Songs, a publishing company that would control the copyrights of all Lennon–McCartney compositions recorded between 1963 and 1973. Music publisher Dick James and his partner Charles Silver owned 51 per cent of the company, Lennon and McCartney 20 per cent each, and Epstein 9 per cent. By 1969, Lennon and McCartney had lost control of all publishing rights to ATV Music Publishing. Epstein&#x27;s death in 1967 marked the beginning of the group&#x27;s dissolution and had a profound effect on each Beatle.

===The Beatles&#x27; appearance on stage===

Epstein had no prior experience of artist management, yet he had a strong influence on the band&#x27;s early dress code and stage demeanour. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at the Cavern Club he thought, &quot;They were a scruffy crowd in leather, and they were not very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other.&quot; Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein&#x27;s suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein&#x27;s RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: &quot;I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn&#x27;t allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits.&quot; Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, which Epstein approved: &quot;I thought it was an excellent design at the time.&quot;

Lennon resisted wearing suits and ties, but later said, &quot;I&#x27;ll wear a suit; I&#x27;ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody&#x27;s going to pay me.&quot; Epstein began seeking publicity by &quot;charming and smarming ... the newspaper people&quot;, as Lennon said in 1972. According to McCartney, &quot;The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit, it did go up&quot;; they were &quot;now playing better places&quot;. The group was now far more organised, having one single diary in which to record bookings, rather than using whoever&#x27;s diary was at hand. The group usually called Epstein &quot;Mr. Epstein&quot; or &quot;Brian&quot; in interviews, but in private the group abbreviated his name to &quot;Eppy&quot; or &quot;Bri&quot;.

===Record contract===
Starting shortly after he met the Beatles, Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies in the hope of securing a record contract, but many rejected him, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most notoriously Decca. On 13 December 1961, at Epstein&#x27;s invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at the Cavern, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles&#x27; Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows) to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca he also approached Ron White, an EMI marketing executive with whom he had a business relationship. White told Epstein he would play the Beatles&#x27; recording of &quot;My Bonnie&quot; the band made in Germany with Tony Sheridan for EMI&#x27;s four A&amp;R directors. However, White only played it for two of them—Wally Ridley and Norman Newell.

In early February 1962, Epstein visited the HMV store (owned by EMI) in 363 Oxford Street, London to have the Decca tape transferred to 78 rpm acetates. An HMV disc-cutter named Jim Foy liked the recordings, suggesting that Epstein should contact Sid Colman, the head of EMI&#x27;s record publishing division, which controlled the publishing company Ardmore &amp; Beechwood. Colman and his colleague Kim Bennett liked the Beatles&#x27; recording of &quot;Like Dreamers Do&quot; and sought to have EMI record Lennon–McCartney original songs, with Ardmore &amp; Beechwood retaining the publishing rights; they sent Epstein to George Martin, the A&amp;R manager of EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label. Epstein met Martin on 13 February, where he played the acetates of the Decca audition. Epstein left the meeting optimistic, but Martin &quot;wasn&#x27;t knocked out at all&quot; by the &quot;lousy tape&quot;.

Martin later claimed that Epstein&#x27;s conviction that the Beatles would become internationally famous finally convinced him to offer a recording contract. In fact, however, EMI managing director L. G. (&quot;Len&quot;) Wood instructed Martin to sign the Beatles in May 1962, largely to appease the continued interest of Ardmore &amp; Beechwood in Lennon–McCartney song publishing. Martin met with Epstein again on 9 May and offered him a standard EMI recording contract for the Beatles to record six &quot;sides&quot; (equivalent to three two-sided single releases) in their first year. Upon signing the contract, Epstein immediately sent a telegram to the Beatles (who were in Hamburg) and to the &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; music journal in Liverpool.

The recording contract gave the Beatles one penny (1d) for each record sold, which was split among the four members, meaning that each earned one farthing per copy. The royalty rate was further reduced for singles sold outside the UK; the group received half of one penny per single, which was again split amongst the whole group. Martin scheduled the first recording session to be on 6 June 1962 at Abbey Road Studios. Epstein later renegotiated EMI&#x27;s royalty rate and on 27 January 1967 the Beatles signed a new nine-year contract with EMI. The contract stipulated that 25 per cent would be paid to NEMS for the full nine years even if the Beatles decided not to renew their management contract with Epstein, which was up for renewal later that year.

===Dismissal of Pete Best===

By early 1962, the Beatles had played several gigs with Ringo Starr on occasions when Pete Best was ill, and they had performed at a recording session with Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison in Hamburg. The Beatles enjoyed Starr&#x27;s drumming style and social demeanor with the band, whereas Best rarely socialized with the other band members after gigs. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison had also long believed Best to be a stylistically limited drummer. McCartney later remarked, &quot;It had got to the stage that Pete was holding us back. What were we gonna do—pretend he was a wonderful drummer?&quot;

After the group&#x27;s first recording session on 6 June 1962, George Martin felt that using an experienced studio session drummer rather than Best would improve the recording (this was in accordance with normal practice at the time). Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison decided Best needed to be replaced and, uncomfortable with sacking him themselves, asked Epstein to sack Best so that Starr could join the band. Epstein was aware the Beatles had discussed replacing Best but hoped it would not happen, as he was not yet fond of Starr. Epstein agonised about the decision, asking the Cavern&#x27;s disc jockey Bob Wooler if it were a good idea. Wooler replied that Best was &quot;very popular with the fans,&quot; who would not like it at all. Despite his reservations, Epstein accepted the Beatles&#x27; decision: &quot;They liked Ringo, and I trusted the boys&#x27; judgment. If they were happy, so was I.&quot;

Epstein&#x27;s task of sacking Best was complicated by the fact that he was under contract to provide management to all four members of the Beatles. Epstein thus had to secure paid work for Best if he was to leave the group. Epstein consulted a lawyer, who informed him that the Beatles could not simply expel Best under the terms of their contract; they could only legally disband and then re-form with Starr. Epstein planned to have Best become the drummer for the Merseybeats as an alternative that would satisfy his commitment to provide Best work.

In the meantime, Starr was playing with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, the resident group at Butlins&#x27; holiday complex in Skegness. Epstein searched for drummers who could temporarily fill in for Best until Starr was available to join the Beatles, such as Joe Brown&#x27;s drummer, Bobby Graham. He also offered the position to Johnny Hutchinson of the Big Three, a group that Epstein managed at that time as well. Hutchinson turned down the offer, saying, &quot;Pete Best is a very good friend of mine. I couldn&#x27;t do the dirty on him&quot;—although Hutchinson did play for the Beatles at short notice when Best did not turn up on the evening of his dismissal and for two subsequent bookings, until Starr was able to join. 

Epstein finally dismissed Best on 16 August, more than two months after the first recording session at EMI Studios. He called Best and Neil Aspinall to his office on Whitechapel Street, where he informed Best that the Beatles would be replacing him with Starr. When Best asked why, Epstein told him, &quot;Mainly because they think you&#x27;re not a good enough drummer. And also because at EMI Studios, George Martin said, &#x27;the drummer isn&#x27;t good enough&#x27;.&quot;

With the band&#x27;s lineup now solidified, Epstein had his solicitor draw up a new management contract for the Beatles.

===Beatles last official live appearance in the UK===
The Beatles made their last official live appearance in Britain on 1 May 1966, at the NME Annual Poll-Winners&#x27; All-Star Concert at the Empire Pool, Wembley Park. Although the concert was televised, the cameras were switched off while the Beatles played, because Epstein and ABC TV had failed to agree over terms. They were filmed receiving their awards, however.

===After Candlestick Park===

The Beatles&#x27; hectic schedule kept Epstein very busy between 1963 and 1965 with touring plus television and film work. Their last live concert was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco on 29 August 1966, and Epstein&#x27;s management duties then changed to reflect the changing nature of their career. He pressured them to continue touring, but they steadfastly refused.

==Business dealings==

Epstein once offered all four Beatles a fixed wage of £50 a week for life (). Harrison remembered that he was earning £25 a week at the time (), which was more than the £10 a week that his father was earning (). The group declined Epstein&#x27;s offer, believing that they were worth much more than £50 a week.
NEMS had a staff of twenty-five at the time of its move from Liverpool to London in 1964. NEMS booked the Beatles&#x27; concerts, and it also presented groups as an opening act. It accrued money as promoter, booking agent, and manager for all concerts. The Beatles were constantly in demand by concert promoters, and Epstein took advantage of the situation to avoid paying some taxes by accepting &quot;hidden&quot; fees on the night of a performance, which he always kept in a brown paper bag.

Epstein also successfully managed Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (who had four hits with Lennon–McCartney songs), the Fourmost (Lennon wrote their first two singles), the Cyrkle (Epstein&#x27;s first American group), and Cilla Black (who was Epstein&#x27;s only female artist), as well as Tommy Quickly and Sounds Incorporated (later known as Sounds Inc.). He also managed the Moody Blues for around a year from late 1965 to late 1966. Epstein sent his roster of artists on &quot;package tours&quot; around the UK, a common practice at the time. This involved short sets by each act, alternating with a compère or a comedian. Epstein once revealed that even though he was entitled to be reimbursed by acts for expenses incurred, he paid for his own flights to and from the United States, as he did not see himself as being part of a touring group. Photographs, transport, and international telephone calls were paid from his own 25 percent share in profits.

The Beatles toured the Philippines in July 1966, playing two shows at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation&#x27;s first lady Imelda Marcos when presented with an invitation to a breakfast party. He had politely declined on behalf of the group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles&#x27; assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing that they would not be allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.

Epstein added the Vic Lewis Organisation to NEMS in 1966, and later brought impresario Robert Stigwood in as a manager. He once offered to sell the control of NEMS to Stigwood, without telling any of his artists about the offer. McCartney was taking a more active interest in NEMS&#x27; finances, as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms, such as the Rolling Stones under the management of Allen Klein. After Epstein&#x27;s death, Clive Epstein assumed control of NEMS as the company&#x27;s second-largest shareholder. Stigwood then tried to take over management of NEMS but all four Beatles vigorously objected, with Lennon saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t know you. Why would we do this?&quot;

McCartney admitted that they had always signed all the contracts that Epstein presented to them without reading them first, but after Epstein&#x27;s death Lennon complained, &quot;Well, he was alright. I&#x27;ve found out since, of course, that he wasn&#x27;t quite as honest to us as he made out.&quot; Despite this, other interviews with Lennon report him as being loyal to Epstein&#x27;s memory: &quot;We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert.&quot; When asked in 1964 about his standing as a manager or businessman, Epstein replied, &quot;Fair, as a businessman, fair. I&#x27;ve got a business background, and probably a reasonable business brain. I&#x27;m no, sort of, genius [laughter].&quot; Asked about his deficiencies, Epstein replied, &quot;I&#x27;m probably too conscious of ideas, rather than finance behind ideas.&quot;

According to &quot;Time&quot;, Epstein made $14 million in five years while managing The Beatles.

===Merchandising===
Before the Beatles achieved nationwide success in Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the group&#x27;s popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty-goods companies desperate to use the Beatles name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse any product directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies who were able to produce good-quality products at a fair price, even though many companies were already selling products without a licence.

During the first Beatles trip to the United States, merchandisers pitched many products to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to Nicky Byrne in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles, but David Jacobs subsequently renegotiated the royalty rate to 49% at Epstein&#x27;s behest in August 1964.
Byrne then took over Epstein&#x27;s Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards) in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.

Mindful of the number of records the group was selling in the United States, Capitol Records sent a well-spoken Yorkshire woman, Wendy Hanson, to the Plaza Hotel to act as Epstein&#x27;s secretary and to filter his calls. Hanson later worked solely with Epstein in his Albemarle Street office in London, which was separate from the NEMS office. Lennon later said, &quot;On the business end he [Epstein] ripped us off on the Seltaeb thing.&quot; McCartney said years later, &quot;He [Epstein] looked to his dad for business advice, and his dad knew how to run a furniture store in Liverpool.&quot;

===Lenmac===

Epstein asked chartered accountant James Trevor Isherwood to set up a company to collect Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s PRS payment, called Lenmac, which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein&#x27;s office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein&#x27;s expenses were deducted from his artists&#x27; gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967) would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles&#x27; performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.

===Publishing===
The Beatles entered into a publishing agreement with Dick James Music (DJM), so James set up a company called Northern Songs. James and his financial partner and accountant, Charles Silver, would each receive 25 per cent of the shares. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, with Epstein receiving the remaining 10 per cent. The Beatles&#x27; PRS income increased rapidly, so Epstein asked Isherwood to devise a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would owe. Isherwood suggested a stock market flotation for Northern Songs. He also suggested to Epstein that during the flotation Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near Isherwood&#x27;s own in Esher. Lennon, Harrison and Starr agreed, while Epstein and McCartney remained in London.

===Promoter and presenter===
After settling in London in 1965, Epstein rented an office in Monmouth Street, and later bought the lease of the Saville Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. He promoted new works by writers such as Arnold Wesker in productions that occasionally fell foul of the Lord Chamberlain for including &quot;obscene&quot; content or nudity. In 1966 Epstein reinvented it as a music venue featuring various US acts. On 20 February 1967 Epstein sacked the manager of the theatre, Michael Bullock, for lowering the safety curtain the previous day shortly before the end of a Chuck Berry concert that Epstein was attending with Lennon and Starr. Two fans had climbed onto the stage to dance, the curtain came down, and they were pushed from the stage. Although Bullock had not given the order, he was held responsible.

In the wake of the Beatles&#x27; success Epstein was asked to appear on several music-based TV programmes in Britain. He also hosted a regular part of the US television show &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, filming his appearances in the UK.

==Personal life==

Throughout Epstein&#x27;s life, he was known to be kind and caring to his family, friends of his family, and business colleagues. When Lennon married Cynthia Powell, on 23 August 1962, Epstein served as best man and paid for the couple&#x27;s celebratory lunch afterwards. During Cynthia&#x27;s pregnancy Epstein paid for a private room in a hospital and offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat at 36 Falkner Street, Liverpool, when they needed a home. He also agreed to be godfather to Lennon&#x27;s son Julian.

===Sexual orientation===

Epstein&#x27;s homosexuality was not publicly known until some years after his death, although it had been an open secret among his friends and business associates. While Epstein was in the British Army, he commissioned a tailor to make him an officer&#x27;s uniform. He wore the uniform when cruising the bars of London, but was arrested one night at the Army and Navy Club in Piccadilly by the military police for impersonating an officer. Epstein managed to avoid a court martial by agreeing to see an army psychiatrist, who learned of Epstein&#x27;s sexuality. After ten months he was discharged from the army on medical grounds for being &quot;emotionally and mentally unfit&quot;. Epstein later stated that his first homosexual experience was when he returned to Liverpool after being discharged.

Epstein spent a year studying acting at RADA, but dropped out shortly after his arrest for &quot;persistent importuning&quot; outside a men&#x27;s public toilet in Swiss Cottage, London. Cottaging, as it was called, was one of the few public ways that gay and bisexual men could meet, especially if they were closeted. When Epstein first saw the Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying, &quot;They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, or I should say in the most attractive way—black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course&quot;. McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage the Beatles they knew that he was homosexual but did not care, because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously &quot;off-limits&quot; social circles.

Although the group, Lennon in particular, often made sarcastic comments about Epstein&#x27;s homosexuality to friends and to Epstein personally, no one outside the group&#x27;s inner circle was allowed to comment. Ian Sharp (actor Richard Tate), one of Lennon&#x27;s art-school friends, once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein, saying, &quot;Which one of you [Beatles] does he fancy?&quot; Sharp was sent a letter by Epstein&#x27;s office within 48 hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised but was then ostracised. McCartney sent him a letter directing him to have no contact with any of them in the future. Epstein went on holiday to places such as Amsterdam, Torremolinos and Barcelona or Manchester at weekends, as the attitude towards homosexuals there was more tolerant than in Liverpool, even though Liverpool did have several gay bars.

In his autobiography, Pete Best stated that Epstein drove them both to Blackpool one evening where Epstein expressed his &quot;very fond admiration&quot;. Epstein then supposedly said, &quot;Would you find it embarrassing if I ask you to stay in a hotel overnight?&quot; Best replied that he was not interested and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona in April 1963. Lennon admitted in a 1971 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that he knew Epstein was a &quot;fag&quot; and that he (Lennon) enjoyed &quot;playing a bit faggy and all that&quot;. Addressing the rumours again later, Lennon told &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1980, &quot;Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated ... but we did have a pretty intense relationship&quot;. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film &quot;The Hours and Times&quot;.

===Drug use===

After the start of his management career, Epstein started taking stimulants, usually Preludin, which did not require a prescription at the time. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr had also taken it since their days in Hamburg. Epstein explained his use of the drug as the only means of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours. In 1964, Peter Brown suspected that Epstein was taking too many pills, as he would often cough at parties, which Brown realised was Epstein&#x27;s way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. McCartney often met Epstein at late night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often grind his jaws (possibly due to bruxism), once saying to him, &quot;Ugghhh, the pills&quot;. Epstein also developed dependencies on the drug carbromal, a barbiturate-like sedative/hypnotic drug.

In 1964, after having been introduced to cannabis by Bob Dylan in New York, Epstein was observed by McCartney standing in front of a mirror, pointing at himself and repeatedly saying &quot;Jew!&quot;, while laughing loudly, which McCartney found hilarious and &quot;very liberating&quot;. Epstein later became heavily involved in the 1960s drug scene. During the four months when the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was being recorded, Epstein spent time on holiday, or at the Priory Clinic in Putney, where he tried unsuccessfully to curb his drug use. He left the Priory to attend the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; launch party at his house on 24 Chapel Street, but returned to the Priory immediately after.

Epstein added his name to an advertisement that appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on 24 July 1967, which called for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana&#x27;s medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma and was signed by 65 people, including the Beatles, Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, sixteen doctors, and two members of Parliament. Epstein responded to questions about the advertisement by saying, &quot;My opinion is that pot smoking is definitely less harmful than drinking alcohol. I am not addicted to either, but I have been very drunk and very &#x27;high&#x27;.&quot; In June 1967, after McCartney had admitted to LSD use, Epstein defended him to the media, stating that he too had taken the drug.

===Gambling===

In August 1965, the Beatles and Epstein visited Elvis Presley at his house in Los Angeles, where Elvis&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, set up a roulette wheel and several packs of playing cards. Epstein immediately asked to play, as he was known for his love of gambling. McCartney frequently visited gambling clubs in London, such as Epstein&#x27;s favourite casino, &quot;Curzon House Club&quot;, where he often ran into Epstein. He once saw Epstein put a Dunhill cigarette lighter worth £100 () on the table, then lose it during a game of cards. Epstein often lost thousands of pounds by playing baccarat or chemin de fer (the original version of baccarat when it was introduced in France), but would stay at Curzon House the whole evening, eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines. The club never presented Epstein with a bill, as they knew he lost so much in the casino.

==Death==
Epstein attended a traditional shiva (week of mourning) in Liverpool after his father died, having just come out of the Priory Clinic where he had been trying to cure his acute insomnia and addiction to amphetamines. A few days before his death he made his last visit to a Beatles recording session &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; on 23 August 1967, at the Chappell Recording Studios on Maddox Street in Mayfair, London.
On 24 August, Epstein asked personal assistant Peter Brown and business partner Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsley Hill for the bank holiday weekend. Approximately 50 miles (80 km) from his home in Chapel Street, Kingsley Hill was Epstein&#x27;s country home in Warbleton, East Sussex. After they arrived, Epstein decided to drive back to London alone because an expected group of friends he had invited failed to arrive, although they did turn up after Epstein left. Epstein phoned Brown at 5 p.m. the next day from his Chapel Street house in London. Brown thought that Epstein sounded &quot;very groggy&quot; and suggested he take a train back down to the nearest railway station, in Uckfield, instead of driving under the influence of Tuinal. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail, and watch &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.

Epstein died of an overdose of Carbrital, a hypnotic preparation combining the barbiturate pentobarbital with carbromal, in his locked bedroom on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler who, having been unable to rouse Epstein via his locked bedroom door, called Epstein&#x27;s PA, Joanne Petersen. She arrived, failed to rouse him, and called his doctor who, with the butler, broke down the door and found Epstein in his bed, appearing to be asleep, an open book near his hand and some digestive biscuits on the bedside cabinet. When they realised that he was dead, staff swept the house for contraband and then called the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident, caused by a gradual buildup of Carbrital combined with alcohol in his system. It was revealed that he had taken six Carbrital pills to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol, his tolerance was reduced.

The Beatles were on a retreat in Bangor in North Wales at the time, with the Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Epstein had previously agreed to travel to Bangor after the August Bank Holiday. The second of two shows by Jimi Hendrix at Epstein&#x27;s Saville Theatre was cancelled on the evening of Epstein&#x27;s death.

Peter Brown wrote in his memoir, &quot;The Love You Make: An Insider&#x27;s Story of the Beatles&quot;, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, &quot;This is all too much and I can&#x27;t take it any more.&quot; Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money to his mother and his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be grateful if Brown did not tell anyone, and that he was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that he had no intention of overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein&#x27;s doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein&#x27;s death was caused by an overdose of Carbrital and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbrital for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein&#x27;s blood was a &quot;low fatal level&quot;.

The Beatles did not attend Epstein&#x27;s funeral, both to allow his family some privacy and to avoid attracting fans and the media. According to Geoffrey Ellis, chief executive of NEMS Enterprises, the day before the funeral George Harrison had given Nat Weiss, Epstein&#x27;s good friend and confidant, a single flower (Ellis remembers it as a chrysanthemum) wrapped in a newspaper on behalf of all four Beatles, with instructions to place the flower on Brian&#x27;s coffin as a final farewell. However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials. Weiss and Ellis discussed this dilemma while walking back to the grave, where they observed two men beginning to shovel dirt onto the casket. Ellis later wrote: &quot;Nat, who himself was Jewish, cast the newspaper package unopened onto Brian&#x27;s coffin, where it was swiftly covered by earth.&quot; Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool. The service at the graveside was held by Rabbi Norman Solomon, who said, disparagingly, that Epstein was &quot;a symbol of the malaise of our generation&quot;. A few weeks later, on 17 October, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in St John&#x27;s Wood (near Abbey Road Studios), which was officiated by Rabbi Louis Jacobs. The Bee Gees&#x27; 1968 song &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot; was written and recorded as a tribute to Epstein.

==Legacy==

Epstein was upset that he was not honoured along with Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr when they received the MBE in 1965, though Harrison once said that the MBE stood for &quot;Mister Brian Epstein&quot;; The Beatles were among the earliest entrants into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but Epstein was not included in the Hall&#x27;s &quot;Non-Performers&#x27; Section&quot; until 2014, and not without controversy as he was inducted alongside Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham who refused to attend, in part in protest at what he perceived as the indignity of a joint induction. Martin Lewis, previously Taylor&#x27;s assistant, created the official Brian Epstein website, which included a petition that Epstein be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Lewis also organised the 1998 re-publication, in the United States, of Epstein&#x27;s 1964 autobiography &quot;A Cellarful of Noise&quot;.

McCartney summarised the importance of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying: &quot;If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian.&quot; In his 1970 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Lennon commented that Epstein&#x27;s death marked the beginning of the end for the group: &quot;I knew that we were in trouble then ... I thought, &#x27;We&#x27;ve fucking had it now. In 2006, Cynthia Lennon said: &quot;I think Brian&#x27;s one of the forgotten people. It&#x27;s almost as if he&#x27;s been written out of the [Beatles] story. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d have got anywhere without Brian.&quot; The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.

Epstein&#x27;s influence on the Beatles and his complicated personal life continue to provoke controversy. In 2013, author Vivek Tiwary released the graphic novel &quot;The Fifth Beatle: The Brian Epstein Story&quot;. A film of the same name was scheduled for release in 2014, originally to be produced by Bruce Cohen and directed by Peyton Reed. Tiwary said about that project that the film would &quot;be less a music bio and more of an inspirational human-interest story about an outsider&quot;. Tiwary and named co-producers Stuart Ford and Simon Cowell originally set the film for release in 2016, but in March 2016 it was announced that the project would be a television series.

Another biopic about Epstein, &quot;Midas Man&quot;, premiered at the 32nd Toronto Jewish Film Festival on 30 May 2024.

As well as Jacob Fortune-Lloyd in &quot;Midas Man&quot;, Brian Epstein has been portrayed by other actors such as Ed Stoppard in &quot;Cilla&quot;, and Andrew Games in The Moondogs from 2022 to 2024.

Epstein was once asked about the future of the Beatles and their &quot;fresh honesty&quot; (as he put it), which the interviewer thought could be &quot;corrupted by time&quot;. He replied by saying, &quot;I think they will go in the reverse direction, and become more honest.&quot;

On 27 August 2022, the 55th anniversary of his death, a bronze statue of Brian Epstein was unveiled near the former site of his family&#x27;s NEMS record shop in Liverpool. One of the statue&#x27;s sculptors, Jane Robbins, is a cousin of McCartney.

<text>Alnwick ( ) is a market town in Northumberland, England, of which it is the traditional county town. The population at the 2011 Census was 8,116.

The town is on the south bank of the River Aln, south of Berwick-upon-Tweed and the Scottish border, inland from the North Sea at Alnmouth and north of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The town dates to about AD 600 and thrived as an agricultural centre. Alnwick Castle was the home of the most powerful medieval northern baronial family, the Earls of Northumberland. It was a staging post on the Great North Road between Edinburgh and London. The town centre has changed relatively little, but the town has seen some growth, with several housing estates covering what had been pasture, and new factory and trading estate developments along the roads to the south.

==History==

The name &quot;Alnwick&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;wic&quot; (&#x27;dairy farm, settlement&#x27;) and the name of the river Aln.

The history of Alnwick is the history of the castle and its lords, starting with Gilbert Tyson (written variously as &quot;Tison&quot;, &quot;Tisson&quot;, and &quot;De Tesson&quot;), one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s standard-bearers, upon whom this northern estate was bestowed. It was held by the De Vesci family (now spelt &quot;Vasey&quot; – a name found all over south-east Northumberland) for over 200 years, and then passed into the hands of the House of Percy in 1309.

The castle was founded as a timber structure by Ivo de Vesci in about 1096. In 1136 it is first recorded as being captured by David I of Scotland. In 1147, Alnwick Abbey was founded for Premonstratensian canons, a short distance west of the castle. At about the same time, the castle was rebuilt in stone.

At various points in the town are memorials of the constant wars with the Scots, in which so many Percys spent the greater part of their lives. A cross near Broomhouse Hill across the river from the castle marks the spot where Malcolm III of Scotland was killed, during the first Battle of Alnwick in 1093. At the side of the broad shady road called Ratten Row, leading from the West Lodge to Bailiffgate, a stone tablet marks the spot where William the Lion of Scotland was captured during the second Battle of Alnwick in 1174 by a party of about 400 mounted knights, led by Ranulf de Glanvill.

Hulne Priory, outside the town walls in Hulne Park, the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s walled estate, was a friary founded in about 1240 for the Carmelites by William de Vesci. It is said that the site was chosen for some slight resemblance to Mount Carmel where the order originated.

In 1314, Sir John Felton was governor of Alnwick. During the 14th century the Percys did extensive work on the castle, adding new towers in the outer wall, strong gates to the wall and keep, and new domestic apartments. After the Percys challenged King Henry IV, the king moved against their castles, taking Alnwick in 1403, despite its improvements.

In winter 1424, much of the town was burnt by a Scottish raiding party. Again in 1448, the town was burnt by a Scottish army led by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas and George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus. Following these setbacks, in the 15th century both monastic houses gained defensive towers and the town was walled.

In addition to the threat from Scotland, Alnwick was heavily contested in the Wars of the Roses. It was held for Henry VI until the Lancastrian collapse of 1461, when it fell to Edward IV. That winter the Lancastrians recaptured it, but in July 1462 the Yorkists retook it. By the autumn the Lancastrians were again in possession, and quickly came under Yorkist siege. Despite Franco-Scottish reinforcements, the Lancastrians abandoned the castle to the Yorkists in January 1463, though by May they had regained it through betrayal. On 23 June it was surrendered to the Yorkists for the final time. According to historian Dan Spencer, this made Alnwick the most besieged place in the country in the Wars of the Roses. Sir Thomas Malory mentions Alnwick as a possible location for Lancelot&#x27;s castle Joyous Garde.

In the English Reformation, monastic life at Alnwick came to an end, with both Alnwick Abbey and Hulne Priory being suppressed in 1539. Shortly after, the Percys also left Alnwick to decay, only resuming residence in the mid-18th century. Since then the Percys have remained at Alnwick. There was a Church of Scotland congregation in Alnwick in the 17th and 18th centuries.

A Royal Air Force distribution depot was constructed at Alnwick during the Second World War with four main fuel storage tanks (total capacity 1700 tons) and road and rail loading facilities. The tanks were above ground and surrounded by concrete. The site was closed in the 1970s, and its demolition and disposal were completed in 1980.

The Alnwick by-pass takes the A1 London–Edinburgh trunk road around the town. It was started in 1968.

==Geography==
Alnwick lies at (55.417,
-1.700)1. The River Aln forms its unofficial northern boundary.

==Governance==

Historically, the town was partly within the Bamburgh Ward and Coquetdale Ward and later included in the East Division of Coquetdale Ward in 1832. Alnwick Town Hall was the home of the common council of Alnwick. By the time of the 2011 Census, an electoral ward covering only part of Alnwick parish existed. The total population of this ward was 4,766.

==Economy==

Some major or noteworthy employers in the town are:
* Barter Books, one of the largest second-hand bookshops in England, set in the town&#x27;s former railway station 
* Quotient Sciences Alnwick, a large pharmaceutical manufacturing, research and testing centre
* NFU Mutual, provider of insurance, pensions, investments

==Landmarks==
The town&#x27;s greatest building is Alnwick Castle, one of the homes of the Duke of Northumberland, and site of The Alnwick Garden. The castle has extensive grounds landscaped by Capability Brown, which include several follies as well as the ruins of St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital, Alnwick Abbey and Hulne Priory.
The town centre is the marketplace, with its market cross, and the 19th century Northumberland Hall, used as a meeting place.

The Alnwick Playhouse is a thriving multi-purpose arts centre that stages theatre, dance, music, cinema, and visual arts productions.

In 2003, the Willowburn Leisure Centre was opened on the southern outskirts of the enlarged town (replacing the old sports centre located by the Lindisfarne Middle School and the now-demolished Youth Centre).

Alnwick&#x27;s museum, Bailiffgate Museum, is close to the Bailiffgate entrance to the castle. Its collection is dedicated to local social history. The museum has recently had a major refit funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Its collection includes a variety of agricultural objects, domestic items, railway items, coal mining artefacts, printing objects, a sizeable photographic collection, paintings and a range of activities for children.

==Events==

Alnwick Fair was an annual costumed event, held each summer from 1969 to 2007, recreating some of the appearance of medieval trading fairs and 17th century agricultural fairs. It has now been discontinued.

==Transport==

===Road===

Alnwick lies adjacent to the A1, the main national north–south trunk road, providing easy access to Newcastle upon Tyne ( south) and Edinburgh ( north).

===Rail===
The East Coast Main Line between Edinburgh (journey time approximately 1:10) and London (journey time approximately 3:45) runs through Alnmouth for Alnwick Stationabout awaywith a weekday service of 15 trains per day north to Edinburgh and 13 trains per day south to London.

The Alnwick branch line formerly linked Alnwick&#x27;s own station, close to the town centre, to Alnmouth station, but this line closed in January 1968. Since the 2010s, the Aln Valley Railway Trust have worked to reopen the branch as a heritage railway but, due to construction of the A1 Alnwick bypass removing a section of the original trackbed on the edge of the town, their purpose-built Alnwick Lionheart terminus is located near the Lionheart Enterprise Estate on the outskirts of the town. The reopening project is ongoing and, as of July 2020, the line&#x27;s eastern terminus had reached a new station at Greenrigg Halt, approximately from Lionheart, although it is yet to carry passengers over the full length.

<doc id="129203" wikidata="Q1196663" url="?curid=129203" title="Recall election">
<text>A recall election (also called a recall referendum, recall petition or representative recall) is a procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a referendum before that official&#x27;s term of office has ended. Recalls appear in the constitution in ancient Athenian democracy. Even where they are legally available, recall elections are only commonly held in a small number of countries including Peru, Ecuador, and Japan. They are considered by groups such as ACE Electoral Knowledge Network as the most rarely used form of direct democracy.

== Process ==
The processes for recall elections vary greatly by country and can be originated in different ways.

=== Initiating a recall ===
This can be done in two ways:
* Indirect (also known as a &quot;Mixed&quot; or &quot;Top-down&quot; recall): A recall may only be triggered by an official authority such as a government, parliament, or president.
*Direct (also known as a &quot;Full&quot; or &quot;Bottom-up&quot; recall): A recall may be triggered by the public directly by the collection of signatures.

== Costs ==
=== Financial costs ===
The scheduling of a recall outside of normal elections causes additional expense. For example, the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election cost taxpayers $300 million for an election that the governor won 61.9% to 38.1%.

=== Turnout ===
Many recall elections take place in off-years, resulting in much lower voter turnout than regularly scheduled elections.

=== Education ===
Some recall elections have different rules than normal elections, requiring voter education and outreach.

== By country ==

=== Argentina ===
The recall referendum arrived in Latin America shortly after its introduction at the US subnational level, in 1923 and 1933, to Cordoba and Entre Ríos provinces, respectively, both in Argentina. There, recall exists at the provincial level in Chaco (introduced in 1957), Chubut (1994), Córdoba (1923, 1987), Corrientes (1960), La Rioja (1986), Rio Negro (1988), Santiago del Estero and Tierra del Fuego (1991); other provinces include it for their municipalities, namely, Entre Ríos (1933), Neuquén (1957), Misiones (1958), San Juan (1986), San Luis (1987). It is also included in Buenos Aires City (1996).

=== Canada ===
An attempt at introducing recall legislation for Canada&#x27;s federal Parliament was brought in October 1999 by Reform Party opposition member Ted White through a private members bill entitled &quot;Bill C 269, the Recall Act (An Act to establish the right of electors to recall members of Parliament.)&quot;. However, the legislation stalled and did not progress past first reading.

As such, no nation-wide recall statute exists, but two provinces, Alberta and British Columbia have recall laws on the books.

==== Alberta ====
The province of Alberta enacted recall legislation for Members of the Legislative Assembly in 1936 during the Social Credit government of William Aberhart. The legislation was repealed after a petition was introduced for the recall of Aberhart himself.

In 2020, the Government of Alberta announced it will introduce a bill allowing recall elections for Members of the Legislative Assembly, municipal governments, and school boards. This bill, Bill 52, was passed and received Royal Assent June 17, 2021, and came into effect on April 7, 2022.

==== New Brunswick ====
Recall was available in New Brunswick in the early 20th century. A successful recall election took place in Saint John in late 1918.

==== British Columbia ====
British Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Recall and Initiative Act&quot;, enacted in 1995, provides a process for recalling members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Voters in a provincial riding can petition to have their Member of the Legislative Assembly removed from office once said MLA has been in office for at least 18 months. If over 40 percent of registered voters in the riding sign the petition and the petition is validated by Elections BC, the Chief Electoral Officer informs the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the member in question that the member has been recalled and their seat vacated. A by-election is called by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia as soon as possible to fill the vacant seat. The recalled MLA is permitted to run in the by-election for their former seat. Twenty-six recall petitions have been launched ; of the six completed petitions returned to Elections BC, five were rejected for having too few valid signatures. The sixth, on the recall of MLA Paul Reitsma, was halted after Reitsma resigned in 1998 during the secondary verification stage.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, the recall referendum was included by the constitution in 1991. The constitutional replacement was launched as an answer to the movement known as &quot;la séptima papeleta&quot; (the seventh ballot), which requested a constitutional reform to end violence, narcoterrorism, corruption and increasing citizenship apathy. The definition of recall referendum in relation to programmatic vote was approved. It obliges candidates running for office to register a government plan which is later on considered to activate the recall. Since the time the mechanism was regulated by Law 134 in 1994, until 2015, 161 attempts led 41 referendums and none of them succeeded since the threshold of participation was not reached. In 2015, a new law (303/2015) reduced the number of signatures required to activate a recall referendum (from 40 per cent to 30 per cent of the total of votes obtained by the elected authority) and the threshold (dropping from the 50 per cent to the 40 per cent of valid votes on the day of the elections of the challenged authority). The change in the regulation, also quickening the registration of promoters, led to a considerable increase in the number of attempts.

=== Cuba ===
According to its constitution, Cuba is a socialist republic in which all members of representative bodies of state power are subject to recall by the masses. As a principle of soviet democracy, similar recall provisions have been included in the constitutions of many other communist countries, including that of the Soviet Union. Although allowable according to law, in practice the right of recall was never used in any soviet system of government, except for an attempt in Hungary in 1989.

=== Ecuador ===
Article 105 of the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador provides for recall of all elected officials: 
=== Germany ===

==== Mayoral Recalls ====
Mayors may be recalled in 11 out of the 16 states of Germany. In a majority of these states recall elections are indirect, meaning that they only take place after a motion of no confidence from the municipal council of the city. A supermajority vote is normally needed to start the recall process from the council. Four states also allow the direct recall, where citizens may sign a petition to trigger the recall vote.
==== State parliaments ====
The recall of members of the state parliaments of Germany exist in five states; Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, and Rhineland-Palatinate. All of these states only allow for the recall of the entire legislature by triggering a new election, the recall of individual members is not allowed.

Article 18, Section 3 of the Constitution of Bavaria provides, that the entire Landtag can be dismissed by referendum on petition of 1 Million citizens, with elections of a new Landtag to be held up to six weeks after the recall referendum.

=== India ===
=== Kiribati ===
Section 69 of the Constitution of Kiribati provides for a majority of electors in a district (who were electors of the district at the time of the original election) to sign a petition requesting a recall election. The recall election must not occur less than 6 months after the original election or a failed recall attempt. If the recall election is successful another election to fill the seat must be held within 3 months.

=== Latvia ===
Article 14 of the Constitution of Latvia enables the recall of the entire Saiema, though not of specific representatives:

:Article 14: Not less than one tenth of electors has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.
:If the majority of voters and at least two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections of the Saeima vote in the national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima, then the Saeima shall be deemed recalled.
:The right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima may not be exercised one year after the convening of the Saeima and one year before the end of the term of office of the Saeima, during the last six months of the term of office of the President, as well as earlier than six months after the previous national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.
:The electors may not recall any individual member of the Saeima.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, the State of Yucatán was the first to introduce the recall in 1938. The mechanism, which had never been used, was declared unconstitutional 72 years later by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. A similar mechanism introduced in Chihuahua in 1997 was also declared unconstitutional and consequently eliminated from law. Despite these precedents, the recall was later included in the states of Oaxaca (1998), Morelos (2011), Guerrero (2013), Zacatecas and Aguascalientes.

=== New Zealand ===
Early policies of the New Zealand Labour Party included support for &quot;the recall&quot;.

=== Peru ===
Recall regulations were introduced in Peru by the Democratic Constituent Congress (&quot;Congreso Constituyente Democrático&quot;) which drafted a new constitution after Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s &quot;autogolpe&quot; in 1992. Between 1997 and 2013, more than 5000 recall referendums were activated against democratically elected authorities from 747 Peruvian municipalities (45.5% of all municipalities). This makes Peru the world&#x27;s most intensive user of this mechanism.

=== Philippines ===
Article 10 of the 1987 constitution of the Philippines allows for the recall of local officials. The Local Government Code, as amended, enabled the application of the provisions of the constitution. Elected officials from provincial governors to the barangay (village) councilors are potentially subject to recall. At least 15% of the electorate in a specific place must have their signatures verified in a petition in order for the recall to take place.

The president, vice president, members of Congress, and the elected officials of the Bangsamoro cannot be removed via recall.

Above the barangay level, there had been eight recall elections, of which at least 2 led to a successful recall of an incumbent; the most recent recall election was the 2015 Puerto Princesa mayoral recall election. 

=== Switzerland ===
While recalls are not provided for at the federal level in Switzerland, six cantons allow them:
*Bern: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1846. 30,000 signatures (4% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive in 1852 (the &#x27;Schatzgelder&#x27; affair).
*Schaffhausen: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1876. 1,000 signatures (2% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive in 2000, triggered by the lawyer and cantonal MP Gerold Meier.
*Solothurn: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1869. 6,000 signatures (3% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive and legislative in 1995 (related to a banking scandal). Three further attempts (in 1887, 1961 and 1973) failed to collect the necessary number of signatures.
*Ticino: Recall of the executive has been possible since 1892. 15,000 signatures (7% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful recall attempt in 1942. In addition, recall of municipal executives has been possible since 2011. Signatures of 30% of all adult citizens are required to trigger a recall referendum.
*Thurgau: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1869. 20,000 signatures (13% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There have been no recall attempts.
*Uri: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1888. Since 1979, 600 signatures (3% of all adult citizens) have been required to trigger a recall referendum. In addition, recall of municipal executives and legislatives has been possible since 2011. Signatures of 10% of registered voters are required to trigger a recall referendum. There have been no recall attempts either at the cantonal or municipal levels.

The possibility of recall referendums (together with the popular election of executives, the initiative and the legislative referendum) was introduced into several cantonal constitutions after the 1860s in the course of a broad movement for democratic reform. The instrument has never been of any practical importance—the few attempts at recall so far have failed, usually because the required number of signatures was not collected—and it was abolished in the course of constitutional revisions in Aargau (1980), Baselland (1984) and Lucerne (2007). The only successful recall so far happened in the Canton of Aargau in the year 1862. However, the possibility of recalling municipal executives was newly introduced in Ticino in 2011, with 59% of voters in favor, as a reaction to the perceived problem of squabbling and dysfunctional municipal governments.

=== Soviet Union ===
Article 142 of The 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union gave the right in theory to recall deputies in legislatures at all levels of government:
As a principle of soviet democracy, similar recall provisions have been widely copied in the constitutions of other communist countries, including those of Cuba, China, Vietnam, North Korea, and countries in the Eastern Bloc. Although allowable according to law, in practice the right of recall was never used in any soviet system of government, except for an attempt in Hungary in 1989.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, according to the Additional Articles of the Constitution, the recall of the president or the vice president shall be initiated upon the proposal of one-fourth of all members of the Legislative Yuan, and also passed by two-thirds of all the members. The final recall must be passed in a recall election by more than one-half of the valid ballots in a vote in which more than one-half of the electorate in the free area of the Republic of China takes part.

Other elected officials can be recalled in elections by more than 1/4 of the total electors in the original electoral district, and where the number of votes consenting to the recall is more than that of dissenting.

On 6 June 2020, Mayor of Kaohsiung Han Kuo-yu became the first mayor to be recalled. 939,090 votes within 969,259 agreed the recall.

After Mayor of Keelung George Hsieh defeated a recall vote in October 2024, the Kuomintang proposed amendments to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act. In December 2024, the Legislative Yuan approved changes requiring that initiators and signatories of recall petitions provide photocopies of their national identification cards.

In 2025, due to the 2024 Taiwanese constitutional controversy, civic groups launched the &quot;Great Recall Wave&quot; to recall more than 30 Kuomintang legislators.

=== Ukraine ===
A year after the 2015 Ukrainian local elections, voters can achieve a recall election of an elected deputy or mayor if as many signatures as voters are collected.

=== United Kingdom ===

The Recall of MPs Act 2015 (c. 25) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which mandates a recall petition to be held if a Member of Parliament is found to have committed certain wrongdoings, including any that result in a custodial prison sentence. The petitions cannot be triggered by popular initiative. The subsequent recall petition is successful if signed by at least 10% of the electorate in the MPs constituency. Successful recall leads to a by-election to fill the seat.

The Act received Royal Assent on 26 March 2015 after being introduced on 11 September 2014. The UK’s first recall petition occurred in 2018.

There are no recall procedures for other elected officials in the United Kingdom.

=== United States ===

==== History ====

Recall first appeared in Colonial America in the laws of the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1631. This version of the recall involved one elected body removing another official. During the American Revolution, the Articles of Confederation stipulated that state legislatures might recall delegates from the Continental Congress. According to New York Delegate John Lansing, the power was never exercised by any state. The Virginia Plan, issued at the outset of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, proposed to pair recall with rotation in office and to apply these dual principles to the lower house of the national legislature. The recall was rejected by the Constitutional Convention. However, the anti-Federalists used the lack of recall provision as a weapon in the ratification debates.

Only two governors have ever been recalled. In 1921, Governor Lynn Frazier of North Dakota was recalled during a dispute about state-owned industries. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis of California was recalled over the state budget. Additionally, in 1988, a recall was approved against Governor Evan Mecham of Arizona, but he was impeached and convicted before it got on the ballot.

In Alaska, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Rhode Island, and Washington, specific grounds are required for a recall. Some form of malfeasance or misconduct while in office must be identified by the petitioners. The target may choose to dispute the validity of the grounds in court, and a court then judges whether the allegations in the petition rise to a level where a recall is necessary. Anna Louise Strong, member of the Seattle School board, was recalled from her position in 1918, apparently on grounds that she was supporting extreme labour positions. In the November 2010 general election, Illinois passed a referendum to amend the state constitution to allow a recall of the state&#x27;s governor, in light of former Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s corruption scandal. In the other eleven states that permit statewide recall, no grounds are required and recall petitions may be circulated for any reason. However, the target is permitted to submit responses to the stated reasons for recall.

The minimum number of signatures to qualify a recall, and the time limit to do so, vary among the states. In addition, the handling of recalls, once they qualify, differs. In some states a recall triggers a simultaneous special election, where the vote on the recall, as well as the vote on the replacement if the recall succeeds, are on the same ballot. In the 2003 California recall election, over 100 candidates appeared on the replacement portion of the ballot. In other states, a separate special election is held after the target is recalled, or a replacement is appointed by the Governor or some other state authority.

The largest amount of recalls in the United States were held in 2021, as 529 officials faced recalls, but it had the lowest amount of successful recalls as only 25 were removed.

==== 2011 recalls ====
In 2011, there were at least 150 recall elections in the United States. Of these, 75 officials were recalled, and nine officials resigned under threat of recall. Recalls were held in 17 states in 73 different jurisdictions. Michigan had the most recalls (at least 30). The year set a record for number of state legislator recall elections (11 elections) beating the previous one-year high (three elections).

Three jurisdictions adopted the recall in 2011.

Of recall elections, 52 were for city council, 30 were for mayor, 17 were for school board, 11 were for state legislators, and one was for a prosecuting attorney (York County, Nebraska). The largest municipality to hold a recall was Miami-Dade County, Florida, for mayor.

The busiest day was November 8 (Election Day) with 26 recalls. In 34 jurisdictions, recalls were held over multiple days.

==== Unsuccessful attempts to qualify recall elections ====

* 1988 Evan Mecham, Governor of Arizona, was scheduled for a recall election on May 17 of that year, after a successful petition drive (301,000 signatures). However, the Supreme Court of Arizona canceled the election, since Mecham had already been removed from office (via impeachment conviction) by the Senate on April 4.
*1992–93 Pete Wilson, Governor of California was targeted for recall by the &quot;Bite &#x27;Em Back&quot; campaign, which was a grassroots effort that came about as a result of a piece by &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; columnist Pat Dillon, in response to the then-ongoing California budgetary crisis. The &quot;Bite &#x27;Em Back&quot; campaign also intended to recall then-Speaker of the Assembly Willie L. Brown, and then-President Pro Tem of the state Senate, David Roberti.
*2003 H. Brent Coles, mayor of Boise, Idaho, was the subject of a recall petition drive. Coles resigned on February 14, 2003, before the recall drive could proceed.
*2009 Joseph Cao U.S. representative for Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, was determined to be not subject to recall because of his status as a Federal office holder.

*2010 there was one unsuccessful recall petition for Lisa Poppaw city council member of Fort Collins, CO.
*2010 there was one unsuccessful recall petition for Antonio Villaraigosa mayor of Los Angeles.
*2010, a recall proposal aimed at mayor Ron Littlefield of Chattanooga, Tennessee, failed after a judge of the Hamilton County, Tennessee circuit court ruled that too many of the petition signatures were invalid and that the petitioners had failed to properly adhere to the state&#x27;s recall law, leaving &quot;pages without dates&quot;.
*2011, the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in November that the Hamilton County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Hollingsworth did not have the jurisdiction in entering an injunction against the Hamilton County Election Commission. In its judgment summary the Appeals Court said, &quot;The trial court acted without jurisdiction in entering an injunction against the Election Commission. The judgment of the trial court is vacated and the complaint dismissed.&quot; Mayor Littlefield is continuing legal action to stop the recall.
*2011, as part of the 2011 Wisconsin Senate recall elections, there were a number of failed recall petitions. Petitions against senators Lena Taylor (D), Spencer Coggs (D), Mark Miller (D), Glenn Grothman (R), Julie Lassa (D), Fred Risser (D), and Mary Lazich (R), were unsuccessful. Many senators had multiple recall petitions filed against them, and in the case of both Wirch and Hansen, one succeeded while others failed.

In 2012, Johansen ran for reelection as an independent and lost by a wide margin; Millett was reelected.

*2020: Norman, Oklahoma Mayor and four of the eight city councilmembers were the subject of unsuccessful recall initiatives spearheaded by a local at a public City Council meeting.

=== Venezuela ===
Article 72 of the Constitution of Venezuela enables the recall of any elected representative, including the President. This provision was used in the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, which attempted to remove President Hugo Chávez:

:Article 72: All [...] offices filled by popular vote are subject to revocation.
:Once one-half of the term of office to which an official has been elected has elapsed, a number of voters representing at least 20% of the registered voters in the affected constituency may petition for the calling of a referendum to revoke that official&#x27;s mandate.
:When a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favour of the recall, provided that a number of voters equal to or greater than 25% of the total number of registered voters vote in the recall referendum, the official&#x27;s mandate shall be deemed revoked and immediate action shall be taken to fill the permanent vacancy as provided for by this Constitution and by law.

The 2004 recall referendum failed with 59.25% voting against removing Chavez from office.

<text>Paul Edgar Philippe Martin (born August 28, 1938), also known as Paul Martin Jr., is a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 21st prime minister of Canada and the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006.

The son of former senator and secretary of state for external affairs Paul Martin Sr., Martin was a lawyer from Ontario before he became president and the chief executive officer of Canada Steamship Lines in 1973. He held that position until his election as a member of Parliament for the Montreal riding of LaSalle—Émard in 1988. Martin ran for leader of the Liberal Party in 1990, losing to Jean Chrétien. Martin would become Chrétien&#x27;s longtime rival for the leadership of the party, though was appointed his minister of finance after the Liberal victory in the 1993 federal election. Martin oversaw many changes in the financial structure of the Canadian government, and his policies had a direct effect on eliminating the country&#x27;s chronic fiscal deficit by drastically cutting spending and reforming various programs including social services.

In 2002, Martin resigned as finance minister when the tension with Chrétien reached its peak. Martin initially prepared to challenge Chrétien&#x27;s leadership, though Chrétien announced his intention of retiring, which triggered the November 2003 leadership election. Martin easily won the leadership and in the following month, became prime minister. In the 2004 federal election, the Liberal Party retained power, although only as a minority government due to the Liberal Party&#x27;s sponsorship scandal that began in the late 1990s. Martin&#x27;s government signed the Kelowna Accord to improve living conditions for indigenous peoples, reached an agreement with the provinces on increased funding for healthcare, and legalized same-sex marriage. In 2005, the opposition parties in the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence contending that Martin&#x27;s government was corrupt after the Gomery Commission released new details regarding the sponsorship scandal; this triggered the 2006 federal election, which saw the Liberals being defeated by the newly unified Conservative Party led by Stephen Harper, ending over 12 years of Liberal rule.

Shortly after the defeat, Martin stepped down as Liberal leader and declined to seek re-election in 2008. Evaluations of Martin&#x27;s prime ministership have been mixed, whereas his tenure as finance minister is viewed more favourably. Now seen as a global diplomat, Martin continues to contribute on the international arena through a variety of initiatives such as Incentives for Global Health, the not-for-profit behind the Health Impact Fund, where he serves as a member of the advisory board. He also sits as an advisor to Canada&#x27;s Ecofiscal Commission.

==Early life==
Martin was born at Hôtel-Dieu of St. Joseph Hospital in Windsor, Ontario, and grew up in Windsor and Ottawa. His father, Paul Martin Sr., a Franco-Ontarian of Irish and French descent, served 33 years as a member of the House of Commons of Canada, and was a Cabinet minister in the Liberal governments of Prime Ministers W. L. Mackenzie King, Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson, and Pierre E. Trudeau. His mother, Eleanor &quot;Nell&quot; Alice (née Adams), was of Scottish and Irish descent. He had one sister, Mary-Anne Bellamy, who was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease at a young age. She died on July 20, 2011. Martin contracted polio in 1946 at the age of eight (like his father, who contracted the disease in 1907). To give him the opportunity to improve his French, his parents enrolled him in a private French-language middle school, École Garneau, in Ottawa.

Martin then briefly attended the University of Ottawa before transferring and graduating from St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto with a B.A. in history and philosophy in 1961. He was a member of the U of T Young Liberals during his time at the University of Toronto. He then attended the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, where he received an LL.B. in 1964. He was called to the Ontario bar in 1966.

On September 11, 1965, Martin married Sheila Ann Cowan, with whom he has three sons: Paul, Jamie and David.

==Business career==
===Board of directors===
In 1969, Power Corporation took a controlling share in Canada Steamship Lines. On December 2, 1970, Paul Martin, the 32-year-old executive assistant to Power Corporation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Maurice Strong, was appointed to the CSL board of directors. In 1971, CSL minority shareholders sold outstanding shares to Power Corporation, making CSL a Power Corporation subsidiary.

===Presidency===

CSL suffered losses in 1972 when forced to cover unexpected cost overruns in the construction of three 80,000-ton ocean-going tankers at Davie Shipbuilding. On November 22, 1973, Martin was appointed president and CEO of the CSL Group. In 1974, CSL earnings were further hurt by an eight-week strike on the Great Lakes.

In 1976, Power Corporation reversed itself and took over the investment portfolio that had been sold to CSL five years earlier. CSL reverted to an operating division of Power Corporation.

==Early political career (1988–1993)==

In 1988, Martin was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the southwestern Montreal riding of LaSalle-Émard. He was re-elected without much difficulty at every election until he retired from politics.

In 1984, the Liberal Party was defeated under the leadership of John Turner, falling to just 40 seats. A group of young Liberals approached Martin as a possible candidate to replace Turner, and while he did not take part in an attempt to overthrow Turner, he did prepare to succeed him in the leadership should the position open.

Martin was a candidate at the 1990 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, losing to Jean Chrétien in a bitter race that resulted in lasting animosity between the two men and their supporters. A key moment in that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal, where the discussion quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord. Martin, favouring Meech, attempted to force Chrétien to abandon his nuanced position on the deal and declare for or against it. When Chrétien refused to endorse the deal, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant &quot;vendu&quot; (&quot;sellout&quot; in French) and &quot;Judas&quot; at Chrétien. Chrétien was upset at the response from the floor and another similar outburst by Martin supporters at the convention when Chrétien accepted the party leadership. Jean Lapierre and his supporters, who supported Martin, wore black armbands at the convention to protest Chrétien&#x27;s victory. The Meech Lake accord was officially defeated just one day before the Liberal leadership was to be decided. In the House of Commons, Lapierre then crossed the floor to the newly formed &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot;.

After the leadership convention, Martin co-authored the election platform &quot;Creating Opportunity&quot;, colloquially known as the Red Book. The Liberal Party won a landslide majority government in the 1993 election.

==Finance Minister (1993–2002)==
After the Liberals formed the government, Martin was chosen as minister of finance by Prime Minister Chrétien. At the time, Canada had one of the highest budgetary deficits of the G7 countries. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s had lowered its rating on Canada&#x27;s foreign-denominated government debt from AAA to AA-plus in 1992, and in 1994, Moody&#x27;s lowered its rating on Canada&#x27;s foreign currency debt from Aaa to Aa1, partly due to Canada&#x27;s growing public debt. In his debut as finance minister, Martin made huge budget cuts that almost ground economic growth to a halt, scaling down government to 1951 levels. In 1994–96, when these cuts were made, economic growth decreased by 3.5 percentage points, according to a study by CIBC-Wood Gundy. The resulting loss in tax revenue almost eliminated the savings made by the cuts and turned the economy away from the public sector toward the private sector. The cuts endangered the provinces&#x27; abilities to pay for social programs, health care, and public infrastructure. In response, the Bank of Canada lowered interest rates to avoid contributing to a growing recession, causing a huge spurt of economic growth and resulting increase in government revenue. In 1998, Martin introduced a balanced budget, an event that had occurred only twice in 36 years before 1997. In 2002, Moody&#x27;s and Standard and Poor&#x27;s restored Canada&#x27;s domestic and foreign currency debt ratings to AAA.

During his tenure as finance minister, Martin was responsible for lowering Canada&#x27;s debt-to-GDP ratio from a peak of 70 percent to about 50 percent in the mid-1990s. In December 2001, he was named a member of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s &quot;dream cabinet.&quot; The global business and financial body listed Martin along with United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as top world leaders.

Also during his tenure as finance minister, Martin coordinated a series of meetings between the finance ministers of all provinces to discuss the pending crisis in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). Consequently, Martin oversaw the creation of a general public consultation process in February 1996 that eventually led to major structural reform of the CPP. The results of this public consultation process were collected and analyzed by the Finance department. Eventually, it led to a proposal for overhauling the CPP, which was presented to Parliament and was approved soon after, averting a pension crisis.

While Martin&#x27;s record as finance minister was lauded in business and financial circles, there were undeniable costs. Some of these took the form of reduced government services, affecting the operations and achievement of the mandate of federal and provincial departments. This was probably most noticeable in health care, as major reductions in federal funding to the provinces meant significant cuts in service delivery. Martin&#x27;s tactics, including those of using contributor&#x27;s funds from RCMP, Military and Civil Service pension plans and Employment Insurance, created further controversy. CAW economist Jim Stanford said that a combination of a spending freeze at 1994 levels and lower interest rates would have eliminated the deficit in two years through economic growth alone, without the reduction in services.

===Relations with Chrétien===

Chrétien and Martin frequently clashed while in office. It was reported that Chrétien privately often condemned Martin in bitter terms and had never forgiven Martin for running against him in the Liberal leadership convention of 1990. During that bitter contest, Martin had forced Chrétien to declare his opposition to the Meech Lake Accord and, as a result, Chrétien was generally unpopular in his home province for the next decade.

Even before the Liberals&#x27; second electoral victory in the 1997 election, there was much speculation in the media and in Ottawa that Martin was after Chrétien&#x27;s job and wanted to force him to retire. As the Liberals emerged with a smaller majority government after the 1997 election, it seemed unlikely that any opposition party could pose a serious challenge, but Martin began to gain support from those who began to disagree with Chrétien. Chrétien, however, resolved to stay on after the Liberals were reelected in 2000, having regained much of the ground lost in 1997. By this time, Martin had gained control of much of the party machinery.

==Becoming prime minister==

The conflict between the two men reached a peak in 2002. Martin left Cabinet, being replaced by John Manley as finance minister. There is some question about whether Martin resigned or Chrétien had him dismissed. Being out of Cabinet was likely a boost to Martin&#x27;s campaign as he was no longer obligated to disclose his donors. Soon after, Martin declared his intention to run as leader of the Liberal Party at the next party convention. Over the summer of 2002, Martin toured the country campaigning to succeed Chrétien while his Liberal organizers prepared to challenge Chrétien&#x27;s leadership during a review vote in January 2003. During the fall, Chrétien announced that he would step down in the spring of 2004 after less than half of caucus agreed to sign a commitment supporting him. The Liberal party called a leadership convention for the fall of 2003, to be held in Toronto.

Several other potential leadership contenders, such as Brian Tobin and Allan Rock, declined to enter the contest. John Manley&#x27;s attacks on Martin&#x27;s refusal to disclose his campaign contributors did little to dent the latter&#x27;s commanding lead and Manley eventually conceded the race. This left no strong candidate for Chrétien supporters to rally around, and some of them grudgingly voted for Martin.

On September 21, 2003, Martin easily defeated his sole remaining opponent, former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps, securing 93 percent of the party delegates. On November 14, 2003, he was declared the winner at the Liberal leadership convention, capturing 3,242 of 3,455 votes. He had won the leadership almost unopposed, due to his hold on the party machinery, and because Chrétien supporters did not rally around either of the leadership opponents.

Simon Fraser University professor Doug McArthur has noted that Martin&#x27;s leadership campaign used aggressive tactics for the 2003 leadership convention, in attempting to end the contest before it could start by giving the impression that his bid was too strong. McArthur blamed Martin&#x27;s tactics for the ongoing sag in Liberal fortunes, as it discouraged activists who were not on side.

==Prime Minister (2003–2006)==

===Majority government and sponsorship controversy===

On December 12, 2003, Martin was appointed by then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as the 21st Prime Minister of Canada. When sworn in as prime minister, Martin held the flag that flew on Parliament Hill when the elder Martin died. Both father and son had served as Cabinet ministers and contested the Liberal leadership on multiple occasions; their attempts from 1948 to 1990 were unsuccessful. Martin&#x27;s election as leader and becoming prime minister was described as fulfilling a family dream. Both also earned the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. One difference between them was that Paul Sr. was one of the most left-wing members of the party, while Paul Jr. is considered on the right-wing.

When he was sworn in, Martin&#x27;s new cabinet retained only half the ministers from Chrétien&#x27;s government, a noteworthy break in tradition from previous instances where a retiring prime minister handed over power to his successor as party leader. Martin and his supporters exercised control over the riding nomination process, breaking with the precedent to automatically sign the nomination papers of backbenchers and former ministers who wanted to run for reelection. While these were signs of open party infighting, this had little impact on Martin&#x27;s record popularity, with several pundits suggesting that the cabinet change was meant to present a new government different from Chrétien&#x27;s ten-year tenure.

Martin and the Liberals were adversely affected by a report from Auditor General Sheila Fraser on February 9, 2004, indicating that sponsorship contracts designed to increase the federal government&#x27;s status in Quebec resulted in little to no work done. Many of the agencies had Liberal ties, and roughly $100 million of the $250 million in program spending went missing. The scandal hurt Martin&#x27;s popularity, especially in Quebec, where Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe even accused Martin of planning to widen the St. Lawrence seaway to benefit his own Canada Steamship Lines. The scandal also cast skepticism on Martin&#x27;s recommendations for Cabinet appointments, prompting speculation Martin was simply ridding the government of Chrétien&#x27;s supporters to distance the Liberals from the scandal. Martin acknowledged that there was political direction but denied involvement in, or knowledge of, the sponsorship contracts. He had a judicial inquiry called to investigate what came to be known as the Sponsorship Scandal, and nominated John Gomery to head it.

During his term, Martin appeared as himself in a fictional, comedic context in several programs, including an episode of the CTV sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot; in 2006, and also in the CBC mockumentary series &quot;Jimmy MacDonald&#x27;s Canada&quot; in 2005.

====2004 federal election====
The Liberals were facing a new united Conservative Party led by Stephen Harper, while the Bloc Québécois and NDP were also buoyed by the Sponsorship Scandal. Martin advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to call an election for June 28, 2004.

The Liberals were also hampered by their inability to raise campaign money competitively after Chrétien passed a bill in 2003 that banned corporate donations, even though the Liberals had enjoyed by far the lion&#x27;s share of this funding due to the then-divided opposition parties. It has been suggested that Chrétien, who had done nothing about election financing for his 10 years in office, could be seen as the idealist as he retired, while his rival and successor Martin would have the burden of having to fight an election under the strict new rules.

An unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, who broke a pledge not to raise taxes, hurt the federal party&#x27;s numbers in Ontario, as did a weak performance from Martin in the leaders&#x27; debates. The Conservatives soon took the lead, prompting some predictions of an imminent Harper government. The Liberals managed to narrow the gap and eventually regain momentum. Martin was successful in winning a plurality of seats to continue as the government, though they were now in a minority situation, the first since Joe Clark&#x27;s tenure in 1979–80.

===Minority government===

The Martin government faced combined challenges from Quebec separatism and general hostility arising from the Sponsorship Scandal. The first test of the Liberal minority came following the Speech from the throne on October 5, 2004. The Conservatives announced plans to move an amendment to the speech. In this they were supported by the separatist Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party. The fall of the government was averted only after agreement on a watered-down version of the amendment.

====Economic policy====
Martin invested heavily in Quebec, for example with the Bombardier Inc. &quot;C series&quot; project, which was later taken over by Airbus when the owner got into financial difficulties and called the Airbus A220. By June 2005 Martin gave the Federation of Canadian Municipalities a GST rebate and was about to supply to them a portion of the federal gasoline tax; the programme was called &quot;New Deal for Cities and Communities&quot;. This was a left-over of his time as Minister of Finance, spurred by continued carping by academics, some of whom did not hesitate to note in 2004 that &quot;[u]nlike the federal and provincial governments, municipalities cannot borrow for operating purposes; they can only do so for capital expenditures.&quot; 

===== Healthcare funding =====

At the First Ministers&#x27; Meeting of September 13–15, 2004, Martin and the provincial premiers reached an agreement on increased funding for healthcare. This 10-year plan outlined $18 billion in increased transfers to the provinces over 6 years, notably through increases in the CHT:
* The CHT was to be increased by $3 billion in 2004-05 and $2 billion in 2005-06;
* A new CHT base set at $19 billion starting in 2005–06, greater than suggested in the Romanow Report;
* An escalation factor set at 6% starting in 2006–07.

===== Equalization =====

Martin also introduced changes to the equalization program, under which the Federal Government is constitutionally obligated to redistribute federal revenue to provinces having less ability to raise revenues through taxation than wealthier provinces. The goal is to ensure uniformity of public service provision across the nation. This was received well in &quot;have-not&quot; provinces, but Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador sought to retain income from natural resources on federal marine territory that would generally be taken, or &#x27;clawed back&#x27;, by the federal treasury in lieu of equalization payments. In the 2004 federal election campaign, Harper provided a written promise that Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia under a Conservative government would receive 100 percent of the revenue generated from their natural resources without an equalization clawback, a promise he reneged upon when elected Prime Minister. NDP leader Jack Layton followed suit soon after with a similar guarantee, and later Martin promised that under a Liberal government both provinces would receive the same deal, except only for oil resources. Negotiations over the agreement were harsh, with Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams at one point ordering all Canadian flags removed from provincial government buildings in December 2004. The dispute was resolved when the federal government agreed to Martin&#x27;s original campaign promise.

===== 2005 budget =====

The 2005 federal budget was presented in the House of Commons on February 23, 2005. The budget included an array of new spending for the Armed Forces, the environment and a national child-care program.

Public hearings of the Gomery Commission inquiry into the sponsorship scandal involving alleged kickbacks and &quot;donations&quot; from Quebec advertising agencies and corporations to Liberal Party operatives led to a drop in the Liberal Party&#x27;s popularity. The security of the minority government came under fire as the Conservatives threatened to force an election by use of their &quot;opposition day,&quot; when they get to set the Parliament&#x27;s agenda. The Conservatives would use this time to hold a vote of no confidence in order to topple Martin&#x27;s government. To avoid this, Martin removed all opposition days from the schedule and made a televised appearance on April 21, 2005, to attempt to gain support from the Canadian people to let the inquiry run its course before an election was called. In the rebuttal speeches by the opposition party leaders, Layton offered his party&#x27;s support provided that they were given major concessions in the budget such as canceling the proposed corporate tax cuts. Days later, the Liberals took the NDP up on their offer and negotiated tax cut deferments and new spending initiatives. Among the new commitments was aid for Sudan, which Sudan&#x27;s officials turned down as Martin did not consult them about it beforehand. This aid was attacked as a perceived attempt to win the vote of a single independent MP, former Liberal David Kilgour. Kilgour nevertheless voted against the government.

In May, Parliament passed a motion asking one of its committees to express a lack of confidence in the government. The Liberals dismissed this as a procedural matter, causing some to accuse them of governing unlawfully by ignoring parliamentary tradition. The Conservatives and Bloc interpreted it as a vote of no confidence, and they combined their votes to shut down the House of Commons early for two days in a row. The Speaker of the House of Commons later ruled in favour of the Liberal stance.

On May 17, 2005, MP Belinda Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservative Party and joined the Liberal Party to become Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. Martin claimed Stronach&#x27;s move was due to concerns over the direction the Conservative Party was taking; others accused Stronach of political opportunism. The event changed the balance of power in the House of Commons in favour of the government. This, and the support of independent MP Chuck Cadman, caused a tie during a May 2005 confidence vote, meaning that Peter Milliken, Speaker of the House needed to cast the deciding vote. He voted with the government, following the tradition that the Speaker votes to continue debate, and that allowed the budget to pass through the House on May 19, 2005.

====Social policy====

Same-sex marriage proved to be a defining issue of Martin&#x27;s mandate. Martin opposed same-sex marriage in a 1999 vote on the issue along with a majority of MPs, but changed his stance on the issue in 2004, citing recent court rulings and his personal belief that same-sex marriage was primarily a human rights issue. In the midst of various court rulings in 2003 and 2004 that allowed for the legalization of same-sex marriages in seven provinces and one territory, the government proposed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage across Canada. The House of Commons passed the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in late June 2005 in a late-night, last-minute vote before Parliament closed down, the Senate passed it in July 2005, and it received Royal Assent on July 20 of the same year. This made Canada the fourth country in the world to allow same-sex marriages.

In November 2005, the Martin government reached a historic consensus with Canada&#x27;s provinces, territories, First Nations, Métis and Inuit. Known as the Kelowna Accord, it aimed to eliminate the gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians in health, education, housing and economic opportunity.

====Foreign relations====

On February 24, 2005, Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew told the House of Commons that Canada would not participate in the American National Missile Defense Program, and that he expected to be consulted in the case of a missile being launched over Canadian airspace. Martin&#x27;s decision met with much praise, but others saw that the government was distancing itself from the U.S. His government continued to cooperate with the United States on border control, refugee claimants, and defense, and he appointed seasoned Liberal politician Frank McKenna as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to Washington.

Martin was criticized for failing to reach a foreign-aid target of 0.7 percent of GDP, most notably by Bono of Irish rock group U2 (who claimed that he was going to &quot;kick [Martin&#x27;s] butt&quot; over the issue). Martin later responded that, in his view, many foreign leaders had made pledges that were too fanciful and that he would only commit to targets that he knew his government could be held accountable for.

Martin became involved in a diplomatic row with the United States administration after accusing, with Bill Clinton, the US of not listening to global environmental concerns. Martin rejected US Ambassador David Wilkins&#x27;s rebuke and said he was standing up for Canada&#x27;s interests over softwood and other issues.

Martin promoted the expansion of the G8 into a larger group of twenty nations, G20, whose inaugural chairman was himself. He also forged a closer relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China by announcing the strategic partnership initiative during PRC President Hu Jintao&#x27;s state visit to Canada in September 2005.

====Appointment of Governor General====
On August 4, 2005, the government announced that Martin had advised Queen Elizabeth II to appoint Michaëlle Jean as governor general. The reception to the appointment was mixed: some applauded the move, while accusations that her husband had both dined with former members of the terrorist organization FLQ and been supportive of Quebec separatism surprised others. Subsequent to her appointment, she reaffirmed her commitment to federalism and the issue died down.

====Fall of government====
The first volume of the Gomery Report, released on November 1, 2005, cleared Martin of any wrongdoing while placing some blame for the scandal on Chrétien for lack of oversight, although it acknowledged that Chrétien had no knowledge of the scandal. On June 26, 2008, Chrétien was cleared of all allegations of involvement in the scandal.

A Canadian judge issued a gag order that barred Canadian media from covering the hearings of the Gomery Inquiry. Despite this, leaked information circulated after being published in an American blog &quot;Captain&#x27;s Quarters&quot;.

After the Gomery findings, NDP leader Jack Layton notified the Liberals of conditions for the NDP&#x27;s continued support; the terms of these conditions are unclear, but the two parties were unable to come to an agreement. An opposition proposal to schedule an election for February 2006 in return for passing several pieces of legislation was also unrealized. The Conservatives, supported by the other two opposition parties (the NDP and Bloc Québécois), introduced a motion of non confidence against the Martin government. The motion passed on November 28 by a count of 171–133, defeating the government, after which the Governor General issued election writs for a vote to be held on January 23, 2006.

Some commentators described Martin&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister as unfocused and indecisive, with the Canadian correspondent of &quot;The Economist&quot; reporting that he was being called &quot;Mr. Dithers&quot; in Ottawa.

====2006 federal election====
Prior to the campaign and upon dropping of the writs, opinion polling indicated the Liberals were ahead of the Conservatives by 2–10% popular support (November 30, 2005: Liberals 35%, Conservatives 30%). But the Liberal lead did not last. They did not plan much serious campaigning during December, allowing the Conservatives to take the initiative in rolling out policy ideas. Several early gaffes were picked up by an unsympathetic media. One notable gaffe was Liberal Party strategist Scott Reid&#x27;s suggestion that parents might buy beer and popcorn with the Conservatives&#x27; child care subsidy, although Martin declined to apologize. Martin was also criticized for portraying himself as the defender of Canadian unity; some opponents said that the election was not a referendum while others pointed to the Sponsorship Scandal.

Near the end of December, the Liberals were rocked by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police criminal investigation into the leaking of news of a federal tax change for income trusts. This again brought the Sponsorship Scandal to public attention at a time when Martin planned to make important policy announcements. Under constant campaign pressure by all opposition parties casting Martin and the Liberals as corrupt, Liberal support fell to as low as 26% in early January 2006. The decline was not halted even by a glossy election pledge booklet.

Martin did not put in a strong performance during the televised campaign debates. While appearing passionate in his message, he stuttered in making statements and appeared somewhat flustered. During one debate, Martin made a surprise pledge that he would eliminate the notwithstanding clause; the Conservatives pointed out that this was not one of the announced Liberal campaign promises.

In an attempt to sway voter sentiment in the final two weeks of the campaign, the Liberals prepared a series of attack ads. One unreleased ad was seen widely as disrespectful of the military and it not only overshadowed the other ads but also forced Martin to defend it instead of releasing new policies. During the last week, Martin was forced to defend Harper after the latter was called a separatist by Canadian Auto Workers union leader Buzz Hargrove. In another tactic similar to the 2004 campaign, Hargrove urged all progressive voters to unite under the Liberal banner in English Canada and the Bloc Québécois in Quebec to stop the Conservatives, hoping to attract voters who were leaning towards the NDP, but New Democrat leader Jack Layton responded by focusing his attacks on Liberal corruption.

In the end, the Conservatives won a plurality of support and seats, finishing 31 seats short of a majority. The Liberals held their base of support in Ontario, with 54 seats of the 103 in the province. The Liberals lost a number of seats in Quebec, winning only 13 of the 75 seats in the province, down from 21 in 2004, while the Conservatives won 10 seats there. The Liberals did not improve their standings in the Western provinces, winning only 14 of the 92 seats, the same number as in 2004.

Shortly after midnight on January 24, 2006, after it became clear that the Conservatives were on their way to a plurality, Martin conceded defeat. (Near the end of the 2004 election, Martin and Harper both pledged that they would not form a government unless they won a plurality of seats.) Martin surprised many by announcing his resignation as party leader, saying &quot;I will continue to represent with pride the people of LaSalle—Émard, but I will not take our party into another election as leader.&quot; The next day, Martin officially informed Governor General Michaëlle Jean of his intention to resign as prime minister. Jean asked Harper to form a government later that day. Martin remained as prime minister until the Harper minority government was sworn on February 6, 2006.

=== Supreme Court appointments ===
Martin chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:
* Rosalie Abella (October 4, 2004 – July 1, 2021)
* Louise Charron (October 4, 2004 – August 30, 2011)

==Return to the back benches (2006–2008)==
Choosing not to take on the office of Leader of the Opposition, the first defeated Prime Minister who had retained his seat not to do so, Martin stepped down as parliamentary leader of his party on February 1, and the Liberal caucus appointed Bill Graham, MP for Toronto Centre and outgoing Defence Minister, as his interim successor.

Martin temporarily remained nominal Liberal party leader until March 18, 2006, when he submitted his resignation to party executives, who handed that post to Graham for the interim until that next leadership convention could be held. At the same meeting Martin tendered his resignation, the date for the leadership convention to select his successor was set for the weekend of December 2–3, 2006. According to media reports, Martin decided to move up the date of his resignation to end speculation that he might lead the Liberals into another election if Stephen Harper&#x27;s minority government were to fall prior to the Liberal leadership convention. This began a trend of high turnover among permanent Liberal leaders, in contrast to their predecessors who usually served over two or more elections, including Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chrétien who each led for over a decade.

At the Liberal convention in Montreal, Martin was officially neutral in the contest. The party&#x27;s tribute to Martin was hosted by former Olympian Mark Tewksbury. Martin&#x27;s press secretary denied that the tribute was low key due to the Sponsorship Scandal and lingering bitterness inside the party, saying that the former prime minister wanted a simple evening. In his farewell speech, Martin paid homage to Chrétien, though the latter was not present for the event, and urged the Liberals to emerge united from the convention. Stéphane Dion was elected Liberal leader from a field of eight candidates.

For his last years of public office after resigning as Prime Minister, Martin was a backbencher, devoting his time to projects related to improving educational opportunities for Aboriginals (The Martin Aboriginal Education Initiative), and protecting the Congo Basin rain forest. In the 2008 federal election, Martin did not run for re-election to Parliament.

==Retirement (2008–present)==
In November 2008, CTV reported that Martin would be a member of a four-person council of economic advisers to a coalition government formed by the Liberals and the NDP if they succeed in toppling the Harper government. However, the proposed coalition dissolved as outgoing Liberal leader Stéphane Dion was immediately forced out and replaced by Michael Ignatieff, who quickly distanced the party from the coalition.

Martin published his memoirs, entitled &quot;Hell Or High Water: My Life In And Out of Politics&quot; (), in late 2008. The book, published by McClelland &amp; Stewart, draws heavily upon interviews conducted by Sean Conway, a former Ontario Liberal provincial cabinet minister, which were carried out for the Library and Archives Canada.

Martin was asked by Kofi Annan (at that time Secretary General of the United Nations), Gordon Brown (then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), and other international politicians and diplomats to help African countries develop their economic potential.

In 2009, Martin was co-chair of the Congo Basin Forest Fund, along with Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Professor Wangari Maathai, to address global warming and poverty issues in a ten-nation region in Africa.

In September 2022, Martin attended Elizabeth II&#x27;s state funeral, along with other former Canadian prime ministers.

Since his retirement from active Canadian politics, Martin has been an adviser to the International Monetary Fund, and to the Coalition for Dialogue on Africa. He also works with the Martin Family Initiative, which assists First Nations youth. He lives in Knowlton, Québec.

<text>Derek Wyn Taylor (7 May 1932 – 8 September 1997) was a British journalist, writer, publicist and record producer. He is best known for his role as press officer to the Beatles, with whom he worked in 1964 and then from 1968 to 1970, and was one of several associates to earn the moniker &quot;the Fifth Beatle&quot;. Before returning to London to head the publicity for the Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps organisation in 1968, he worked as the publicist for California-based bands such as the Byrds, the Beach Boys and the Mamas and the Papas. Taylor was known for his forward-thinking and extravagant promotional campaigns, exemplified in taglines such as &quot;The Beatles Are Coming&quot; and &quot;Brian Wilson Is a Genius&quot;. He was equally dedicated to the 1967 Summer of Love ethos and helped stage that year&#x27;s Monterey Pop Festival.

Taylor started his career as a local journalist on the Wirral, now part of Merseyside, aged 17 working for the Hoylake and West Kirby Advertiser followed by the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post and Echo&quot;. He then became a North England-based writer for national British newspapers that included the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. He also served as a regular columnist and theatre critic for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 1952. During the 1970s, Taylor worked for Warner Bros. Records and then HandMade Films. The term &quot;pocket symphony&quot; is generally attributed to Taylor for his description of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.

A trusted confidant of the Beatles, Taylor remained particularly close to George Harrison long after the band&#x27;s break-up and maintained a friendship with John Lennon until the latter&#x27;s murder in 1980. In addition to working as editor on Harrison&#x27;s 1980 autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, Taylor authored books such as &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, &quot;The Making of Raiders of The Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Fifty Years Adrift (In An Open Necked Shirt)&quot; and &quot;It Was Twenty Years Ago Today&quot;. Having returned to Apple in the early 1990s, Taylor died of cancer in September 1997 while working on the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; book.

==Work with the Beatles==
Taylor was a national journalist working for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; when he was assigned to write a review of a Beatles concert on 30 May 1963. He had been expected by his editors to write a piece critical of what at that time was considered by the national press as an inconsequential teen fad. However, he was enchanted by the group and instead sang their praises. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to meet the Beatles and soon became a trusted journalist in their circle, especially as he was a fellow Liverpudlian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As the band gained national attention in Britain, Taylor&#x27;s editors conceived of running a column ostensibly written by a Beatle to boost circulation, to be ghostwritten by Taylor. George Harrison was the Beatle eventually decided upon. Although Harrison was initially only given the right to approve or disapprove of the content, Harrison&#x27;s dissection of the first draft turned the column into an ongoing collaboration between the two, with Harrison providing the stories and Taylor providing the polish.

In early 1964, Beatles manager Brian Epstein hired Taylor away from his newspaper job, putting him in charge of Beatles press releases, and acting as media liaison for himself and the group. He subsequently became Epstein&#x27;s personal assistant for a short period. Taylor assisted Epstein in the writing of his autobiography, &quot;A Cellarful of Noise&quot;. Taylor conducted interviews with Epstein for the book and then shaped the transcriptions of the audio recordings into a narrative, retaining most of Epstein&#x27;s basic words.

Taylor served as press officer for the Beatles&#x27; first concert tour of the US in the summer of 1964. After a falling out with Epstein, he resigned from his position at the end of the tour, in September. Brian Epstein demanded that Taylor continue working for a three-month notice period, however. After this, he went to work for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.

==As a publicist in California==
In 1965, Taylor left the UK and moved with his growing family to California. There he started his own public relations company, providing publicity for groups such as the Byrds, the Beach Boys and Paul Revere and the Raiders, as well as the Mamas &amp; the Papas. According to music critic Richie Unterberger, through his time working in Hollywood, Taylor &quot;became, probably, the most famous rock publicist of the mid-&#x27;60s&quot;.

Among Taylor&#x27;s strategies, he touted the Byrds as a new breed of American band with parallels to the Beatles. He also encouraged nascent rock journalists to perceive Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson as a musical genius. Using his connections in Britain, Taylor ensured that the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; received a level of acclaim from UK music critics and Wilson&#x27;s peers, including John Lennon and Paul McCartney, that had not been forthcoming in the United States.

In June 1967, Taylor helped organise the Monterey Pop Festival, serving as the event&#x27;s publicist and spokesman. For a few weeks in the autumn of 1967, Taylor hosted a Sunday-evening freeform radio program on Pasadena station KRLA. Having contributed to the station&#x27;s magazine, &quot;KRLA Beat&quot;, since 1965, he became editor in 1967, helping to guide the magazine&#x27;s focus towards US countercultural issues and psychedelia.

George Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; was written during Harrison&#x27;s 1967 visit to California, on a foggy night waiting for Taylor and his wife Joan to arrive at his rented home in the Hollywood Hills. During the same visit, Taylor accompanied Harrison on his trip to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco.

Taylor was a catalyst in Harry Nilsson&#x27;s musical career; hearing Nilsson&#x27;s song &quot;1941&quot; on a car radio, he bought a case (twenty-five copies) of his album &quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot;, sending copies to various members of the music-industry. Among the recipients were all four Beatles, who became enamoured of Nilsson&#x27;s talent and invited him to London. Nilsson subsequently became a collaborator and good friend of both Lennon and Ringo Starr. In 1973, Taylor produced Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot;.

==The Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps==
In April 1968, at Harrison&#x27;s request, Taylor returned to England to work for the Beatles again, as the press officer for their newly created Apple Corps. Taylor oversaw the public launch of the company&#x27;s record label, Apple Records, in August 1968, marked by the release of the Beatles&#x27; single &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. As part of the campaign, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and three other Apple singles were compiled in a gift box and dispatched to Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother and the British prime minister. During this period, Taylor frequently clashed with Paul McCartney, about whom he later wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever hated anyone as much as I hated Paul in the summer of 1968.&quot; That same year, Taylor provided uncredited contributions to the lyrics of two songs issued on the band&#x27;s double album, &quot;The Beatles&quot;: &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;.

Between 1968 and 1970, Taylor had a major role in the company&#x27;s activities, leading the publicity campaigns for the band&#x27;s projects and for those of the other artists signed to Apple Records. Among these, he helped stage Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1969 campaign for world peace. He is named in the lyrics of Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;, along with Tommy Smothers, Timothy Leary and Norman Mailer, who like Taylor were all present at the recording of the song. In March 1970, Taylor commissioned the young photographer Les Smithers to photograph Badfinger, a rock band signed to Apple Records. That portrait has now been acquired by the National Portrait Gallery.

Taylor&#x27;s time as Apple press officer became as notable for its extravagance as much as the creativity of his campaigns and press releases. With the appointment of Allen Klein as Apple&#x27;s business manager in early 1969 – leading to a period that Taylor later described as &quot;miserable&quot; – expenditure and staff numbers were cut back drastically. While describing Taylor as a &quot;lavish spender&quot;, author Nick Talveski notes that much of his job entailed denying the media access to the Beatles. Talveski adds: &quot;To his eternal credit, Taylor nevertheless became one of the most popular professionals in the [music] industry, one of very few men to perfect the art of saying &#x27;no&#x27; graciously.&quot; In her 2009 memoir, former Apple employee Chris O&#x27;Dell says that Taylor &quot;stood for everything that was good and honest and funny and bright about Apple&quot;.

Taylor left the company in late 1970, having outlasted most of the other senior employees there, thanks to the affection and high regard in which he was held by Lennon, Harrison and Starr. In April that year, Taylor had confirmed The Beatles&#x27; break-up using deliberately vague terms, partly to mask his sadness:
Spring is here and Leeds play Chelsea tomorrow and Ringo and John and George and Paul are alive and well and full of hope. The world is still spinning and so are we and so are you. When the spinning stops – that&#x27;ll be the time to worry. Not before …

==After the Beatles==
Taylor went to work for the newly launched UK record company WEA (later Warner Music Group), the British umbrella company that distributed and marketed several labels owned in the US by Kinney National Company. These record labels included Warner Bros., Reprise, Elektra and Atlantic. Taylor served as Director of Special Projects, working with artists such as the Rolling Stones, Yes, America, Neil Young, Vivian Stanshall, Carly Simon and Alice Cooper. He also presided over a revival of British jazz singer George Melly, producing two albums for him. He was instrumental in signing seminal Liverpool Art School rock band Deaf School, featuring future record producer Clive Langer. He was instrumental in the Rhead Brothers signing to WEA and received a dedication on both their 1977 album &quot;Dedicate&quot; and the re-issued &quot;Black Shaheen&quot; (2017).

Independently of his work for WEA, Taylor co-produced Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot; in 1973. He had previously provided liner notes for Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot; album. (A story written by Taylor&#x27;s daughter Vanessa was printed on the back cover of Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Harry&quot;.)

==Return to the United States==
In the mid-1970s Taylor served as a Vice-President of Marketing for Warner Bros. Records, where he was instrumental in the acquisition of the Rutles project, and supervised the worldwide marketing campaign for the album release and television special. A spoof on the Beatles&#x27; career and legacy, the Rutles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; special featured Harrison playing a reporter interviewing a Derek Taylor-like character, named Eric Manchester and played by Michael Palin. Taylor left Warner&#x27;s in 1978. As well as staying close to Harrison throughout the 1970s, Taylor maintained a correspondence with Lennon during the latter&#x27;s years of retirement between 1975 and 1980. Taylor did not enjoy his second period in California, however, and returned to England after a couple of years.

==Back in England==
In the early 1980s he worked as a co-author on books with Michelle Phillips and Steven Spielberg. He also worked with George Harrison&#x27;s film company, Handmade Films.

In January 1988, while accepting the Beatles&#x27; induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Harrison named Taylor and Neil Aspinall as the two people worthy of the much-used title &quot;the Fifth Beatle&quot;. In the early 1990s Taylor was asked to rejoin Apple to be in charge of marketing of the multiple projects planned for that decade. The projects included the CD release of the non-Beatle Apple catalogue and major Beatles releases such as &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; and compilation albums associated with &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;.

==Work as an author==
In 1973 he wrote a very informal memoir, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, published by Sphere Books and reprinted by its Abacus imprint the following year. (It was re-issued in 2018.)

Over 1978–79, Taylor collaborated again with Harrison, helping him to complete his autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, published in 1980 by Genesis Publications. The following year, Taylor&#x27;s on-set account of the production of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was published as &quot;The Making of Raiders of The Lost Ark&quot; by Ballantine Books. He subsequently wrote his own autobiography, &quot;Fifty Years Adrift&quot;, published in December 1983 by Genesis, for which Harrison provided a glowing introduction to the signed, limited-edition volume. Only 2000 copies were printed, and the book quickly became a collectors&#x27; item after Harrison joined Taylor in promoting the publication.

In 1987, Taylor&#x27;s &quot;It Was Twenty Years Ago Today&quot; (published by Bantam Press in the UK, and Fireside for Simon &amp; Schuster in the US)&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen/UPI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the release of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It provides a detailed documentary of the people and events that shaped the album and the wider events of the Summer of Love counterculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy/Sentinel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes archive interviews and photographs as well as extensive transcripts from a Granada TV documentary, which was also titled &quot;It Was Twenty Years Ago Today&quot; and for which Taylor served as consultant.

&quot;As Time Goes By: Living in the Sixties (Rock and Roll Remembrances Series No 3)&quot; (Popular Culture Ink) was published in June 1990 in the US.

&quot;Getting sober...and loving it!&quot;, co-authored with his wife Joan Taylor, was released in 1992. The book collects personal experiences from alcoholics, including himself, combined with practical information. Ringo Starr wrote the foreword.

In the UK Bois Books published &quot;What You Cannot Finish&quot; and &quot;Take A Sad Song&quot; in 1995, coinciding with the release of the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; (Taylor was extensively interviewed for the TV program). Posthumous volumes include &quot;Beatles&quot; (Ebury Press 1999). In addition, an audio CD, &quot;Here There and Everywhere: Derek Taylor Interviews The Beatles&quot;, was released on the Thunderbolt label in 2001.

==Death==
Derek Taylor died of throat cancer at his home in Sudbury, Suffolk, on 8 September 1997. At the time of his death he was still working for Apple, helping to compile the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; book. His funeral took place in Sudbury, Suffolk on 12 September, attended by family and friends such as Harrison, Aspinall, Palin, Neil Innes and Jools Holland.

==Personal life==
Taylor was married to Joan Taylor (née Doughty) from 1958 until his death. The couple had six children: Timothy, Dominic, Gerard, Abigail, Vanessa and Annabel. Joan Taylor appeared in his stead in the 2011 documentary &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;.

In 2013, American singer and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks revealed that she had had a brief affair with Taylor in the late 1970s, and that she wrote the song &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, included in the album &quot;Tusk&quot;, about him.

<doc id="129208" wikidata="Q338518" url="?curid=129208" title="Intel i860">
<text>The Intel i860 (also known as 80860) is a RISC microprocessor design introduced by Intel in 1989. It is one of Intel&#x27;s first attempts at an entirely new, high-end instruction set architecture since the failed Intel iAPX 432 from the beginning of the 1980s. It was the world&#x27;s first million-transistor chip. It was released with considerable fanfare, slightly obscuring the earlier Intel i960, which was successful in some niches of embedded systems. The i860 never achieved commercial success and the project was terminated in the mid-1990s.

==Implementations==

The first implementation of the i860 architecture is the i860 XR microprocessor (code-named N10), which ran at 25, 33, or 40 MHz. The second-generation i860 XP microprocessor (code named N11) added 4 Mbyte pages, larger on-chip caches, second level cache support, faster buses, and hardware support for bus snooping, for cache consistency in multiprocessor systems. A process shrink for the XP (from 1 μm to 0.8 CHMOS V) increased the clock to 40 and 50 MHz. Both microprocessors supported the same instruction set for application programs.

==Technical features==
The i860 combined a number of features that were unique at the time, most notably its very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture and powerful support for high-speed floating-point operations. The design uses two classes of instructions: &quot;core&quot; instructions which use a 32-bit ALU, and &quot;floating-point or graphics&quot; instructions which operate on a floating-point adder, a floating-point multiplier, or a 64-bit integer graphics unit. The system had separate pipelines for the ALU, floating-point adder, floating-point multiplier, and graphics unit. It can fetch and decode one &quot;core&quot; instruction and one &quot;floating-point or graphics&quot; instruction per clock. When using dual-operation floating-point instructions (which transfer values between subsequent dual-operation instructions), it is able to execute up to three operations (one ALU, one floating-point multiply, and one floating-point add-or-subtract) per clock.

All of the data buses were at least 64 bits wide. The internal memory bus to the cache, for instance, was 128 bits wide.

The &quot;core&quot; class instructions use thirty-two 32-bit integer registers. But the &quot;floating-point or graphics&quot; instructions use a register file that can be accessed by the floating point units as either thirty-two 32-bit, sixteen 64-bit, or eight 128-bit floating-point registers, or that can be accessed by the graphics unit as sixteen 64-bit integer registers.

The &quot;core&quot; unit is responsible for fetching instructions, and in the normal &quot;single-instruction&quot; mode can fetch one 32-bit &quot;core&quot; or one 32-bit &quot;floating point or graphics&quot; instruction per cycle. But when executing in dual-instruction mode, the instruction cache is accessed as VLIW instructions consisting of a 32-bit &quot;core&quot; instruction paired with a 32-bit &quot;floating-point or graphics&quot; instruction, simultaneously fetched together over a 64-bit bus.

Intel referred to the design as the &quot;i860 64-Bit Microprocessor&quot;.

Intel i860 instructions acted on data sizes from 8-bit through 128-bit.

The graphics supports SIMD-like instructions in addition to basic 64-bit integer math. For instance, its 64-bit integer datapath can represent multiple pixels together as either 8-bit pixels, 16-bit pixels, or 32-bit pixels. Experience with the i860 influenced the MMX functionality later added to Intel&#x27;s Pentium processors.

The pipelines into the functional units are program-accessible (VLIW), requiring the compilers to order instructions carefully in the object code to keep the pipelines filled. In traditional architectures these duties were handled at runtime by a scheduler on the CPU itself, but the complexity of these systems limited their application in early RISC designs. The i860 was an attempt to avoid this entirely by moving this duty off-chip into the compiler. This allowed the i860 to devote more room to functional units, improving performance. As a result of its architecture, the i860 could run certain graphics and floating-point algorithms with exceptionally high speed, but its performance in general-purpose applications suffered and it was difficult to program efficiently (see below).

The i860 has both non-delayed and delayed branch instructions. When delayed branches are taken, the following instruction will be executed prior to transferring control to the branch target instruction. It means the i860 has a single branch delay slot.

==Performance==
On paper, performance was impressive for a single-chip solution; however, real-world performance was anything but. One problem, perhaps unrecognized at the time, was that runtime code paths are difficult to predict, meaning that it becomes exceedingly difficult to order instructions properly at compile time. For instance, an instruction to add two numbers will take considerably longer if those numbers are not in the cache, yet there is no way for the programmer to know if they are or not. If an incorrect guess is made, the entire pipeline will stall, waiting for the data. The entire i860 design was based on the compiler efficiently handling this task, which proved almost impossible in practice. While theoretically capable of peaking at about 60-80 MFLOPS for both single precision and double precision for the XP versions, manually written assembler code managed to get only about up to 40 MFLOPS, and most compilers had difficulty getting even 10 MFLOPs. The later Itanium architecture, also a VLIW design, suffered again from the problem of compilers incapable of delivering sufficiently optimized code.

Another serious problem was the lack of any solution to handle context switching quickly. The i860 had several pipelines (for the ALU and FPU parts) and an interrupt could spill them and require them all to be re-loaded. This took 62 cycles in the best case, and almost 2000 cycles in the worst. The latter is 1/20000th of a second at 40 MHz (50 microseconds), an eternity for a CPU. This largely eliminated the i860 as a general purpose CPU.

==Demise==
As the compilers improved, the general performance of the i860 did likewise, but by then most other RISC designs had already passed the i860 in performance.

In the late 1990s, Intel replaced their entire RISC line with ARM-based designs, known as the XScale. Confusingly, the 860 number has since been re-used for a motherboard control chipset for Intel Xeon (high-end Pentium) systems and a model of the Core i7.

Andy Grove suggested that the i860&#x27;s failure in the marketplace was due to Intel being stretched too thin:
==Applications==
At first, the i860 was only used in a small number of supercomputers such as the Intel iPSC/860. Intel later marketed the i860 as a workstation microprocessor for a time, where it competed with microprocessors based on the MIPS and SPARC architectures, among others. The Oki Electric OKI Station 7300/30 and Stardent Vistra 800 Unix workstations were based on a 40 MHz i860 XR running UNIX System V/i860. The Hauppauge 4860 and Olivetti CP486 featured an Intel 80486 and i860 on the same motherboard. Microsoft initially developed what was to become Windows NT on internally designed i860XR-based workstations (codenamed &quot;Dazzle&quot;), only porting NT to the MIPS (Microsoft Jazz), Intel 80386 and other processors later. Some claim the NT designation was a reference to the &quot;N-Ten&quot; codename of the i860XR.

The i860 did see some use in the workstation world as a graphics accelerator. It was used, for instance, in the NeXTdimension, where it ran a cut-down version of the Mach kernel running a complete PostScript stack. However, the PostScript part of the project was never finished so it ended up just moving color pixels around. In this role, the i860 design worked considerably better, as the core program could be loaded into the cache and made entirely &quot;predictable&quot;, allowing the compilers to get the ordering right. Truevision produced an i860-based accelerator board intended for use with their Targa and Vista framebuffer cards. Pixar produced a custom version of RenderMan to run on the card that ran approximately four times faster than the 386 host. Another example was SGI&#x27;s RealityEngine, which used a number of i860XP processors in its geometry engine. This sort of use slowly disappeared as well, as more general-purpose CPUs started to match the i860&#x27;s performance, and as Intel turned its focus to Pentium processors for general-purpose computing.

Mercury Computer Systems used the i860 in their multicomputer. From 2 to 360 compute nodes would reside in a circuit switched fat tree network, with each node having local memory that could be mapped by any other node. Each node in this heterogeneous system could be an i860, a PowerPC, or a group of three SHARC DSPs. Good performance was obtained from the i860 by supplying customers with a library of signal processing functions written in assembly language. The hardware packed up to 360 compute nodes in 9U of rack space, making it suitable for mobile applications such as airborne radar processing.

During the early 1990s, Stratus Technologies built i860-based servers, the XA/R series, running their proprietary VOS operating system.

Also in the 1990s, Alliant Computer Systems built their i860-based FX/800 and FX/2800 servers, replacing the FX/80 and FX/8 series that had
been based on the Motorola 68000 ISA. Both the Alliant and Mercury compute systems were in heavy use at NASA/JPL for the SIR-C missions.

The U.S. military used the i860 for numerous aerospace and digital signal processing applications as a coprocessor, where it saw use up until the late 1990s.

<doc id="129209" wikidata="Q65961967" url="?curid=129209" title="Earl of Cork">
<text>Earl of Cork is a title in the Peerage of Ireland, held in conjunction with the Earldom of Orrery since 1753. It was created in 1620 for Richard Boyle, 1st Baron Boyle. He had already been created Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghal, in the County of Cork, in 1616, and was made Viscount of Dungarvan, in the County of Waterford, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland.

Known as the &quot;Great Earl&quot;, Richard Boyle was born in Canterbury, England, but settled in Ireland in 1588, where he married an Irish heiress and bought large estates in County Cork. From 1631 to 1643 he served as Lord Treasurer of Ireland. His third son, the Hon. Sir Roger Boyle was created Earl of Orrery in 1660. The first Earl of Cork was remarkable for having four of his sons created peers; his remaining son was Robert Boyle, the scientist, discoverer of Boyle&#x27;s law.

Lord Cork was succeeded by his second son, another Richard Boyle, the second Earl; his eldest son died young. This Richard Boyle had already succeeded his younger brother as second Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky according to a special remainder in the letters patent. He married Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford, and in 1644 he was created Baron Clifford of Lanesborough, in the County of York, in the Peerage of England. Lord Cork later served as Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1664 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Burlington in the Peerage of England. His only son and heir apparent Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, was summoned to the Irish House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Viscount Dungarvan in 1663. He later represented Tamworth and Yorkshire in the English House of Commons. In 1689 he was summoned to the English House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Clifford of Lanesborough.

Lord Cork was succeeded by his grandson, the third Earl, the son of Viscount Dungarvan. He was Lord Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the fourth Earl of Cork and third Earl of Burlington. Known as Lord Burlington, he was the famous architect who published Andrea Palladio&#x27;s designs of Ancient Roman architecture and designed Chiswick House with William Kent. He had no sons and on his death in 1753 the barony of Clifford of Lanesborough and earldom of Burlington became extinct. He was succeeded in the Burlington estates and in the barony of Clifford by his eldest surviving daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle, 6th Baroness Clifford (see the Baron Clifford for later history of this title). She married William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. Their third son Lord George Augustus Henry Cavendish was created Earl of Burlington in 1831.

Lord Burlington was succeeded in the earldom of Cork and the other remaining titles by his third cousin John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, who became the fifth Earl of Cork as well (he was descended from the &quot;third&quot; son of the first Earl of Cork, and had also inherited the titles of Baron Broghill [Ireland] and Baron Boyle of Marston in the Peerage of Great Britain, thus a seat in the British House of Lords until 1999 (see the Earl of Orrery for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was a writer and a friend of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. He represented Charleville in the Irish House of Commons and Warwick in the British House of Commons. He died unmarried at the age of thirty-three and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork. The seventh Earl is remembered only for the fame of his second wife Mary Boyle, Countess of Cork and Orrery, the celebrated Lady Cork whose salon was a centre of intellectual life for fifty years. On his death in 1798 the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the eighth Earl. He was a General in the Army and fought in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
He was succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Captain Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan. Lord Cork was a Liberal politician and served as Master of the Buckhounds and as Master of the Horse under Lord Russell, William Ewart Gladstone and Lord Rosebery. His eldest son, the tenth Earl, fought in the Second Boer War but died childless in 1925. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the eleventh Earl. He also died childless and was succeeded by his second cousin, William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and Orrery. He was the grandson of the Hon. John Boyle, third son of the eighth Earl. Lord Cork was an Admiral of the Fleet and notably commanded the combined expedition for the capture of Narvik in 1940. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the thirteenth Earl. He was the eldest son of Major the Hon. Reginald Courtenay Boyle. He served as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords and as Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords from 1973 to 1978. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourteenth Earl. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the fifteenth Earl, who succeeded in 2003.

The family seat is Lickfold House, near Petworth, West Sussex.

==Earl of Cork (1394?)==
Edward of Norwich, Earl of Rutland, the first son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, fifth son of Edward III of England, favorite of his cousin Richard II, had been created &quot;Earl of Cork&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland during his nephew&#x27;s personal reign. While the creation is unrecorded, he campaigned in Ireland from 1394 to 1395, and both he and King Richard use the title in letters that spring.

He is usually called by some other of his many titles; Rutland, Aumale, or York. He was created Duke of Aumale in 1397, and deprived of the dukedom 6 October 1399, as a consequence of the deposition of Richard II; he succeeded his father as Duke of York in 1402. This Earldom, and all honours created for him, became extinct when he died childless at the battle of Agincourt in 1415.

<text>Malcolm Frederick Evans (27 May 1935 – 4 January 1976) was an English road manager and personal assistant employed by the Beatles from 1963 until their break-up in 1970.

In the early 1960s Evans was employed as a telephone engineer, and he also worked part-time as a bouncer at the Cavern Club. The Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein, later hired Evans as the group&#x27;s assistant roadie, in tandem with Neil Aspinall. Over time, Evans became a constant companion to the group, being present on all of their tours, and after the Beatles stopped touring in 1966, at nearly all of their recording sessions. As a constant presence, the Beatles occasionally used Evans as an extra musician; he has (often uncredited) contributions on most Beatles albums from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965) onwards. During the final years of the group, and continuing after their break-up in 1970, Evans worked as a record producer and continued to work with the individual Beatles on their solo projects. As a producer, his biggest hit was with Badfinger&#x27;s top 10 hit &quot;No Matter What&quot;.

In 1976, at the age of 40, Evans was shot and killed by police at his home in Los Angeles, when he threatened officers with what turned out to be an air rifle. A decade after his death, his collection of diaries, notebooks and other handwritten documents was discovered, many of which provided key insights into Beatles recording sessions and internal band dynamics, though the disposition of these writings has been a source of some legal controversy in the intervening decades.

== Early life ==
Malcolm Frederick Evans was born in Liverpool to Frederick and Joan Evans and grew up in Waldgrave Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, along with his three sisters Pam, June and Barbara. He could also play the banjo.

What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a funfair in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, was born in the same year. Their daughter, Julie, was born five years later in 1966.

The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool&#x27;s Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Allerton and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.

He first befriended George Harrison, who put forward Evans&#x27; name to the Cavern Club&#x27;s manager, Ray McFall, when he needed a doorman. The 27-year-old Evans was accepted, even though he wore thick-framed glasses, but mainly because of his burly frame, which was an asset when holding back unruly fans at the Cavern&#x27;s door. He was later nicknamed the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot; and &quot;Big Mal&quot;. In 1962, Evans wrote that it was &quot;a wonderful year&quot;, as he had Lily (his wife), his son Gary, a house, a car, and he was working at the Cavern Club, which he wrote into a 1963 Post Office Engineering Union diary, which also had information concerning Ohm&#x27;s law and Post Office pay rates.

== The Beatles ==

On 11 August 1963, Evans began working for the Beatles in the combined role of roadie/bodyguard. Evans and Aspinall&#x27;s duties were to drive the van while on tour, and to set up and test the equipment. Evans&#x27; telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and glazed over; Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group had to lie one on top of the other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures, something Paul McCartney later referred to as a &quot;Beatle sandwich&quot;.

Evans had many other duties as well as acting as a bodyguard; he was sent to buy anything they needed, such as clothing, meals, or drinks. If John Lennon said &quot;Socks, Mal&quot;, Evans would have to rush to a local store and buy pairs of cotton socks for him. In 1967, Evans wrote in his diaries that he &quot;bought Ringo [Starr] some undies for his visit to the doctor&quot;. Although Beatles&#x27; memorabilia are in continuous demand, a full set of autographs by all four could be forgeries: Evans and Aspinall used to sign many of them when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were too busy.

The Beatles started their first European tour in January 1964, and Evans was allowed to take his wife and son with him, but was involved in a &quot;big punch-up&quot; with photographers in Paris while protecting them. Epstein&#x27;s associate, Alistair Taylor, once asked him why he was driving an Austin Princess limousine, rather than a Daimler, a Bentley, or a Rolls-Royce. Evans explained that the Beatles were forced to choose an Austin, because they had tested every car to see how wide the doors would open as they (literally) had to &quot;dive into the car&quot; to escape their fans.

=== United States and the Philippines ===
The Beatles, and Evans, were introduced to cannabis by Bob Dylan in New York City in 1964. McCartney and Evans, both high for the first time, frantically searched until they found a pencil and paper so McCartney could write down his cannabis-influenced thoughts about life. He entrusted the writing to Evans, only to discover the next morning that he&#x27;d only written, with no further explanation, &quot;There are seven levels!&quot; He later guessed it was rooted in a general concept shared by some world religions although he admitted he would not have known anything about them at that point. The Beatles attended &quot;The Night of 100 Stars&quot; at the London Palladium on 23 July 1964, and during the show Evans constantly supplied them with whisky and Coca-Cola, which he delivered to them balanced on a wooden oar he had found backstage.

The Beatles were always assisted by Evans on their American tours, and when they played two shows at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1965 Epstein arranged for them all to have a four-day rest in a luxurious horseshoe-shaped house on stilts in Benedict Canyon off Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles. They spent their time there smoking cannabis joints. Evans and Lennon swam in the large outdoor swimming pool with cigarettes in their mouths, to see who could keep them alight the longest. After recording sessions in London, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the &quot;stockbroker belt&quot; of southern England, but Evans, Aspinall, and McCartney would drive to a late-night club to eat steak, chips, and mushy peas. The Bag O&#x27;Nails nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. In his memoirs Evans wrote: 19 January and 20: &quot;Ended up smashed in Bag O&#x27;Nails with Paul [McCartney] and Neil [Aspinall]. Quite a number of people attached themselves, oh that it would happen to me... freak out time baby for Mal.&quot;

In July 1966, the Beatles toured the Philippines, and unintentionally snubbed the nation&#x27;s first lady, Imelda Marcos. After the supposed snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of the Beatles&#x27; police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to Manila airport on their own. At the airport, Evans was beaten and kicked, and the group members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. Once the group boarded the plane, Tony Barrow and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, &quot;Tell Lil I love her&quot;, thinking he was about to be jailed or killed. Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the group had earned while they were there before being allowed on the plane.

=== Kenya and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; ===
The Beatles&#x27; last concert was at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans continued to work for them in the studio, and to run errands. After returning to London following their last American tour, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o&#x27;clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together but, after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein&#x27;s office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.

They spent their final night in Nairobi at a YMCA, before they returned to London. The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words to see if they could come up with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters &quot;S&quot; and &quot;P&quot; stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; could be completed by Peter Blake, Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.

In the spring of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Jane Asher, who was acting there with the Old Vic theatre company. The three of them went on a trip to the Rockies, returning to LA in Frank Sinatra&#x27;s jet. Evans: &quot;We left Denver in Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Lear Jet, which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar.&quot; When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smile&quot; album. Evans wrote about singing &quot;On Top of Old Smokey&quot; with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson&#x27;s avant-garde attitude to music: &quot;Brian [Wilson] then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session.&quot;

=== Greece and the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; ===
The Beatles and Evans flew to Greece in late 1967, with encouragement from Greek-born &quot;Magic Alex&quot;, the director of Apple Electronics, to buy an island or a group of islands. The general idea was that the Beatles would live on the islands in their own separate homes, but would be connected to each other by tunnels leading to a central dome. Evans and his family were included in the plan, but it was abandoned as being unworkable after McCartney refused to participate. As McCartney had no housekeeper in 1967, Evans moved in with him at 7 Cavendish Avenue, St John&#x27;s Wood, which is near Abbey Road Studios. It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first Old English sheepdog, Martha, although Evans often complained about the dog fouling the beds. Evans later bought a house in Sunbury-on-Thames, which was situated between McCartney&#x27;s, Lennon&#x27;s, Harrison&#x27;s and Starr&#x27;s houses.

While working on the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film, Evans wrote about his work duties: &quot;I would get requests from the four of them to do six different things at one time, and it was always a case of relying on instinct and experience in awarding priorities. They used to be right sods for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... Then I would find time between numerous cups of tea and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room.&quot;

After the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney to shoot &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; promotional film, although McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying &quot;You know who I am&quot;, but he and Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they &quot;didn&#x27;t look the part&quot;, and had to eat dinner in Evans&#x27; room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: &quot;We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul&#x27;s [McCartney] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when the manager of the club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, &#x27;You either pay the bill, or I call the police.&#x27; It certainly looked like we were going to get thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill.&quot;

=== India and Apple ===
The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, to visit the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India a few days earlier to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his inoculation shots were causing him pain. Evans: &quot;When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him [Starr], to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, &#x27;He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.&#x27; So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say &#x27;It will be all right&#x27;.&quot; Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: &quot;The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me &quot;No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country&quot;, I cooled it.&quot; Evans&#x27; diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly,&quot; and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.

When Apple was formed in 1968, Evans was promoted from road manager to personal assistant, although his weekly £38 salary remained the same.
After Evans and Peter Asher (A&amp;R head of Apple Records) saw the rock band the Iveys perform at London&#x27;s Marquee Club, Evans constantly suggested that the Beatles sign the band to the Apple label. This eventually happened in July 1968, when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Evans and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: Evans&#x27; financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: &quot;April 24: &quot;Had to tell George [Harrison]—&#x27;I&#x27;m broke&#x27;. Really miserable and down because I&#x27;m in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [his wife] suffers as I don&#x27;t want to get a rise. Not really true don&#x27;t want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is.&quot;

Evans was the only member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45 am, but McCartney&#x27;s brother, Michael&#x27;s train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the register office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30 am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple&#x27;s offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.

=== Allen Klein ===

Evans enjoyed an executive position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein was hired as a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were &quot;living like kings; like fucking emperors&quot;. Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voormann, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: &quot;I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John&#x27;s performance to be filmed. This was on top of it being video-taped by Dan Richter.&quot;

=== Musical contributions ===
Evans contributed to many recordings, including singing in the chorus of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. He played single organ notes on &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; Regarding Evans&#x27; organ contribution on &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot;, McCartney explained that he showed Evans where the notes were on the organ, and then nodded his head when he wanted Evans to play, and shook it when he wanted him to stop.

On &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, Evans controlled an alarm clock; counting the measures in the original 24-bar pause, and was one of the five piano players simultaneously hitting the last chord of the song. He played tambourine on &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, and trumpet on &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, where he played a double solo with Lennon, even though neither was proficient on the instrument. Evans contributed background vocals, and stirred a bucket of gravel (as part of the rhythm), on &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)&quot;. He also contributed to the White Album out-take &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot;, and hit an anvil on &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;, because Starr could not lift the hammer high enough to get the right sound and keep in time with the song.

According to Evans&#x27; diaries, he helped to compose songs for the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album. He wrote, on 27 January 1967: &quot;Sgt Pepper. Started writing song with Paul [McCartney] upstairs in his room, he on piano&quot; and &quot;Did a lot more of &quot;where the rain comes in&quot; [a lyric from &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot;]. Hope people like it. Started Sergeant Pepper&quot;. On 1 February: &quot;Sergeant Pepper sounds good. Paul tells me that I will get royalties on the song—great news, now perhaps a new home.&quot; On 2 February: &quot;Recording voices on Captain Pepper. All six of us doing the chorus in the middle, worked until about midnight.&quot;

Keith Badman—author of &quot;The Beatles off the Record&quot;—referred to a tape recording of Evans speaking shortly before his death, on which Evans reiterated some of the statements made in the diary. According to Badman, Evans was asked at the time if it would be a problem that he was not credited as a writer, because the Lennon–McCartney writing name was &quot;a really hot item&quot;. For reasons unclear, Evans did not receive any royalties and stayed at his £38-a-week pay (£ in modern currency).

=== On film ===
Evans appeared in four (out of five) Beatles&#x27; films. During the filming of the Beatles&#x27; first feature film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Evans appeared in a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In &quot;Help!&quot;, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and on a beach in the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told to paint the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.

In the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film, Evans can be seen playing the anvil during early versions of &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;, and can be seen talking to police officers on the Savile Row rooftop when they came to stop the performance. Before the concert, Evans placed a camera and a microphone in a corner of Apple&#x27;s reception area, so that when the police came in to complain about the noise—which was expected—they could be filmed and recorded. McCartney then saved Evans from police arrest. The Beatles were often filmed by Evans during his time with them (without sound), and a collection of his own film recordings was later released on DVD.

==After the Beatles==
In 1968, Evans had seen the group Badfinger (then known as The Iveys) play live, and suggested that they be signed to Apple. Evans then produced several of their songs in 1969 and 1970, the most notable of which was &quot;No Matter What&quot;, which charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 in December 1970. Evans also discovered the group Splinter and brought them to the Apple label, although they would subsequently move to George Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse Records. Evans&#x27; other production credits include Jackie Lomax&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;New Day&quot; (on Apple) and some of the tracks on Keith Moon&#x27;s only solo album &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot; (1975).

Evans separated from his wife in 1973 and moved to Los Angeles where Lennon had moved to live with May Pang after his own separation from Yoko Ono. Evans performed chimes, handclaps, and backing vocals on John Lennon&#x27;s first post-Beatles single, &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;. Evans is credited on Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and the &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; album as providing &quot;tea and sympathy&quot;. Evans cowrote &quot;You and Me (Babe)&quot; with Harrison. The track appeared on Starr&#x27;s 1973 solo album &quot;Ringo&quot;. He also cowrote the Splinter song &quot;Lonely Man&quot;, the musical centrepiece of &quot;Little Malcolm&quot;, an Apple feature film produced by Harrison. A rare interview appearance by Evans was included in the 1975 ABC television special &quot;David Frost Salutes the Beatles&quot;.

Evans was asked to produce the group Natural Gas, and was working on a book of memoirs called &quot;Living the Beatles&#x27; Legend&quot; which he was due to deliver to his publishers, Grosset &amp; Dunlap, on 12 January 1976. Evans was depressed about the separation from his wife (who had asked for a divorce before Christmas) even though he was then living with his new girlfriend, Fran Hughes, in a rented motel apartment at 8122 West 4th Street in Los Angeles.

== Death ==
On 4 January 1976, Evans was so despondent that Hughes phoned John Hoernie, Evans&#x27; co-writer for his biography, and asked him to visit them. Hoernie saw Evans &quot;really doped-up and groggy&quot; but Evans told Hoernie to make sure he finished &quot;Living the Beatles&#x27; Legend&quot;. Hoernie helped Evans up to an upstairs bedroom, but during an incoherent conversation, Evans picked up an air rifle. Hoernie struggled with Evans, but Evans, being much stronger, held onto the weapon.

Hughes then phoned the police and told them that Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on Valium. Four police officers arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Charles Higbie, went up to the bedroom. They later reported that as soon as Evans saw the three police officers he pointed the rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the weapon but Evans refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him. Evans previously had been awarded the badge of &quot;Honorary Sheriff of Los Angeles County&quot;, but in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; he was referred to as a &quot;jobless former road manager for the Beatles&quot;. Evans&#x27; biographer Kenneth Womack argued that the death was a suicide by cop, as Evans had written a will the night before.

Evans was cremated on 7 January 1976, in Los Angeles. None of the former Beatles attended his funeral, but Harry Nilsson, George Martin, Neil Aspinall and other friends did. George Harrison arranged for Evans&#x27; family to receive £5,000, as Evans had not maintained his life insurance premiums, and was not entitled to a pension.

== Legacy ==
In 1986, a trunk containing Evans&#x27; diaries and other effects was found in the basement of a New York publisher, and then sent to his family in London. In 1992, Lennon&#x27;s original pages of lyrics to &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; were sold by the Evans estate for £56,600 at Sotheby&#x27;s in London.
In 2010, a double-sided sheet of paper containing the hand-written lyrics and notes to &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; were sold at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York to an anonymous American buyer for $1.2m (£810,000). Other lyrics collected by Evans have been subject to legal action over the years: In 1996, McCartney went to the High Court in England and prevented the sale of the original lyrics to &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; that Evans&#x27; ex-wife had tried to sell, by claiming that the lyrics were collected by Evans as a part of his duties, and therefore belonged to the Beatles, collectively. A 2004 report of the discovery of a further collection of Evans&#x27; Beatles&#x27; memorabilia proved to be false.

A notebook in which McCartney wrote the lyrics for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was sold in 1998, for £111,500. The notebook also contains lyrics for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. It also contained lyrics, notes, drawings and poems by Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr, as well as by Evans.

In July 2012, a solo play about Mal by actor Nik Wood-Jones premiered at the Cavern in Liverpool before a run at the Edinburgh fringe.

In December 2021, it was reported that a biography of Evans, written by Beatles scholar Kenneth Womack, was to be published by HarperCollins&#x27;s Dey Street Books in 2023, to be followed the next year by material from Evans&#x27;s diary and archives. Womack&#x27;s biography, entitled &quot;Living the Beatles Legend: The Untold Story of Mal Evans&quot;, was published on 14 November 2023.

Evans appears in the 2021 documentary series &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;. The machine learning software and models developed by WingNut Films that were used to clean and isolate instruments and vocal tracks from single-track recordings for the documentary, and subsequently used for the of &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot;, was named MAL (machine-assisted learning) after Evans, and as an homage to HAL 9000.

<doc id="129213" wikidata="Q380912" url="?curid=129213" title="Neil Aspinall">
<text>Neil Stanley Aspinall (13 October 1941 24 March 2008) was a British music industry executive. A school friend of Paul McCartney and George Harrison, he went on to head the Beatles&#x27; company Apple Corps.

The Beatles employed Aspinall first as their road manager, which included driving his old Commer van to and from shows, both day and night. After Mal Evans started work for the Beatles, Aspinall was promoted to become their personal assistant, later becoming chief executive of their company, Apple Corps. He was one of several Beatles associates to earn the nickname &quot;the fifth Beatle&quot;.

On behalf of Apple, Aspinall was involved in court cases against Allen Klein, EMI and Apple Computer. He supervised the marketing of music, videos and merchandising, as well as being a director of Standby Films, which was run from his home in Twickenham, London. On 10 April 2007, Aspinall retired from Apple Corps and died of lung cancer in New York in 2008.

==Early life==
Aspinall was born in Prestatyn, North Wales, after his mother had been evacuated from the family home in Liverpool because of the air-raids on Liverpool during the Second World War, while Aspinall&#x27;s father was away at sea with the Royal Navy. Aspinall and his mother returned to Liverpool later in 1942 after the bombing had subsided. Aspinall later attended West Derby School, where he passed his 11-Plus exams. When he was twelve years old, Aspinall gained a place at the Liverpool Institute in Mount Street, and was in the same class as Paul McCartney for English and Art lessons.

Aspinall later commented about his first meeting with George Harrison, who also attended the Liverpool Institute: &quot;My first encounter with George was behind the school&#x27;s air-raid shelters. This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It was one of the first cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our &#x27;Mad Lad&#x27; gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime.&quot; Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, failing French. Aspinall left school in July 1959 to study accountancy. Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.

==The Beatles==

The Beatles played at the opening of the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959, which was in the cellar of Mona Best&#x27;s house. Aspinall later rented a room in the house and became very good friends with then-Beatle Pete Best. The Beatles had previously used public transport to travel to local bookings, however by February 1961, they were playing two or three shows per night at different locations needing their own transportation. Best asked Aspinall to be a part-time road manager for the band, so Aspinall bought an &quot;old, grey and maroon Commer van&quot; for £80, and charged each of the group five shillings (60d [old pence], or 25p [new post-1971 pence]) per concert. Harrison later said: &quot;Our early van became the centre of attention every time it pulled up. It was brush-painted red and grey and from head to foot was covered in graffiti – girls&#x27; names, and things like &#x27;I love you, John&#x27;. It looked interesting, but the moment anybody saw it they would feel free to write all over it.&quot; The Beatles returned from their second trip to Hamburg in July 1961, and Aspinall left his job to become their permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant.

The Beatles were driven down to London by Aspinall on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1962, for their Decca audition, but Aspinall lost his way, and the trip took ten hours. They arrived at 10 o&#x27;clock at night, and John Lennon said that they arrived &quot;just in time to see the drunks jumping in the Trafalgar Square fountains.&quot; In 1963, Aspinall was joined by Mal Evans, who also helped set up the Beatles&#x27; equipment (and acted as a bodyguard) which freed Aspinall to concentrate on other duties, like arranging appointments or buying things for them, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks.

Best was sacked from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting on behalf of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein&#x27;s NEMS record shop, and was the first one to talk to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best strongly advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, &quot;It&#x27;s got nothing to do with you. You&#x27;re only the driver.&quot; However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. Aspinall stayed with the band, ending his affair with Best&#x27;s mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent &quot;Roag&quot; Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag&#x27;s father.

Aspinall worked closely with Epstein, who provided weekly notes for Aspinall to give to the group members detailing their concert appearances and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall&#x27;s van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall&#x27;s van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.

===Personal assistant===

Aspinall&#x27;s job as personal assistant consisted of driving to concerts and meetings, but mostly meant just being there whenever someone needed something. Aspinall went on the first trip to the United States, and when George Harrison became ill with a fever and had a temperature of , he was ordered to stay in bed, so Aspinall stood in for him for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; camera rehearsals; however, Harrison was back in time for the final shooting. Before the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sgt. Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song near the end of the album.

After recording sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the &#x27;stockbroker belt&#x27; of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O&#x27;Nails nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was to make sure that the portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. Although Harrison, McCartney and Starr had passed their driving tests, Lennon didn&#x27;t pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.

===Musical contributions===

Although not a musician, Aspinall made minor contributions to a handful of the Beatles&#x27; recordings. He played a tamboura on &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, some percussion on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, and was among the many participants singing on the chorus of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

===Manager===

Following the death of Epstein in August 1967, there was a vacuum in the management of the Beatles&#x27; affairs. The Beatles asked Aspinall to take over the management of Apple Corps in 1968, which had been founded in April of the same year. Aspinall later said that he only accepted the position after being asked, but did not want to do it full-time, and would only do it &quot;until they found somebody else.&quot; George Martin (The Beatles&#x27; record producer) was against the idea, as he thought that Aspinall did not have the necessary social qualifications to be able to speak to the upper class executives at EMI. Aspinall accompanied McCartney and Lennon to New York on 11 May 1968, to announce the formation of Apple to the American Media. Apple Corps had five divisions: electronics, film, publishing, records and retailing. Aspinall later spoke of the Beatles&#x27; business arrangements:
Derek Taylor (Apple&#x27;s press officer) said that Aspinall hated being stuck in the Apple office (at 3 Savile Row) all through the recording of &quot;The White Album&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. Life in the Apple office, however, was improved by having a chef and assistants at hand: &quot;The liquor bill was £600 per month and the food bill was close to that.&quot; This was mostly due to Aspinall&#x27;s and Peter Brown&#x27;s four-course lunches with expensive wines in the dining room at Apple. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles&#x27; manager Aspinall was dismissed, but reinstated after complaints from the group, and because Klein realised that Aspinall was no threat to his control of the company. Klein lost a High Court action in 1971 (started by McCartney) but lawsuits between Klein and Apple kept Aspinall busy until 1977.

===Apple Corps executive===

In 1978, Aspinall instigated the first of three lawsuits on behalf of Apple Corps against Apple Computer, Inc. (now known as Apple, Inc.) for trademark infringement. The first suit settled in 1981 with an amount of £41,000 being paid to Apple by Apple Computer. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer was allowed to use its logo as long as it did not enter the music business. The second suit with Apple Computer arose in 1989, when Apple Corps sued Apple Computer over its Apple IIGS (which included a professional synthesiser chip) claiming violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991, a settlement of £13.5 million was reached. McCartney praised Aspinall for trademarking the Apple name worldwide, and called Aspinall &quot;Mr. X&quot; in the Apple Corps organisation.

In September 2003, Apple Computer, Inc. was again sued by Apple Corps, this time for the introduction of the iTunes Music Store and the iPod, which Aspinall and Apple Corps believed was a violation of the previous agreement for Apple Computer to not distribute music. The trial began on 27 March 2006 in the UK, and ended on 8 May 2006 in a victory for Apple Computer; the judge ruled the company&#x27;s iTunes Music Store did not infringe on the trademark of Apple Corps. Aspinall was also involved in several court cases in which Apple Corps took action against EMI:
In the early 1990s, Aspinall became the executive producer for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;; he, producer George Martin, and press officer Derek Taylor are the only non-Beatles seen in new footage for the documentary. He continued to advise the surviving Beatles, as well as Lennon&#x27;s and Harrison&#x27;s estates, and to supervise the marketing of music, music videos and merchandising. On 10 April 2007, it was announced by Apple that Aspinall had &quot;decided to move on&quot; and Jeff Jones—a longtime VP at Sony Legacy—was hired as CEO to oversee the back-catalogue. One of Aspinall&#x27;s final tasks at Apple was to oversee the remastering of The Beatles&#x27; back-catalogue for an anticipated 2008 release.

==Personal life and death==

In 1961 and 1962, Aspinall had become good friends with Pete Best and subsequently rented a room in the house where Best lived with his parents. During one of the extended business trips of Best&#x27;s stepfather, the 19-year-old Aspinall became romantically involved with Best&#x27;s mother, Mona Best, who was 17 years his senior. As a result, during this period, Aspinall fathered a child by Mona: Vincent &quot;Roag&quot; Best. Roag Best was born in late July 1962, and just three weeks later, on 16 August 1962, Best was dismissed from the Beatles.

On 30 August 1968, Aspinall married Suzy Ornstein at the Chelsea Register Office, London, with Magic Alex as best man. McCartney, Starr and his wife attended, and were also at a surprise party held later in the King&#x27;s Road, London. Suzy Aspinall is the daughter of Bud Ornstein, the late chief executive of United Artists Pictures (UK). Aspinall had met her during 1964/1965 when her father was the United Artists representative overseeing the production of the first two Beatles&#x27; films: &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. They went on to have four children: daughters Gayla, Dhara, Mandy and son Julian. As well as his work for Apple Corps, Aspinall and his wife were the sole directors of their own Standby Films Ltd. company, which is run from their home in Twickenham, London. In 1999, Standby Films released a film about Jimi Hendrix, called &quot;Hendrix: Band of Gypsys&quot;.

Aspinall died of lung cancer in New York City in 2008. His funeral was at the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Twickenham. Stella McCartney, Yoko Ono, Barbara Bach (wife of Starr), George Martin, Pete Best and Pete Townshend attended the funeral, with Townshend playing Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; as a tribute. The private service was followed by Aspinall&#x27;s burial at Teddington Cemetery. Aspinall left nearly £7 million in his will in a trust, with the income going to Suzy, his wife of 40 years.

<text>The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was an American labor union which represented over 100,000 film and television principal and background performers worldwide. On March 30, 2012, the union leadership announced that the SAG membership voted to merge with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) to create SAG-AFTRA.

==Background==
According to SAG&#x27;s Mission Statement, the Guild sought to: negotiate and enforce collective bargaining agreements that establish equitable levels of compensation, benefits, and working conditions for its performers; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members, and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members.

The Guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to eliminate the exploitation of Hollywood actors, who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios. Opposition to these contracts included that they did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods, and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios&#x27; discretion. These contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them, and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal.

The Screen Actors Guild was associated with the Associated Actors and Artistes of America (AAAA), which is the primary association of performer&#x27;s unions in the United States. AAAA is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. SAG claimed exclusive jurisdiction over motion picture performances, and shared jurisdiction of radio, television, Internet, and other new media with its sister union AFTRA, with which it shared 44,000 dual members. Internationally, the SAG was affiliated with the International Federation of Actors.

In addition to its main offices in Los Angeles, SAG also maintained branches in several major US cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, New York, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

Beginning in 1995, SAG began to award the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which are considered an indicator of success at the Academy Awards. It continues through SAG-AFTRA.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
In 1925, the Masquers Club was formed by actors discontented with the grueling work hours at the Hollywood studios. This was one of the major concerns which led to the creation of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933. Another was that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which at that time arbitrated between the producers and actors on contract disputes, had a membership policy which was by invitation only.

A meeting in March 1933 of six actors (Berton Churchill, Charles Miller, Grant Mitchell, Ralph Morgan, Alden Gay, and Kenneth Thomson) led to the guild&#x27;s foundation. Three months later, three of the six and eighteen others became the guild&#x27;s first officers and board of directors: Ralph Morgan (its first president), Alden Gay, Kenneth Thomson, Alan Mowbray (who personally funded the organization when it was first founded), Leon Ames, Tyler Brooke, Clay Clement, James Gleason, Lucile Webster Gleason, Boris Karloff, Claude King, Noel Madison, Reginald Mason, Bradley Page, Willard Robertson, Ivan Simpson, C. Aubrey Smith, Charles Starrett, Richard Tucker, Arthur Vinton, Morgan Wallace, and Lyle Talbot.

Many high-profile actors refused to join SAG initially. This changed when the producers made an agreement amongst themselves not to bid competitively for talent. A pivotal meeting, at the home of Frank Morgan (Ralph&#x27;s brother, who played the title role in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;), was what gave SAG its critical mass. Prompted by Eddie Cantor&#x27;s insistence, at that meeting, that any response to that producer&#x27;s agreement help all actors, not just the already established ones, it took only three weeks for SAG membership to go from around 80 members to more than 4,000. Cantor&#x27;s participation was critical, particularly because of his friendship with the recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After several years and the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the producers agreed to negotiate with SAG in 1937.

Actors known for their early support of SAG (besides the founders) include Bette Davis, Edward Arnold, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Dudley Digges, Porter Hall, Paul Harvey, Jean Hersholt, Russell Hicks, Murray Kinnell, Gene Lockhart, Bela Lugosi, David Manners, Fredric March, Adolphe Menjou, Chester Morris, Jean Muir, George Murphy, Erin O&#x27;Brien-Moore, Irving Pichel, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Edwin Stanley, Gloria Stuart, Lyle Talbot, Franchot Tone, Warren William, and Robert Young.

=== Blacklist years ===
In October 1947, the members of a list of suspected communists working in the Hollywood film industry were summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), which was investigating Communist influence in the Hollywood labor unions. Ten of those summoned, dubbed the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;, refused to cooperate, and were charged with contempt of Congress and sentenced to prison. Several liberal members of SAG, led by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Danny Kaye, and Gene Kelly, formed the Committee for the First Amendment (CFA) and flew to Washington, DC, in late October 1947 to show support for the Hollywood Ten.

The president of SAG – future United States President Ronald Reagan – also known to the FBI as Confidential Informant &quot;T-10&quot;, testified before the committee but never publicly named names. Instead, according to an FBI memorandum in 1947: &quot;T-10 advised Special Agent [name deleted] that he has been made a member of a committee headed by Mayer, the purpose of which is allegedly is to &#x27;purge&#x27; the motion-picture industry of Communist party members, which committee was an outgrowth of the Thomas committee hearings in Washington and subsequent meetings ... He felt that lacking a definite stand on the part of the government, it would be very difficult for any committee of motion-picture people to conduct any type of cleansing of their household&quot;. Subsequently, a climate of fear, enhanced by the threat of detention under the provisions of the McCarran Internal Security Act, permeated the film industry. On November 17, 1947, the Screen Actors Guild voted to force its officers to take a &quot;non-communist&quot; pledge. On November 25 (the day after the full House approved the ten citations for contempt) in what has become known as the Waldorf Statement, Eric Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), issued a press release: &quot;We will not knowingly employ a Communist or a member of any party or group which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.&quot;

None of those blacklisted were proven to advocate overthrowing the government – most simply had Marxist or socialist views. The Waldorf Statement marked the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist that saw hundreds of people prevented from working in the film industry. During the height of what is now referred to as McCarthyism, the Screen Writers Guild gave the studios the right to omit from the screen the name of any individual who had failed to clear his name before Congress. At a 1997 ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Blacklist, the Guild&#x27;s president made this statement:

=== 1970s to 2012 ===
The Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minorities Committee was co-founded in 1972 by actors Henry Darrow, Edith Diaz, Ricardo Montalbán and Carmen Zapata.

The Screen Actors Guild Women&#x27;s Committee was founded in 1972.

In 1980, SAG and AFTRA held a strike over issues regarding profit sharing from home media and pay TV.

==== &quot;Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild&quot; ====

In 1998, Naomi Marquez filed suit against SAG and Lakeside Productions claiming they had breached their duty of fair representation. The claim was denied by the Supreme Court.

==== Merger with AFTRA ====

The membership of the Screen Actors Guild voted to merge with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists on March 30, 2012.

== Composition ==
According to SAG&#x27;s Department of Labor records since 2006, when membership classifications were first reported, 30%, or almost a third, of the guild&#x27;s total membership had consistently been considered &quot;withdrawn&quot;, &quot;suspended&quot;, or otherwise not categorized as &quot;active&quot; members. These members were ineligible to vote in the guild. &quot;Honorable withdrawals&quot; constituted the largest portion of these, at 20% of the total membership, or 36,284 members before the merger in 2012. &quot;Suspended&quot; members were the second largest, at 10%, or 18,402 members. This classification scheme is continued by SAG-AFTRA.

== Rules and procedure ==

=== Becoming a member ===
An actor was eligible to join the Screen Actors Guild by meeting the criteria in any of the following three categories: principal actor in a SAG production, background actor (originally the &quot;three voucher rule&quot;), and one-year member of an affiliated union (with a principal role). The basic categories were:
* &quot;Principal actor:&quot; Any actor who works as a principal actor for a minimum of one day on a project (film, commercial, TV show, etc.) under a producer&#x27;s agreement with SAG, and the actor has been paid at the appropriate SAG daily, three-day, or weekly rate was then considered &quot;SAG-eligible&quot;. A SAG-eligible actor could work in other SAG or non-SAG productions up to 30 days, during which that actor was classified as a &quot;Taft–Hartley&quot;. After the 30-day Taft–Hartley period has expired, the actor could not work on any further SAG productions until first joining SAG, by: paying the initiation fee with the first half-year minimum membership dues, and agreeing to abide by the Guild&#x27;s rules and bylaws.
* &quot;Background actor:&quot; For years, SAG had the &quot;three voucher rule&quot;. After collecting three valid union vouchers for three separate days of work, a background actor could become SAG-eligible; however, employment must have been confirmed with payroll data, not vouchers. SAG productions required a minimum number of SAG members be employed as background actors before a producer was permitted to hire a non-union background actor. For television productions in the West Coast Zones, the minimum number of SAG background actors was 21 (25 in the New York Zone), for commercials the minimum was 40, and for feature films, the minimum was 57 in the West Coast zones (85 in the New York zone). In rare circumstances, due to the uniqueness of a role, or constraints on the numbers of available SAG actors or last-minute cancellations, those minimums were unable to be met. When this happened, producers were permitted to fill one or more of those union spots with non-union actors. The non-union actor chosen to fill the union spot was then issued a union background voucher for the day, and that non-union actor was entitled to all the same benefits and pay that the union actor would have received under that voucher. This was called a Taft–Hartley voucher. The SAG-Eligible background actor could continue working in non-union productions, but after obtaining 3 Taft–Hartley vouchers were given a 30-day window where they were allowed to work as many SAG jobs as they wish. After the 30-day window had expired the actor became a &quot;Must Join&quot; with SAG, meaning they could no longer work any SAG projects without formally joining the union. They could continue to work non-union jobs, however, until they officially became a SAG member.
* &quot;Member of an affiliated union:&quot; Members in good standing, for at least one year, of any of the other unions affiliated with the AAAA, and who had worked as a principal at least once in an area of the affiliated union&#x27;s jurisdiction, and who had been paid for their work in that principal role, were eligible to join SAG.

=== Initiation fee and membership dues ===
Members joining the Los Angeles, New York, or Miami SAG locals were assessed an initial fee to join the Guild of $3,000. At the time of initiation, the first minimum semi-annual membership dues payment of $58 must have also been paid, bringing the total amount due upon initiation into the Guild to $3,058. All other SAG locals still assessed initiation fees at the previous rate. Members from other locales who worked in Los Angeles, New York, or Miami after joining were charged the difference between the fee they paid their local and the higher rate in those markets.

Membership dues were calculated and due semi-annually, and were based upon the member&#x27;s earnings from SAG productions. The minimum annual dues amount was $116, with an additional 1.85% of the performer&#x27;s income up to $200,000. Income from $200,000 to $500,000 was assessed at 0.5%, and income from $500,000 to $1 million was assessed at 0.25%. For the calculation of dues, there was a total earnings cap at $1 million. Therefore, the maximum dues payable in any one calendar year by any single member was limited to $6,566.

SAG members who became delinquent in their dues without formally requesting a leave of absence from the Guild were assessed late penalties, and risked being ejected from the Guild and could be forced to pay the initiation fee again to regain their membership.

=== Global Rule One ===
The SAG Constitution and Bylaws stated &quot;No member shall work as a performer or make an agreement to work as a performer for any producer who has not executed a basic minimum agreement with the Guild which is in full force and effect&quot;, and this became known as &quot;Rule One&quot; of the organization. Every SAG performer, as a condition of membership, agreed to abide by this and all other SAG rules; thus SAG members could not perform in any non-union project that was within SAG&#x27;s jurisdiction. Beginning in 2002 the Guild pursued a policy of worldwide enforcement of Rule One, and renamed it &quot;Global Rule One&quot;.

=== Unique stage names ===
Like other organizations that represent actors, SAG rules stipulated that no two members could have identical working names; many actors were thus prevented from registering under their own names and had to make changes. Some maintained their usual name but added a middle initial; others adopted a stage name quite different from their legal name to comply with this rule. Notable examples include Michael Keaton, Michael J. Fox and Emma Stone, whose birth names &quot;Michael Douglas&quot;, &quot;Michael Fox&quot; and &quot;Emily Stone&quot;, respectively, had already been registered by other actors.

== Member benefits and privileges ==
SAG contracts with producers contained a variety of protections for Guild performers. Among these provisions were: minimum rates of pay, adequate working conditions, special protection and education requirements for minors, arbitration of disputes and grievances, and affirmative action in auditions and hiring.

=== Standardized pay and work conditions ===
All members of the Guild agreed to work only for producers who had signed contracts with SAG. These contracts spelled out in detail the responsibilities that producers must assume when hiring SAG performers. Specifically, the SAG basic contract specified: the number of hours performers may work, the frequency of meal breaks required, the minimum wages or &quot;scale&quot; at which performers must be compensated for their work, overtime pay, travel accommodations, wardrobe allowances, stunt pay, private dressing rooms, and adequate rest periods between performances. When applicable, and with due regard to the safety of the individuals, cast and crew, women and minorities were to be considered for doubling roles and for descript and non-descript stunts on a functional, non-discriminatory basis.

=== The Producers and the Pension and Health Plans ===
Performers who meet the eligibility criteria of working a certain number of days or attaining a certain threshold in income derived from SAG productions could join the Producers Pension and Health Plans offered by the Guild. The eligibility requirements varied by age of the performer and the desired plan chosen (there were two health plans). There were also Dental, Vision, and Life &amp; Disability coverage included as part of the two plans.

=== Residuals ===
The Guild secured residuals payments in perpetuity to its members for broadcast and re-broadcast of films, TV shows, and TV commercials through clauses in the basic SAG agreements with producers.

== Major strikes and boycotts ==

=== Early strikes ===
In July 1948, a strike was averted at the last minute as the SAG and major producers agreed upon a new collective bargaining contract. The major points agreed upon included: full union shop for actors to continue, negotiations for films sent direct to TV, producers could not sue an actor for breach of contract if they strike (but the guild could only strike when the contract expires).

In March 1960, SAG went on strike against the seven major studios. This was the first industry-wide strike in the 50-year history of movie making. Earlier walkouts involved production for television. The Writers Guild of America had been on strike since January 31, 1960 with similar demands to the actors. The independents were not affected since they signed new contracts. The dispute rested on actors wanting to be paid 6% or 7% of the gross earnings of pictures made since 1948 and sold to television. Actors also wanted a pension and welfare fund.

In December 1978, members of SAG went on strike for the fourth time in its 45-year history. It joined the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in picket lines in Los Angeles and New York. The unions said that management&#x27;s demand would cut actors&#x27; salaries. The argument was over filming commercials. Management agreed to up salaries from $218 to $250 per scene, but if the scene were not used at all, the actor would not be paid.

=== Strike and Emmy Awards boycott of 1980 ===

In July, SAG members walked out on strike, along with AFTRA, the union for television and radio artists, and the American Federation of Musicians. The union joined the television artists in calling for a successful boycott against that year&#x27;s prime-time Emmy awards. Powers Boothe was the only one of the 52 nominated actors to attend: &quot;This is either the most courageous moment of my career or the dumbest&quot; he quipped during his acceptance speech. The guild ratified a new pact, for a 32.25% increase in minimum salaries and a 4.5% share of movies made for pay TV, and the strike ended on October 25.

=== The commercials strike of 2000 ===
The commercials strike of 2000 was extremely controversial. Some factions within SAG call it a success, asserting that it not only saved Pay-Per-Play (residuals) but it also increased cable residuals by 140% up from $1,014 to $2,460. Others suggested almost identical terms were available in negotiation without a strike. In the wake of the strike, SAG, and its sister union AFTRA, gathered evidence on over 1,500 non-members who had worked during the strike. SAG trial boards found Elizabeth Hurley and Tiger Woods guilty of performing in non-union commercials and each was fined $100,000.
== Beyond the major studios ==
SAG Principal members could not work on non-union productions. Union background actors were not fully covered nationwide and could work non-union outside the background zones. These background zones included the state of Hawaii, 4 zones in California, Las Vegas NV, and a 300-mile radius around New York City. Many film schools had SAG Student Film Agreements with the Guild to allow SAG actors to work in their projects. SAGIndie was formed in 1997 to promote using SAG actors; SAG also had Low Budget Contracts that were meant to encourage the use of SAG members on films produced outside of the major studios and to prevent film productions from leaving the country, known as &quot;Runaway production&quot;. In the fight against &quot;Runaway production&quot;, the SAG National Board voted unanimously to support the Film and Television Action Committee (FTAC) and its 301(a) Petition which asked the US Trade Representative to investigate Canadian film subsidies for their violation of trade agreements Canada signed with the United States.

== Financial core ==
Financial core, or &quot;Fi-Core&quot;, was a payment to the union to allow someone to work in a union environment without being a member of the union. The concept was defined in 1963 by Supreme Court case &quot;Labor Board v. General Motors&quot; and clarified for the communications industry in 1988 via &quot;Communications Workers of America v. Beck&quot;.

Approximately 96% of normal union dues were paid to make an actor a Financial Core member of the SAG, and Financial Core members were not permitted to &quot;represent themselves as Screen Actors Guild members&quot;. Additionally, the Screen Actors Guild said &quot;Fi-Core/FPNM are viewed as scabs ... by SAG members, directors, and writers—most of whom also belong to entertainment unions&quot;. This statement was met with skepticism by some.

Former SAG President Charlton Heston was apparently a supporter of Fi-Core.

== National Women&#x27;s Committee ==
Entertainment remains among the most gender unequal industries in the United States. The National Women&#x27;s Committee operated within the National Statement of Purpose to promote equal employment opportunities for its female SAG members. It also encouraged positive images of women in film and television, in order to end sexual stereotypes and educate the industry about the representation of women, both in numbers and quality of representation.

SAG Women&#x27;s Committee had been dedicated to working towards strategic objectives adopted from the Fourth World Conference on Women Beijing Platform of 1995. These objectives included supporting research into all aspects of women and the media so as to define areas needing attention and action. The SAG Hollywood Division Women&#x27;s Committee also encouraged the media to refrain from presenting women as inferior beings and exploiting them as sexual objects and commodities.

=== Woman&#x27;s Committee timeline ===
* 1972: The Screen Actors Guild Women&#x27;s Committee is founded. Brigham Young University conducts a study that reveals 81.7% of television roles are male, versus 18.3% female.
* 1974–1976: In conjunction with the Directors Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild compiles statistical surveys that explicitly document the disenfranchisement of their women members, often linking the data to a specific studio, network and in several cases individual television shows. These efforts are spearheaded by the two organizations&#x27; individual Women&#x27;s Committees.
* 1975: Kathleen Nolan becomes the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s first female president.
* 1979: A study reveals that between 1949 and 1979, 7,332 feature films were made and released by major distributors. Fourteen, a mere 0.19%, were directed by women.
* October 10, 1979: Women and Minorities Rally. President Kathleen Nolan leads protest rally, with signs reading &quot;Women and Minorities: Not Seen on the American Scene&quot;...&quot;Window Dressing on the Set&quot;...and &quot;TV: it&#x27;s Time for a Facelift&quot;.
* 1981–1985: Leslie Hoffman, first stuntwoman elected to the Hollywood Screen Actors Board. She works towards hiring more women, minorities, seniors, and disabled performers as stuntpeople. She is blacklisted by the Screen Actors Guild Board and Stuntmen Groups.
* 1984: SAG creates additional low-budget motion picture agreement, giving advantages to productions that hire more women, minorities, seniors, and disabled performers. SAG&#x27;s New York branch forms Women&#x27;s Voice-Over Committee to study why women get only 10–20% of voiceover work.
* 1986: Women&#x27;s voice-over study by McCollum/Spielman and Company indicates &quot;it makes absolutely no difference whether a male or female voice is used as a TV commercial voice-over&quot;, destroying long-held advertising industry assertion that male voices &quot;sell better&quot; and carry &quot;more authority&quot;.
* 1989: A SAG report reveals that 71% of all roles in feature films and 64% of all roles in TV went to men. The report said the combined income of men more than doubled that of women ($644 million to $296 million).
* 1990: At the SAG National Women&#x27;s Conference, Meryl Streep keynotes first national event, emphasizing the decline in women&#x27;s work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She lashes out at the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.
* 1996: Composition of female leading roles rises to 40%, but supporting roles for women decline to 33%.
* 1997: SAG contracts for actresses exceed $472 million, while male SAG contracts receive more than $928 million.
* 2004: Only 37% of all SAG television and film roles go to women.
* 2008: Kathryn Bigelow becomes the first woman to win the Oscar for Best Director of a Motion Picture, after being only the fourth woman in history to secure a nomination. Statistics show that only 9% of directors are female.
* 2009: Dr. Martha Lauzen of the Alliance for Women Film Journalists, conducts a study revealing that, of 2009&#x27;s top 250 films at box offices, women comprised only 16% of the directors, producers, writers, and other top jobs. This represents a 3% decline from the 2001 study showing 19% female composition. Female directors fall from a low 9% in 2008, to a meager 7%. Warner Brothers Pictures and Paramount Pictures did not release a single film directed by a woman.
* 2010: A study carried out by the Annenberg School for Communication and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media finds that male characters outnumber female characters by 2.42 to one in top-grossing American films.
* 2010: Ex-Board Member Leslie Hoffman successfully fights to get Disability Health Plans for two stuntmen and a reimbursement for a disabled stuntwoman.

<text>In linear algebra, an invertible complex square matrix is unitary if its matrix inverse equals its conjugate transpose , that is, if

formula_1

where is the identity matrix.

In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (), so the equation above is written

formula_2

A complex matrix is special unitary if it is unitary and its matrix determinant equals .

For real numbers, the analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.

==Properties==
For any unitary matrix of finite size, the following hold:
* Given two complex vectors and , multiplication by preserves their inner product; that is, .
* is normal (formula_3).
* is diagonalizable; that is, is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, as a consequence of the spectral theorem. Thus, has a decomposition of the form formula_4 where is unitary, and is diagonal and unitary.
* The eigenvalues of formula_5 lie on the unit circle, as does formula_6.
* The eigenspaces of formula_5 are orthogonal.
* can be written as , where indicates the matrix exponential, is the imaginary unit, and is a Hermitian matrix.

For any nonnegative integer , the set of all unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group, called the unitary group .

Every square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices.

==Equivalent conditions==
If &quot;U&quot; is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:
# formula_5 is unitary.
# formula_9 is unitary.
# formula_5 is invertible with formula_11.
# The columns of formula_5 form an orthonormal basis of formula_13 with respect to the usual inner product. In other words, formula_14. 
# The rows of formula_5 form an orthonormal basis of formula_13 with respect to the usual inner product. In other words, formula_17. 
# formula_5 is an isometry with respect to the usual norm. That is, formula_19 for all formula_20, where formula_21.
# formula_5 is a normal matrix (equivalently, there is an orthonormal basis formed by eigenvectors of formula_5) with eigenvalues lying on the unit circle.

==Elementary constructions==

=== 2 × 2 unitary matrix ===
One general expression of a unitary matrix is

formula_24

which depends on 4 real parameters (the phase of , the phase of , the relative magnitude between and , and the angle ). The form is configured so the determinant of such a matrix is
formula_25

The sub-group of those elements formula_26 with formula_27 is called the special unitary group SU(2).

Among several alternative forms, the matrix can be written in this form:
formula_28

where formula_29 and formula_30 above, and the angles formula_31 can take any values.

By introducing formula_32 and formula_33 has the following factorization:

formula_34

This expression highlights the relation between unitary matrices and orthogonal matrices of angle .

Another factorization is

formula_35

Many other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.

<text>William Kent (c. 1685 – 12 April 1748) was an English architect, landscape architect, painter and furniture designer of the early 18th century. He began his career as a painter, and became Principal Painter in Ordinary or court painter, but his real talent was for design in various media.

Kent introduced the Palladian style of architecture into England with the villa at Chiswick House, and also originated the &#x27;natural&#x27; style of gardening known as the English landscape garden at Chiswick, Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, and Rousham House in Oxfordshire. As a landscape gardener he revolutionised the layout of estates, but had limited knowledge of horticulture.

He complemented his houses and gardens with stately furniture for major buildings including Hampton Court Palace, Chiswick House, Devonshire House and Rousham.

==Early life==
Kent was born in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, and baptised on 1 January 1686, as William Cant. His parents were William and Esther Cant (née Shimmings).

Kent&#x27;s career began as a sign and coach painter, and he was encouraged to study art, design and architecture by his employer. A group of Yorkshire gentlemen sent Kent for a period of study in Rome, and he set sail on 22 July 1709 from Deal, Kent, arriving at Livorno on 15 October. By 18 November he was in Florence, staying there until April 1710 before finally setting off for Rome. In 1713 he was awarded the second medal in the second class for painting in the annual competition run by the Accademia di San Luca for his painting of &quot;A Miracle of S. Andrea Avellino&quot;. 

He also met several important figures including Thomas Coke, later 1st Earl of Leicester, with whom he toured Northern Italy in the summer of 1714 (a tour that led Kent to an appreciation of the architectural style of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s palaces in Vicenza), and Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, for whom he apparently painted some pictures, though no records survive. During his stay in Rome, he painted the ceiling of the church of San Giuliano dei Fiamminghi (Church of St. Julian of the Flemings) with the &quot;Apotheosis of St. Julian&quot;. The most significant meeting was between Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. 

Kent left Rome for the last time in the autumn of 1719, met Lord Burlington briefly at Genoa, Kent journeying on to Paris, where Lord Burlington later joined him for the final journey back to England before the end of the year. As a painter, he displaced Sir James Thornhill in decorating the new staterooms at Kensington Palace, London; for Burlington, he helped to decorate Chiswick House, especially the painted ceilings, and Burlington House.

==Architectural works==
Kent started practising as an architect relatively late in life, in the 1730s. He is remembered as an architect of the revived Palladian style in England. Burlington gave him the task of editing &quot;The Designs of Inigo Jones...&quot; with some additional designs in the Palladian/Jonesian taste by Burlington and Kent, which appeared in 1727. As he rose through the royal architectural establishment, the Board of Works, Kent applied this style to several public buildings in London, for which Burlington&#x27;s patronage secured him the commissions: the Royal Mews at Charing Cross (1731–33, demolished in 1830), the Treasury buildings in Whitehall (1733–37), and the Horse Guards building in Whitehall (designed shortly before his death and built 1750–1759). These neo-antique buildings were inspired as much by the architecture of Raphael and Giulio Romano as by Palladio.

In country house building, major commissions for Kent were designing the interiors of Houghton Hall, Norfolk (c.1725–35), recently built by Colen Campbell for Sir Robert Walpole, but at Holkham Hall (also in Norfolk) the most complete embodiment of Palladian ideals is still to be found; there Kent collaborated with Thomas Coke, the other &quot;architect earl&quot;, and had for an assistant Matthew Brettingham, whose own architecture would carry Palladian ideals into the next generation. Walpole&#x27;s son Horace described Kent as below mediocrity as a painter, a restorer of science as an architect and the father of modern gardening and inventor of an art.

A theatrically Baroque staircase and parade rooms in London, at 44 Berkeley Square, are also notable. Kent&#x27;s domed pavilions were erected at Badminton House (Gloucestershire) and at Euston Hall (Suffolk).

Kent could provide sympathetic Gothic designs, free of serious antiquarian tendencies, when the context called; he worked on the Gothic screens in Westminster Hall and Gloucester Cathedral.

He worked on the house at 22 Arlington Street in St. James&#x27;s, a district of the City of Westminster in central London from 1743, when it was commissioned by the newly elevated Prime Minister, Henry Pelham. After Kent&#x27;s death, the work was completed by his assistant Stephen Wright.

==Landscape architect==

As a landscape designer, Kent was one of the originators of the English landscape garden, a style of &quot;natural&quot; gardening that revolutionised the laying out of gardens and estates. His projects included Chiswick House, Stowe, Buckinghamshire, from about 1730 onwards, designs for Alexander Pope&#x27;s villa garden at Twickenham, for Queen Caroline at Richmond, and notably at Rousham House, Oxfordshire, where he created a sequence of Arcadian set-pieces punctuated with temples, cascades, grottoes, Palladian bridges and exedra, opening the field for the larger scale achievements of Capability Brown in the following generation. Smaller Kent works can be found at Shotover Park, Oxfordshire, including a faux Gothic eyecatcher and a domed pavilion. His all-but-lost gardens at Claremont, Surrey, have recently been restored. It is said that he was not above planting dead trees to create the mood he required.

Kent&#x27;s only downfall was said to be his lack of horticultural knowledge and technical skill (compared to those such as Charles Bridgeman, whose impact on Kent is often underestimated). Nevertheless, his naturalistic style of design was his major contribution to the history of landscape design. Claremont, Stowe, and Rousham are places where their joint efforts can be viewed. Stowe and Rousham are Kent&#x27;s most famous works. At the latter, Kent elaborated on Bridgeman&#x27;s 1720s design for the property, adding walls and arches to catch the viewer&#x27;s eye. At Stowe, Kent used his Italian experience, particularly with the Palladian Bridge. At both sites Kent incorporated his naturalistic approach.

==Furniture designer==

His stately furniture designs complemented his interiors: he designed furnishings for Hampton Court Palace (1732), Lord Burlington&#x27;s Chiswick House (1729), London, Thomas Coke&#x27;s Holkham Hall, Norfolk, Robert Walpole&#x27;s pile at Houghton Hall, for Devonshire House in London, and at Rousham. The royal barge he designed for Frederick, Prince of Wales can be seen at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

In his own age, Kent&#x27;s fame and popularity were so great that he was employed to give designs for all things, even for ladies&#x27; birthday dresses, of which he could know nothing and which he decorated with the five classical orders of architecture. These and other absurdities drew upon him the satire of William Hogarth who, in October 1725, produced a &quot;Burlesque on Kent&#x27;s Altarpiece at St. Clement Danes&quot;.

==Walpole tribute==
According to Horace Walpole, Kent &quot;was a painter, an architect, and the father of modern gardening. In the first character he was below mediocrity; in the second, he was a restorer of the science; in the last, an original, and the inventor of an art that realizes painting and improves nature. Mahomet imagined an Elysium, Kent created many.&quot;

<text>Chiswick House is a Neo-Palladian style villa in the Chiswick district of London, England. A &quot;glorious&quot; example of Neo-Palladian architecture in west London, the house was designed and built by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (1694–1753), and completed in 1729. The house and garden occupy . The garden was created mainly by the architect and landscape designer William Kent, and it is one of the earliest examples of the English landscape garden.

After the death of the 3rd Earl of Burlington in 1753, and the subsequent deaths of his last surviving daughter (Charlotte Boyle) in 1754 and his widow in 1758, the property was ceded to William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, Charlotte&#x27;s husband. After William&#x27;s death in 1764, the villa passed to his and Charlotte&#x27;s orphaned young son, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. His wife, Georgiana Spencer, a prominent and controversial figure in fashion and politics whom he married in 1774, used the house as a retreat and as a Whig stronghold for many years; it was where Charles James Fox died in 1806. Prime Minister George Canning also died there in 1827, in a bedroom in the John White wing buildings.

During the 19th century, the house fell into decline and was rented out by the Cavendish family. It was used as a mental hospital, the Chiswick Asylum, from 1892. In 1929, the 9th Duke of Devonshire sold Chiswick House to Middlesex County Council, and it became a fire station. The villa suffered damage during World War II, and in 1944, a V-2 rocket damaged one of the two wings, which were both demolished in 1956. Today, the house is a Grade I listed building and is maintained by English Heritage.

==History==

===Early history (c. 1610–1682)===

The original Chiswick House was a Jacobean house owned by Sir Edward Wardour, and possibly built by his father. It is dated in a late 17th-century engraving of the Chiswick House estate by Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff, and was constructed with four sides around an open courtyard. Wardour sold the house in 1624 to Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. The house was quite large: in the 1664 Hearth Tax documents it is recorded as having 33 fireplaces. The house was at the south end of the Royalist line in the Battle of Turnham Green (1641), during the First English Civil War. The house was purchased by Charles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan in 1682.

===Boyle family (1682–1758)===
The Jacobean house was used by the Boyle family as a summer retreat from their central London home, Burlington House. After a fire in 1725, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (Lord Burlington), then head of the family, decided to build a new &quot;villa&quot; to the west of the old Chiswick House.

During his trip to Italy in 1719, Burlington had acquired a passion for Palladian architecture. He had not closely inspected Roman ruins or made detailed drawings on the sites in Italy; he relied on Palladio and Scamozzi as his interpreters of the classic tradition. Another source of his inspiration were drawings he collected, including those of Palladio himself, which had belonged to Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. According to Howard Colvin, &quot;Burlington&#x27;s mission was to reinstate in Augustan England the canons of Roman architecture as described by Vitruvius, exemplified by its surviving remains, and practised by Palladio, Scamozzi and Jones.&quot;

Burlington, himself a talented amateur architect and (in the words of Horace Walpole) &quot;Apollo of the Arts&quot;, designed the villa with the aid of William Kent, who also took a leading role in designing the gardens. Burlington built the villa with enough space to house his art collection, regarded as containing &quot;some of the best pictures in Europe&quot;, and his more select pieces of furniture, some of which was purchased on his first Grand Tour of Europe in 1714. Construction of the villa took place between 1726 and 1729.

After Burlington&#x27;s death in 1753, his wife, Lady Dorothy Savile, and daughter, Charlotte, who had married William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire in 1748, inherited the house. Charlotte died in December 1754, and Lady Burlington died in September 1758. Several views of Burlington&#x27;s house were made by the architect-draughtsman John Donowell around this time.

===Cavendish family (1758–1929)===
After the death of Lady Burlington in 1758, the villa and gardens passed to the Cavendish family. William Cavendish died in 1764, leaving the property to his son William, the 5th Duke of Devonshire. In 1774, William married Lady Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire, who enjoyed spending time at Chiswick which she referred to as her &quot;earthly paradise&quot;. She regularly invited members of the Whig party to the house for tea parties in the garden. In 1788 the Cavendish family demolished the Jacobean house and hired architect John White to add two wings to the villa to increase the amount of accommodation. The Duchess was responsible for the building of the Classical Bridge in 1774, designed by the architect James Wyatt, and the planting of roses on the walls of the new wings and the sides of the buildings. She died in 1806.

In 1813, a conservatory was built by Samuel Ware, with the purpose of housing exotic fruits and camellias. &gt; Gardener Lewis Kennedy built an Italian inspired geometric garden around the conservatory. In 1827, after a rapid decline in health, Tory Prime Minister George Canning died in the same room where Charles James Fox had died in 1806.

Between 1862 and 1892 the villa was rented by the Cavendish family to a number of successive tenants, including the Duchess of Sutherland in 1867, the Prince of Wales in the 1870s, and John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, patron of the architect William Burges, from 1881 to 1892.

===Chiswick Asylum (1892–1928)===

From 1892, the 9th Duke of Devonshire rented the villa to Doctors Thomas Seymour and Charles Molesworth Tuke (sons of Thomas Harrington Tuke), and it was used by them as a mental hospital, the Chiswick Asylum, for wealthy male and female patients until 1928. The asylum was praised for its relatively compassionate approach to its inmates. The wings of the house used for the asylum were demolished in the 1950s so little now remains of this use, except in archival records. In 1897, the two sphinxes on the main gate were removed to Green Park during the celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. They were never returned.

===Public ownership (1929–present)===
The 9th Duke of Devonshire sold Chiswick House to Middlesex County Council in 1929, the purchase price being met in part by contributions from public subscribers, including King George V. The villa became a fire station during World War II, and suffered damage; vibration from the bombing of Chiswick brought down the plasterwork in the Upper Tribunal, and on 8 September 1944 a V-2 rocket damaged one of the two wings. The wings were removed in 1956.

In 1948, extensive lobbying from the newly created Georgian Group prevented it from being destroyed. The house came under the aegis of the Ministry of Works and subsequently of English Heritage.

Hounslow Council and English Heritage formed the Chiswick House and Gardens Trust in 2005 to unify the management of the villa and gardens. The trust took over the administration for the villa and gardens in July 2010, following the completion of the restoration works. A Heritage Lottery Fund grant was complemented by approximately £4 million from other sources, for restoration of the gardens in 2007. The garden is open to the public from dawn until dusk without charge.

== Architecture ==

Chiswick House was an attempt by Lord Burlington to create a Roman villa, rather than a Renaissance pastiche, situated in a symbolic Roman garden. Chiswick Villa is inspired in part by several buildings of the 16th-century Italian architects Andrea Palladio and his assistant Vincenzo Scamozzi. The house is often said to be directly inspired by Palladio&#x27;s Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot; near Vicenza, as architect Colen Campbell had offered Lord Burlington a design for a villa closely based on the Villa Capra for his use at Chiswick. However, although this was clearly influential, Lord Burlington rejected this design; it was subsequently used at Mereworth Castle, Kent. Lord Burlington&#x27;s library list at Chiswick shows that he was not restricted to the influence of Andrea Palladio. He owned books by influential Italian Renaissance architects such as Sebastiano Serlio and Leon Battista Alberti, and his library contained books by French architects, sculptors, illustrators and architectural theorists like Jean Cotelle, Philibert de l&#x27;Orme, Abraham Bosse, Jean Bullant, Salomon de Caus, Roland Fréart de Chambray, Hugues Sambin, Antoine Desgodetz, and John James&#x27;s translation of Claude Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of the Five Orders&quot;. Whether Palladio&#x27;s work inspired Chiswick or not, the Renaissance architect exerted an important influence on Lord Burlington through his plans and reconstructions of lost Roman buildings; many of these, unpublished and little known, were purchased by Burlington on his second Grand Tour and housed in the Blue Velvet Room, which served as his study. These reconstructions were the source for many of the varied geometric shapes within Burlington&#x27;s Villa, including the use of the octagon, circle and rectangle (with apses). Burlington&#x27;s use of Roman sources can be seen in features including the steep-pitched dome of the villa, which is derived from the Pantheon in Rome. However, the source for the octagonal form of the dome, the Upper Tribunal, Lower Tribunal and cellar at Chiswick may be Scamozzi&#x27;s Rocca Pisana near Vicenza. Burlington may also have been influenced in his choice of octagon by the drawings of the Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), or by Roman buildings of antiquity (for example, Lord Burlington owned Andrea Palladio&#x27;s drawings of the octagonal mausoleum at Diocletian&#x27;s Palace, Split in modern Croatia).

The brick-built Villa&#x27;s façade is faced in Portland stone, with a small amount of stucco. The finely carved Corinthian capitals on the projecting six-column portico, carved by John Boson, are derived from the Temple of Castor and Pollux in Rome. The inset door, projecting plinth and &#x27;v&#x27;-necked rusticated vermiculation (resembling &quot;tufa&quot;) were all derived from the base of Trajan&#x27;s Column. The short sections of crenellated wall with ball finials which extend out either side of the villa were symbolic of medieval (or Roman) fortified town walls, and were inspired by their use by Palladio at his church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and by Inigo Jones (1573–1652) (Palladio produced woodcuts of the Villa Foscari with crenellated sections of walls in his &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; in 1570, yet they were never built). To reinforce this link, two full-length statues of Palladio and Jones are positioned in front of these sections of wall. Palladio&#x27;s influence is also felt in the general cubic form of the villa with its central hall with other rooms leading off its axis. The villa is a half cube of by by . The house when built was described by John, Lord Hervey as &quot;Too small to live in, and too big to hang to a watch&quot;. John Clerk of Penicuik described it as &quot;Rather curious than convenient&quot;, while Horace Walpole called it &quot;the beautiful model&quot;.
==Gardens==

The gardens at Chiswick were an attempt to recreate a garden of ancient Rome, such as the Emperor Hadrian&#x27;s Villa Adriana at Tivoli. From the 1720s, Burlington and Kent experimented with new designs, incorporating elements such as a Ha-ha, classical garden buildings, statues, groves, faux Egyptian objects, bowling greens, winding walks, cascades and water features. A theatre of hedges known as an &quot;exedra&quot; was designed by William Kent and originally displayed ancient statues of three unknown Roman gentlemen. The lawn at the rear of the house was created by 1745 and planted with young Cedar of Lebanon trees which alternate with stone funerary urns designed by William Kent. Placed between the urns and the Cedar of Lebanon are three more sphinxes orientated to face the rising sun.

A lake was created around 1727 by widening the Bollo Brook. The excess soil was heaped up behind William Kent&#x27;s cascade to produce an elevated walkway for people to admire the gardens and a view of the nearby River Thames. A gateway designed by Inigo Jones in 1621 at Beaufort House in Chelsea (home of Sir Hans Sloane) was bought and removed by Lord Burlington and rebuilt in the gardens at Chiswick in 1738. The Classic Bridge beyond the Orange Tree Garden was built for Georgiana Spencer in 1774 to the design of James Wyatt. 

The kitchen garden was created in 1682 as part of an adjoining property. Its ownership changed several times, and the garden fell into disrepair. In 2005 it was restored by local volunteers of the Chiswick House Kitchen Garden charity. In 2009 the charity was awarded a grant from the Big Lottery Fund Local Food Scheme, which it had transferred to the Chiswick House and Gardens Trust to fund a community gardener and to assist with the ongoing operation of the kitchen garden.

==Freemasonry==
Chiswick House has been linked with Freemasonry, and is believed by some scholars to have functioned as a private Masonic Lodge or Temple (unaffiliated to Grand Lodge), given that many of the ceiling paintings by William Kent in the Gallery and the Red, Blue and Summer Parlour Rooms contain iconography of a strong Masonic, Hermetic, and possible Jacobite character. The proportions of several of the upstairs rooms also have significance in relation to biblical buildings important in Freemasonry. Lord Burlington&#x27;s status as an important Freemason is indicated by his inclusion in the &quot;Freemason&#x27;s Pocket Companion&quot; of 1736 and in a poem in James Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Constitutions of the Free-Masons&quot; of 1723 where he is linked to an illustrious line of personalities important in Masonic lore. Pat Rogers has argued (following the original research of Jane Clark) that Chiswick House was a symbolic temple, based on so-called Royal Arch Freemasonry, involving a Hermetic intervention designed to heal the sufferings of the exiled Jews. Lord Burlington&#x27;s handwritten list of titles in his library at Chiswick also shows that he supported a large number of publications by Freemasons. 
After completion of the villa in 1729, Burlington later provided inspiration to other Masonic architects for numerous other buildings, such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall, Norfolk Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, at Goodwood House, and the Mansion House, nicknamed the &quot;Egyptian Hall&quot; for its columns.

== Notable guests ==

Although little is known of the people who stayed or visited the house in Lord Burlington&#x27;s lifetime, many important visitors to the property are recorded as visiting throughout its history. These included leading figures of the European &#x27;Enlightenment&#x27; including the philosophers Voltaire (1694–1778) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778); the future US Presidents John Adams (1735–1826) and Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826); Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790); the German landscape artist Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau; the Italian statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–1882); Russian Tsars Nicholas I (1796–1855) and Alexander I (1777–1825); the shah of Persia; Queen Victoria (1819–1901) and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg (1819–61); Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832); Prince Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau (1740–1817); Prime Ministers William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898) and Sir Robert Walpole (1676–1745); Queen Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1683–1737); John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713–92) and the architect William Burges (1827–1881).

On 20 May 1966, the Beatles visited Chiswick House to shoot promotional films for both sides of their latest 45 RPM single, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;. There are scenes shot in the conservatory, in the walled garden and by the exedra.

== Events ==

Since the restoration of the gardens, a variety of seasonal events have been held in the gardens of Chiswick House each year, including a &quot;Camellia&quot; show, open days in the walled kitchen garden, a circus, and a magic lantern festival.

<text>The Afsluitdijk (; ; &quot;closure dyke&quot;) is a major dam and causeway in the Netherlands. It was constructed between 1927 and 1932 and runs from Den Oever in North Holland province to the village of Zurich in Friesland province, over a length of and a width of , at an initial height above Amsterdam Ordnance Datum of between along the section at Friesland, and where it crosses the deep channel of the Vlieter. The height at the greater sea depths west of Friesland was required to be a minimum of 7 metres everywhere when originally constructed.

Increases to the height of the Afsluitdijk have been made several times since 1958, when height increases were undertaken during regular maintenance periods as a result of the North Sea Flood of 1953, with the section between the and sluice complexes seeing the crest level raised to 7.8 metres. Major upgrade works commenced in 2019, with one of the design conditions being that only limited wave overtopping during the design storm condition be permitted. The design proposed by the successful contractor to meet this criterion will see a further increase in the height of the dam, by approximately 2 metres.

The Afsluitdijk is a fundamental part of the larger Zuiderzee Works, damming off the Zuiderzee, a salt water inlet of the North Sea, and turning it into the fresh water lake of the IJsselmeer. It is a major land reclamation project and provides a road connection between the North and West of the Netherlands. 

The highway on the Afsluitdijk was the initial demonstration site for a speed limit in the Netherlands.

==History==


=== Reasons for construction ===
The Afsluitdijk (literally translated: shut-off-dyke) was completed in 1932, thereby shutting off the Zuiderzee (lit: Southern Sea) from the North Sea. Until then, the Zuiderzee had been a large bay south of the North Sea which gave maritime access to five provinces of The Netherlands, and particularly during the Dutch Golden Age provided a protected entrance and exit for the harbour of Amsterdam and several other important Dutch sea harbours. Furthermore, the Zuiderzee provided relatively shallow and calm fishing grounds for the many towns bordering the bay. However, the opening of the North Sea Canal (Noordzeekanaal) in 1876 gave a much shorter direct entrance to the Amsterdam harbour, and overfishing had depleted the shallow bay. In the second half of the 19th century, the Dutch population was exploding, and there was an increasing need for land for agriculture and animal husbandry. The Dutch already had centuries of experience of building dykes around lakes, emptying them and converting them to fertile polderland.

The next large project was to convert the Zuiderzee into polder. In 1886, a few notables established the Zuiderzee Society to investigate whether reclamation was feasible. One of the most prominent members of the society was Cornelis Lely, a civil engineer, prominent member and later chairman of the society. In 1891 he designed the first plan for the closure and reclamation of the Zuiderzee.

In 1913, Lely was Minister of Water Management, and land reclamation was included in the government program. His plan was initially opposed, particularly for its huge costs and also by the fishing industry. But after the flood of 1916 and the famine of 1918, opinions were ready for this mega project and the parliament agreed, but it took another 9 years, until 1927, before the works actually began.

=== Building the dyke ===
Wieringen was connected to the mainland with the short Amsteldiepdijk in 1925; the &quot;&quot; would be in length. The inland side is heavy stone; the seaward side is boulder clay with brushwood mattresses above, weighed down by basalt boulders and old concrete. Previous experience had showed that boulder clay was superior to just sand or clay for a structure like the Afsluitdijk, with the added benefit that till was in plentiful supply in the area; it could be retrieved in large quantities by simply dredging it from the bottom of the Zuiderzee. Work started at four points: on both sides of the mainland and on two specially made construction-islands (Kornwerderzand and Breezanddijk) along the line of the future dyke.

From these points, the dyke slowly grew by ships depositing till into the open sea until it breached the surface. The nascent dyke was then strengthened from land by basalt rocks and mats of willow switch at its base. The dyke could then be finished off by raising it further with sand and finally clay for the surface of the dyke, on which grass was planted.

As the dyke grew, physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz calculated the force of the tide as the smaller gap made it stronger. Ten thousand workers, 27 large dredges, 13 floating cranes, 132 barges, and 88 tugs worked on the project at the end, timed to close the dyke at low tide; it was finished on 28 May 1932. Construction progressed better than expected; at three points along the line of the dyke there were deeper underwater trenches where the tidal current was much stronger than elsewhere. These had been considered to be major obstacles to completing the dyke, but all of them proved to be relatively straightforward. Two years earlier than initially thought, the Zuiderzee ceased to be, as the last tidal trench, the &quot;Vlieter&quot;, was closed by a final bucket of till. The IJsselmeer was born, even though it was still salty at the time.

The dyke itself however was not finished as it still needed to be brought up to its required height and a road linking Friesland and North Holland (the current A7/E22 motorway) also remained to be built. On 25 September 1933, the Afsluitdijk was officially opened, with a monument designed by architect Willem Marinus Dudok marking the spot where the dyke had been closed. The amount of material used is estimated at of sand and of till and over the years an average of around four to five thousand workers were involved with the construction every day, relieving some of the unemployment following the Great Depression.

Besides the dyke itself, there was also the necessary construction of two complexes of shipping locks and discharge sluices at both ends of the dyke. The complex at Den Oever includes the &quot;Stevin&quot; lock (named after the son of mathematician and engineer Simon Stevin, Hendrik Stevin, who was the first making a plan to close the Zuiderzee in 1667) and three series of five sluices for discharging the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea; the other complex at Kornwerderzand is composed of the &quot;Lorentz&quot; locks (named after the physicist) and two series of five sluices, making a total of 25 discharge sluices. It is necessary to routinely discharge water from the lake since it is continually fed by rivers and streams (most notably the IJssel river that gives its name to the lake) and polders draining their water into the IJsselmeer.

=== Developments after construction and height increases ===
The height of the crest of the Afsluitdijk was originally determined based on insufficient data about wave run-up. This became apparent soon after the first significant storm surge following the completion of the works, which occurred in December 1936. During the storm, the water in the Wadden Sea reached to around half a metre below the dike. For the crown height, storm surge heights indicated by the &quot;(English: Lorentz State Commission)&quot; were primarily used, based on storm surges that had occurred in the period 1825–1926. 

According to committee&#x27;s predictions, if the Zuiderzee had been closed during the 1825–1926 period, the highest water level reached would have been 3.1 metres above Amsterdam Ordnance Datum at Den Oever, and about 3.4 metres on the Friesland coast. However, the commission drew attention to the fact that in a very rare and unfavourable set of circumstances, even higher storm surge heights were possible.
All values in centimetres. Z and A are in centimetres above NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil/Amsterdam Ordnance Datum).

The lower value was based on the assumption that wave run-up in the shallow area near the Frisian coast would be reduced. However, it became evident as early as 1934 that this assumption was incorrect due to the narrowness of the shallow zone. To address this issue, a section of the dike body was removed. Despite these adjustments, a 1937 storm revealed that they were insufficient, leading to an increase in the crest height to 7.4 metres.

Later research on storm surge flood levels in the Netherlands by Pieter Jacobus Wemelsfelder and Johan van Veen, along with the devastating effects of the storm surge of 1953, would bring the reality of such extremely rare cases to light.

In determining the height for the construction of the inner berm, different considerations were employed compared to those for the main dam crest height. The primary requirement for the crest was to ensure the dike would not be breached during the most severe anticipated storm. To achieve this, the crest was designed to be elevated enough so that, at most, only a single wave could reach it. The IJsselmeer side of the dam was designed with a lower factor of safety than the Wadden Sea side, as it was anticipated that even under unfavourable conditions, such as a southwest storm over the IJsselmeer with a high average water level, the waves would not exceed about 3.5 metres above Amsterdam Ordnance Datum. Consequently, the berm was constructed to a height of approximately 4 metres.

The inner berm slope toward the future water level of the IJsselmeer (or Amstelmeer) was designed to be steeper than the outer slope, with a ratio of approximately 1:3. The majority of the dam&#x27;s core consisted of sand, while boulder clay on the exterior provided resistance against water flow, limiting seepage and enhancing dike breach protection. A layer of armourstone, composed of basalt rock, was utilized on the outer slope.

During construction, the slopes were partially fortified with basalt columns and Belgian block stone , a block-shaped, hard variety of limestone. Block stone served as a more affordable and widely available alternative to basalt, and the Dutch Government resisted purchasing large quantities of basalt to avoid potential price increases, instead planning to gradually replace the block stone with basalt.

=== World War II ===
On 12 and 13 May 1940 it was the site of the Battle of the Afsluitdijk, where Fort Kornwerderzand became the only Dutch line of defense that successfully withstood a &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; attack during the conflict, and was one of the few &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; defeats suffered by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

=== Post-war modernization ===
Following the 1953 storm, a subsequent storm in 1954 caused significant damage to the Afsluitdijk. Although the 1953 water level was not as extreme at the Afsluitdijk as in the southern Netherlands, the intense wave action resulted in severe damage to a large portion of the block stone, which was later replaced by basalt. In response to recommendations from the , the commission responsible for the Delta Works, it was deemed necessary to elevate the dike level. However, this was considered less urgent compared to the issues in Zeeland after the 1953 storm. A decision was made to prioritize the Delta Works while also incrementally increasing the Afsluitdijk height to 7.4 metres.

On 23 September 1954, on the centenary of Cornelis Lely, a statue, made by Mari Andriessen, was unveiled by Queen Juliana on the North Holland side of the Afsluitdijk. On May 9, 2007, the statue was relocated near to the Vlieter Monument. The official unveiling, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the dyke, was performed on 24 May 2007 by Prince Willem-Alexander. 
In 2012, the State Secretary for Infrastructure and the Environment, Joop Atsma, issued a statement detailing the factors influencing the decision to replace the locks at Kornwerderzand. A naviduct would have a high construction cost compared with standard locks and bridges, but would benefit the economy by reducing delays. After the cost–benefit analysis of all potential solutions was considered, a decision was made to strengthen the existing locks. However, it is quite possible that a naviduct will be built to replace the locks when they reach the end of their useful life in 2050. The work started in April 2020 and was planned to take three years; during the work, the highway remained in operation, however the bicycle path was closed.
Rijkswaterstaat (the ministry which oversees the dyke) further increased the height of the dyke beginning in 2018. As part of the renovation program, a series of artistic projects were incorporated into the dyke, known as the &quot;Icoon Afsluitdijk.&quot; Daan Roosegaarde led the artistic aspects. The three designs of light and interaction developed by Roosegaarde and his team are entitled Gates of Light, Windvogel and Glowing Nature. The improvement of the main dike body was completed in 2022. Additional works (the fish migration river, new locks and the pumping station) were at that moment not yet ready.

Provision for a railway line linking North Holland and Friesland (between Anna Paulowna and Harlingen) had been included on the Afsluitdijk, in the form of a linear reservation, along with extra drawbridge abutments at the locks. However, construction of the line was never undertaken by the Dutch track operator (ProRail), for reasons of cost and relative lack of benefits. The reservation and abutments for the rail line were utilized instead for a second carriageway for the dyke&#x27;s two-lane highway in the 1970s, transforming the latter into today&#x27;s four-lane A7 motorway.

<text>Piper Aircraft, Inc. is a manufacturer of general aviation aircraft, located at the Vero Beach Regional Airport in Vero Beach, Florida, United States and owned since 2009 by the Government of Brunei. Throughout much of the mid-to-late 20th century, it was considered to be one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; in the field of general aviation manufacturing, along with Beechcraft and Cessna.

Between its founding in 1927 and the end of 2009, the company produced 144,000 aircraft in 160 certified models, of which 90,000 are still flying.

==History==



The company was founded as the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Manufacturing Company in September 1927 by brothers Clarence G. Taylor and Gordon A. Taylor in Rochester, New York. The company was renamed Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation in April 1928, shortly before Gordon Taylor died in an aircraft accident flying one of the brothers&#x27; own designs, a Taylor Chummy, on April 24, 1928. The company was enticed to move to Bradford, Pennsylvania, with the promise of a larger facility and investment capital from local businessmen, including an initial investment of $400 from local oil industry engineer William T. Piper. The move was completed in September 1929.

===1930s===
In late 1930, the company filed for bankruptcy and William T. Piper purchased the assets of the company for $761. Reorganized as the Taylor Aircraft Company, Piper effectively took control of the firm when he assumed the position of corporate secretary-treasurer, although he retained C. G. Taylor in the role of president. Piper, often called the &quot;Henry Ford of Aviation&quot;, firmly believed a simple-to-operate, low-cost, private airplane would flourish, even in the darkest depths of the Great Depression. This aircraft was the E-2 Cub.

In December 1935, after a series of clashes, William Piper bought out C. G. Taylor, who left the company and went on to form the Taylorcraft Aircraft Company. On March 16, 1937, a fire destroyed the Bradford Piper factory and the company relocated to an abandoned silk mill in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. In 1937, it was renamed Piper Aircraft Corporation.

===1940s===
Piper continued operations in Lock Haven throughout World War II, building military versions of its J-3 Cub as the L-4 Grasshopper. A total of 5,941 powered aircraft were built by the company for the US armed forces during the war, as well as training gliders, and aircraft components for other manufacturers, but its main contribution to the war effort was in the fabrication of steel masts for mounting radar antennas. In 1946, the company opened a new factory in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and transferred production of the Cub from Lock Haven. That year, Piper led the American industry in light aircraft production. Almost 7,800 of the 35,000 civil aircraft built in the United States that year were Pipers, but a strike led to a shortage of steel tubing, interrupting production, and 1,900 workers had to be suspended as a result.

The following year, the postwar general aviation boom ended. This led to a downfall for the company. Piper&#x27;s output reached 3,500 aircraft, less than half its 1946 total, and the company suffered an operating loss of more than $560,000. The board of directors replaced William Piper with William Shriver, a former Chrysler executive. Under Shriver, the product line was expanded with the introduction of the PA-14 Family Cruiser and PA-15 Vagabond. Piper introduced the Taxicub light charter concept at 1500 dealers and 52 distributors. In 1948, with two thirds of its workforce laid off, Piper only lost $75,000, but it found itself no longer the leader in a shrinking market, falling behind Cessna, which itself only delivered 1,600 aircraft; the Ponca City factory was closed. At the end of 1948, Piper bought the Stinson Aircraft Company for $3 million and Shriver left the company.

===1950s===
The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 helped to stimulate production at Piper, which again won large orders for military versions of the Cub. William Piper regained control of the company the same year, and the decision was made to develop a twin-engine aircraft. The company initially investigated producing the Baumann Brigadier, but later decided to develop a Stinson design, which became the PA-23 Apache. In its business planning following the war, it became clear the Lock Haven facility would not support larger manufacturing efforts, and in 1955 it acquired rights to property at the Vero Beach Municipal Airport. Vero Beach was initially used as a center for design work under Fred Weick, with the first aircraft developed there being Piper&#x27;s first agricultural aircraft, the PA-25 Pawnee, announced in 1958 and entering production the following year at Lock Haven.

===1960s===
In 1960, the line of Piper aircraft consisted of agricultural and two-passenger variants of the Super Cub, the Caribbean, Colt and Tri-Pacer, two versions of the PA-24 Comanche, the Pawnee, the Apache and its new larger derivative the Aztec. The following year, the PA-28 Cherokee was the first type to enter production at the new Vero Beach factory. The Cherokee replaced the Tri-Pacer and Colt, which ended their production runs in 1961 and 1964 respectively. By the later part of the decade, Vero Beach was building 7,000 Cherokees per year.

In 1963, Piper supported Betty Miller&#x27;s successful attempt to be the first female pilot to fly solo across the Pacific Ocean, during which she delivered a twin-engine Piper aircraft from Oakland, California, USA to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

In September 1964, Piper flew the prototype of its new PA-31 Navajo cabin-class twin for the first time, after two-and-a-half years of development.

In 1969, the Piper family agreed to sell Piper Aircraft to the Bangor Punta Corporation, which started an eight-year court battle with the losing bidder, Chris-Craft Industries, culminating in a Supreme Court decision in 1977.

===1970s===
Piper discussed a merger with Swearingen but the deal was not completed. The Lock Haven facility was nearly destroyed in 1972 when torrential rains from Hurricane Agnes caused the Susquehanna River to flood in June. The manufacturing plant was flooded to a depth of , effectively destroying about 100 aircraft and causing an estimated $23 million in damage. Much of the tooling necessary for production of several designs, including the Aztec, Navajo, and Comanche, was also destroyed, and the Piper PA-31T Cheyenne program received a setback when the prototype was damaged just after the Federal Aviation Administration awarded it Type Certification. Initial deliveries of the new PA-31-350 Chieftain were also delayed by several months. After the flood, Piper gave 32 written-off PA-28s, PA-31s and PA-23 Aztecs to NASA, which used them for crash tests at the Langley Research Center, using a rig originally built to simulate spacecraft landings on the moon for the Apollo program.

As a result of the flood, and market factors, the company decided to end production of the Comanche and Twin Comanche. Piper opened a manufacturing division in Lakeland, Florida, in 1972 and through the 1970s, the Piper PA-31 Navajo, Chieftain, and Cheyenne III were manufactured at the more than facility on the Lakeland municipal airport.

===1980s and 1990s===
Piper opened its T1000 airline division at the Lakeland, Florida, location in May 1981, with 20 people. Employment at both of Piper&#x27;s Lakeland divisions peaked at 2,200 later that year. The Piper PA-42 Cheyenne IV and the Piper T-1020/Piper T-1040 aircraft were manufactured in Lakeland during that time. Piper also maintained a fully staffed research and development center in Lakeland, including the &quot;X&quot; shop, which developed the Piper PA-48 Enforcer. The airline division provided aircraft for commuter airlines in the United States including Air New Orleans, Desert Sun in Long Beach, Shasta Air and Sun West Airlines, as well as internationally for Vickers for corporate transport use in the United Kingdom, Cameroon&#x27;s Avia Services and to Piper&#x27;s distributor in Colombia, Aero Leaver. In 1984, Piper changed hands when parent company Bangor Punta was acquired by Lear Siegler which, in turn, was acquired by Forstmann Little in 1986. Forstmann Little then sold Piper to M. Stuart Millar in 1987.

Manufacture of light aircraft was impacted in the mid-1980s when increasing product liability insurance premiums made operation financially difficult for Piper and other American manufacturers of light aircraft. In a bid to improve sales, Piper cut prices for its aircraft and the company became unprofitable. In 1991 the Lakeland, Florida factory was sold and closed and by July that year the workforce had shrunk to 45; with only $1,000 in available cash remaining, Piper filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a proposed takeover by competing French manufacturer Socata failed over the issue of product liability. Production of the flagship Cheyenne 400 ended in February 1993 with only 43 being built since its inception a decade earlier. In 1995, the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was renamed New Piper Aircraft. As part of the end of bankruptcy protection, the company was sold to Newco Pac Inc., itself owned by Piper&#x27;s creditors (including major creditor, aircraft engine manufacturer Teledyne Continental Motors) and a Philadelphia-based investment firm.

===2000s===
In July 2003, American Capital Strategies, Ltd. bought 94% of Piper&#x27;s voting equity.

In July 2006, a partnership with Honda was announced to market the new HA-420 HondaJet. The following month, the firm dropped the &quot;New&quot; from its name, reverting to Piper Aircraft.

In response to the late 2000s recession, the company announced in November 2008 that it was reducing its work-week to save money while avoiding lay-offs. Piper is party to an agreement with the state of Florida that will see the company benefit from $32 million in incentives in exchange for increasing its work force to 1400 people and building the PiperJet in the state.

In December 2008, the company announced it would defer the $10 million incentive that required hiring 400 new workers by 2012 for the PiperJet project and retain 1,417 employees through 2015. The company stated the move was precautionary. Piper spokesman Mark Miller said: &quot;While this year has been a good one for Piper, we have taken measures to keep the company healthy and to weather any future adversity.&quot;

In February 2009, the company announced it was laying off an additional 300 workers without notice immediately and the 650 remaining workers would be given unpaid weeks off in April and July to reduce unsold inventory. Piper spokesman Mark Miller stated company regretted the pain caused by the layoffs and indicated the employees would be rehired when the economy improves. He also said: &quot;Even the willing buyers that we have find it incredibly difficult to get financing...We can&#x27;t keep a full workforce on at this point when people aren&#x27;t buying planes...If market conditions continue to deteriorate, it may be necessary for the company to take additional actions&quot;. On 24 February 2009, the company announced it would add two more weeks of unpaid furlough for its employees in May and June, bringing the total to four weeks in 2009, citing a need to reduce inventory and cut expenses. In June 2010, the company announced it would shut down for a further week in August to save money. The lay-off affected all workers except those on the PiperJet program and some critical company business functions.

On 1 May 2009, American Capital Strategies sold the company to Singapore-based investment strategy company Imprimis, making a profit of US$31 million on the sale. Imprimis is funded by the Government of Brunei and has offices in Bangkok, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.

In June 2009, James Bass, CEO of Piper Aircraft since 2005, announced he would step down effective that same month. He was succeeded by VP of operations Kevin Gould. During his four years at Piper, Bass oversaw development of the PiperJet, the Meridian G1000 and the Matrix, and negotiated a new business partnership with Honda. He also negotiated $32 million in incentives from the state and county that retained Piper&#x27;s factory in Vero Beach, Florida.

On 2 November 2009, company president John Becker announced his resignation effective 1 December 2009 &quot;to pursue other career opportunities&quot;. Becker was replaced as president by CEO Kevin Gould.

===2010s===
On 4 January 2010, the company announced Boeing subsidiary Aviall would act as Piper&#x27;s sole global parts distributor.

In July 2010, CEO Kevin Gould resigned for unspecified reasons, having served just over a year in the post. Gould was replaced on an interim basis by Geoffrey Berger, managing director of Imprimus in Brunei, on behalf of the government of Brunei. Also in July 2010, longtime Piper media spokesman Mark Miller left the company.

In September 2010, Piper announced the lay-off of an additional 60 production workers. Piper&#x27;s interim CEO Geoffrey Berger stated: &quot;Piper remains challenged by overall market weakness&quot;. The company hired 140 workers for the PiperJet program in 2009–10.

Piper started renovation of a factory in Vero Beach in October 2010, with a completion goal of 2011. The facility was intended to be used to build the PiperJet.

On 17 October 2011, the company announced Simon Caldecott had replaced Geoff Berger as interim CEO. At the same time, executive vice president Randy Groom also resigned from the company and it was announced that the Piper Altaire program was &quot;under review&quot;. Only one week later, on 24 October 2011, Piper Aircraft announced it had &quot;indefinitely suspended&quot; all work on the Altaire project and would be laying off 150 of its 850 employees, plus 55 contract workers, due to the program&#x27;s cancellation.

In December 2011, Piper announced it was attempting to renegotiate the 2008 deal it had made with the state of Florida and Indian River County for incentives. The company did not meet its contractual requirements to employ 1,100 people by the end of 2009; instead, employment fell to 600, and as a result, the company owed US$1.5 million. Piper is looking for forgiveness of the debt. Also in December, Piper came under the direct ownership of the government of Brunei.

In July 2015 the company announced it was laying off 15-20% of its workers, about 150 people, as sales were faltering amongst world markets, especially Asia, Latin America and Europe.

In February 2018, Piper announced the largest order of trainer aircraft in the company&#x27;s history. Fanmei Aviation Technologies, which is Piper&#x27;s exclusive dealer in China, placed an order for 152 aircraft. The deliveries will take place over a period of seven years.

In April 2019 an even bigger order was announced: L3 Commercial Aviation will take delivery up to 240 new aircraft over the next 10 years. The order will consist of single-engine Piper Archers and twin-engine Piper Seminoles.

===2020s===
In March 2021, CEO Simon Caldecott announced that he would retire in April 2021. CFO John Calcagno assumed the role of president and CEO in April 2021.

In February 2024, Piper introduced a brand new aircraft, the M700 Fury. This aircraft had been secretly developed over the course of the past two years, and was a pleasant surprise to the aviation community.

In October 2024, the Piper M700 FURY, a high-performance single-engine aircraft by Piper Aircraft, received type certification from several aviation authorities: the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Brazil’s Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC), and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) of Australia. The certification encompasses flight approvals in known icing conditions and for operation on unpaved surfaces, enhancing the M700 FURY’s operational versatility. Deliveries for customers in Europe, Brazil, and Australia are set to begin by the end of October 2024, following this milestone certification.

==Aircraft==
Piper&#x27;s J-3 Cub, a single-engine, high-wing, two-seater, was the first inexpensive training aircraft produced in large numbers. Many former military examples were sold to civilian owners over the 1950-1995 period and seem certain to see many more years in recreational use.

The PA-28 Cherokee has been one of the company&#x27;s most successful products. Both this design and the twin-engined PA-34 Seneca are used for pilot training around the world. The PA-23 Apache was one of the first aircraft associated with the term &quot;air taxi&quot;, although it was superseded in that role by faster and more spacious designs from competitors Beechcraft and Cessna.

Beginning production in 1965, the PA-32 series provided six- or seven-seat, single-engine designs based on the smaller Cherokee. Variously named Cherokee Six, Lance, and Saratoga, these were available as both fixed- and retractable-gear models and also with normally aspirated, fuel-injected, and turbocharged engines. The PA-32s proved popular with private owners, air taxi, and freight companies. Production of the Saratoga-II HPs and Saratoga TCs ended in 2009.

On 21 January 2010 the company announced it had licensed the CZAW SportCruiser and intended to market it as the PiperSport. Piper CEO Kevin Gould said, &quot;The PiperSport is an amazing entry-level aircraft that will bring new customers into Piper and lead the way for those customers to step up into more sophisticated and higher performance aircraft within our line over time.&quot; In January 2011, the licensing agreement with Piper was abruptly ended with Piper CEO Geoffrey Berger saying &quot;the company has a different business perspective and approach to the market than Czech Sport Aircraft&quot;.

<text>Donald McNichol Sutherland (17 July 1935 – 20 June 2024) was a Canadian actor. With a career spanning six decades, he received numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards as well as a BAFTA Award nomination. Considered one of the best actors never nominated for an Academy Award, he was given an Academy Honorary Award in 2017. Sutherland was a prominent anti-war activist during the Vietnam War era.

Sutherland rose to fame after roles in the war films &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), and &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970).

He portrayed President Snow in &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; franchise (2012–2015).

On television, his performance in the HBO movie &quot;Citizen X&quot; (1995) won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. For his portrayal of Clark Clifford in the HBO film &quot;Path to War&quot; (2002) he earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. He also acted in &quot;Uprising&quot; (2001), &quot;Human Trafficking&quot; (2005), &quot;Trust&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Undoing&quot; (2020).

Sutherland was made an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in 1978, raised to Companion (CC) in 2019, inducted into the Canadian Walk of Fame in 2000 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. He is the father of Kiefer, Rossif, and Angus Sutherland, all actors.

== Early life and education ==

Donald McNichol Sutherland was born on 17 July 1935 at the Saint John General Hospital in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, the youngest son of Dorothy Isobel (; 1892–1956) and Frederick McLea Sutherland (1894–1983), who worked in sales and ran the local gas, electricity, and bus company. He was of Scottish, German, and English ancestry. His grandfather was a Scots church minister. As a child, he had rheumatic fever, hepatitis, and polio. During the first six years of his life, Sutherland and his family lived on present-day Kennebecasis River Road in Hampton, a town in Kings County, having moved there from Saint John while he was an infant. He first received education at a one-room schoolhouse in Hampton; Sutherland&#x27;s family moved back to Saint John when he was six, his father having secured a position in the New Brunswick Power Company as its vice president and general manager. Sutherland attended the Victoria School in Saint John, and later played hockey for the school. During this time, Sutherland also practiced puppetry.

In a letter Sutherland sent to a Saint John Free Public Library representative in 2017, he detailed how he and his family had lived in a farmhouse in Lakeside, located in present-day Hampton, before moving to Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, at the age of 12, where he spent his teenage years. He obtained his first part-time job, at the age of 14, as a news correspondent for local radio station CKBW. At the age of 19, Sutherland spent four months as an exchange student in Finland, where he lived near an iron mine located in Otanmäki, Kainuu.

Sutherland graduated from Bridgewater High School. He then began studying at the University of Toronto before transferring to its affiliate college, Victoria University, where he met his first wife Lois May Hardwick. He graduated in 1958, with a dual degree in engineering and drama. He had at one point been a member of the &quot;UC Follies&quot; comedy troupe in Toronto. He changed his mind about becoming an engineer, and left Canada for Britain in 1957, studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

== Career ==
=== 1960–1968: Early work and breakthrough ===
While at LAMDA, Sutherland began appearing in West End productions. He dropped out of his first year and moved to Scotland where he acted at the Perth Repertory Theatre for 18 months from 1960. His roommate was actor Michael Sheard. In the early-to-mid-1960s, Sutherland began to gain small roles in British films and TV, such as a hotel receptionist in &quot;The Sentimental Agent&quot; episode &quot;A Very Desirable Plot&quot; (1963). He was featured alongside Christopher Lee in horror films such as &quot;Castle of the Living Dead&quot; (1964) and the anthology film &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965). He also had a supporting role in the Hammer Films production &quot;Die! Die! My Darling!&quot; (1965), with Tallulah Bankhead and Stefanie Powers. In the same year, he appeared in the Cold War classic &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; and in the TV series &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, in the 1966 episode &quot;The Millionaire&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In 1966, Sutherland appeared in the BBC TV play &quot;Lee Oswald – Assassin&quot;, playing a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, Charles Givens (even though Givens himself was an African American). He also appeared in the TV series &quot;The Saint&quot;.

In 1967, he appeared in &quot;The Superlative Seven&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1966 he also made a second, and more substantial appearance in &quot;The Saint&quot; (S5,E14). The episode, &quot;Escape Route&quot;, which was directed by the show&#x27;s star, Roger Moore, who later recalled Sutherland &quot;asked me if he could show it to some producers as he was up for an important role... they came to view a rough cut and he got &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;&quot;. The film, which starred Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, and several other popular actors, was the fifth highest-grossing film of 1967 and MGM&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the year. In 1968, after the breakthrough in the UK-filmed &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, Sutherland left London for Hollywood.

=== 1970–1979: Stardom and praise ===

Sutherland then appeared in two war films, playing the lead role as Hawkeye Pierce in the Robert Altman–directed comedy &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1970; and, again in 1970, as hippie tank commander &quot;Oddball&quot; in &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; alongside Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas and Don Rickles. His health was threatened by spinal meningitis contracted during the filming of the latter film. Sutherland starred with Gene Wilder in the 1970 comedy &quot;Start the Revolution Without Me&quot;. During the filming of the Academy Award-winning detective thriller &quot;Klute&quot; (1971), Sutherland had an intimate relationship with co-star Jane Fonda. Sutherland and Fonda went on to co-produce and star together in the anti–Vietnam War documentary &quot;F.T.A.&quot; (1972), consisting of a series of sketches performed outside army bases in the Pacific Rim and interviews with U.S. troops who were then on active service. As a follow-up to their appearance in &quot;Klute&quot;, Sutherland and Fonda performed together in &quot;Steelyard Blues&quot; (1973), a &quot;freewheeling, Age-of-Aquarius, romp-and-roll caper&quot; from the writer David S. Ward.
Sutherland found himself as a leading man throughout the 1970s in films such as the Venice-based psychological horror film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1973), co-starring Julie Christie, a role which saw him nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. He took a leading role in the war film &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976) acting opposite Michael Caine and Robert Duvall That same year he starred in Federico Fellini&#x27;s film &quot;Federico Fellini&#x27;s Casanova&quot; (1976) playing Giacomo Casanova. A year later, he had parts as a clumsy waiter in the comedy &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and as a contract killer in the thriller &quot;The Disappearance&quot;.

Sutherland took the role of a health inspector in the science fiction/horror film &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1978) alongside Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Mr. Sutherland is by turns personable and opaque, affecting in a way that he hasn&#x27;t been since &quot;Klute&quot;&quot;. He helped launch the internationally popular Canadian television series &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot;, with a performance as the Montreal doctor Norman Bethune, a physician and humanitarian, largely talking of Bethune&#x27;s experiences in revolutionary China. Sutherland also had a role as pot-smoking Professor Dave Jennings in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; in 1978, making himself known to younger fans as a result of the film&#x27;s popularity. When cast, he was offered either $40,000 upfront or two per cent of the film&#x27;s gross earnings. Thinking the film would certainly not be a big success, he chose the upfront payment. The film eventually grossed $141.6 million. Also, in 1978 Sutherland starred in the heist comedy film &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;, alongside Sean Connery. Sutherland&#x27;s performance as Attila, an Italian fascist in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1976 epic film &quot;1900&quot;, received praise from critics such as A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for his portrayal of a sadistic, &quot;over-the-top villainy&quot; villain.

=== 1980–2009: Established actor ===

Sutherland received praise for his role as the conflicted and grieving father in the Robert Redford-directed family drama &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton. In September 1980, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Sutherland realizes his best film role in years, playing a fellow who, filled with love for both his wife and his son, is angrily accused by each of fence-sitting, of being weak and indecisive when he&#x27;s really the only one in the family with some idea of what is wrong.&quot; Sutherland was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 1981, he starred in the English spy thriller &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; and narrated Anne Wheeler&#x27;s Canadian docudrama &quot;A War Story&quot;.

In 1998 he took the role of Bill Bowerman in the sports drama &quot;Without Limits&quot; for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Sutherland&#x27;s performance is the film&#x27;s treasure... brings a deep patience to Bowerman, who understands that running is a matter of endurance and strategy, as well as heart&quot;. Sutherland played the famous American Civil War General P.G.T. Beauregard in the 1999 film &quot;The Hunley&quot;.

He played an astronaut in &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000), with co-stars Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Garner.

For his performance he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.

On 26 March 2012, he was a guest on the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; radio show where he mentioned he had been offered the lead roles in &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, although turned down both offers because he did not want to appear in violent films at the time. The role in &quot;Deliverance&quot; went to Jon Voight and the role in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; to Dustin Hoffman, and both films enjoyed critical and box office success. After declining these violent roles, he quipped: &quot;And then I played a fascist&quot; in &quot;1900&quot; by Bernardo Bertolucci.

That year he also took a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;Basmati Blues&quot; starring Brie Larson.

In 2018, Sutherland portrayed an oil tycoon J. Paul Getty in the FX a historical drama series &quot;Trust&quot;.

In 2020, he appeared in the HBO limited series &quot;The Undoing&quot; (2020) alongside Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman.

== Personal life ==
Sutherland was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on 22 December 1978, and was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2019. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in March 2000. He had maintained a residence in Georgeville, a village in Quebec, since 1977. Referred to as his &quot;emotional home,&quot; Sutherland occupied this house during the summer. He had additional houses in other places, including Paris, France.

=== Marriages and family ===
Sutherland married three times. His first marriage, to Lois May Hardwick, a head school teacher, lasted from 1959 to 1966. His second marriage, which lasted from 1966 to 1970, was to Shirley Douglas, daughter of Tommy Douglas, the social democratic former premier of Saskatchewan. Sutherland and Douglas had two children, twins Kiefer and Rachel. From 1970 to 1972, he had an affair with &quot;Klute&quot; co-star Jane Fonda, with whom he had participated in anti-Vietnam war activism.

Sutherland married his long-term partner Francine Racette in the 1990s. The couple had been together since meeting on the set of the Canadian pioneer drama &quot;Alien Thunder&quot; in the early 1970s. They had three sons – Rossif, Angus, and Roeg – all of whom were named after directors Sutherland had worked with. Kiefer (his son with Douglas) is named after American-born director and writer Warren Kiefer, who, under the assumed name of Lorenzo Sabatini, directed Sutherland in his first feature film, the Italian low-budget horror film &quot;Il castello dei morti vivi&quot; &quot;(Castle of the Living Dead)&quot;; Roeg is named after director Nicolas Roeg; Rossif is named after French director Frédéric Rossif; and Angus&#x27;s middle name is after Robert Redford.

=== Politics ===

Sutherland was an antiwar activist who started the Free Theatre Associates (aka Free The Army) tour with Jane Fonda, Peter Boyle, Howard Hesseman, Elliott Gould, Mike Nichols, Ben Vereen, Dick Gregory, Nina Simone, and other celebrities as an alternative to Bob Hope&#x27;s USO in Vietnam. Documents declassified in 2017 show that Sutherland was on the National Security Agency watchlist between 1971 and 1973 at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency because of his anti-war activities. Sutherland was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. He also opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Sutherland became a blogger for the American news website &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; during the 2008 United States presidential election campaign. In his blogs, he stated his support for Barack Obama.

Although he was proud to be Canadian, was an officer in the Order of Canada, and had no intention of changing his citizenship, Sutherland complained in 2015 that he was not allowed to vote because he was an expatriate for over five years. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed expats to vote in national elections in a decision handed down in 2019.

== Death and tributes ==
Sutherland died under hospice care in Miami on 20 June 2024, aged 88, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Kiefer Sutherland announced his death on X/Twitter adding, &quot;He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived&quot;. Upon hearing of his death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote, &quot;We&#x27;ve lost one of the greats. Donald Sutherland brought a level of brilliance to his craft few could match. A remarkable, legendary actor — and a great Canadian&quot;. U.S. President Joe Biden wrote, &quot;Donald Sutherland was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and one-of-a-kind actor who inspired and entertained the world for decades&quot;. Numerous members of the film industry wrote condolences, including Jane Fonda, Alec Baldwin, William Baldwin, Tom Blyth, Josh Brolin, Kim Cattrall, John Cusack, Michael Douglas, Roland Emmerich, Elliott Gould, Ron Howard, John Leguizamo, Janet Maslin, Helen Mirren, David Oyelowo, Lou Diamond Phillips, Richard Roeper, Will Smith, Henry Winkler, Edgar Wright, Rachel Zegler and Jennifer Lawrence. Following his death, a funeral was held in Miami and his remains were cremated.

== Artistry and legacy ==
Throughout his life, multiple sources have considered Sutherland as being one of the greatest actors to have never been nominated for an Academy Award. He was given the Academy Honorary Award during the 90th Academy Awards in 2017.

In 2023, Sutherland told The Canadian Press that he had not spent much time reflecting on the legacy of his career, stating &quot;You know, it&#x27;s over or very nearly over, so I guess I got to get down to thinking about it.&quot; Viking Canada is set to publish his memoir, &quot;Made Up, But Still True&quot;, in November 2024. Following his death, the City of Saint John, his birthplace and childhood residence, opened a condolence book signing to the public.
Helen Mirren named Sutherland as &quot;one of the smartest actors I ever worked with. He had a wonderful enquiring brain and a great knowledge of a wide variety of subjects. He combined this great intelligence with a deep sensitivity, and with seriousness about his profession as an actor. This all made him into the legend of film that he became.&quot; David Oyelowo, who worked with Sutherland on what became his final performance in &quot;,&quot; stated that &quot;Given the iconic status he rightly achieved, having a front row seat to Donald Sutherland&#x27;s last onscreen performance was both a privilege and clear evidence to me of his deep passion for the craft of acting. The glint in his eye was that of an inquisitive, hungry artist still on the hunt for the truth. Seeing that glint, up close, in the eyes of a legend was something to behold.&quot; Jane Fonda, who worked with Sutherland on the 1971 film &quot;Klute&quot;, wrote: &quot;Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as the &quot;FTA Show&quot;, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971. I am heartbroken.&quot;

Sutherland&#x27;s BBC obituary says that the &quot;late Donald Sutherland cast a literal and figurative shadow over his industry for almost 50 years&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw wrote that &quot;Sutherland was an utterly unique actor and irreplaceable star&quot; and &quot;was an aristocrat of screen actors&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman wrote that &quot;in 1970, Donald Sutherland ... was the coolest movie star on the planet. The moment I saw him in &quot;MASH,&quot; I knew he was the person I wanted to be, the same way that I wanted to be Mick Jagger or Steve McQueen&quot;. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated, &quot;He was a man with a strong presence, a brilliance in his craft, and truly a great Canadian artist and he will be deeply missed.&quot;
