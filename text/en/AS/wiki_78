<text>Mount Pleasant is a large suburban town in Charleston County, South Carolina, United States. In the Lowcountry, it is the fourth-most populous municipality in South Carolina, and for several years was one of the state&#x27;s fastest-growing areas, doubling in population between 1990 and 2000. The population was 90,801 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Charleston metropolitan area.

At the foot of the Arthur Ravenel Bridge is Patriots Point, a naval and maritime museum, home to the World War II aircraft carrier , which is now a museum ship. The Ravenel Bridge, an eight-lane highway that is part of U.S. Route 17 and was completed in 2005, spans the Cooper River and links Mount Pleasant with the city of Charleston.

==History==
The site of Mount Pleasant was originally occupied by the Sewee people, an Algonquian language-speaking tribe. The first European settlers arrived from England on July 6, 1680, under the leadership of Captain Florentia O&#x27;Sullivan. Captain O&#x27;Sullivan had been granted , which included not only the island later named for him, but also the future site of Mount Pleasant. On the earliest map of the time, this area was called &quot;North Point&quot;.

In 1696, 51 new settlers arrived. Each family was allotted several hundred acres in the area that became known as Christ Church parish. In 1706 the Province of Carolina withstood several attacks by the Spanish and the French from their settlements to the south and were victorious in defeating French invaders in an area known as &quot;Abcaw&quot;.
The area of &quot;Abcaw&quot; was Hobcaw Plantation, located between Shem Creek and the Wando River. Later, it was also known as Shipyard Plantation. Its access to deep water and abundance of good timber made it ideal for the development of a prosperous shipbuilding enterprise. Lands adjacent to Hobcaw Point were owned at different times by several different English families, many of which maintained ferries which served Mount Pleasant. By 1721, 107 families were living in Christ Church parish, including 400 whites and 637 enslaved Africans or African Americans. As the area was developed for large plantations, enslaved Africans and African Americans made up the chief labor force of the slave society. Based on this history, the majority of the population in the town was African American through the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1754, Charles Pinckney acquired a 715-acre plantation, cultivating the commodity crops of rice and indigo. It became known as Snee Farm near here. His son Charles retained the plantation until 1817. It was operated as a plantation through the 19th century.

On September 24, 1860, a public meeting was held in Mount Pleasant; it resulted in the first secession resolution passed in the state. The secession convention met in Charleston on December 20, 1860. With the advent of the Civil War, Battery Guerry and an adjacent floating battery between Mount Pleasant and Sullivan&#x27;s Island were instrumental in defense of the city. They were also bases for attacks on Fort Sumter. The city was defended by a line of fortifications from Elliot&#x27;s Creek at Boone Hall to Copahee Sound. Mount Pleasant was the secret training ground for the nine-man crew of the Confederate submarine . This small vessel was launched from Breach Inlet in 1864 to attack and sink the .
The original plank-and-barrel footbridge, later known as the Pitt Street Bridge at the foot of the Old Village area in Mount Pleasant, was used by the crew of the &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot; to cross to Breach Inlet to test the submarine. In 1899 the original wooden plank bridge was replaced by a trolley bridge.

A generation later, in 1929 a steel drawbridge was built for vehicle access between Sullivan&#x27;s Island and Mount Pleasant. The Pitt Street bridge was dismantled in 1945, but the remains are visible in the Intracoastal Waterway. The area has been maintained since then as the Pickett Bridge Recreation Area. It was named for Charleston doctor Otis Pickett.

The &quot;Old Village&quot; is Mount Pleasant&#x27;s oldest neighborhood; the oldest home, 111 Hibben Street (the Hibben House) was constructed in 1755 by Jacob Motte, a descendant of French Huguenots who had immigrated to South Carolina to escape religious persecution.

In the early 21st century, the Old Village is centered on the Pitt Street Shops at the northwestern end of the street. Among them is the Pitt Street Pharmacy, which was featured on the Food Network. It has operated at this location for more than 60 years.

The numerous slaves were freed during and after the Civil War. In 1875 African Americans made up 73% of the population in Charleston County.

===Scanlonville===
Some of the freedmen developed Scanlonville, one of the first African-American communities to be formed after the Civil War in the Charleston area. Today it is a neighborhood within Mount Pleasant, having been annexed by the city. Robert Scanlon, a freedman carpenter, purchased the property known as Remley&#x27;s Plantation, bordering Charleston harbor along the Wando River in Mount Pleasant. Scanlon was the president and founder of the Charleston Land Company, formed by 100 local freedmen who pooled their limited resources and paid $10 per share, in order to purchase large tracts of land in the area. The Charleston Land Company divided this tract into smaller lots so that freedmen could have their own land. Remley&#x27;s Plantation was divided into farm lots and city lots (which were smaller) to form the community of Scanlonville. The Charleston Land Company and Scanlonville are one of four known cooperative real estate development ventures among African-American freedmen after the Civil War. Remley Point Cemetery is in Scanlonville.
===Riverside===
West of Scanlonville is Riverside. During the Jim Crow years of much of the 20th century, this was known as the largest and oldest of five &quot;black beaches&quot; in Charleston County. It was established when public facilities were segregated under state law. Riverside officially opened in 1930 and featured a dance pavilion, athletics field, bathhouse, playground, and a boardwalk along the Wando River. Riverside Pavilion was the only venue where black city residents could see African-American musical legends such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, B.B. King, and Ivory Joe Hunter, who also performed in whites-only venues. Music performances at the Pavilion spawned juke joints, or night clubs, in Scanlonville and eventually a hotel called White&#x27;s Paradise. James Brown was known to have frequented this hotel.
After the original park owner died in 1975, operations of the Riverside property were taken over by Charleston County. It eventually sold the property to a real estate company, which developed this area as a private gated community. Public access to the waterfront ended.

===Hurricane Hugo and growth that followed===
On September 21, 1989, Mount Pleasant was hit by Hurricane Hugo, a Category Four hurricane. While the town was spared from the worst of the storm (Category 4 conditions were suffered by areas further north of the city), the town and its neighboring barrier islands still had severe damage. Children who lived through the storm were featured in an early episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Nick News&quot;, along with children who lived through Hurricane Andrew.

Development continued. A year after the storm, more people moved to the area, and the town had its largest growth spurt. It increased from a population of roughly 23,000 in 1990 to one of roughly 47,000 in 2000.

===County seat===
The county seat for Berkeley County was located in Mount Pleasant from 1882 until 1895, when it was moved to Moncks Corner.

===Bridges===

In 1928, a bridge from the Charleston Peninsula to Mount Pleasant was built. Spanning Town Creek and the Cooper River, and crossing the uninhabited Drum Island, the two-lane Grace Memorial Bridge was opened as a toll bridge. A second and larger bridge, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge, opened in 1966.

On July 16, 2005, the eight-lane Arthur Ravenel Bridge opened for automotive traffic, replacing the two aging bridges. It is one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. A week before the new bridge officially opened, pedestrians were allowed to cross the bridge, and commemorative coins were distributed. Also, a fireworks display was part of the ceremonies before the official opening. Several cars from the same time period as the Grace Memorial Bridge, including several restored Model A Fords, made a final crossing of the old bridges. The remaining portions of the old bridges were demolished. Local residents watched as the bridges were demolished by explosives over several weeks, through the summer of 2006.

In 2004, Mount Pleasant became one of the first municipalities in the United States to pass a &quot;pay-before-you-pump&quot; gas ordinance. It was intended to reduce stealing of gas that had accompanied rising prices.

==Geography==

Mount Pleasant is located in central Charleston County at (32.823189, -79.845477), on the east side of Charleston Harbor and the tidal Wando River.

Over time, the town limits have pushed northeastward from the Old Village area along U.S. Route 17, nearly as far as Awendaw.

Mount Pleasant is separated from Charleston by the Cooper River. For many years, the town was populated largely on a seasonal basis by Charleston residents wealthy enough to afford summer homes across the river from the Charleston peninsula, where they would go believing they could escape the regular summer &quot;fevers&quot;. The population of Mount Pleasant was centered in &quot;Old Village&quot;.

<text>Seabrook Island, formerly known as Simmons Island, is a barrier island in Charleston County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 1,714 at the 2010 census, up from 1,250 in 2000.

Seabrook Island is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area.

==Geography==
Seabrook Island is located in southwestern Charleston County at (32.582173, -80.163332), bordered to the south by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west by the North Edisto River, and to the north by Bohicket Creek. To the east along the Atlantic shoreline as far as the Kiawah River, across which is the town of Kiawah Island. Most of the eastern border of the town, however, is next to unincorporated land. The city of Charleston is to the northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Seabrook Island has a total area of , of which is land and , or 14.74%, is water.

==Geography and climate==
The Köppen Climate Classification System rates the climate of Seabrook Island as humid subtropical.[12] Ocean breezes tend to moderate the island climate, as compared to the nearby mainland were daytime highs are higher and nighttime lows are lower. Daytime mean highs in winter range from , with nighttime lows averaging . Summertime mean highs are , with average lows . Average rainfall is 48 inches per year. Accumulation of snow/ice is rare. The island is located borderline USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b/9a.

==History==
In 1666, British subject Lt. Col. Robert Sanford arrived on Seabrook as an explorer in royal service to King Charles II. By 1684, the local Stono Indians were persuaded to cede their lands to the proprietary government, which in turn sold the property to English settlers.

During the American Revolutionary years, the island was used as a staging area for Hessian and British troops during the Siege of Charleston. In 1816, the island was sold to William Seabrook of nearby Edisto Island, hence the present name. Under Seabrook&#x27;s ownership, the island was used for growing cotton. At the height of the Civil War, Seabrook sold the island to William Gregg, who rented the land to Charles Andell.

In 1917, the island was sold to sportsmen for hunting, fishing, and recreation; their club was known as the Kiawato Club, a portmanteau of Kiawah and Edisto, the two neighboring islands. Membership closed when the group had 50 members in 1918. The group&#x27;s clubhouse at the mouth of the Edisto River, directly across from Rockville, was completed in 1918 on plans of architect David Hyer. The clubhouse was a -story, wooden building with six bedrooms on the first floor and a dormitory with many bunkbeds on the second floor.

Victor Morawetz, the owner of Fenwick Hall (a nearby plantation), bought the club&#x27;s holdings in 1936. He did not intend to make it his personal residence but to resell it to a friend who would use the clubhouse as a winter retreat. He acquired another 560 acres from the Andell family adjacent to the old Kiawato Club in 1938.

In 1939, the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina rented land on Seabrook to establish a summer camp for underprivileged children. In 1951, about of land, including the old Kiaweto Clubhouse, were given to the church by Mrs. Morawetz.

In 1970, the diocese sold about to private developers who planned the private, residential community that Seabrook Island is today. Seventeen years later, the town of Seabrook was incorporated, and it celebrated a decade of private ownership and self-government in 1997.

In 2005 Seabrook Island Club membership became a requirement for new purchasers of property on Seabrook. The switch to mandatory membership has been controversial with some owners contending that the requirement has depressed real estate sales and prices.

In 2010 the Horizon Plan, a complete reconstruction of island amenities, was completed, providing property owners and guests with a new fitness/community center, racquet club, full-service clubhouse, beach club and renovated equestrian center, pools and golf practice facility.

Seabrook Island amenities include two championship golf courses, nationally recognized racquet club with 15 Har Tru tennis courts and two pickleball courts, equestrian center offering trail and beach rides, ocean-front dining venues, swimming pools, fitness center and expansive banquet/private dining venues.

<doc id="134429" wikidata="Q1425473" url="?curid=134429" title="Sullivan's Island, South Carolina">
<text>Sullivan&#x27;s Island, historically known as O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Island, is a town and island in Charleston County, South Carolina, United States, at the entrance to Charleston Harbor, with a population of 1,791 at the 2010 census, and 1,891 people in 2020. The town is part of the Charleston metropolitan area and is considered a very affluent suburb of Charleston.

Sullivan&#x27;s Island was the point of entry for approximately 40 to 50 percent of the 400,000 enslaved Africans brought to Colonial America, meaning that 99% of all African Americans have ancestors that came through the island. It has been likened to Ellis Island, the 19th-century reception point for immigrants in New York City. During the American Revolution, the island was the site of a major battle at Fort Sullivan on June 28, 1776, since renamed Fort Moultrie in honor of the American commander at the battle.

On September 23, 1989, Hurricane Hugo came ashore near Sullivan&#x27;s Island; few people were prepared for the destruction that followed in its wake. The eye of the hurricane passed directly over Sullivan&#x27;s Island. The Ben Sawyer Bridge was a casualty, breaking free of its locks. Before the storm was over, one end of the bridge was in the water and the other was pointing skyward. Sullivan&#x27;s Island police chief, Jack Lilien, was the last person to leave the island before the bridge gave way.

==History==
The island was known as O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Island, named for Captain Florence O&#x27;Sullivan, who was stationed here as a lookout in the late 17th century. O&#x27;Sullivan was captain of one of the ships in the first fleet to establish the colonial settlement of Charles Town. In 1671, he became surveyor general. He appears in the earliest record of Irish immigration to the Carolinas, mentioned as being taken on &quot;at Kingsayle (Kinsale) in Ireland&quot;.

Sullivan&#x27;s Island was used as a quarantine station for enslaved Africans, who were housed in various &quot;pest houses&quot; on the island and checked for communicable diseases before they were transported to Charleston for sale at public auction. Sullivan&#x27;s Island was the port of entry for over 40% of the estimated 400,000 enslaved Africans transported to Colonial America, making it the largest slave port in North America. It is estimated that more than half, if not all, of all African Americans have ancestors who passed through Sullivan&#x27;s Island.

&quot;There is no suitable memorial, or plaque, or wreath or wall, or park or skyscraper lobby,&quot; writer Toni Morrison said in 1989. &quot;There&#x27;s no 300-foot tower, there&#x27;s no small bench by the road.&quot;On July 26, 2008, the Toni Morrison Society dedicated a small, black, steel bench on Sullivan&#x27;s Island to the memory of the Africans forced into slavery, one of several which are planned. The memorial was privately funded.

In 2009, the National Park Service installed a commemorative marker at Fort Moultrie describing the Sullivan&#x27;s Island Quarantine Station. The text on the plaque reads:

Albert Wheeler Todd, an architect from Charleston, designed a town hall for the island. For most of its history, the town, located on the southwest half of the island, was known as &quot;Moultrieville&quot;. Later, Atlanticville, a community on the north-east of the islands, merged with Moultrieville and together the two became the town of Sullivan&#x27;s Island. In 1962, the new Charleston Light was built.

In May 2006, the Town of Sullivan&#x27;s Island became the first municipality in South Carolina to ban smoking in all public places. The ordinance passed 4–2 and the ban went into effect in June.

The Atlanticville Historic District, Battery Gadsden, Battery Thomson, Fort Moultrie Quartermaster and Support Facilities Historic District, Moultrieville Historic District, Dr. John B. Patrick House, Sullivan&#x27;s Island Historic District, and U.S. Coast Guard Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Fort Moultrie===

On June 28, 1776, an incomplete fort was held by South Carolinian forces under Colonel William Moultrie against an invasion by a British force under the command of Henry Clinton sailing with Commodore Sir Peter Parker&#x27;s Royal Navy fleet. The British cannonade proved to have no effect on the sand-filled palmetto log walls of the fort; the only fatalities were the result of those shots that carried over the walls.

During this battle, a flag designed by Moultrie flew over the fortress; it was dark blue with a crescent moon on it bearing the word &quot;liberty&quot;. When this flag was shot down, Sergeant William Jasper reportedly picked it up and held it aloft, rallying the troops until a new standard could be provided. Because of the importance of this pivotal battle, that flag became symbolic of liberty in South Carolina, the South, and the nation as a whole.

The Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island was commemorated by the addition of a white palmetto tree to the flag used to rally that day, known as the Moultrie Flag. This was used as the basis of the state flag of South Carolina. The victory is celebrated and June 28 is known as Carolina Day.

The history of the island has been dominated by Fort Moultrie, which, until its closure in the late 1940s, served as the base of command for the defense of Charleston. After World War II, the Department of Defense concluded that such coastal defense installations were no longer needed, given current technology and style of war. It is now used as heritage tourism.

==Literary references==
*The writer Edgar Allan Poe was stationed at Fort Moultrie from November 1827 to December 1828. The island is a setting for much of his short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; (1843). In Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot;, a gas balloon (forerunner of the dirigible) is piloted by eight men, two of them making independent diary entries, and describes a trip from Northern Wales to Fort Moultrie, Sullivan&#x27;s Island over the course 75 hours. (Written in a dry, scientific style, Poe&#x27;s account was published as fact in a New York City newspaper in 1844 and retracted three days later.) Today, the town library on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, situated in a refurbished military battery, is named after the poet, and streets such as Raven (after his narrative poem &quot;The Raven&quot; published in 1845) and Gold Bug avenues commemorate his works. His poem &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; is said to be written about a girl Poe fell in love with when stationed in Fort Moultrie in the early 1830s.
*The novel &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Island&quot; by Dorothea Benton Frank is set here. 
*Pat Conroy set his semi-autobiographical memoir &quot;The Boo&quot; (1970) and the novel &quot;Beach Music&quot; (1995) here. He also features Sullivan&#x27;s Island in his novel &quot;South of Broad&quot; (2009).
*In Lawrence Hill&#x27;s novel &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;, the main character, Aminata Diallo, passes through Sullivan&#x27;s Island in 1757 at the age of 11 after being kidnapped in Mali and sold into slavery.

Sullivan&#x27;s Island is mentioned in the song &quot;Palmetto Rose&quot; by Jason Isbell in his 2015 album &quot;Something More Than Free&quot;.

==Other references==
E. Lee Spence, a pioneer underwater archaeologist, was a longtime resident of Sullivan&#x27;s Island. In the 1960s and 1970s, he discovered many shipwrecks along its shores. Those discoveries included the Civil War blockade runners &quot;Flora&quot;, &quot;Beatrice&quot;, &quot;Stono&quot;, &quot;Flamingo&quot;, &quot;Prince Albert&quot;, and the &quot;Celt&quot; (also known as the &quot;Colt&quot;).

In 1981, adventure novelist and marine archaeologist Clive Cussler and his organization, the National Underwater and Marine Agency, discovered the wreck of the blockade runner &quot;Raccoon&quot; off Sullivan&#x27;s Island.

Several districts and properties on Sullivans&#x27; Island have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places: Atlanticville Historic District, Moultrieville Historic District, Sullivans Island Historic District, Fort Moultrie Historic District, U.

<text>Blacksburg is a small town in Cherokee County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 1,848 at the 2010 census. The communities of Antioch, Cherokee Falls, Kings Creek, Cashion Crossroads, Buffalo, and Mount Paran are located near the town.

Blacksburg is in Upstate South Carolina on the Interstate 85 corridor about southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina. It is part of the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson Combined Statistical Area (CSA) which has a population of 1,478,648 according to 2018 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau.

==History==
Located near the northern border of the state, the present-day site of Blacksburg was first settled by a man named Stark. Mr. Stark, who had lived in Charleston, South Carolina prior to moving to the area, had gotten several people to come along with him on an agriculture venture, but this venture would fail. Those who stayed behind named the area &quot;Stark&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

In the late 19th century the Black family, headed by John G. Black, a Confederate veteran, was living in the area and persuaded the C.C. &amp; C. Railroad Company to lay track through the town and build a depot. The town soon became known as &quot;Black&#x27;s Station&quot; in honor of John G. Black and was incorporated as Black&#x27;s Station town in 1876. The legal town was renamed &quot;Blacksburg&quot; in 1888.

Major John F. Jones of Massachusetts came to live in Blacksburg when hired as superintendent of the C. C. &amp; C. Railroad. He donated his own money to build a school, hotel (the Cherokee Inn), and several other buildings in Blacksburg. He lived in Blacksburg until 1922, when he was appointed the South Carolina Internal Revenue Collector by the President of the United States.

In the 1890s large amounts of iron ore were found in the area, and many people hoping to make a fortune from mining it flocked to the town. Blacksburg became a boom town, and hotels and saloons were built for the new visitors. The town went by the name &quot;Iron City&quot; for a short time. Because of the &quot;iron rush&quot; the town became quite wealthy. It installed the first electric street lights in Upstate South Carolina and perhaps in the entire state.
The town was renamed in 1888 as &quot;Blacksburg&quot; but still holds the nickname of &quot;Iron City&quot;.

The Kings Mountain State Park Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

<text>Gaffney is a city in and the seat of Cherokee County, South Carolina, United States, in the Upstate region of South Carolina.

==History==

Michael Robert Gaffney was born in the town of Granard in County Longford, Ireland, in 1775. He emigrated to the United States in 1797, arriving in New York City and moving to Charleston, South Carolina, a few years later. Gaffney moved again in 1804 to the South Carolina Upcountry and established a tavern and lodging house at what became known as &quot;Gaffney&#x27;s Cross Roads&quot;. The location was perfect for growth because of the two major roads which met here, one from the mountains of North Carolina to Charleston and the other from Charlotte into Georgia. Michael Gaffney died here on September 6, 1854.

In 1872, the area became known as &quot;Gaffney City&quot;. Gaffney became the county seat of Cherokee County which was formed out of parts of York, Union, and Spartanburg counties in 1897. Gaffney became a major center for the textile industry in South Carolina, which was the backbone of the county&#x27;s economy up until the 1980s.

Uptown Gaffney began to languish after Interstate 85 was built in the county as industries located near the new highway.

Two serial killers have at different times attacked residents of Gaffney. In 1967–1968 Lee Roy Martin, known as the Gaffney Strangler, killed four people; two were young girls, a fourteen-year-old and a fifteen-year-old. In 2009, a series of shootings by Patrick Tracy Burris led to five deaths.

<text>In linear algebra, the Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization (pronounced ) is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which is useful for efficient numerical solutions, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations. It was discovered by André-Louis Cholesky for real matrices, and posthumously published in 1924.
When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations.

== Statement ==
The Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix , is a decomposition of the form

formula_1

where is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries, and * denotes the conjugate transpose of . Every Hermitian positive-definite matrix (and thus also every real-valued symmetric positive-definite matrix) has a unique Cholesky decomposition.

The converse holds trivially: if can be written as for some invertible , lower triangular or otherwise, then is Hermitian and positive definite.

When is a real matrix (hence symmetric positive-definite), the factorization may be written
formula_2
where is a real lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries.

=== Positive semidefinite matrices ===
If a Hermitian matrix is only positive semidefinite, instead of positive definite, then it still has a decomposition of the form where the diagonal entries of are allowed to be zero.
The decomposition need not be unique, for example:
formula_3
for any . However, if the rank of is , then there is a unique lower triangular with exactly positive diagonal elements and columns containing all zeroes.

Alternatively, the decomposition can be made unique when a pivoting choice is fixed. Formally, if is an positive semidefinite matrix of rank , then there is at least one permutation matrix such that has a unique decomposition of the form with
formula_4,
where is an lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal.

== LDL decomposition ==

A closely related variant of the classical Cholesky decomposition is the LDL decomposition,

formula_5

where is a lower unit triangular (unitriangular) matrix, and is a diagonal matrix. That is, the diagonal elements of are required to be 1 at the cost of introducing an additional diagonal matrix in the decomposition. The main advantage is that the LDL decomposition can be computed and used with essentially the same algorithms, but avoids extracting square roots.

For this reason, the LDL decomposition is often called the &quot;square-root-free Cholesky&quot; decomposition. For real matrices, the factorization has the form and is often referred to as decomposition (or decomposition, or LDL′). It is reminiscent of the eigendecomposition of real symmetric matrices, , but is quite different in practice because and are not similar matrices.

The LDL decomposition is related to the classical Cholesky decomposition of the form as follows:

formula_6

Conversely, given the classical Cholesky decomposition formula_7 of a positive definite matrix, if is a diagonal matrix that contains the main diagonal of formula_8, then can be decomposed as formula_9 where
formula_10 (this rescales each column to make diagonal elements 1),
formula_11

If is positive definite then the diagonal elements of are all positive.
For positive semidefinite , an formula_9 decomposition exists where the number of non-zero elements on the diagonal is exactly the rank of .
Some indefinite matrices for which no Cholesky decomposition exists have an LDL decomposition with negative entries in : it suffices that the first leading principal minors of are non-singular.

== Example ==

Here is the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric real matrix:

formula_13

And here is its LDLT decomposition:

formula_14

== Geometric interpretation ==
The Cholesky decomposition is equivalent to a particular choice of conjugate axes of an ellipsoid. In detail, let the ellipsoid be defined as formula_15, then by definition, a set of vectors formula_16 are conjugate axes of the ellipsoid iff formula_17. Then, the ellipsoid is preciselyformula_18where formula_19 maps the basis vector formula_20, and formula_21 is the unit sphere in n dimensions. That is, the ellipsoid is a linear image of the unit sphere.

Define the matrix formula_22, then formula_17 is equivalent to formula_24. Different choices of the conjugate axes correspond to different decompositions.

The Cholesky decomposition corresponds to choosing formula_25 to be parallel to the first axis, formula_26 to be within the plane spanned by the first two axes, and so on. This makes formula_27 an upper-triangular matrix. Then, there is formula_28, where formula_29 is lower-triangular.

Similarly, principal component analysis corresponds to choosing formula_16 to be perpendicular. Then, let formula_31 and formula_32, and there is formula_33 where formula_34 is an orthogonal matrix. This then yields formula_35.

== Applications ==
===Numerical solution of system of linear equations===
The Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of linear equations formula_36. If is symmetric and positive definite, then formula_36 can be solved by first computing the Cholesky decomposition formula_38, then solving formula_39 for by forward substitution, and finally solving formula_40 for by back substitution.

An alternative way to eliminate taking square roots in the formula_41 decomposition is to compute the LDL decomposition formula_42, then solving formula_39 for , and finally solving formula_44.

For linear systems that can be put into symmetric form, the Cholesky decomposition (or its LDL variant) is the method of choice, for superior efficiency and numerical stability. Compared to the LU decomposition, it is roughly twice as efficient.

===Linear least squares===
In linear least squares problem one seeks a solution of an over-determined system , such that quadratic norm of the residual vector is minimum. This may be accomplished by solving by Cholesky decomposition
normal equations formula_45, where formula_46 is symmetric positive definite. Symmetric equation matrix
may also come from an energy functional, which must be positive from physical considerations; this happens frequently in the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

Such method is economic and works well in many applications, however it fails for near singular
. This is best illustrated in pathological case of square formula_47,
where determinant of is square of that of the original system .
Then it is best to apply SVD or QR decomposition. Givens QR has the advantage that similarly
to normal equations there is no need to keep the whole matrix as it is
possible to update Cholesky factor with consecutive rows of .

===Non-linear optimization===
Non-linear least squares are a particular case of nonlinear optimization. Let formula_48 is an over-determined system of equations with a non-linear function formula_49 returning vector results. The aim is to minimize square norm of residuals formula_50. An approximate Newton&#x27;s method solution is obtained by expanding formula_49 into curtailed Taylor series 
formula_52 yielding
linear least squares problem for formula_53
: formula_54
Of course because of neglect of higher Taylor terms such solution is only approximate, if it ever exists. Now one could update expansion point to formula_55
and repeat the whole procedure, hoping that (i) iterations converge to a solution
and (ii) that the solution is the one needed. Unfortunately neither is guaranteed and
must be verified.

Non-linear least squares may be also applied to the linear least squares problem by setting 
formula_56 and formula_57. This may be useful if Cholesky decomposition yields inaccurate inverse triangle matrix formula_58 where
formula_59, because of rounding errors. Such procedure is called &quot;differential correction&quot; of solution. As long as iterations converge, by virtue of Banach fixed point theorem they yield the solution which precision is only limited by precision of calculated residuals formula_60, but independent rounding errors of formula_58. Poor formula_58 may restrict region of initial formula_63
yielding convergence or altogether preventing it. Usually convergence is slower e.g. linear
so that formula_64 where constant
formula_65. Such slow convergence may be sped by &quot;Aitken formula_66&quot; method.
If calculation of formula_58 is very costly, it is possible to use it from previous 
iterations as long as convergence is maintained. Such Cholesky procedure may work even for Hilbert matrices, 
notoriously difficult to invert. 

Non-linear multi-variate functions may be minimized over their parameters using variants of Newton&#x27;s method called &quot;quasi-Newton&quot; methods. At iteration k, the search steps in a direction formula_68 defined by solving formula_69 for formula_68, where formula_68 is the step direction, formula_72 is the gradient, and formula_73 is an approximation to the Hessian matrix formed by repeating rank-1 updates at each iteration. Two well-known update formulas are called Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DFP) and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS). Loss of the positive-definite condition through round-off error is avoided if rather than updating an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian, one updates the Cholesky decomposition of an approximation of the Hessian matrix itself.

===Monte Carlo simulation===
The Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in the Monte Carlo method for simulating systems with multiple correlated variables. The covariance matrix is decomposed to give the lower-triangular . Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated observations in a sample produces a sample vector Lu with the covariance properties of the system being modeled.

The following simplified example shows the economy one gets from the Cholesky decomposition: suppose the goal is to generate two correlated normal variables formula_74 and formula_75 with given correlation coefficient formula_76. To accomplish that, it is necessary to first generate two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables formula_77 and formula_78 (for example, via a Box–Muller transform). Given the required correlation coefficient formula_76, the correlated normal variables can be obtained via the transformations formula_80 and formula_81.

===Kalman filters===
Unscented Kalman filters commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose a set of so-called sigma points. The Kalman filter tracks the average state of a system as a vector of length and covariance as an matrix . The matrix is always positive semi-definite and can be decomposed into LLT. The columns of can be added and subtracted from the mean to form a set of vectors called &quot;sigma points&quot;. These sigma points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state.

===Matrix inversion===
The explicit inverse of a Hermitian matrix can be computed by Cholesky decomposition, in a manner similar to solving linear systems, using formula_82 operations (formula_83 multiplications). The entire inversion can even be efficiently performed in-place.

A non-Hermitian matrix can also be inverted using the following identity, where BB* will always be Hermitian:

formula_84

== Computation ==
There are various methods for calculating the Cholesky decomposition. The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is in general. The algorithms described below all involve about FLOPs ( multiplications and the same number of additions) for real flavors and FLOPs for complex flavors, where is the size of the matrix . Hence, they have half the cost of the LU decomposition, which uses FLOPs (see Trefethen and Bau 1997).

Which of the algorithms below is faster depends on the details of the implementation. Generally, the first algorithm will be slightly slower because it accesses the data in a less regular manner.
The Cholesky decomposition was shown to be numerically stable without need for pivoting.

=== The Cholesky algorithm ===
The Cholesky algorithm, used to calculate the decomposition matrix , is a modified version of Gaussian elimination.

The recursive algorithm starts with and

At step , the matrix has the following form:
formula_85
where denotes the identity matrix of dimension .

If the matrix is defined by
formula_86
(note that since is positive definite),
then can be written as
formula_87
where
formula_88
Note that is an outer product, therefore this algorithm is called the &quot;outer-product version&quot; in (Golub &amp; Van Loan).

This is repeated for from 1 to . After steps, is obtained, and hence, the lower triangular matrix sought for is calculated as

formula_89

=== The Cholesky–Banachiewicz and Cholesky–Crout algorithms ===

If the equation
formula_90

is written out, the following is obtained:

formula_91

and therefore the following formulas for the entries of :

formula_92
formula_93

For complex and real matrices, inconsequential arbitrary sign changes of diagonal and associated off-diagonal elements are allowed. The expression under the square root is always positive if is real and positive-definite. 

For complex Hermitian matrix, the following formula applies:

formula_94
formula_95

So it now is possible to compute the entry if the entries to the left and above are known. The computation is usually arranged in either of the following orders:
* The Cholesky–Banachiewicz algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix and proceeds to calculate the matrix row by row. 

for (i = 0; i &lt; dimensionSize; i++) {
 for (j = 0; j &lt;= i; j++) {
 float sum = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; j; k++)
 sum += L[i][k] * L[j][k];

 if (i == j)
 L[i][j] = sqrt(A[i][i] - sum);
 else
 L[i][j] = (1.0 / L[j][j] * (A[i][j] - sum));
}

The above algorithm can be succinctly expressed as combining a dot product and matrix multiplication in vectorized programming languages such as Fortran as the following,

do i = 1, size(A,1)
 L(i,i) = sqrt(A(i,i) - dot_product(L(i,1:i-1), L(i,1:i-1)))
 L(i+1:,i) = (A(i+1:,i) - matmul(conjg(L(i,1:i-1)), L(i+1:,1:i-1))) / L(i,i)
end do

where codice_1 refers to complex conjugate of the elements.

* The Cholesky–Crout algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix and proceeds to calculate the matrix column by column. 
for (j = 0; j &lt; dimensionSize; j++) {
 float sum = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; j; k++) {
 sum += L[j][k] * L[j][k];
 L[j][j] = sqrt(A[j][j] - sum);

 for (i = j + 1; i &lt; dimensionSize; i++) {
 sum = 0;
 for (k = 0; k &lt; j; k++) {
 sum += L[i][k] * L[j][k];
 L[i][j] = (1.0 / L[j][j] * (A[i][j] - sum));
}

The above algorithm can be succinctly expressed as combining a dot product and matrix multiplication in vectorized programming languages such as Fortran as the following,

do i = 1, size(A,1)
 L(i,i) = sqrt(A(i,i) - dot_product(L(1:i-1,i), L(1:i-1,i)))
 L(i,i+1:) = (A(i,i+1:) - matmul(conjg(L(1:i-1,i)), L(1:i-1,i+1:))) / L(i,i)
end do

where codice_1 refers to complex conjugate of the elements.

Either pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.

=== Stability of the computation ===
Suppose that there is a desire to solve a well-conditioned system of linear equations. If the LU decomposition is used, then the algorithm is unstable unless some sort of pivoting strategy is used. In the latter case, the error depends on the so-called growth factor of the matrix, which is usually (but not always) small.

Now, suppose that the Cholesky decomposition is applicable. As mentioned above, the algorithm will be twice as fast. Furthermore, no pivoting is necessary, and the error will always be small. Specifically, if , and denotes the computed solution, then solves the perturbed system (, where
formula_96
Here ||·||2 is the matrix 2-norm, &quot;cn&quot; is a small constant depending on , and denotes the unit round-off.

One concern with the Cholesky decomposition to be aware of is the use of square roots. If the matrix being factorized is positive definite as required, the numbers under the square roots are always positive &quot;in exact arithmetic&quot;. Unfortunately, the numbers can become negative because of round-off errors, in which case the algorithm cannot continue. However, this can only happen if the matrix is very ill-conditioned. One way to address this is to add a diagonal correction matrix to the matrix being decomposed in an attempt to promote the positive-definiteness. While this might lessen the accuracy of the decomposition, it can be very favorable for other reasons; for example, when performing Newton&#x27;s method in optimization, adding a diagonal matrix can improve stability when far from the optimum.

=== LDL decomposition ===
An alternative form, eliminating the need to take square roots when is symmetric, is the symmetric indefinite factorization
formula_97

The following recursive relations apply for the entries of and :
formula_98
formula_99

This works as long as the generated diagonal elements in stay non-zero. The decomposition is then unique. and are real if is real.

For complex Hermitian matrix , the following formula applies:

formula_100
formula_101

Again, the pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.

===Block variant===
When used on indefinite matrices, the LDL* factorization is known to be unstable without careful pivoting; specifically, the elements of the factorization can grow arbitrarily. A possible improvement is to perform the factorization on block sub-matrices, commonly 2 × 2:

formula_102

where every element in the matrices above is a square submatrix. From this, these analogous recursive relations follow:

formula_103
formula_104

This involves matrix products and explicit inversion, thus limiting the practical block size.

===Updating the decomposition===
A task that often arises in practice is that one needs to update a Cholesky decomposition. In more details, one has already computed the Cholesky decomposition formula_105 of some matrix formula_106, then one changes the matrix formula_106 in some way into another matrix, say formula_108, and one wants to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the updated matrix: formula_109. The question is now whether one can use the Cholesky decomposition of formula_106 that was computed before to compute the Cholesky decomposition of formula_108.

==== Rank-one update ====
The specific case, where the updated matrix formula_108 is related to the matrix formula_106 by formula_114, is known as a &quot;rank-one update&quot;.

Here is a function written in Matlab syntax that realizes a rank-one update:

function [L] = cholupdate(L, x)
 n = length(x);
 for k = 1:n
 r = sqrt(L(k, k)^2 + x(k)^2);
 c = r / L(k, k);
 s = x(k) / L(k, k);
 L(k, k) = r;
 if k &lt; n
 L((k+1):n, k) = (L((k+1):n, k) + s * x((k+1):n)) / c;
 x((k+1):n) = c * x((k+1):n) - s * L((k+1):n, k);
 end
 end
end

A &quot;rank-n update&quot; is one where for a matrix formula_115 one updates the decomposition such that formula_116. This can be achieved by successively performing rank-one updates for each of the columns of formula_115.

==== Rank-one downdate ====
A &quot;rank-one downdate&quot; is similar to a rank-one update, except that the addition is replaced by subtraction: formula_118. This only works if the new matrix formula_108 is still positive definite.

The code for the rank-one update shown above can easily be adapted to do a rank-one downdate: one merely needs to replace the two additions in the assignment to codice_3 and codice_4 by subtractions.

==== Adding and removing rows and columns ====
If a symmetric and positive definite matrix formula_120 is represented in block form as

formula_121

and its upper Cholesky factor
formula_122

then for a new matrix formula_108, which is the same as formula_120 but with the insertion of new rows and columns,
formula_125

Now there is an interest in finding the Cholesky factorization of formula_108, which can be called formula_127, without directly computing the entire decomposition. 
formula_128

Writing formula_129 for the solution of formula_130, which can be found easily for triangular matrices, and formula_131 for the Cholesky decomposition of formula_132, the following relations can be found:
formula_133

These formulas may be used to determine the Cholesky factor after the insertion of rows or columns in any position, if the row and column dimensions are appropriately set (including to zero). The inverse problem, 

formula_125
with known Cholesky decomposition 
formula_135

and the desire to determine the Cholesky factor
formula_136

of the matrix formula_120 with rows and columns removed,
formula_138

yields the following rules:
formula_139

Notice that the equations above that involve finding the Cholesky decomposition of a new matrix are all of the form formula_140, which allows them to be efficiently calculated using the update and downdate procedures detailed in the previous section.

== Proof for positive semi-definite matrices ==

=== Proof by limiting argument ===
The above algorithms show that every positive definite matrix formula_141 has a Cholesky decomposition. This result can be extended to the positive semi-definite case by a limiting argument. The argument is not fully constructive, i.e., it gives no explicit numerical algorithms for computing Cholesky factors.

If formula_141 is an formula_143 positive semi-definite matrix, then the sequence formula_144 consists of positive definite matrices. (This is an immediate consequence of, for example, the spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus.) Also,
formula_145 
in operator norm. From the positive definite case, each formula_146 has Cholesky decomposition formula_147. By property of the operator norm,

formula_148

The formula_149 holds because formula_150 equipped with the operator norm is a C* algebra. So formula_151 is a bounded set in the Banach space of operators, therefore relatively compact (because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional). 
Consequently, it has a convergent subsequence, also denoted by formula_152, with limit formula_153. 
It can be easily checked that this formula_153 has the desired properties, i.e. formula_155, and formula_153 is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries: for all formula_157 and formula_158,

formula_159

Therefore, formula_155. 
Because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional, all topologies on the space of operators are equivalent. 
So formula_152 tends to formula_153 in norm means formula_152 tends to formula_153 entrywise. 
This in turn implies that, since each formula_165 is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries, formula_153 is also.

=== Proof by QR decomposition ===

Let formula_106 be a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix. Then it can be written as a product of its square root matrix, formula_168. Now QR decomposition can be applied to formula_169, resulting in formula_170
, where formula_171 is unitary and formula_172 is upper triangular. Inserting the decomposition into the original equality yields formula_173. Setting formula_174 completes the proof.

== Generalization ==
The Cholesky factorization can be generalized to (not necessarily finite) matrices with operator entries. Let formula_175 be a sequence of Hilbert spaces. Consider the operator matrix

formula_176

acting on the direct sum

formula_177

where each

formula_178

is a bounded operator. If is positive (semidefinite) in the sense that for all finite and for any

formula_179

there is formula_180, then there exists a lower triangular operator matrix such that . One can also take the diagonal entries of to be positive.

== Implementations in programming libraries ==
* C programming language: the GNU Scientific Library provides several implementations of Cholesky decomposition.
* Maxima computer algebra system: function codice_5 computes Cholesky decomposition.
* GNU Octave numerical computations system provides several functions to calculate, update, and apply a Cholesky decomposition.
* The LAPACK library provides a high performance implementation of the Cholesky decomposition that can be accessed from Fortran, C and most languages.
* In Python, the function codice_5 from the codice_7 module performs Cholesky decomposition.
* In Matlab, the codice_8 function gives the Cholesky decomposition. Note that codice_8 uses the upper triangular factor of the input matrix by default, i.e. it computes formula_181 where formula_182 is upper triangular. A flag can be passed to use the lower triangular factor instead.
* In R, the codice_8 function gives the Cholesky decomposition.
* In Julia, the codice_5 function from the codice_12 standard library gives the Cholesky decomposition.
* In Mathematica, the function &quot;codice_13&quot; can be applied to a matrix.
* In C++, multiple linear algebra libraries support this decomposition:
** The Armadillo (C++ library) supplies the command codice_8 to perform Cholesky decomposition. 
** The Eigen library supplies Cholesky factorizations for both sparse and dense matrices.
** In the ROOT package, the codice_15 class is available.

==History==
While being transported to Richmond, Virginia, for his trial for treason, former Vice-President Aaron Burr passed through Chester. Burr &quot;flung himself from his horse and cried for a rescue, but the officer commanding the escort seized him, threw him back like a child into the saddle, and marched on.&quot; The large stone he stood on has been inscribed and is preserved in the town center, and is known locally as the Aaron Burr Rock.

Chester was home to Brainerd Institute, a school for African American children.

The Catholic Presbyterian Church, Chester City Hall and Opera House, Chester Historic District, Colvin-Fant-Durham Farm Complex, Fishdam Ford, Kumler Hall, Lewis Inn, and McCollum Mound are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

John A. G. Walker owned a plantation in Chester County. After Walker died in the 1870s, his widow wanted a town built, which would be named Walkerville. She offered the Chester and Cheraw Railroad land to build a line through the proposed town, which they did. The Walkers&#x27; daughter married a Dr. Fort, who had a large home with a lawn next to the railroad. The story is that the railroad&#x27;s conductor would say, &quot;Everybody off for Fort&#x27;s Lawn!&quot;

After Southern Power built a dam in 1907, the nearby town of Great Falls saw considerably more growth than Fort Lawn. In 1959, area leaders worked to attract industry, and over the next three years, companies including Springs Industries spent $18 million.

<doc id="134441" wikidata="Q1070214" url="?curid=134441" title="Cheraw, South Carolina">
<text>Cheraw ( , ) is a town on the Pee Dee River in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 5,040 at the 2020 census. The greater Cheraw area in the zip code 29520 has a population of 13,689 according to the 2019 ACS data. It has been nicknamed &quot;The Prettiest Town in Dixie&quot;. More than half the population is African American.

==History==

===Origins===
When the first Europeans arrived in the area it was inhabited by the Cheraw and Pee Dee American Indian tribes. The Cheraw lived near the waterfall hill, near present-day Cheraw, but by the 1730s they had been devastated by new infectious disease inadvertently carried by the European traders. Survivors joined the Catawba Confederacy for safety and left their name in history. Only a few scattered Cheraw families remained by the time of the American Revolution. A few European settlers entered their territory in the 1730s, and were then forced upriver when the Welsh came to claim the Welsh Baptist lands granted by the English government in the area around Society Hill. Many of the early settlers of the 1740s in Cheraw were ethnic English, Scots, French Huguenots, or Scots-Irish.

By 1750, Cheraw had become an established Anglo-American village with a growing river trade, one of the first inland villages. It was one of only six places in South Carolina that appeared on English maps at the time. In the 1760s, Joseph and Eli Kershaw were granted the part of Cheraw that is now the downtown historic district. The Kershaws laid out a formal street system. By 1830 settlers lined all the streets with rows of elms. The Kershaws originally called the town &quot;Chatham&quot;, but people never accepted this name, continuing to call it &quot;Cheraw&quot; or &quot;Cheraw Hill&quot;.

===American Revolution===
There was a lack of organization and rule during the beginning of the 1740s in the backcountry of South Carolina. This lack of organization and unrest was an underlying cause of the resentment people of these areas felt toward the British Crown. In the Pee Dee area, planters organized a group called the Regulators to help bring order to the area. In 1768 St. David&#x27;s Parish, the last Anglican Church built in South Carolina under King George III, was established to help serve the civic and religious needs of the Cheraw area. Later a judicial district and courthouse were established to help deal with the problem of order. However, there was still much discontent with the ruling authority, and in May 1776 the grand jury of the Cheraws District Two declared its independence from Great Britain.

Many area men played prominent roles in the American Revolution. They included Claudius Pegues, General Henry W. Harrington, the Ellerbe brothers, Philip Pledger, and Eli Kershaw. There was much unrest in the area during this time because Cheraw fell into part of the British strategic line of defense, where garrisons were built to control revolutionaries and to encourage loyalists. Other towns in this line of defense included Camden, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia. Cheraw also became a strategic point for the Americans. Military activity was especially heavy in Cheraw and surrounding counties from 1780 to 1781. During the Revolutionary War, St. David&#x27;s Church was used as a hospital for British troops that operated under Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s command and as quarters for the South Carolina militia. In December 1780, just across from Cheraw, American commander General Nathanael Greene set up a &quot;camp of repose&quot; to rest and train his men.

===Early 19th century===
In 1819, the first steamboat came up river, and along with it a burst of prosperity because of expanded trade. Cheraw was incorporated as a town in 1820. The main crops from the Cheraw area were corn, cotton, tobacco, rice and indigo. Cheraw had the largest cotton market between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. Because of the cotton trade, the town boasted the largest bank in South Carolina outside of Charleston before the Civil War. Despite a serious fire in 1835, by 1850 the town was a prosperous center of trade.

===Civil War===
Leading up to the Civil War, Cheraw citizens played a key role in South Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union. On November 19, 1860, the first call for secession in a public meeting was made at the Chesterfield County Courthouse. John A. Inglis of Cheraw was in attendance. He later introduced the resolution for South Carolina to secede. Inglis was also named the chairman of the committee that wrote the document for South Carolina&#x27;s secession.

From the beginning of the war, Cheraw was known as a place of refuge and a storehouse for valuables. In March 1865, General William T. Sherman brought his Union troops to Cheraw for several days. The town was strategically important due to its bridge across the Pee Dee River. The Confederate forces there were able to delay Sherman&#x27;s army by destroying the bridge during their withdrawal from Cheraw. One Union soldier said that they found Cheraw to be &quot;a pleasant town and an old one with the Southern aristocratic bearing.&quot; Sherman used this as a time to gain more control over his men. No private dwellings or public buildings in Cheraw were destroyed by Sherman and his troops. However, an accidental explosion of captured gunpowder at the river hill burned the Cheraw business district. The county courthouse in Chesterfield was burned in this event, resulting in the loss of many records. Thus, it is difficult to date many of the historic properties.

During the Civil War, St. David&#x27;s Church was used as a hospital by both the Confederate and Union armies. Some troops from both armies were buried there. The first Confederate monument was erected there in 1867, a claim disputed by Romney, West Virginia. Originally, the monument did not mention the Confederate soldiers because the area was still occupied by Federal troops.

===20th century to present===

The Civil War caused great economic hardship in Cheraw due to the destruction of its bridge across the Pee Dee River and the conflagration in its business district. However, by the early 1900s, prosperity began to return to Cheraw. Colored Memorial School was established in Cheraw.

The Great Depression again brought change. Cheraw State Park and Sandhills State Forest were both founded in the 1930s. Cheraw was the first municipality to use the Civilian Conservation Corps in South Carolina to build a state park. The plan, which was privately funded by the town&#x27;s citizens, was to make Cheraw the &quot;Gateway City&quot; of South Carolina with the creation of Cheraw State Park. The park is the largest of the CCC-originated state parks in South Carolina.

By the 1950s and 1960s the groundwork was laid for industrial growth. By the end of the 20th century, Cheraw had a balanced industrial base while maintaining its historic charm, architectural treasures and natural resources. The harbor tug &quot;USS Cheraw&quot; was named in the town&#x27;s honor.

In November, 1941, Cheraw saw pretend combat in its streets during the Battle of Pee Dee River, Phase 1 of the Carolina Maneuvers. General George Patton&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division was the (Red) attacking force versus Major General Charles F. Thompson&#x27;s I Corps defending (Blue). Tanks from Patton&#x27;s division penetrated the defenses and entered the city center to be met by defending anti-tank guns. It was determined that Red&#x27;s tanks were successful and Blue forces were forced to withdraw from the town.

In addition to St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church and Cemetery, the Cheraw Historic District and Robert Smalls School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Brewer Gold Mine ===
The Brewer Gold Mine is an abandoned mine located on the western border of Chesterfield County, about 1.5 miles due west of the town of Jefferson, South Carolina. Brewer Gold Company owns approximately 1,000 acres of land along a small north-south ridgeline that divides Little Fork Creek and the Lynches River. About one-quarter of the 1,000 acres has been disturbed by mining operations. Brewer Gold Mine was one of the oldest and most productive gold mines in the eastern United States.

Activities at Brewer are rumored to date to the 16th century involving Indian trade with the Spaniards. Before the Revolutionary War, the area was mined for iron. The first documented discovery of gold took place by Burrell Brewer in 1828. Brewer Gold Company, a subsidiary owned by the British Costain Limited Group (Costain), secured ownership of the mine in 1986, with the first gold production occurring in August 1987. Ore was mined using conventional open pit methods until January 1995. Rock was first fractured using drilling and blasting, and then loaded into trucks. Waste rock was used as fill for facility construction or hauled to a disposal area to the south of the Brewer Pit. Ore was hauled to the crushing area where processing for the cyanide heap-leach method began. The crushed ore was then placed on pads and a dilute cyanide solution was sprayed over the heaps and allowed to percolate through the ore, thereby dissolving the gold into solution.

<text>McBee is a town in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 867. McBee is approximately northwest of Florence and northeast of Columbia.It is also the hometown of professional golfer Grant Sellers.

==History==

===Origin===
McBee was named after a railroad executive, V.E. &quot;Bunch&quot; McBee, born July 26, 1849, in Greenville County, South Carolina. Bunch McBee was one of South Carolina&#x27;s leading forces in the building of railroads, was responsible for the Columbia to Hamlet, North Carolina, line, which runs through McBee, and was at one time superintendent of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad.

===20th century===
In 1900, McBee&#x27;s first railroad depot was built. About one year later on October 8, 1901, McBee was incorporated. On June 30, 1901, McBee Presbyterian Church was built, the first church in McBee. Six years later in 1907 McBee&#x27;s second church, McBee Methodist Church, was built.

After the Seaboard&#x27;s Columbia-to-Cheraw line was completed in 1900, McBee grew so quickly that a new depot became a high priority by the end of the decade. In 1914, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad built a second depot in McBee. This was both a passenger and freight depot until it closed in 1971. Now it is the McBee Depot Library and Railroad Museum. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as the Seaboard Air Line Railway Depot in McBee. In 1980, the railroad became a subsidiary of the newly created CSX Corporation, and in 1986 the Seaboard name was changed to CSX Transportation.

In 1945, U.S. Route 1 through McBee was named the Blue Star Memorial Highway Number 6.

McBee Rescue was originally formed in 1962 as a joint venture with Jefferson Rescue to fill the need of rescue - ambulance service in the area. The ambulance was rotated between McBee and Jefferson and responded to the appropriate area as needed. The ambulance was originally parked on the street corner in McBee and later at the Health Center prior to constructing the current squad building. Prior to the ambulance, the only means of transport to the hospital was by personal vehicle or by the funeral home hearse, which had to come from Hartsville. Approximately one year later McBee and Jefferson split and formed their own respective squads and each purchased an ambulance.

In 1973, the town of McBee purchased a second engine for the McBee Fire Department. In 1986, Alligator Fire District was formed with McBee Fire Department.

===21st century===
In 2001, McBee celebrated its 100-year anniversary. In 2001 McBee Elementary School was re-modeled. Following the completion of the elementary school, in 2005 McBee High School also was re-modeled. In 2012 McBee built a recreational complex that consists of four baseball diamonds, a football field, a soccer field, a walking trail, and a practice football field. In 2013 McBee launched their official website. Nestle Waters of North American, completed their bottled water facility in 2016, creating 27 jobs in McBee.

<doc id="134449" wikidata="Q2025061" url="?curid=134449" title="Manning, South Carolina">
<text>Manning is a city in and the county seat of Clarendon County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 3,245 as of the 2010 census, with an estimated population in 2018 of 3,941. It was named after former South Carolina governor John Laurence Manning.

==History==
In 1855, the South Carolina Legislature appointed a group of commissioners to select and purchase a tract of land for &quot;the Village of Manning&quot; in the newly formed Clarendon County. According to the &quot;Watchmen&quot;, a local newspaper of the time, &quot;the Legislature (had) granted a bill of divorce between Clarendon and Claremont (Sumter).&quot;

Thirteen men were named as commissioners to select and acquire from on which to lay out the new courthouse village: R. C. Baker, L. F. Rhame, J. C. Brock, W. W. Owens, Joseph Sprott, J. C. Burgess, M. T. Brogdon, J. J. Nelson, Samuel A. Burgess, J. J. McFadden, Jesse Hill, R. R. Haynsworth, and P. S. Worsham. Five other commissioners, R. I. Manning, L. F. Rhame, J. B. Brogdon, J. J. Conyers, and William A. Burgess, were later named when it came time to erect the courthouse and jail from a state appropriation of $18,000, plus whatever funds might be realized from the sale of lots. The site for the village was presented to the state by Captain Joseph Copley Burgess, and the Plat of Manning was prepared and filed in Sumter County Courthouse. (Captain Burgess had also donated land for the courthouse and jail in Manning.) On the second Monday of the following October, the new district officers were elected, and Clarendon began to operate independently from Sumter District with Manning as its county seat.

The city was named for John Lawrence Manning, who was elected to both chambers in the General Assembly. He was later chosen by the Assembly to serve as Governor of South Carolina from 1852 to 1854. George Allen Huggins was the first &quot;intendant&quot; (mayor) of Manning.

Manning&#x27;s Post Office was established in 1856, and Thomas S. Coogler was appointed as the first Postmaster. Manning&#x27;s first library, the Hannah Levi Memorial Library, was completed in 1910. It was funded by the children of Moses and Hannah Levi, and by the sale of the Moses Levi Institute. They named it in honor of their mother. It eventually became known as the Manning Library and was the only public library in the county. It became a county library in 1976 and continued to operate until the opening of the Harvin Clarendon County Library in 1984. The building now houses the Clarendon County Archives and History Center.

Manning was severely damaged several times over its history. A large portion of the original town, including the courthouse, was destroyed in the Civil War in 1865 during what is known as &quot;Potter&#x27;s Raid&quot;. This raid by Union troops took place only a few days before Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox. Manning was later struck by a downtown fire in 1895 and damaged by a tornado in 1915.
Railroads, abundant timber and diverse agriculture allowed Manning to flourish during the late 19th century and into the 20th century. In 1933, Highway 4 was changed to U.S. Route 301 and thanks in part to the efforts of Manning resident W. P. Legg, Manning and Clarendon County became a preferred route of the Washington to Florida motorist. Manning is along the I-95 corridor and attracts retirees looking for various recreational activities and mild climates.

As early as 1960 Manning was one of many towns across the South for the staging of peaceful Civil Rights demonstrations and sit-ins. Unlike in some other areas, the demonstrations in Manning occurred without significant incident, but helped belie the local media&#x27;s message that black Carolinians accepted the status quo. Manning and the surrounding region was still adjusting to the decisions handed down in the &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; rulings against racial segregation in schools.

In 1969 Pansy Ridgeway became the first woman to be elected mayor of Manning. She served as mayor of Manning from 1970 to 1996 and was the third woman elected mayor in South Carolina and the first woman elected president of the South Carolina Municipal Association.

On April 5, 2022, an EF2 tornado caused considerable damage on the western and northwestern sides of towns. Many homes, businesses, garages, trees, power poles and lines, and vehicles were damaged, some heavily.

==Government==
The city government consists of a mayor and a city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council consists of six members who are elected from each of six districts.

Manning is represented in the South Carolina Senate by Kevin L. Johnson. It is part of South Carolina&#x27;s 6th congressional district which since January 1993 has been represented by Jim Clyburn.

==Media==
Manning is home to &quot;The Manning Times&quot; newspaper. It is published weekly and is updated online daily.

==Education==
The school district is Clarendon School District 2.

Manning maintained school systems, one for black students and one for whites until court-ordered integration caused Manning Training School (for blacks) to merge with all white Manning High School in 1970. At that time, Manning Training School became Manning Middle School, then later Manning Elementary. In response, a private school, Laurence Manning Academy was created. Manning is also the location of the F.E. DuBose Campus of Central Carolina Technical College.

Manning has a lending library, the Clarendon County Public Library.

==Geography==
Manning is located near the center of Clarendon County at (33.693998, -80.215408). It is just to the east of Interstate 95 and at the intersection of U.S. 301 and U.S. 521. Via I-95 it is northeast to Florence and southwest to Interstate 26. Interchanges for Manning along I-95 include US 301 (exit 115), South Carolina Highway 261 (exit 119) and US 521 (exit 122). US 301 leads northeast to Turbeville and southwest to Summerton, while US 521 leads northwest to Sumter and southeast to Greeleyville.

== History ==
Summerton&#x27;s history began &quot;circa&quot; 1830 to 1840. Plantation owners made their move inward to Summerton to escape from the mosquitos along the Santee River. It was thought of as a health resort and safe retreat from the &quot;malaria&quot; associated with the swamp. The town was officially chartered by the South Carolina legislative delegation on Christmas Eve, 1889.

Summerton is well known for the court case &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; (Court citation:347 US 483). &quot;Briggs&quot; was the first filed of the four court cases combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the famous case in which the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 officially overturned racial segregation in U.S. public schools. Summerton High School and Scott’s Branch High School were added to Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in 2022.

Despite the outcome of &quot;Briggs&quot; and &quot;Brown&quot;, as of 2004 Summerton&#x27;s schools remain effectively segregated, with nearly all white students now attending the private Clarendon Hall, leaving the public schools almost entirely African-American. As of 2004, 95% of public high school students at Scotts Branch High are black, despite 40% white population in the community.

Today, Summerton is still noted for being a summer retreat and vacation spot for visitors interested in nature and outdoor recreation activities, e.g. golf, fishing, hunting, boating, camping.

In 1840, Michael Turbeville bought of land one mile north of the present town limits in Diles Bay and built a home on this property. Sometime between 1870 and 1875, William J. Turbeville, son of Michael, purchased approximately from John McFaddin and built the first house in what is now the town of Turbeville. His brother, Clem, likewise bought land and built next to William. Since their land was substantially covered with large pine trees, the brothers built a turpentine still which they ran for about 20 years. They also built a large store where they carried on an extensive mercantile business for an even longer time. During those early years the community was known as &quot;Puddin&#x27; Swamp&quot;.

In 2016, the town gained notoriety for a civil suit brought against it. The suit alleges that the town&#x27;s &quot;town safety&quot; ordinances, which allows Turbeville to write traffic tickets with higher fines than state traffic tickets and keep the money from the citations, are illegal and should be repealed. The town reportedly has nearly twice the ticket rate of much larger nearby towns, writing nearly 2,500 per year, most of which come during prime beach season, as the town is on the major routes between Columbia and Myrtle Beach.

<text>Edisto Beach is a town in Colleton County, South Carolina, United States. Edisto Beach&#x27;s population was 414 as of the 2010 census, down from 641 in 2000. The town limits include only the developed coastal area of Edisto Island within Colleton County, while the majority of the island consists of unincorporated land in Charleston County. Due to its status as a bedroom community, Edisto Beach is among the most affluent communities in the state.

==History==
Edisto Beach was originally settled by the Edistow Indians, but was rediscovered by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Thereafter, commerce on the island began to develop. Rice and indigo were the most common crops during the early settlement years. Later, significant cotton plantations were built and flourished. This industry, fueled by rich land owners and the people they enslaved, prospered until the Civil War.

Although Union soldiers invaded Edisto and Johns Island, Confederate forces were able to retain control of Charleston until 1865, very late in the war.

Initial development was begun in the early 20th century and planned by the island&#x27;s owner, John McConkey. However, development stalled when he was murdered. By the 1920s, South Carolina residents began arriving on Edisto Island and Edisto Beach to build crude retreats. In those days, access to the island could be gained only at low tide by driving or riding across the marsh on beds of oyster shells.

Although most homes on the island were destroyed in the 1940s, Hurricane Hugo spared the island in 1989. It has since become a vacation destination, with a section of the island purchased by Wyndham Resorts in 2006 from Fairfield that included a restaurant and golf course. In 2012, Edisto held its first ever road race, attracting close to 200 runners, including the mayor.

Edisto is known for its low tourism and its industrial scarcity.

==Politics and government==

Edisto Beach is governed by a council–manager government. Under this style, the mayor and the mayor pro tem are elected from members of the town council.

At the state level, Edisto is represented by Republican George E. &quot;Chip&quot; Campsen III in the Senate and Democrat Michael F. Rivers Sr. in the House of Representatives.

<text>Walterboro is a city in Colleton County, South Carolina, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 5,398 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Colleton County. Walterboro is located west of Charleston and is located near the ACE Basin region in the South Carolina Lowcountry.

==History==

Walterboro (original spelling: Walterborough) was founded in 1783, as a summer retreat for local planters looking to escape their malaria-ridden, Lowcountry plantations. The original settlement was located on a hilly area, covered with pine and hickory trees and called Hickory Valley. Two of the earliest settlers were brothers, Paul and Jacob Walter. The brothers were prosperous, plantation owners, in nearby Jacksonboro. Paul&#x27;s small daughter Mary, was taken ill with malaria; a common disease among the families who had plantations in the marshy areas of the Lowcountry, due to the ground&#x27;s suitability for rice production. To prevent Mary from succumbing to the deadly microbe, the Walter brothers went looking for a healthier location in which to live during the summer months, and came to settle the town; with its later being named in their honor.

In 1817, Walterboro was designated as the third county seat of Colleton County, and has remained such through present-day. This designation was followed by, the construction of a county courthouse and county jail in 1821. The courthouse was designed by well-known architect Robert Mills. 

The town quickly spread from the original Hickory Valley location, after its population experienced a significant increase; this being fueled successively by, the town becoming the county seat in 1821, and the establishment of a railroad line that connected the city with Columbia and Charleston in the 1880s.

In 1832, the Irish Catholic community in rural southern Waltersboro (at one point termed Thompson&#x27;s Crossroads) established a parish called St. James the Greater Catholic Church, dedicated by Bishop John England. The community later was known as Catholic Hill. After the church was burned down in 1856, and the emancipation of the slaves roughly a decade later, the White community largely left the area. The Black Catholic community maintained their religion for decades without a priest, before a new church was built for them in the 1890s. They became notable in the media in the 21st century, and a documentary on the community was released in 2020.

An airfield was established in the 1930s. In 1942, Walterboro became home to the Walterboro Army Airfield, a sub-base of Columbia Army Air Base, and part of the national network of army air training facilities erected across the U.S. during World War II. The base was established for the purpose of providing advanced air-combat training, to fighter and bomber groups. It also hosted the largest camouflage school in the United States, as well as, a 250-person prisoner of war camp. 

In 1944, the airfield changed command and became an advanced combat training base for individual fighters, primarily the black trainees graduating from Tuskegee Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama. Over 500 of the famed Tuskegee Airmen trained at Walterboro Army Airfield, between April 1944 and October 1945, including individuals training as replacement pilots for the 332nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, along with the entire 447th Bombardment Group. The base closed in October 1945, returning to its origins as a local airfield.

The establishment of Interstate 95 in the 1960s, made the town a prime overnight stop on the road to Florida or New York.

Presently, Walterboro is dotted with historic homes dating back to 1820, and a downtown area that has kept many of its historic buildings. The city has become increasingly known as an antiquing destination, and is a popular day-trip from Charleston and Beaufort.

==History==

===Early history===
Darlington&#x27;s origins date back to the mid-18th century.

Originally a heavily wooded area, the settlement of what is now Darlington County began in earnest after 1736 and 1737 when the province of South Carolina set aside a vast area of land for the Welsh Baptists of Delaware. This Welsh Tract bordered both sides of the Pee Dee River. For almost thirty years, settlers concentrated on the banks and small tributaries of the Pee Dee River. Beginning in the 1760s, and continuing into the 1770s, other groups slowly made their way into present-day Darlington, and were granted lands on the Lynches River, Jeffries Creek, and a host of other watercourses. These settlers included descendants of French Huguenots, Scots-Irish, and the English.

For 30 years following the arrival of the first settlers, local government did not exist for the citizens of the area. All deeds, estate settlements, and other legal matters had to be taken to Charles Town to be recorded. In 1769, by an Act of the Assembly, Cheraw District was established as a Judicial District. A courthouse and jail were built at Long Bluff (near present-day Society Hill), and were operational by late 1772.

After the Revolutionary War, in 1785, Cheraw District was divided into three counties, Marlborough, Chesterfield, and Darlington. Darlington County was bounded by the Pee Dee River), Lynches River, and Cedar Creek. To this day it is unknown why the county was named &quot;Darlington&quot;, although it could be named after the town of the same name in County Durham, England. After 1798 the designation &quot;county&quot; was changed to &quot;district&quot;. In 1835, the city of Darlington became the new county seat. In the 1868 South Carolina Constitution, the designation reverted to &quot;county&quot;.

Florence County was created out of parts of Darlington and Marion counties in 1888. Darlington County gave up additional territory in 1902 when Lee County was created.

===Darlington Courthouse and Public Square===
Darlington was originally built around the public square and the courthouse. Both now sit in their present location because of an argument between two men, Colonel Lamuel Benton and Captain Elias Dubose, in the late 18th century. The tale goes that the disagreement began over whether the courthouse should be located in Mechanicsville or Cuffey Town. It was said that the two compromised, each beginning in their town traveling on horseback until reaching one another. The spot where they met is now the site of the Darlington public square and courthouse. A fire in March 1806 destroyed the original courthouse. It was rumored at the time that an old woman was responsible for the flames in an attempt to burn papers connected to her coming court case. Between 1824 and 1825 it was rebuilt with brick due to a petition to build all buildings on the public square in brick to prevent the spread of fire. In 1835, the courthouse was chartered.

===Historic sites===
The Cashua Street-Spring Street Historic District, Julius A. Dargan House, Darlington Downtown Historic District, Darlington Industrial Historic District, Darlington Memorial Cemetery, Dove Dale, First Baptist Church, Nelson Hudson House, Manne Building, Clarence McCall House, Charles S. McCullough House, Oaklyn Plantation, St. John&#x27;s Historic District, South Carolina Western Railway Station, West Broad Street Historic District, Wilds-Edwards House, and Mrs. B.F. Williamson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Early churches===
In the 1820s, denominations, mostly the Baptists, met at the courthouse. The Presbyterians built the first church. With the help of donations from all denominations, the church was built with the understanding that all denominations could have access to the building. The Baptists built their church in 1831, which had been planned since 1829. The Methodists built the third church in 1834, where the Methodist Cemetery is now located. The present-day Trinity United Methodist Church sanctuary was constructed in 1901. New Providence Baptist Church is the oldest Baptist church in the city of Darlington.

===The Civil War===
No battles during the Civil War occurred in Darlington. One of Sherman&#x27;s lieutenants, a former architect, was sent to burn down part of Darlington. When he arrived and saw a house that he had designed, he left the house and the rest of the town standing. The federal troops burned down the depot, cotton platforms and railroad trestles in 1865. During this time, St. John&#x27;s Academy was used as a hospital. Federal troops also did some foraging. In 1865, Confederate troops returned through Darlington and hanged a former slave named Amy Spain on the Public Square for insurrection. After the war, the town was occupied by federal troops, which were not withdrawn until 1871. By 1865, Darlington was the headquarters for the Third Separate Brigade of the Military District of Eastern South Carolina and the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. In 1866, during the occupation, the worst fire to ever hit Darlington burned down the courthouse and the jail. It was rumored that drunken federal soldiers were to blame.

===The Darlington Guards===
Prior to the Civil War, as the South readied itself for secession, Darlington formed the Darlington Guards. When South Carolina seceded, they were the first called upon to defend Charleston. After their term of enlistment was over, the men returned to Darlington to reenlist in regiments going to Virginia. The Darlington Guards existed at this time for almost two years. They reorganized in later years and received their own armory in 1893. They were the first in the state to volunteer for the Spanish–American War in May 1898. They were also seen by President William McKinley in Savannah, Georgia, before being sent to Cuba for occupation duties near Havana. After coming home, they continued to serve in the National Guard. In 1915 the group retired from service again, only to be reinstated and sent to the Mexican border in 1916. After returning home, they served in World War I. The last surviving member, Thomas W. Buchanan, died in 1984.

Most years have no snow accumulation due to the mild temperatures and cold temperatures are associated with dry weather. In spite of this, Darlington has occasionally recorded some minor inches of depth during brief snowfalls.

In 1818, Darlington&#x27;s growth proved time to build a school. The first schoolhouse opened was named The Darlington Academy. In 1860, the name was changed to St. John&#x27;s Academy. This building served educational purposes, as well as the site for fund-raising and the lottery. St. John&#x27;s Academy was later renamed St. John&#x27;s High School. Later during renovation, St. John&#x27;s Elementary School was added, followed by the move to a new school in 1977. It was renamed Darlington High School, when it was integrated with Mayo High School in 1995.

Darlington was mentioned in the Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Darlington County&quot;, off his 1984 album &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;

Darlington is the home of Rawls 7, a &quot;touchman&quot; or information broker, in William F. Nolan&#x27;s 1977 science fiction novel &quot;Logan&#x27;s World,&quot; a sequel to &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run.&quot;

A 2012 article in &quot;Small Wars Journal&quot; explored a hypothetical military operation in which an extremist group sympathetic to the Tea Party movement takes over Darlington and clashes with federal troops. Conservative groups criticized the article, suggesting it reflected misplaced priorities.

The town plays a major role in the season 2 episode &quot;The Darlington 500&quot; of the NBC series &quot;Timeless&quot;. In the episode, Lucy, Wyatt, and Rufus travel to September 4, 1955, to stop a Rittenhouse agent from destroying the Darlington 500 with a bomb, which would allow Rittenhouse to take over the American automobile industry.

<text>Hartsville is the largest city in Darlington County, South Carolina, United States. It was chartered on December 11, 1891. The population was 7,764 at the 2010 census. Hartsville was chosen as an All-America City in 1996 and again in 2016. Hartsville has also been a National Arbor Day Foundation Tree City since 1986.

Hartsville is home of Coker University and a branch of Florence–Darlington Technical College. It is also the home of the South Carolina Governor&#x27;s School for Science and Mathematics, a public boarding high school.

The city is served by the Hartsville Regional Airport.

Hartsville is home to several major corporations including Sonoco Products Company, Duke Energy&#x27;s H. B. Robinson Nuclear Generating Station, Novolex, and Stingray Boats.

==History==
The area surrounding Hartsville was once home to several Native American tribes, including the Pee Dee, Catawba, Chicora, Edisto, Sane, and Chicora-Waccamaw, who inhabited the region until European settlers arrived.

Hartsville&#x27;s first settlement began around 1760. The town is named for Captain Thomas E. Hart, who eventually owned most of the land in the community. Hart started a successful mercantile business, but lost his business and his land during the economic depression of 1837–1838.

In 1845, Thomas Hart&#x27;s son, John Lide Hart, purchased of land in what is now downtown Hartsville from Colonel Law. John Hart went on to establish a carriage factory, steam-powered saw mill, grist mill, general store, and Hartsville Baptist Church. Caleb Coker purchased the carriage factory for his son James Lide Coker in 1855.

James Lide Coker came to Hartsville in 1857 with plans to implement new farming methods he had learned at Harvard College. This was interrupted by the start of the Civil War, in which he became a major for the Confederacy. He returned to Hartsville injured and found that his plantation was in shambles. He planned to reconstruct his plantation and bring prosperity to the town of Hartsville. Major Coker established Welsh Neck High School, which later became Coker University. He also established a seed company, oil mill, fertilizer plant, the Coker and Company General Store, a bank, and the Southern Novelty Company, now known as Sonoco Products Company. Even with his own successes in business, Coker and his family were unable to convince other business owners in the area to build a railroad spur, so they decided to build their own, which became the Hartsville Railroad, completed in 1889.

The Town of Hartsville received its first charter on December 11, 1891, during a period of bustling economic activity and growth.

The railroad eventually became part of the South Carolina Central Railroad, and the Southern Novelty Company and Carolina Fiber Company merged to form Sonoco Products Company. Sonoco eventually expanded to a global scale and became a Fortune 500 company.

<text>Dillon is a city in Dillon County in eastern South Carolina, United States.
It is the county seat and largest city of Dillon County. It was established on December 22, 1888. Both the name of the city and county comes from James W. Dillon, an early settler and key figure in bringing a railroad through the area. The population was 6,788 in the 2010 U.S. census.

==History==
The County was founded in 1910 from a portion of Marion County. The County and the City of Dillon are named for prosperous local citizen James W. Dillon (1826−1913), an Irishman who settled there and led a campaign to bring the railroad into the community. The result of this effort was the construction of the Wilson Short Cut Railroad, which later became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, and which brought greater prosperity to the area by directly linking Dillon County to the national network of railroads.
For many decades, residents of Dillon County were farmers growing cotton and tobacco. Timber harvesting remains a major industry in the County.
Dillon County has seen a growth in manufacturing and distribution centers over the past 20 years due in part to Interstate 95 which runs through the County north-south.

Dillon was once known as &quot;The &quot;Wedding Capital of the East&quot; because South Carolina allowed people as young as 14 to get married and did not have other requirements. Many couples who got married there went to South of the Border for their honeymoons.

==Geography==

Interstate 95 passes northeast of the city, with access from Exits 190 and 193. I-95 leads northeast to Lumberton, North Carolina, and southwest to Florence. South Carolina Highway 9 passes through the center of town, leading northwest to Bennettsville and southeast to Lake View. South Carolina Highway 57 follows SC 9 through Dillon but leads north to the North Carolina border and south to Mullins. SC 9 and 57 follow Main Street southeast out of town. South Carolina Highway 34 follows Main Street northwest out of town, leading west to Darlington.

<text>Latta is a town in Dillon County, South Carolina, United States. Latta is the second most populous town in Dillon County. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 1,379.

==History==
Latta was established in 1887. The town arose from a need for a railroad, which helped to eliminate &quot;the need to travel to Wilmington, North Carolina, in order to reach many points in South Carolina.&quot; Thus, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad built two depots; one in the city of Dillon and the other to the south in Latta. The depots were completed in 1888. Many families were drawn to this area, and in March 1890, &quot;the town of Latta was incorporated by the state legislature and received its charter.&quot;

The town was named for the Latta family of settlers. More specifically, it was named after Captain Robert Latta, who was from York County, South Carolina; he orchestrated the engineering for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Captain Latta not only surveyed the area for the railroad, but he also constructed the original plans for the town of Latta. Because of Latta&#x27;s railroad facilities, the town grew rapidly, especially from 1900 to 1910.

Latta has an established historic district, mostly located on Main Street, and many of these structures are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Latta has about 55 properties, constructed between ca. 1890 and ca. 1930, that are a part of the historic district. Furthermore, Latta is home to one of the 13 Carnegie public library buildings in South Carolina. The Latta library opened in 1914 and is &quot;one of five of South Carolina&#x27;s original 14 Carnegie libraries still in use as a library.&quot; The post office in Latta has been in operation since 1888.

In April 2014, Mayor Earl Bullard fired Police Chief Crystal Moore, allegedly because Moore is lesbian. Bullard said on the telephone, &quot;I would much rather have — and I will say this to anybody&#x27;s face — somebody who drank and drank too much taking care of my child than I had somebody whose lifestyle is questionable around children. … I&#x27;m not going to let two women stand up there and hold hands and let my child be aware of it. And I&#x27;m not going to see them do it with two men neither.&quot;

In June 2014, Latta residents voted in favor of changing from a &quot;strong mayor&quot; government to a &quot;strong council&quot; government, which allowed the town council to reinstate Crystal Moore as Latta&#x27;s police chief, which they did unanimously on June 28, 2014.

In the mid-1980s, town leaders wanted to create a yearly festival for the city. After reviewing possible ideas, local grocery store owner John Walters discovered from contacts at Quaker Oats that the upper part of Dorchester County (where Saint George is located) consumes more grits per capita than any other place in the world. In 1986, the first annual World Grits Festival was held. During the festival, which takes place in mid-April, close to 10,000 people flock to the tiny town for food, music, and games. Until 2019, the festival featured a contest in which people rolled in a vat of grits, vying to have the largest quantity of grits (by weight) stick to them. The festival is held annually; it was not held in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic but returned in 2022.

<text>Edgefield is a town in and the county seat of Edgefield County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 4,750 at the 2010 census.

Edgefield is part of the Augusta Metropolitan Area.

==Geography==
Edgefield is located slightly east of the center of Edgefield County at (33.7868, -81.9278). U.S. Route 25 passes through the southwest part of the town, bypassing the center, and leads north to Greenwood and south to Augusta, Georgia. South Carolina Highway 23 passes through the center of the town, leading east to Batesburg-Leesville and west to Modoc on U.S. Route 221 near the Savannah River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Edgefield has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.71%, is water.

==History==

The story of Edgefield is more than a quarter of a millennium long, reaching back to before the first European settlers arrived, when only Native Americans roamed the forests. At that time the area which later became Edgefield County was a vast wilderness of virgin forests, occasional prairies, great cane brakes, and sparkling rivers and creeks. It was bisected by the fall line, with sandy soils on the southeast side of this line growing primarily pine trees, and rich clay soils on the northwest side growing primarily oak and hickory. Wildlife was abundant with deer and turkey, but also with elk, buffalo (bison), panther, and bear.

===18th century===
The initial settlement of present-day Edgefield County occurred in the quarter century between 1750 and 1775. Some settlers came up from the South Carolina Lowcountry but more poured down &quot;the Great Wagon Road&quot; from the colonies to the north. In this colonial period the economy was primarily a subsistence one, in which the settlers consumed what they raised. Initially there were no courts or law enforcement, but beginning in the mid-1760s, the law-abiding settlers began their struggle to bring law, order, and government to the &quot;backcountry&quot; of South Carolina.

The colonial period was followed by the prolonged conflict with Great Britain which began in 1775. By this time there were many settlers living in present-day Edgefield County and almost all of them were involved, on one side or the other, in the Revolutionary War. Some Edgefieldians were die-hard patriots from the outset, who believed that the American colonies should be free and independent. Others were loyal to the king who had granted them land and provided a home for them in the New World. Still others wanted no part of the conflict but were inevitably drawn into it by partisans on each side. Finally, others were strictly opportunists who switched sides back and forth as they perceived their best interest. The conflict was, in this area, a bitter civil war in which personal vendettas often superseded politics as the cause for fighting. Cousins fought against cousins and neighbors against neighbors. When General Lighthorse Harry Lee later wrote about the Revolution in this area, he stated that &quot;in no part of the South was the war fought with such asperity as in this quarter. It often sank into barbarity.&quot;

Following the Revolution, citizens turned their attention to establishing local government and to rebuilding the economy. In 1788 the 96 District was divided into smaller counties. The boundaries of Edgefield County were established at that time and the courthouse site was designated. Although a substantial but unsuccessful effort was made in the late 1780s to bring tobacco to Edgefield County as a money crop, short staple cotton began to assume that role in the late 1790s. For the next two decades the cultivation of cotton spread like wildfire across the county. The rich clay soils of the piedmont proved ideal for growing cotton. African slaves were brought in to provide the labor for cotton cultivation, resulting in a mushrooming of the slave population of Edgefield County. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Edgefield County, like most of piedmont South Carolina, began to experience unprecedented prosperity.

===19th century (antebellum period)===
With the construction of the jail and courthouse at the designated county seat beginning in 1785, a village began to grow up around the public buildings: first houses for the public officials, then a tavern, then a store, gradually other houses, and then other stores. By 1811 a school was established, then several churches and more houses. By 1826 South Carolina architect Robert Mills could describe Edgefield Courthouse village as &quot;a neat little village ... [with] between forty and fifty [houses]. The buildings are neat, commodious, and generally painted . ... The population is estimated at 300.&quot;

In the antebellum era, Edgefield was not the market town of the District. In the Plantation economy, the plantation owners took their cotton to market in Augusta or Hamburg and bought the majority of their supplies from merchants in those market towns. The merchants of Edgefield Courthouse village primarily filled in the needs of the planters between trips to the larger market towns.

During the first several decades of the 19th century, Edgefield, being the courthouse village of a large and prosperous district, began to develop its reputation as a center of law and politics. A number of the sons of the wealthy cotton planters and other ambitious young men, after attending elite schools and colleges across the nation, came to Edgefield to practice law and engage in politics. Many of these young lawyers and politicians also maintained large plantations out in the District. These budding leaders built substantial houses in town and created a social atmosphere which attracted more similarly-situated young men.

The social prestige of being a planter with broad acres and many slaves, and dabbling in law and politics, caused many ambitious young Edgefieldians in the antebellum period to develop a self-confidence, an overdeveloped sense of honor, and an aristocratic worldview which did not always serve them well. One result of this was a widespread devotion to the Code Duello, which resulted in a number of Edgefield&#x27;s best and brightest becoming involved in tragic duels. Another result was a sense of invincibility, which caused many to approach war with a cavalier attitude and to focus on the glories of victory rather than on the horrors of death and defeat. These young men also accepted violence, which had been a common occurrence in Edgefield from its earliest days, as an inevitable part of life, and in some cases even glorified it. Edgefield had a &quot;violent reputation&quot;. &quot;Since before Edgefield was officially a town, it has been known for violence and scandal.&quot;

While planting, politics, and violence captured the imagination of most white Edgefieldians, a number of other bright young men looked for opportunities in industry and commerce. Dr. Abner Landrum developed a pottery industry which was to have a major impact on Edgefield for more than half a century. Henry Schultz, a German immigrant, developed Hamburg, a new town on the Savannah River, which became an important commercial center during the antebellum era. Another German immigrant, Christian Breithaupt, built the first textile mill in this part of the state at Vaucluse. A number of Edgefieldians participated in bringing the South Carolina Railroad to Hamburg. The Plank Road from Edgefield to Hamburg was built. William Gregg, a Charleston silversmith, came to run the Vaucluse factory and wound up developing the Graniteville factory, the most successful textile operation in the antebellum South. These industrial and commercial enterprises were a significant part of the fabric of antebellum Edgefield and a number of the Edgefield lawyers and planters were involved in these endeavors.

However, the most significant contribution of antebellum Edgefield to our nation&#x27;s history was the intense sectionalism which began in the mid-1820s and evolved to 1860. Edgefield Congressman George McDuffie (later Senator and Governor) initiated the fight against federal tariffs which were imposed on imported goods to protect New England manufacturers. He believed that the interests of this section of the country were being sacrificed for the good of New England.

McDuffie, together with South Carolina statesman John C. Calhoun, developed the doctrine of &quot;nullification&quot;, which postulated that a state had the right to nullify a federal law with which it disagreed. This doctrine was put to a test in 1832. South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification, and President Andrew Jackson threatened to send troops to the state to enforce the tariff. Edgefieldians, like most South Carolinians, reacted violently to the President&#x27;s threats. Militia units were called up and the state braced for war. A national crisis was averted only by a last minute compromise that gradually reduced the tariffs.

Later, as the anti-slavery movement gained momentum and began to threaten the economic basis of the South&#x27;s prosperity, most white Edgefieldians, like most white South Carolinians, embraced this sectionalism. National unity was again threatened in 1850 when many leaders throughout the South began to speak of secession. The 1856 caning of Senator Charles Sumner by Edgefield Congressman Preston Brooks on the floor of the United States Senate galvanized the nation and set South Carolina on a course for secession and Civil War. By the fall of 1860 when Abraham Lincoln was elected President, all but a few Edgefield citizens were convinced that the time had come for the South to go its own way. A convention was called and Edgefield&#x27;s delegation joined in the unanimous declaration of secession.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
At the outbreak of war in April 1861, the vast majority of Edgefieldians welcomed the conflict, believing that they would defeat the North in short order and the risk of slavery being outlawed would be eliminated. Hundreds of Edgefieldians volunteered for service and were quickly sent to Virginia to take on the federal forces. Little did they realize the sacrifices which they would make during the ensuing four years. Before the war was over almost every Edgefield male between the ages of 15 and 60 had been involved in some way in the war effort. Although the war never got closer than Aiken (Edgefieldians have always claimed that Sherman was afraid to come to Edgefield!), the people of Edgefield endured four bloody years in which nearly one-third of their fighting age white males became casualties. The incalculable devastation of the war is hard to comprehend. Almost all the liquid assets of the citizens had been invested in Confederate currency or bonds which were now worthless. The emancipation of the slaves wiped out a huge portion of the county&#x27;s wealth, and giving them the right to vote brought an almost total reorganization of the political, economic, and social systems.

During the eleven-year period of Reconstruction, the newly freed slaves, called &quot;freedmen&quot;, became sharecroppers, farming the land on shares with the landowners. They also acquired the right to vote and hold office. Together with &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; (Northerners who had come South seeking opportunities) and &quot;scalawags&quot; (Southern anti-slavery whites who had joined the Republican Party), the white population lost their control of local and state government. Intimidated by the occupying Federal troops, the white population were militarily and politically dominated by what they perceived as corrupt Republican administrations imposed upon them by force by their Northern enemies.

The Red Shirt Campaign of 1876, largely orchestrated by the former Confederate generals Martin W. Gary and M. C. Butler of Edgefield, was a massive organized effort on the part of the white population to regain control of the political machinery of the state. Violence was a calculated part of the strategy to remove Republican dominance. The Freedmen and their Republican allies tried valiantly to maintain their political control in the face of the fierce campaign by the former Confederates. By the middle of 1877 the Red Shirt strategy, along with an increasing willingness on the part of the rest of the nation to allow the South to go forward on its own terms, proved successful in bringing the control of the state back into the hands of the white population. In the ensuing decades the black population of Edgefield, like that of the entire South, was thrust back into second-class citizenship by the persistent efforts of the whites who were determined to see that the conditions of Reconstruction were never allowed to return.

===Later 19th century===
One of the principal results of the breakdown of the antebellum plantation system was that goods were no longer purchased centrally by the planters and then parceled out during the year, but rather freedmen and other small farmers purchased their own goods as they saw fit. This, together with the proliferation of manufactured consumer goods in the late 19th century, led to the development of a vigorous commercial economy in which every town and every crossroads sprouted new merchants. These new merchants, who often used questionable practices to benefit themselves at the expense of their customers, enjoyed a long period of prosperity.

During this period the village of Edgefield suffered a series of fires which destroyed practically all of the commercial area of the town except for the courthouse. In 1881 and 1884 the entire eastern and northern portions of the town were laid waste in devastating fires. In 1892 the southern and western sides of the Public Square were burned. A town ordinance was passed in 1884 requiring that all new buildings constructed within 500 feet of the town square be built of brick. It was from the ashes of these tragic fires that most of the current buildings of the town were raised. Prosperous merchants and other town leaders built new stores and, in many cases, they built grandly. The commercial district around the public square and down Main Street began to take shape.

The continuing development of railroads, such as the Charlotte, Columbia, and Augusta Railroad, built through the eastern part of the county in the late 1860s and the Augusta and Greenwood Railroad built through the western part of the county in the 1880s, resulted in the development of numerous railroad depot towns, including Ridge Spring, Ward, Johnston, Trenton, Clark&#x27;s Hill, Modoc, Parksville, Plum Branch and McCormick. These new towns took on a prosperity of their own and began to sap commercial activity which might otherwise have come to Edgefield.

During this same period, the movement to bring government closer to the people resulted in the creation of a number of new counties, four of which took substantial portions of Edgefield. Aiken County was created in 1871; Saluda in 1895; Greenwood in 1897; and McCormick in 1916. Edgefield County, the area serviced by the Courthouse Village, was reduced in size to just over a quarter of what it had been.

The county&#x27;s agricultural economy began to suffer in the 1880s. The combination of a dramatic increase in the production of cotton, the continued depletion of the rich soils of the piedmont regions of the county, and other general economic ills which were also affecting farmers throughout the nation, made farming increasingly difficult. One Edgefield farmer decided to do something about these problems. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, believing that the state&#x27;s political leaders were not doing enough to help the farmers, instigated the farmers’ revolt, got himself elected Governor in 1890, and turned out of office the old guard of the state, including the principal leaders of the 1876 Red Shirt Campaign.

===20th century===
In the thirty-odd year period from the late 1880s through the early 1920s a number of positive developments took place in Edgefield. The railroad finally reached Edgefield, the first telephone was installed, the Edgefield Mill was constructed, the first automobile came to town, electrical power was installed, water and sewer systems were built, a new hotel was constructed, and the streets around the town square were paved. As World War I proceeded, cotton prices shot up and a general prosperity prevailed. The town&#x27;s population had exploded, going from approximately 500 in 1880 to 2,500 by 1920. Edgefield, it seemed, was finally getting back on its economic feet.

Unfortunately, beginning in 1921 and 1922, the boll weevil, which had come from Central America and had been marching across the South since the turn of the century, finally arrived in Edgefield County, devastating the cotton crop on which the economy was almost entirely based. Farmers saw their production of cotton plummet by as much as 90 percent. Lands which had been devoted to cotton for more than a century were allowed to go idle. Sharecroppers, no longer able to make a living, left the farms and many left the state. Throughout the 1920s farm incomes sank; merchants, unable to collect accounts from destitute farmers, were squeezed; banks failed. Then, when it seemed as if economic conditions could not get worse, the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression further impoverished the county. The population of Edgefield County began to decline and continued to decline in every census from 1920 to 1970.

World War II brought changes of other kinds. Young men throughout the county entered the service. A number of Edgefield families contributed multiple sons to the war effort. Former State Senator and Circuit Judge Strom Thurmond, West Side native J. L. Doolittle, Trenton native Fritz Huiet and Johnston native Robert Herlong all participated in the Normandy invasion. Women back home took on jobs which had traditionally been held by men. Rationing significantly affected everyone who remained in town.

After the war, the soldiers returning brought back with them a new confidence and an ambition to improve the county. A well-organized effort to bring new industry to Edgefield enjoyed moderate success as the Crest Manufacturing Company was brought to town in the late 1940s. The neighboring town of Johnston was more successful as it secured both the Milliken and Riegel plants during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s Edgefield added to its list of new industrial recruits the National Cabinet Company, Star Fibers, Federal Pacific Electric, and Tranter, each bringing a substantial number of new jobs. During this same period, farmers on the eastern side of the county began to expand their production of peaches which, by the 1960s, had become nationally significant.

African-American soldiers had also fought valiantly in World War II, and when they returned, they came with a determination to improve their status in American society. A sustained campaign for Civil Rights developed at a national level in the late 1940s. The primary focus of this campaign was to overturn the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, legitimized by the 1896 &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; decision of the United States Supreme Court. In 1954 the court, in its unanimous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, reversed the earlier decision and ruled that segregated facilities, even if equal, were unconstitutional.

The late 1960s and the early 1970s brought other new developments to Edgefield: a new water line capable of supplying the county for decades to come, a new country club, a new private school, a new county hospital, the National Wild Turkey Federation headquarters, and a new congressman, Butler C. Derrick, Jr.

Edgefield has rich clay deposits which provide the source for alkaline-glazed stoneware pottery which was developed by Dr. Abner Landrum in the early 19th century. The enslaved potter David Drake, who produced many large storage jars and other vessels between 1830 and 1870, was literate, inscribed and signed some of his work, and became more widely known more than a century after his death. Unsigned pottery from kilns in Pottersville and Edgefield today are known by the names of their owners; the artists were largely undocumented.

The upland area also was developed for cotton plantations, after invention of the cotton gin made growing short-staple cotton profitable. Several mansions and a plantation have been preserved from this era: Blocker House, Cedar Grove, Darby Plantation, and together with the Edgefield Historic District, Horn Creek Baptist Church, and Pottersville, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Murphys Estates (also commonly known as Murphy Village) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Edgefield County, South Carolina, part of the larger Augusta metropolitan area. The population was 1,719 as of the 2020 census. The community is notable for having the largest number of Irish Traveller Americans in the United States.

==Geography==
Murphys Estates is located along the southern border of Edgefield County at (33.594591, -81.940999).

== Culture ==

=== Irish Traveller community ===
Having emigrated from Ireland to various parts of the United States, a large number of Catholic Travellers began to congregate at the Parish of Our Lady of Peace in North Augusta after its construction in 1948. The church&#x27;s Irish priest, Rev. Fr. Joseph John Murphy, encouraged the Travellers to settle to the north of North Augusta, and so the community of Murphy Village was formed during the 1960s and 1970s. St. Edward Catholic Church was constructed in Murphy Village in 1964 to serve the Travellers.

In the 2020 census, 7.1% of the population of Murphys Estates listed their ancestry as &#x27;Irish&#x27;, the largest ancestry group reported in the CDP; however, the total number of Travellers has been estimated at 1,500.

<text>Winnsboro is a town in Fairfield County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 3,550 at the 2010 census. The population was 3,215 at the 2020 census, a population decrease of approximately 9.5% for the same 10 year period. It is the county seat of Fairfield County. Winnsboro is part of the Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan Area as well as a suburb of Columbia.

==History==
Based on archeological evidence, this area of the Piedmont was occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples from as early as the Archaic period, about 1500 BC. Blair Mound is a nearby archeological site and earthwork likely occupied 1300-1400 AD, as part of the late Mississippian culture in the region.
Several years before the Revolutionary War, Richard Winn from Virginia moved to what is now Fairfield County in the upland or Piedmont area of South Carolina. His lands included the present site of Winnsboro. As early as 1777, the settlement was known as &quot;Winnsborough&quot; since he was the major landowner. His brothers John and Minor Winn joined him there, adding to family founders.

The village was laid out and chartered in 1785 upon petition of Richard and John Winn, and John Vanderhorst. The brothers Richard, John and Minor Winn all served in the Revolutionary War. Richard became a general, and was said to have fought in more battles than any Whig in South Carolina. John gained the rank of colonel. See Fairfield County, South Carolina, for more.

The area was developed for the cultivation of short-staple cotton after Eli Whitney&#x27;s invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which made processing of this type of cotton profitable. Previously it was considered too labor-intensive. Short-staple cotton was widely cultivated on plantations in upland areas throughout the Deep South, through an interior area that became known as the Black Belt. The increased demand for slave labor resulted in the forced migration of more than one million African-American slaves into the area through sales in the domestic slave market. By the time of the Civil War, the county&#x27;s population was majority black and majority slave.

Textile mills were constructed in the area beginning in the late 19th century, and originally only whites were allowed to work in the mills. &quot;Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues&quot;, an industrial folk song of the 1930s with lyrics typical of the blues, refers to working in a cotton mill in this city. The song arose after the textile mill had been converted to a tire manufacturing plant, reflecting the widespread expansion of the auto industry. The song has been sung by Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, and other artists. It was the basis of one of the ballads by modernist composer/pianist Frederic Rzewski in his &quot;Four North American Ballads&quot; for solo piano, completed in 1979.

Places listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Winnsboro range from an Archaic period archeological site, to structures and districts spanning the European-American/African-American history of the city, as in the following list: Albion, Balwearie, Blair Mound, Dr. Walter Brice House and Office, Concord Presbyterian Church, Furman Institution Faculty Residence, Hunstanton, Ketchin Building, Bob Lemmon House, Liberty Universalist Church and Feasterville Academy Historic District, McMeekin Rock Shelter, Mount Olivet Presbyterian Church, New Hope A.R.P. Church and Session House, Old Stone House, Rockton and Rion Railroad Historic District, Rural Point, Shivar Springs Bottling Company Cisterns, The Oaks, Tocaland, White Oak Historic District, and the Winnsboro Historic District.

<text>Florence is a city in and the county seat of Florence County, South Carolina, United States. It lies at the intersection of Interstates 20 and 95 and is the eastern terminus of the former. It is the primary city within the Florence metropolitan area. The area forms the core of the historical Pee Dee region of South Carolina, which includes the eight counties of northeastern South Carolina, along with sections of southeastern North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 39,899, making it the 10th-most populous city in the state.

Florence is one of the major cities in South Carolina. In 1965, Florence was named an All-American City, presented by the National Civic League. The city was founded as a railroad hub and became the junction of three major railroad systems, including the Wilmington and Manchester, the Northeastern, and the Cheraw and Darlington.

==History==
The City of Florence was chartered in 1871 by the Reconstruction government and incorporated in 1890 following the 1888 creation of Florence County. Prior to its charter, the city was part of one of the original townships laid out by the Lords Proprietors in 1719. The area was gradually settled through the late 19th and early 20th century. Early settlers practiced subsistence farming and produced indigo, cotton, naval stores and timber, which were shipped down the Great Pee Dee River to the port at Georgetown and exported. In the mid-19th century two intersecting railroads were built, the Wilmington and Manchester, and the Northeastern. General William Harllee, the president of the W &amp; M, built his home at the junction, and named the community &quot;Florence&quot;, after his daughter.

===American Civil War===
During the Civil War, the town was an important supply and railroad repair center for the Confederacy, and the site of the Florence Stockade, which held between 12,000 and 18,000 Union prisoners of war. Over 2,800 prisoners died of disease and were buried there. The burial ground adjacent to the prison became the Florence National Cemetery after the war and now has expanded.

===Early 20th century===
After the war, Florence grew and prospered, using the railroad to supply its cotton, timber, and by the turn of the century, tobacco. During the 20th century the economy of Florence came to rely heavily on the healthcare industry, driven by two major hospitals and a number of pharmaceutical plants. Industry grew, especially after World War II, when Florence became increasingly known for textiles, pharmaceuticals, paper, and manufacturing, in addition to agricultural products.

Florence also has a budding theater scene, starting with creating the Community Players in 1923. Over the years, the theater troop had several names, such as the Pinewood Plays, the Little Theater Guild, and eventually, the Florence Little Theater Guild. After a fire that took their original performance home at the Pinewood Club, the troop used spaces like the YMCA, high school gyms, and the Army Air Base movie house to perform. In 1968 the first Florence Little Theater was built, but in 2008, they built a new Florence Little Theater due to a need for more space where it is still being used. In 2023 the Florence Little Theater celebrated 100 years of performances opening with The Sound of Music. 

===Downtown revitalization===
In 2010, the city of Florence began a massive redevelopment of Downtown Florence. The city has completed several notable projects and has several more planned. The Downtown Redevelopment District was originally a seventy square block area encompassing some in the heart of the City of Florence, but now has added over 100 more acres of the Timrod Park area with its historic homes. The redevelopment of Florence has even created a new branding effort, to include new city department logos (not to be confused with the city seal) way finding signs and repainting of water towers.

The historic downtown district running from the central business district toward the McLeod Medical Center, features a number of historic buildings that have been rehabilitated. The redevelopment started with the $18 million Drs. Bruce and Lee Foundation Library, and today now has the new Florence Little Theater, some 60 new apartments and the Francis Marion University Performing Arts Center which opened in September 2011, as well the new Florence Museum of Art, Science &amp; History which opened October 11, 2014. New office space has emerged from once abandoned buildings, and a police substation was added on once crime-ridden Dargan Street.

Special efforts are being aimed at the downtown area, which was once the center of the city&#x27;s activity but remains dormant after retailers and shoppers left for suburban malls. The goal is to re-establish Evans as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and five blocks of Evans Street will be streetscaped.

<text>Johnsonville is a city in Florence County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 1,480 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Florence Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The city was founded in 1913 west of the spot of the former Witherspoon&#x27;s Ferry on Lynches River, where General Francis Marion received his commission for the Revolutionary War.

==History==
In use during the American Revolution, Witherspoon&#x27;s Ferry was the site where Francis Marion accepted command of the Williamsburg Militia in 1780. Ownership of the ferry lands passed from Robert to John Witherspoon in 1787. In 1802, John bequeathed the land to Aimwell Presbyterian Church.

Witherspoon&#x27;s Ferry was a strategic ferry in the northeastern area of Williamsburg County, vested in John Witherspoon in 1801 and remaining in his charge until his death in 1815. According to the terms of John Witherspoon&#x27;s will, the ferry was vested in J.D. Witherspoon, executor, for a term of 14 years, &quot;in trust for and having the sole benefit of the incorporated Presbyterian Church at Aimwell on the Pee Dee River.&quot;

In 1819, former South Carolina Governor David R. Williams, son-in-law of John Witherspoon, obtained these ferry lands. William J. Johnson, born 1787, succeeded J.D. Witherspoon at the ferry after purchasing the plantation in 1825 from the Witherspoon estate. The 1850 census of Williamsburg County shows William Johnson, a man of considerable wealth for his time and place, living just below where the American Legion stands in Johnsonville today.

Johnson&#x27;s Ferry was a stagecoach horse changeover and meal break station. As the stagecoach passed east over the Lynches River on the ferry, a Johnson slave in charge of the ferry mules announced the number of passengers with a blast from a fox horn: one blast for each passenger, thus informing Mrs. Johnson of the number of places that should be set for dinner.

The stagecoach stopped at the Johnsons&#x27; house. All the mail for the surrounding communities was left in Capt. Johnson&#x27;s care. This provided an excellent reason for him to request a post office be granted. In 1843, a post office named Johnsonville was established near the ferry.

The city of Johnsonville was incorporated in 1913.

Snows Island, at that point, is believed to be the upthrust of the center after the impact. This eight-mile-wide crater is not well defined at the surface and was discovered by magnetic anomalies and supported by the study of well drilling cores. Supposed impact breccia was found in these cores.

<text>Lake City is a city in Florence County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 6,675 at the 2010 census. Located in central South Carolina, it is south of Florence and included as part of the Florence Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Lake City area was originally part of Williamsburg Township, which was first settled by a group of Scots-Irish in 1736. It was first called &quot;Graham&#x27;s Crossroads&quot; and then &quot;Graham&quot;, after Aaron Graham, a land owner around the crossroads that now form Church and Main streets in Lake City.

In 1856, the Northeastern Railroad built its main line through the area. This brought new growth to the community. On March 4, 1874, after requests from residents, a city charter was granted to the new town of Graham. On December 24, 1883, the town changed its name to &quot;Lake City&quot;, after the swimming lakes just north of town. This was at the request of the locally-serving Lynches Lake Post Office, since there was another post office in South Carolina known as that.

This small town had a population of 300 in 1893, and by 1898 the area had become the leading strawberry cropland in South Carolina.

Lake City was the site of a notorious lynching on February 22, 1898, that resulted in the mob murders of the city&#x27;s African-American postmaster and his infant daughter.

Lake City was at one time called the &quot;Bean Capital of the World&quot;, and the Bean Market downtown has now been converted into an event rental and civic center facility. The building was built in 1936 by the Public Works Administration (PWA), and was a central hub for farmers across the South to get their beans to market. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Lake City Downtown Historic District. Also listed on the National Register of Historical Places is the W.T. Askins House.

==Government==
Lake City&#x27;s city government includes a mayor (elected for a four-year term), an appointed city administrator, and a six-person city council (elected to single-member districts for a four-year staggered term of office). The city&#x27;s mayor is Yamekia Robinson.

==Geography==
Lake City is located in southern Florence County at (33.867697, -79.756153). U.S. Route 52 is the main highway through the city, leading north to Florence, the county seat, and south to Kingstree. U.S. Route 378 crosses US 52 north of the city center, leading east to Conway and west to Sumter.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Lake City has a total area of , of which , or 0.15%, is water. Lake Swamp drains the northern part of the city, flowing east to the Lynches River and then the Pee Dee River.

Following the closure of the Myrtle Beach Speedway in the same market, promoters acquired Florence Motor Speedway from the Powell family, moving the entire operation to the .400-mile circuit, built in 1982, where it is an active NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series circuit. Florence hosts the Icebreaker, CARS Tours, and Myrtle Beach 400 big-money events in addition to the regular club racing schedule.

==Education==
Public education in Timmonsville is administered by Florence County School District 1, following the absorption of District 4 by District 1. Students continue to attend Brockington Elementary School in Timmonsville, but high school students are now served by West Florence High School or South Florence High School. Johnson Middle School and Timmonsville High School, which were part of a unified campus with Brockington Elementary, were both closed as part of the merger.

Timmonsville has a public library, a branch of the Florence County Library System.

==History==
===Pre-Revolution===
In 1526 a Spanish expedition under Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón founded a colony on Waccamaw Neck called San Miguel de Guadalupe. The settlers included enslaved Africans, and was the first European settlement in North America with African slaves. The colony failed for multiple reasons, including a fever epidemic and a revolt of the slaves. The Africans escaped and joined members of the indigenous Cofitachequi chiefdom in the area, people of the late Mississippian culture.

The next settlement in the area was made by English colonists. After settling Charles Town in 1670, the English established trade with regional Indian tribes. Trading posts in outlying areas quickly developed as settlements.

By 1721 the colonial government granted the English residents&#x27; petition to found a new parish, Prince George, Winyah, on the Black River. In 1734, Prince George, Winyah was divided; and the newly created Prince Frederick Parish congregation occupied the church at Black River. Prince George Parish, Winyah encompassed the new town of Georgetown that was developing on the Sampit River.

In 1729, Elisha Screven laid the plan for Georgetown and developed the city in a four-by-eight block grid. The original grid city is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. It bears the original street names, lot numbers, and has many original homes.

Soon after Georgetown was established, the Indian trade declined. Many traders made longer trips to the interior of the upper rivers, for instance to Cherokee Country. In the Lowcountry, plantation owners developed large plantations and cultivated indigo as the cash commodity crop, with rice as a secondary crop. Both were labor-intensive and dependent on enslaved Africans and African Americans, the former imported from Africa in the Atlantic slave trade. Agricultural profits were so great between 1735 and 1775 that in 1757 the Winyah Indigo Society, whose members paid dues in indigo, opened and maintained the first public school for white children between Charles Town and Wilmington. By the early 19th century, rice replaced indigo as the chief commodity crop. It became a staple of regional diets as well, becoming characteristic in the area.

In the American Revolution, the Georgetown planter, Thomas Lynch Jr., signed the Declaration of Independence. During the final years of the conflict, Georgetown was the important port for supplying General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s army. Francis Marion (the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;) led many guerrilla actions in the vicinity.
===Antebellum period===
Georgetown had a large population of Jewish-Americans in the early 1800s. Following the American Revolution, rice surpassed indigo as the staple crop. It was cultivated in the swampy lowlands along the rivers, where enslaved African and African-American laborers built large earthworks: dams, gates and canals to irrigate and drain the rice fields during cultivation. Large rice plantations were established around Georgetown along its five rivers. Planters often had chosen to import slaves from rice-growing regions of West Africa, as they knew the technology for cultivation and processing.

By 1840, the Georgetown District (later County) produced nearly one-half of the total rice crop of the United States. It became the largest rice-exporting port in the world. Wealth from the rice created an elite European-American planter class; they built stately plantation manor houses and often also had townhouses in the city, bought elegant furniture and other furnishings, and extended generous hospitality to others of their class. Their relatively leisured lifestyle for a select few, built on the labor of thousands of slaves, was disrupted by the Civil War. Afterward the abolition of slavery and transformation to a free labor market in the South so changed the economics of rice production as to make the labor-intensive process unprofitable. The soft silt soil of the South Carolina low country required harvesting rice by hand. In addition, the disruption and destruction of the war delayed the resumption of agriculture in the South. Nationally, the economy struggled in the 1870s, adding to pressures on agriculture.
In the antebellum years, the profits from Georgetown&#x27;s rice trade also buoyed the economy of the nearby city and port of Charleston, where a thriving mercantile economy developed. With profits from rice, planters bought products from Charleston artisans: fine furniture, jewelry, and silver, to satisfy their refined tastes. Joshua John Ward was a planter who owned the most slaves in the US – eventually more than 1,000 slaves on several plantations; he lived in a townhouse in Georgetown.

Many of the historic plantation houses are still standing today, including Mansfield Plantation on the banks of the Black River. Joshua Ward&#x27;s main Brookgreen Plantation is the center and namesake of the Brookgreen Gardens park. Since the late 20th century, historic societies and independent plantations have worked to present more of the entire plantation society, including the lives and skills of enslaved African Americans.

Georgetown&#x27;s thriving economy long attracted settlers from elsewhere, including numerous planters and shipowners who migrated from Virginia. These included the Shackelford family, whose migrant ancestor John Shackelford moved to Georgetown in the late eighteenth century after serving in the Virginia forces of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. His descendants became prominent planters, lawyers, judges and businessmen in Georgetown and Charleston.

During the Civil War, the Confederate army built a fort and installed two camps near Georgetown at Murrells Inlet. Fort Ward was in service beginning in 1861, but it was abandoned and disarmed in March 1862. Its exact location is unknown due to shifting sandbars and erosion in the area. Confederate camps Lookout and Waccamaw were also located near Georgetown. Camp Waccamaw was in use from 1862 until 1864; Company E, 4th SC Cavalry were garrisoned at the camp. At least one soldier died there in 1862, probably from disease.

Additional fortifications were built at Battery White, located south of the town to protect the harbor and Winyah Bay. Construction during 1862-1863 on the cannon emplacement resulted in a well-built and situated set of fortifications which did not see action until 1864 when it was captured by Union Forces.

===Reconstruction and post-reconstruction period===
Georgetown and Georgetown County suffered terribly during the Reconstruction Era because of its reliance on agriculture, for which the national market was low. The rice crops of 1866 to 1888 were failures due to lack of capital, which prevented adequate preparation for new crops; inclement weather; and the planters&#x27; struggle to find laborers.

Several African Americans from Georgetown represented Georgetown County in the state legislature during the Reconstruction era including Joseph Haynes Rainey, Bruce H. Williams, Charles H. Sperry, Charles Samuel Green, and James A. Bowley. A fusion arrangement was reached in 1880 and Republican African Americans and white Democrats appointed officials.

Some freedmen left the area in an effort to reunite families separated by the domestic slave trade. Many families withdrew women and children from working as field laborers. Many freedmen families wanted to work for themselves as subsistence farmers, rather than work in gangs for major plantation owners. Rice continued to be grown commercially until about 1910, but the market had changed. It was never as important economically or as profitable a crop as before 1860.

By the time the Reconstruction period ended, the area&#x27;s economy was shifting to harvesting and processing wood products. By 1900 several lumber mills were operating on the Sampit River. The largest was the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company; its mill in Georgetown was the largest lumber mill on the East Coast at the time.

In 1900, a Georgetown constable&#x27;s efforts to arrest barber John Brownfield for refusing to pay a poll tax resulted in a scuffle and his death in a shooting. White supremacists called for lynching and a tense period followed including appeals of Brownfield&#x27;s murder conviction by an all-white jury with ties to the deceased and his family.

===20th century===

Around 1905, &quot;Georgetown reached its peak as a lumber port&quot;, according to the historian Mac McAlister. Jim Crow laws excluded African Americans from taking part in elections and from holding office.

As the twentieth century dawned, Georgetown under the leadership of Mayor William Doyle Morgan began to modernize. The city added electricity, telephone service, sewer facilities, rail connections, some paved streets and sidewalks, new banks, a thriving port, and a new public school for white students. Public schools were segregated and black schools were historically underfunded. The US government built a handsome combination post office and customs house.

Like most cities, Georgetown suffered economic deprivation during the Great Depression. The Atlantic Coast Lumber Company went bankrupt early in the depression, putting almost everyone out of work. Businesses related to the mills also lost revenues and had to lay off employees, with a cascading effect through the city. In 1936 help arrived, when the Southern Kraft Division of International Paper opened a mill; by 1944 it was the largest in the world.

From the mid-20th century, the city developed more industry. In 1973, the Korf company of Germany founded a steel mill in town. in 1993, the steel mill was financed by Bain Capital and was called Georgetown Steel, which became GST Steel Company with its sister Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant in Kansas City, Missouri.
In 1978, Sigma Chemical Company founded its third chemical plant (the other 2 being in Italy) in Georgetown.
In September 1989, a major disaster struck the area with Hurricane Hugo struck south of Georgetown. Its extremely hard winds and an intense storm surge along the rivers flooded and damaged Georgetown and nearby areas. As Georgetown was under Hugo&#x27;s northern eyewall, it suffered winds more severe and damaging than in Charleston, which was in the hurricane&#x27;s weak corridor.

===2000 to present===
In recent years, the economy has become more diversified. The GST Steel Company declared bankruptcy in 2001, first closing the Kansas City plant. In 2003 it closed the South Carolina plant. The Georgetown plant has subsequently reopened under ownership of ArcelorMittal. Due to the influx of cheap foreign steel into the United States, the plant closed its doors again in August 2015. 
On May 19, 2017, Mayor Jack Scoville announced that ArcelorMittal had agreed to sell the mill to Liberty Steel.

On September 25, 2013, a fire engulfed seven historic buildings on 700 Block of Front Street. The fire raged for hours while over 200 firefighters from ten departments and the United States Coast Guard fought to contain the blaze.

Heritage tourism has become a booming business in Georgetown, supporting much retail activity. In addition, many retirees have chosen to settle in this area of beaches, plantations redeveloped as residential communities, and pleasant climate. From 2016 to 2021, housing prices in Georgetown have risen 38 percent.

On January 18, 2018, long-time Democratic City Councilman Brendon Moses Barber, Sr. was inaugurated as Mayor of Georgetown; he is the first African-American mayor of the city. The City of Georgetown has always elected Democratic mayors, even as the make-up of the major parties has realigned since the late 20th century.

As of 2019, brackish water incursions into the Waccamaw River near Georgetown due to rising sea levels are increasing the risk of exposure to toxic vibrio bacteria.

In the 2021 municipal elections, Georgetown elected its first Republican-majority city council in its history. On January 3, 2022, city councilwoman Carol Jayroe was sworn in as the Mayor of Georgetown, having defeated incumbent Democratic mayor Brendon Barber. She is the first woman and the first Republican to hold the mayoralty in Georgetown’s history. 

In September 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall near Georgetown. On October 31, 2024, International Paper announced the closing of their Georgetown plant by the end of 2024, causing the loss of 526 hourly jobs and 148 salaried employees.

<doc id="134489" wikidata="Q3313618" url="?curid=134489" title="Murrells Inlet, South Carolina">
<text>Murrells Inlet is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Georgetown County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 7,547 at the 2010 census. It is about 13 miles south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and 21 miles north of Georgetown, the county seat.

The community was once primarily a fishing village. It has developed in modern times, along with the rest of the Grand Strand, as a tourist and retirement location. It is known for the Murrells Inlet Marshwalk, a boardwalk overlooking a salt marsh. Many restaurants have been developed along the boardwalk.

==Geography==
Murrells Inlet is located in northeastern Georgetown County at (33.551593, -79.048794). The northern edge of the CDP follows the Horry County line. U.S. Route 17 (Ocean Highway) runs through the center of the community, leading northeast to Myrtle Beach and southwest to Georgetown, the seat of Georgetown County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Murrells Inlet CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.21%, are water. It has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and average monthly temperatures range from 46.5 °F in January to 80.5 °F in July. The local hardiness zone is 8b.

==History==

The land around Murrells Inlet has a record of human settlement that goes back thousands of years, before written history. Shell mounds and archeological findings from the Atlantic Ocean to the Waccamaw River document the cultures of indigenous peoples who lived in this area. At the time of European encounter, the inhabitants included the historic Waccamaw people, who took advantage of the natural resources provided by the creeks and rivers. &quot;Wachesaw&quot; is loosely translated as &quot;Place of Great Weeping&quot;, in reference to the burial grounds. Indian burial mounds have been found along the high bluffs at Wachesaw that contained European beads, urns and other artifacts.

The recorded history of the area begins with English colonial settlements and the land grants made by the Lords Proprietors. To encourage development of the colony of South Carolina, they granted large portions of the Waccamaw Neck to men who were willing to transport workers here and settle the land. These estates stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Waccamaw River. The baronies were typically tens of thousands of acres that were subdivided into long narrow plantations that ranged from .

The plantations of Murrells Inlet included The Oaks, Brookgreen, Springfield, Laurel Hill, Richmond Hill, and Wachesaw (from south to north). The first land grants were given to Robert Daniell in 1711, who in turn sold to several other speculators. The first planters arrived in the 1730s, some from Virginia, to begin developing agriculture and settlements. Captain John Murrell bought , which were eventually developed as Wachesaw and Richmond Hill plantations. He had a house on a bluff built around 1733. He was a subsistence farmer, and raised indigo as the primary cash crop. He died in 1771, leaving his land to son Daniel and two daughters. It was divided into the two plantations named above. Wachesaw Plantation was purchased by Allard Belin around 1800. Richmond Hill was held by Murrell descendants until it was sold to an Allston (most likely John Hayes Allston, who pioneered rice planting techniques with clay). In the nineteenth century, rice replaced indigo as the commodity crop throughout the Lowcountry region.

Adjacent plantations were owned by such planters as Plowden Weston, his grandson Plowden C. J. Weston, William Allston, Benjamin Allston, Henry Flagg, Allard Flagg, Joshua Ward, Allard Belin and their descendants. These plantations prospered during the establishment of the rice culture of the late 1700s and 1800s. These planters generally supported the American cause during the Revolutionary War. William Allston served as a captain under his brother-in-law Francis Marion (who had family ties through marriage to the Allston family).

The Waccamaw Neck planters comprised the elite class: they were elected to the state Senate and House, as well as to the Governor&#x27;s and Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s offices during the 1800s. The wealthy rice planters also established social, educational, and religious organizations, including the Planters Club, the Winyah Indigo Society in Georgetown, the Hot and Hot Fish Club, the All Saints Academy, the Waccamaw Methodist Mission, and All Saints Waccamaw. Various historic maps dating to 1783 show these family names on plantations. &quot;Murrells Inlet&quot; was likely named after that early family. It has been alternately shown as &quot;Morrall&#x27;s Inlet&quot; and &quot;Murrays Inlet&quot; on later maps.

The rice plantation era came to an end after the Civil War with the emancipation of the slaves (rice cultivation was labor-intensive) and a series of hurricanes that climaxed with the 1893 Hurricane (also known as the Flagg flood, where the Atlantic Ocean was reported to meet the Waccamaw River). The loss of the slave labor resulted in the decline of the fields, dikes, and water control structures required for rice cultivation, since planters had to rely on freedmen to work the fields. Several powerful hurricanes following the Civil War and up to the 1893 hurricane resulted in uprooted trees and flood-damaged dikes in the rice fields and ultimately ended the production of rice on the Waccamaw Neck. The 1893 hurricane became known as the Flagg Flood, because the Flagg families that lived in houses on Magnolia Beach (Arthur, his wife Georgeanne, his son Arthur Jr., and his wife and six children) were swept away in the storm surge. Ward Flagg (one of three sons) survived the storm and retired to the miller&#x27;s cottage in Brookgreen and reportedly never visited the ocean again.

After Allard Flagg&#x27;s death in 1901, his daughter sold Wachesaw and the Hermitage to Samuel Sidney Fraser, a real estate speculator, who bought and sold interests in several old plantations after the Civil War. Fraser held onto the plantation briefly before selling to Robert Ernest Beaty in 1905. Clarke A. Willcox of Marion purchased Wachesaw and the Hermitage in 1910 for $10,000 to use as a summer retreat. The Willcox family retained the Hermitage, but sold Wachesaw in 1930 to William A. Kimbel, who also bought Richmond Hill with the purpose of developing a large hunting estate. With his purchase of both properties, Kimbel had restored the boundaries of John Murrell&#x27;s original plantation.

In 1920, Julius A. Mood of Sumter and a group of sportsmen bought Brookgreen, Springfield, Laurel Hill, and The Oaks to use as a hunting preserve. His daughter, Julia Mood Peterkin, made several visits to Brookgreen and used the area as the setting for some of her novels. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for &quot;Scarlet Sister Mary&quot; in 1928. Club members enjoyed their hunting paradise for ten years, as a succession of owners conserved the property before selling out to yet another wealthy outsider seeking a rural estate in the South where land was cheap. After numerous owners, railroad magnate Archer Milton Huntington purchased Brookgreen in 1930. At first, he and his wife, Anna Hyatt Huntington, intended Brookgreen as a winter resort. Eventually, they decided to use the plantation as an outdoor gallery for Mrs. Huntington&#x27;s award-winning sculptures. The Huntingtons constructed Atalaya, a Spanish-style fort, on the beach to use for her studio and living quarters at what is now Huntington Beach State Park, abandoning the plantation houses.
The years from Reconstruction until World War I saw an increase in the number of settlers who moved to Murrells Inlet to enjoy the natural resources provided. The family names listed in the 1900–1930 census records reflect the growth and are still found in Murrells Inlet today. The families that moved into this area were from communities like Marion, Conway, Southport, and other nearby counties.

The transportation corridors up to the 1900s were primarily the Waccamaw River and the Atlantic Ocean for boats, and the Kings Road (used during George Washington&#x27;s visit) and the River Road (along the Waccamaw River near the plantation houses) for horse and wagons. These dirt paths were crude rough paths that bore no resemblance to today&#x27;s modern highways. Highway 17 was paved around 1933 as part of a federal effort to provide paved roads across the United States. Early shipping routes relied on the deepwater access provided by the Waccamaw River to move vast quantities of materials and goods. The &quot;Comanche&quot; was an early steamship that called on Wachesaw Landing to deliver passengers and mail to Murrells Inlet.

<text>Pawleys Island is a town in Georgetown County, South Carolina, United States, and the Atlantic coast barrier island on which the town is located.

Pawleys Island&#x27;s population was 103 at the 2010 census, down from 138 in 2000. The post office address also includes an unincorporated area on the mainland adjacent to the island, which is also commonly referred to as Pawleys Island and includes a commercial district along the Ocean Highway (US Route 17) as well as a residential area between the highway and the Waccamaw River. The town of Pawleys Island, though, is only on the island. The island lies off the Waccamaw Neck, a long, narrow peninsula between the ocean and the river, and is connected to the mainland by two bridges, the North Causeway and the South Causeway. It is on the southern end of The Grand Strand and is one of the oldest resort areas of the US East Coast.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pawleys Island area were the Waccamaw and Winyah people, two Native American tribes whose history dates back more than 10,000 years. The ancient Waccamaw lived in communities along the Waccamaw River, an area stretching from Lake Waccamaw in North Carolina to Winyah Bay in Georgetown, South Carolina. Archaeological sites containing Waccamaw shell &#x27;middens&#x27; (mounds) indicate that clams and oysters were popular foods. The Waccamaw were successful farmers, raising a variety of crops, and were skilled at domesticating animals including deer, chickens, ducks, geese, and other fowl.

The first Europeans in the area arrived from Spain in 1521. European colonization had a devastating impact on the Waccamaw and Winyah people, many of whom were captured and enslaved, starved to death when their farms and hunting grounds were seized, or died from the introduction of European diseases. While the Winyah disappeared by 1720, the Waccamaw and its rich culture still exist today as the Waccamaw Indian People of Conway, South Carolina. The Waccamaw tribe is a founding member of the South Carolina Indian Affairs Commission and has worked for decades with South Carolina governors to improve the lives and status of the state’s first inhabitants.

Pawleys Island&#x27;s history as a beach resort began in the early 1700s. Town namesake George Pawley, who inherited the island through a land grant to his father, sold parcels to wealthy rice planters seeking a coastal summer refuge from malaria-causing mosquitoes.

In 1791, President George Washington toured the Grand Strand, traveling The King&#x27;s Highway to an unincorporated portion of Pawleys Island to visit the Alstons, who owned several plantations in the area.

With Hurricane Hugo in 1989, some island cottages were swept away and have since been replaced. The island bans commercial or industrial buildings with the exception of a 1970s condominium complex and a few grandfathered inns, including the SeaView Inn and the PCJ Weston House, which is now the Pelican Inn.
The town government was incorporated in 1985. The water temperature is comfortable from May to October, and there is abundant fishing, crabbing, shrimping, and birdwatching most months of the year.

All Saints Church, Cedar Grove Plantation Chapel, and Pawleys Island Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== The Gray Man ghost ==
The Gray Man is a famous purported ghost local to Pawleys Island and is said to have walked the coastline for nearly 200 years. His presence is said to warn of hurricanes and other dangers.

The most common origin story of the Gray Man is that in 1822 a young woman was staying on the island with her family when she received word that her fiancé was going to join her there. Delighted with the news, she prepared all of his favorite dishes in anticipation of his arrival. However as her fiancé was traveling to the house he challenged his servants to a race on their horses. As they raced he saw a shortcut through a marsh and decided to take it. The horse stumbled in the marsh, throwing him off the horse, and despite his servants&#x27; efforts to free him he sank into the mud.

The news of her fiancé&#x27;s death nearly drove the girl mad, and she had distressing waking and night-dream visions of him. Her family took her to Charleston to see a doctor; within hours of their leaving a hurricane hit the coast and almost all of the Pawleys Island inhabitants died, but the family&#x27;s house was untouched.

<doc id="134494" wikidata="Q2178804" url="?curid=134494" title="Five Forks, South Carolina">
<text>Five Forks is a census-designated place (CDP) in Greenville County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 17,737 at the 2020 census, up from 14,140 in 2010, and 8,064 in 2000. It is a growing, affluent suburb of Greenville and is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Five Forks is located in eastern Greenville County at (34.805912, -82.230346). It is east of Downtown Greenville.

The area is bounded by SC 14 to the west, Roper Mountain and Anderson Ridge roads to the north, Jonesville Road to the east, and Gilder Creek (a tributary of the Enoree River) to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.59%, is water.

==History==

Five Forks is named for a conflux of five roads, which the Greenville edition of &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; identifies as Woodruff (the main east–west artery), Batesville, Scuffletown, Bennetts Bridge, and one now called Five Forks Road. The area was still very rural into the early 1990s before rapid growth made it a destination for shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. A 1983 USGS map of the region shows an asterisk- or star-shaped intersection of roads – Woodruff passing through, with Adams Mill, Five Forks, and Scuffletown – before a Woodruff bypass and other realignment changed it.

In 2019, Niche.com ranked Five Forks as the best place to live, and second best place to raise a family, out of 190 best places in South Carolina.

In April 2019, an EF1 tornado was confirmed to have touched down, beginning in Simpsonville and ending its path in Five Forks.

In March 2021, an area plan for Five Forks was posted by Greenville County for comment. The plan had been developed since 2018 by a committee of Five Forks residents to address heavy traffic, loss of trees, and inconsistent growth, and covers commercial design, environmental protection, and goals for residential control. All three county council members who represent parts of Five Forks support the plan, and no one spoke against it at a public hearing in May 2021. The county&#x27;s addition of overlay districts, as suggested by the plan, would legally govern future development in Five Forks. A motion for the council to adopt the plan as an amendment to the county&#x27;s comprehensive plan was unanimously carried in August 2021.

Numerous companies have offices within the city such as Michelin, Prisma Health, Bon Secours, and Duke Energy.

==History==
===From Cherokee land to Greenville County===

The land of present-day Greenville was once the hunting ground of the Cherokee, which was forbidden to colonists. A wealthy settler from Virginia named Richard Pearis arrived in South Carolina around 1754 and established relations with the Cherokee. Pearis had a child with a Cherokee woman and received about from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established a plantation on the Reedy River called the Great Plains in present-day downtown Greenville. The American Revolution divided the South Carolina country between the Loyalists and Patriots. Pearis supported the Loyalists and together with their allies, the Cherokee, attacked the Patriots. The Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis&#x27; plantation and jailing him in Charleston. Pearis never returned to his plantation but Paris Mountain is named after him. The Treaty of Dewitt&#x27;s Corner in 1777 ceded almost all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to South Carolina.

Greenville County was created in 1786. Some sources state it was named for its physical appearance, while others say the county is named after General Nathanael Greene in honor of his service in the American Revolutionary War, or after early settler Isaac Green. Lemuel J. Alston came to Greenville County in 1788 and bought and a portion of Pearis&#x27; former plantation. In 1797 Alston used his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also built a stately mansion. In 1816, Alston&#x27;s land was purchased by Vardry McBee, who then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort, before making the mansion his home from 1835 until his death in 1864. Pleasantburg was renamed as Greenville in 1821 and became a village in 1831. Considered to be the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as churches, academies, and a cotton mill. Furman University was funded by McBee who helped bring the university to Greenville from Winnsboro, South Carolina, in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded a new railroad called the Greenville and Columbia Railroad. Greenville boomed to around 1,000 in the 1850s due to the growth of McBee&#x27;s donations and the attraction of the town as a summer resort for visitors.

===Latter 19th century===
In December 1860 Greenville supported a convention to debate the issue of secession for South Carolina. The Greenville District sent James Furman, William K. Easley, Perry E. Duncan, William H. Campbell, and James P. Harrison as delegates for the convention. On December 20, 1860, the South Carolina state convention, along with the Greenville delegation, voted to secede from the Union. Greenville County provided over 2,000 soldiers to the Confederate States Army. The town supplied food, clothing, and firearms to the Confederacy. Greenville saw no action from the war until 1865 when Union troops came through the town looking for President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy who had fled south from Richmond, Virginia. In June 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Greenville County native Benjamin Franklin Perry as Governor of South Carolina.

In February 1869, Greenville&#x27;s town charter was amended by the S. C. General Assembly establishing Greenville, the town, as a city. Construction boomed in the 1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the Reedy River, new mills on the river, and new railroads. The Greenville News was established in 1874 as Greenville&#x27;s first daily newspaper. Southern Bell installed the first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated near Greenville making it a cotton mill town. By 1915 Greenville became known as the &quot;Textile Center of the South.&quot; From 1915 to 2004, the city hosted an important textile manufacturing trade fair, the Southern Textile Exposition.

===20th century===
During World War I, Greenville served as a training camp center for US Army recruits. After World War I commercial activity expanded with new movie theaters and department stores. The Mansion House was demolished and replaced with the Poinsett Hotel in 1925. The Great Depression hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay off workers. Furman University and the Greenville Women&#x27;s College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The Textile Workers Strike of 1934 had a major impact in the city and surrounding mill towns, and the National Guard subdued the strike. The New Deal established Sirrine Stadium and a new Greenville High School. The Greenville Army Air Base was established in 1942 during World War II contributing to the further growth of Greenville.

After the war, a November 19, 1946, propane explosion left 6 dead and over 150 injured. The explosion involved a tank containing about of propane and could be heard from Gaffney, away.
On February 16, 1947, Willie Earle, a black man accused of stabbing a cab driver, was taken from his jail cell by a mob of mostly taxi drivers and murdered. Thirty-one white men were jointly tried for the crime; most of the accused signed confessions, many of them naming Roosevelt Carlos Hurd as the lynch mob leader and the person who ultimately killed Earle with the shotgun. On May 21, 1947, a jury of 12 white men returned verdicts of not guilty for every defendant.

After World War II, Greenville&#x27;s economy surged with the establishment of new stores and the expansion of the city limits. Furman University doubled its student population and moved to a new location. Higher education facilities such as Bob Jones University in 1947 and Greenville Technical College in 1962 were established in Greenville. The Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport was established in nearby Greer in 1962. The 1966 construction of the Landmark Building added what remains the city&#x27;s tallest building. Greenville&#x27;s economy waned in the 1970s, leaving a void due to the flight of many retailers. Mayor Max Heller then began a revitalization with the Greenville County Museum of Art and the Hughes Main Library. Main Street was then converted into a two-lane road lined with trees and sidewalks. With a 1978 federal grant, a convention center and hotel were built, bringing business back to the area.

After a succession of several mayors in the early 1980s, Bill Workman was elected in 1983 and made economic development a priority. He and the chamber of commerce convinced Michelin to move its North America headquarters to Greenville in 1984. Tens of other companies also moved to Greenville in following years, including pulp and paper business Bowater in 1992. The Greenville Municipal Stadium was constructed in 1984. The city acted as developer for the West End Market project, which later brought an arts and entertainment district.

In 1990, the Peace Center arts venue opened in downtown Greenville. In 1994, BMW opened its first manufacturing plant outside Germany between Greenville and Spartanburg. Knox White became mayor in 1995. In 1998, Bon Secours Wellness Arena replaced Greenville Memorial Auditorium as an entertainment arena. The Poinsett Hotel was renovated in the late 1990s with Poinsett Plaza at its entryway, and the Camperdown Bridge that had crossed Reedy Falls for four decades was removed and replaced with a renovated Falls Park.

===21st century===
During the 2000s, thousands of people began moving to Greenville. Liberty Bridge at Falls Park was completed in 2004 and became a major landmark. Greenville has continued to evolve and grow with over 70,000 residents in its city limits as of 2020. Its growth has also improved the popularity of close cities such as Simpsonville, Mauldin, and Fountain Inn. Under the leadership of Knox White, the Swamp Rabbit Trail was opened in 2010. It is an old railroad converted into a path that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year.

The Bon Secours Wellness Arena brings national tours of many popular bands to downtown, and the Peace Center for the Performing Arts provides a venue for orchestras and Broadway shows. A planned multimillion-dollar renovation to the center&#x27;s main concert hall lobby and riverside amphitheatre began in the spring of 2011.

* Fluor Field at the West End, home of the Greenville Drive baseball team, the Class-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.

===Landmarks===


* Cancer Survivors Park, opened in 2018
* The Children&#x27;s Museum of the Upstate, one of the first children&#x27;s museums to become Smithsonian affiliated.
* Falls Park on the Reedy, a large regional park in the West End with gardens and several waterfalls, with access to the Swamp Rabbit Trail. Dedicated in 2004, the $15.0 million park is home to the Liberty Bridge, a pedestrian suspension bridge overlooking the Reedy River. The park&#x27;s development sparked a $75 million public-private development, Riverplace, directly across Main Street. Falls Park has been called the birthplace of Greenville, but in the mid-20th century the area was in severe decline, and the Camperdown Bridge was built, obstructing the view of the falls. In the mid-1980s, the City adopted a master plan for the park. However, renovation accelerated under Mayor Knox White in the late 1990s, leading to the removal of the Camperdown Bridge in 2002 and the construction of the Miguel Rosales-designed Liberty Bridge in 2004. While bridges with similar structural concepts have been built in Europe, the Liberty Bridge is unique in its geometry.
* Greenville County Museum of Art, specializing in American art, frequently with a Southern perspective that dates back to the 18th century. It is noted for its collections of work by Andrew Wyeth and Jasper Johns, as well as a contemporary collection that features such notables as Andy Warhol, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, and others.
* Greenville Zoo, established in 1960 and is located in Cleveland Park.
* Linky Stone Park: The Children&#x27;s Garden, a horticultural attraction featuring a unique garden that allows visitors to experience flowers using all five senses, a geology wall made of rocks and minerals from around the Upstate, a textile garden, a Hansel and Gretel cottage, and a secret garden.

A cross section of a Boeing 737 fuselage serves as a park entrance.
* Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum &amp; Baseball Library, located in the historic home of baseballer Shoeless Joe Jackson adjacent to Fluor Field at the West End.
* Swamp Rabbit Trail, a greenway connecting downtown Greenville to the City of Travelers Rest. On June 16, 2023, a extension of the trail was opened, connecting Cleveland Park to the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR).

The park features basketball courts, a baseball field, a splash pad, a 10,000-square-foot welcome center/event space and three pedestrian bridges spanning the river. Five walking trails totaling connect to the Swamp Rabbit Trail as it passes through the park. The park merged what was once two segregated parks, Mayberry Park for Black residents and Meadowbrook Park for white residents. Just north of the park, at the intersection of West Washington and South Hudson streets, the city dedicated the Lila Mae Brock Memorial, named after the late Southernside community leader described as &quot;the epitome of unity.&quot;

<text>Slater-Marietta is a census-designated place (CDP) in Greenville County, South Carolina, United States, along the North Saluda River. At the 2000 census, there were 2,228 people. At the 2010 census, there were 2,176. At the 2020 census, there were 1,873. It is part of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
J. Harvey Cleveland, born in 1815, invested in land in northern Greenville County, including a tract along the North Saluda River which he bought from his father-in-law about 1840. Cleveland expanded the simple home on the property and made it his family home. He also plotted a nearby settlement, named &quot;Marietta&quot; after his wife, Mary Louisa Williams.

Though in an otherwise favorable location, the resulting village was slow to grow, possibly because the only direct access to the area was via the dangerous Jones Gap Road. The CK&amp;W rail line that became nicknamed the Swamp Rabbit was laid past Marietta in the late 1880s. In the 1920s, the Geer Highway was built through the area, a new reservoir provided water, and electricity was eventually provided by Duke Power.

In 1927, the Slater family announced they would build a mill nearby and a Slater village around it, on land bought from Cleveland family members. The Slaters had started Slater Mill, the first textile mill in America, in Rhode Island in 1790, and built the village of Slatersville in 1803 and then other mills in Massachusetts before moving their operations to South Carolina. The new Slater Mill opened in 1928, was very successful, and overwhelmed the two communities, which became referred to as Slater-Marietta.

In 1934, H. Nelson Slater, the mill founder, built Slater Hall, a community center for Slater village. In 1946, the Slaters sold their mill to J.P. Stevens &amp; Company, and the J.P. Stevens&#x27; Slater Plant went on to produce the main material for the space suits used on the first Moon landing in 1969 as well as Space Shuttle components. In 2016, JPS Composite Materials owned the mill, which was mainly producing fiber glass, and sold it to B&amp;W Fiber Glass.

== History ==

In 1823 John McGehee and his wife Charlotte built a summerhouse called &quot;Green Wood&quot; midway between the cities of Abbeville and Cambridge in order to have cleaner air. Nearby, a village named Woodville was formed in 1837 with a post office. By 1850, the village designation was changed to the name Greenwood. The town grew with the first railroad, the Greenville &amp; Columbia Railroad built in 1852. Greenwood was incorporated in 1857.

Starting in 1872, the American Missionary Association (AMA) founded the Brewer Normal Institute in Greenwood; a segregated school for African-American students. The Brewer Normal Institute was initially a private boarding school, and by 1925 it became a public school which closed in 1970. The AMA also built the Brewer Hospital in Greenwood in order to help fostering community racial integration. It was dedicated on May 24, 1924.

Greenwood primarily served as a railroad and agricultural town until 1890 when William L. Durst opened the Greenwood Cotton Mill, and after which moved into local textile manufacturing.

==Arts and culture==
=== South Carolina Festival of Flowers===
Greenwood&#x27;s first South Carolina Festival of Flowers was held in the summer of 1968 to coincide with the 100th anniversary celebration of George W. Park Seed Company. The festival was the brainchild of what was known then as the Tourist and Conventions Committee of the Greenwood Chamber of Commerce. Chamber Director Al Parker and committee members recognized that Park Seed Company hosted &quot;grower days&quot; each year and that hundreds of professional flower growers would come to Greenwood to meander through Park Seed&#x27;s famous trial gardens (the gardens closed in 2013). The committee thought it would be a good idea to capitalize on having those visitors see other venues in Greenwood.

Dick Stowe, chair of the Tourist and Conventions Committee, served as the first Festival Chairman, and Judy Funderburk of Bennettsville was crowned Princess of Flowers. During the festival&#x27;s early years, admission was free to most events, including the Park Seed gardens and open house, arts and craft show, photo exhibit, military band concerts and other popular attractions.

Since then, the festival has grown to include a wide array of activities, many added under the leadership of Frank Cuda, who was Festival Director from 1992 to 2006. In 2007, the festival celebrated its 40th anniversary and welcomed Kay Self as the new executive director.

In 2008, the South Carolina Festival of Flowers introduced a new logo celebrating its Carolina roots. The logo features yellow jessamine (the state flower) encircling the words &quot;Festival of Flowers&quot; with two Carolina wrens (the state bird) perched below.

Also in 2008, the Topiary Project was launched, which has become the signature event. Presently, there are 42 topiaries on the square in Greenwood.

Then in 2009, the festival gained regional recognition by winning four Excellence Awards at the Carolina Showfest Convention. The awards were for &quot;Best Merchandise&quot;, &quot;Best Website&quot;, and &quot;Overall Event of the Year&quot; for South and North Carolina, and Executive Director Kay Self was recognized as &quot;South Carolina Director of the Year&quot;.

Ellesor G. Holder took the helm in 2011 for the 44th Festival of Flowers. She rebranded the festival with a more distinctive and contemporary logo which symbolized the diversity and floral history of the festival. Under Holder&#x27;s leadership, the festival received the SC Festival &amp; Event Association&#x27;s Excellence Award, 2013 Event of the Year. She also garnered two Silver Awards for the festival&#x27;s 2013 TV ad and mobile application/website at the International Festival and Events Association Conference.

The South Carolina Festival of Flowers continues to be named one of the Southeast Tourism Society&#x27;s &quot;Top Twenty Events&quot;.

Attendance at the festival has steadily grown, reaching a record of over 80,000 visitors in the past few years. In 2016, the economic impact of the Festival of Flowers was $3,300,000.

The South Carolina Festival of Flowers is a division of the Greenwood Chamber of Commerce and shares the same board of directors.

===Festival of Discovery===

<text>Ninety Six is a town in Greenwood County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 2,076 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Ninety Six is located in eastern Greenwood County at (34.173211, -82.021710). South Carolina Highway 34 passes through the town as its Main Street; it leads west to Greenwood, the county seat, and east to Newberry.

Lake Greenwood State Park is northeast of town, and Ninety Six National Historic Site is south of the center of town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Ninety Six has a total area of , all land.

==Etymology==
There is much confusion about the name, &quot;Ninety Six&quot;, and the true origin may never be known. Speculation has led to the mistaken belief that traders estimated it was from here to the nearest Cherokee settlement of Keowee (it was about ); to a counting of creeks crossing the main road leading from Lexington, South Carolina, to Ninety-Six (a legend proved false); to an interpretation of a Welsh expression, &quot;nant-sych&quot;, meaning &quot;dry gulch&quot;. No one is able to confirm that European founder Robert Goudey (sic) was Welsh, English, Scottish, or German.

Traders passed on information to each other about landmarks and distances along the Cherokee Path, and sometimes created maps. They estimated mileage between streams based on their day&#x27;s travel. They noted unusual aspects, such as the six creeks that ran unexpectedly south away from the Saluda River and, further west, nine creeks that ran south away from the Savannah River, noting them on maps as &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot;. One story suggests that a town in this area and a district both became known as &quot;Ninety-Six&quot;, likely related to the evolution of traders&#x27; references to 9 and 6, the landmark groups of streams. Using historical accounts and USGS maps, historians have traced the Cherokee Path across present-day Greenwood County, territory that at the time was part of other districts.

Another source suggests the numerical reference was to measuring by Chain, traditional in English parishes. Even so, the origin of the name &quot;Ninety-Six&quot; remains a mystery. Ninety Six has been noted for its unusual place name.

==History==
Ninety Six was established on the frontier of the early 18th century, roughly around 1730. For a time it was known as &quot;Jews Land&quot; because some prominent Sephardic Jewish families of London bought extensive property there. The Salvador and DaCosta families bought , intending to help poor Sephardic families relocate from London to the New World. They began to settle it.

The settlement became the capital city of the Ninety-Six District when the latter was established in July 1769. Since the late 20th century, the National Park Service has operated the Ninety Six National Historic Site at the site of the original settlement and British fort.

Ninety Six figured prominently in the Anglo-Cherokee War (1758–1761). During the American Revolutionary War, it was a site for southern campaigns. The first land battle of the revolution south of New England was fought here November 19–21, 1775.

On August 1, 1776, American militia forces led by Major Andrew Williamson were ambushed by Cherokee and Loyalists near here in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek. More than 4,000 Cherokee warriors had waged war on a long front beginning in June, from modern Tennessee to central South Carolina. Francis Salvador, a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from London and a planter, was one of the casualties. He was the first Jew to be killed fighting with the Patriots in the Revolutionary War.

The Cherokee were allied with the British in an effort to expel European-American settlers from their territory. In fall 1776, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia raised rebel militias to retaliate. Rutherford&#x27;s Light Horse expedition had several units that attacked the Cherokee Lower Towns; the Middle, Valley, and Out Towns; and the Overhill Towns, dealing widespread destruction of Cherokee towns and their stores of food.

In 1780 the British fortified the strategically important frontier town with a star fort. From May 22 to June 18, 1781, Major General Nathanael Greene, with 1,000 Continental Army troops, besieged 550 American Loyalists who were defending Ninety Six. General Greene&#x27;s chief engineer at the siege was Colonel Tadeusz Kościuszko, a Polish officer who became world-renowned for his role in the Revolution; he was wounded at the siege. The Loyalists survived the siege and relocated after the war to Rawdon, Nova Scotia, Canada, with support from the Crown for resettlement.

In the nineteenth century, the Southern Railway was constructed through here and had a stop at Ninety Six. The Kinard House, Moore-Kinard House, Ninety Six National Historic Site, and Southern Railway Depot (Ninety Six, South Carolina) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2008, Ninety Six started hosting an annual July 4 celebration in the park. It is called the festival of stars and as of 2023 is still running in its 15th consecutive year. It has had many famous headliners at the festival including Tracy Lawrence and Aaron Tippin. The festival hosts a petting zoo, various food vendors, a multitude of booths selling items, rides, and even a helicopter ride. People in the town look forward to this annual celebration.
