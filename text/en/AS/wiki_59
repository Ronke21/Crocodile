<text>Sävsjö Municipality (&quot;Sävsjö kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Jönköping County, southern Sweden where the town Sävsjö is seat.

The municipality was created by the local government reform of 1971, when the &quot;City of Sävsjö&quot; (instituted as late as 1947) was amalgamated with parts of two adjacent rural municipalities. Two years later it was completed when &quot;Hjälmseryd&quot; was added.

==Geography==
The municipality is located on the South Swedish highlands and comprise the old Västra Härad. It is considered a scenic place because the forests are not as dense as in the rest of Småland and the terrain is more varied.

===Localities===
There are four urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Sävsjö Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since early Stone Age. Both archeological finds and the five medieval churches from the 12th century stands as reminiscence from those days. A few kilometers from where the town Sävsjö is located today, was for instance the centre of the old administrative court house called Västra Härad Court.

==Today==

Sävsjö Municipality is working hard to increase its population. It currently has a half-price offer when buying plots of land with the intention of building a house here.

Politically Sävsjö Municipality is a stronghold of the Kristdemokraterna, the Christian Democrats (12 mandates of 39). The party is the largest in the municipal assembly (kommunfullmäktige).

In contemporary Sweden today, Sävsjö Municipality is perhaps most known for the successful handball team Sävsjö HK.

<text>Vaggeryd Municipality (&quot;Vaggeryds kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Jönköping County in southern Sweden. The town Skillingaryd is together with Vaggeryd the seat of the municipality. Most of the municipal administration is, however, placed in Skillingaryd.

The present municipality was created in 1971, when the two market towns &quot;Skillingaryd&quot; and &quot;Vaggeryd&quot; were amalgamated with parts of the rural municipalities of &quot;Klevshult&quot; and &quot;Vrigstad&quot;.

The large nature reserve Stora Mosse stretches in this municipality and the adjacent Gnosjö Municipality; in total it covers some , whereof has been marked as nature reserve. A lot of the ground is boggy grounds and swamps which makes it important for different kinds of birds and other animals. It is easily accessible by car, guided tours are regularly conducted, and the total walking road adds up to 50 km.

In the area, iron has been processed since the Iron Age. It continued into the Middle Ages, and was very important for the inhabitants well into the 19th century.

In the municipality is also the horse track &quot;Vaggerydstravet&quot; located, with full rights for betting. A good supply of the natural resources: iron, wood and water, and good communications with larger cities around the province made Vaggeryd a centre for many industries of various kind. A chair manufacturer established itself in the small town of Hagsfors in the 1863, producing the Windsor chair that since has become a standard furniture in Sweden and soon found a market in England.

More wood and carpentry industry sprung out during the 19th century. Manufacturing of different travelling equipages was important, and transportations and communication with other parts of the province were important, and so the wheel came to symbolize the thinking of the municipality. It is manifested in the coat of arms.

Other industries related to the resources are paper manufacturing and pulp mills. While nowadays, tourism makes up an important part of its industry.

Recently, the &quot;Vaggeryd model&quot; has been thought up by some locals and has since been adapted by some 30 other municipalities of Sweden. Its purpose is to create bridges between industries.

==Localities==
There are 4 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Vaggeryd Municipality.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Vaggeryd Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 27,601 residents, including 20,663 Swedish citizens of voting age. 40.5% voted for the left coalition and 58.1% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==History==
The history of Vetlanda goes back to at least the medieval age when it was the seat for the regional assembly called &quot;þing&quot; (thing). According to the imaginations of Petter Rudebeck (1660–1710), Vetlanda was before that known as Vitala, and the centre of a mythological kingdom. However, all later archeological research has failed in finding any evidence of it. But the myth was popular during the 18th and 19th century, which displays in the naming of several companies and locations around the municipality.

==Sports==
Vetlanda boasts successful clubs in bandy (Vetlanda BK) and in motorcycle speedway (Vetlanda Speedway).

<text>Curwensville is a borough in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, United States, north of Altoona on the West Branch Susquehanna River. Coal mining, tanning, and the manufacture of fire bricks were the industries at the turn of the 20th century. In 1900, 1,937 people lived in the borough, and in 1910, 2,549 lived there. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the borough had a population of 2,567. The population of the borough at its highest was 3,422 in 1940.

==History==
Curwensville was named for John Curwen in 1799. Once the Borough was established and local government formed, many improvements were made to this country village, including sidewalks being laid on Filbert, Thompson, and Pine Streets in May 1855, the first bridge constructed in the borough in 1870, and in 1890 the first water system was established. The town began to do well financially because of the lumber trade along the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The leather trade has been and continues to be a large industry in Curwensville, Wickett and Craig. The Clearfield Cheese Company has been producing high-quality cheese out of Curwensville, Pennsylvania since 1938. In 1956, a man named Arnold Nawrocki came up with the idea to invent a method for wrapping cheese slices in cellophane, which drastically increased their shelf life and changed the modern cheese industry. Curwensville became the second borough of Clearfield County in 1851.

===Industry===
North American Refractories Company (NARCO) was a brick plant in Curwensville. The &quot;Brick Yard&quot; as most called it in the community made many different types of brick. Seneca, acid, and cardic brick were all manufactured in NARCO. They were also noted for hot gun models and specialty shapes.

The sandstone quarry owned by Russell Stone Products, Inc. in Curwensville, PA, is a valued asset. Although the site had remained dormant for a lengthy period of time in the 1900s, today it is a viable source that has extensively supplied material for many prominent projects nationwide.

Lezzer Lumber founded in 1927, by Michael Lezzer and his cousins, Louie and Charlie Sandri. They specialized in building materials and farm equipment sales and repair. The company has been a source of lumber in the area since, though the original store burnt down in 1971. Lezzer Lumber has been expanding throughout Pennsylvania since, even opening a truss plant in 1999 to manufacture trusses to be shipped ready to install. Lezzer Lumber&#x27;s main headquarters is still located in Curwensville.

<text>DuBois is a city and the most populous community in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, United States. DuBois is located approximately northeast of Pittsburgh. The population was 7,510 as of the 2020 census. It is the principal city in the DuBois, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Settled in 1812 and platted in 1872, DuBois was incorporated as a borough in 1881 and as a city in 1914.

The town was founded by John Rumbarger, for whom the town was originally named. The Rumbarger Cemetery is all that survives of John Rumbarger&#x27;s &quot;original settlement&quot; in the city of DuBois. The town was later renamed for local lumber magnate John DuBois, who came from a longstanding American family of French Huguenot descent. Many of the town&#x27;s original buildings and homes were funded and or donated by Mr. DuBois&#x27;s lumber mill. In 1938, his nephew, John E. DuBois, donated the family mansion and estate as a permanent home for the DuBois Campus of Penn State University. While DuBois was founded as a lumber town, the mining of bituminous coal quickly became the chief industry in DuBois.

Over the years there have been numerous unsuccessful attempts in 1989, 1995, and 2002 to combine the city with the surrounding Sandy Township, but in 2021 voters in both municipalities successfully voted to consolidate into a new third class city, anticipated to take effect between 2024 and 2026.

== Local historical interest ==
=== Brewery ===

There seems to be some debate as to exactly when Frank Hahne came to DuBois and broke ground on his own facility. One source claims 1898, another 1897. It seems most likely that this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, that the &quot;DuBois Weekly Courier&quot; reported: &quot;Some new developments in connection with the brewery may be looked for in the near future.&quot;

There were a number of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from pollution.

By 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois Wurzburger, Hahne&#x27;s Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between DuBois Brewing and Anheuser-Busch.

The DuBois brands soon traveled far and wide for a brewery of its size, ranging up to away and selling well in Buffalo, Erie and Pittsburgh. The brewery&#x27;s 300-barrel kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas surrounding DuBois.

As with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing moved right along until 1918 and the advent of Prohibition. The brewery shifted production to &quot;near beer&quot; and soft drinks and opened the H&amp;G Ice Company. According to the April 7, 1933, &quot;DuBois Courier&quot;, the brewery won the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws since the 18th Amendment went into effect. As a result, DuBois Brewing Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing immediately upon the enaction of the 21st Amendment.

Frank Hahne died in 1932, and the brewery was passed to his only son, Frank Hahne Jr., whose own only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967.

The brewery was torn down in late 2003.

<text>Emmaboda Municipality (&quot;Emmaboda kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Kalmar County, in south-eastern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town Emmaboda.

The present municipality was formed in 1971, when the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Emmaboda (itself instituted in 1930) was amalgamated with three surrounding rural municipalities.

==Geography==
The municipality borders to the municipalities of Nybro, Kalmar and Torsås in Kalmar County; to Karlskrona and Ronneby in Blekinge County; and Tingsryd and Lessebo in Kronoberg County. The nearest cities in its vicinity are Kalmar (pop. 35,170), Karlskrona (pop. 32,606), Växjö (pop. 55,600), and Nybro (pop. 12,598).

It is part of Glasriket, &quot;The Realm of Glass&quot;, where people have been producing glass products at least since the 17th century, and transported them to the rest of Sweden. The glassworks in Emmaboda municipality are mainly &quot;Johansfors&quot;, &quot;Åfors&quot; and &quot;Boda&quot;, the latter being one part of the supplier for the glass sculptor Kosta Boda.

Those interested in nature activities will find many opportunities of fishing in the many lakes and streams stretching through the municipality.

===Localities===
There are 6 urban areas (also called a &quot;tätort&quot; or locality) in Emmaboda Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Emmaboda Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 9,300 residents, including 6,884 Swedish citizens of voting age. 47.3% voted for the left coalition and 51.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Culture==
&quot;The Emigrants&quot;, the works about the Swedish emigration to North America, written by Vilhelm Moberg that have spread around the world have put a focus on many places in the municipality mentioned in the novels. Moberg himself was born on a farm just north-west of the town Emmaboda in 1898, where a monument stone now stands since 1970. Nearby is also a small museum about the author. Duvemåla, the village where Karl Oskar and Kristina, the fictional main characters of the novels live, is also located in the municipality.

Historically, the dense forests in this area were a centre for Nils Dacke&#x27;s rebellion fights against King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, causing the king great troubles for a while, until he sent down troops gathered from the other provinces of Sweden. Naturally, the area today contains several remains and folk museums in honour of this time.

Every year in August, Emmaboda hosts a music festival called Emmabodafestivalen. The festival bill consists of various indie acts, mostly Swedish. In 2006 acts like José González and Hello Saferide played. The Magic Numbers were scheduled to play, but were held up at an airport and could not make it.

<doc id="132024" wikidata="Q515250" url="?curid=132024" title="Mönsterås Municipality">
<text>Mönsterås Municipality (&quot;Mönsterås kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Kalmar County, south-eastern Sweden, with its seat located in the town Mönsterås.

Mönsterås was an original market town &quot;köping&quot;, which in 1952 was united with the rural municipality by the same name. By the local government reform of 1971 it became a municipality of unitary type and amalgamated with &quot;Fliseryd&quot; and &quot;Ålem&quot; in 1974.

The municipal arms show the ridge which the town centre with its church has been situated on since the medieval age. The cross symbolizes the Knights Hospitallers, a monastic order that was built in the town in the fifteenth century and had a large influence on its development. It is an etymological design showing the origin of the name of the municipality: &quot;Mönster&quot; comes from monastery while &quot;ås&quot; means ridge.

== Geography ==
The coastal line is signified by an archipelago with some 300 islands and islets, whereof two are nature reserves. On the island farthest from land, the lighthouse of Dämman was built in 1873; an automatic lighthouse has replaced its function, but the house itself is visited by tourists and conferences.

The geography of the rest is by some parts covered with forests, as the Småland province generally is. There is also some agricultural areas closer to the sea. There are two rivers flowing through the municipality towards to sea: Emån and Alsterån, that designate the wildlife and geography.

<text>Mörbylånga Municipality (&quot;Mörbylånga kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Kalmar County, in south-eastern Sweden, located on the island of Öland in the Baltic Sea. The seat is located in the town of Mörbylånga, while the largest town is Färjestaden.

The present municipality, making up the southern part of Öland, was formed in 1974. The eighteen original entities (as of 1863) had during the nationwide subdivision reform of 1952 been regrouped into three larger units. &quot;Ottenby&quot; was amalgamated with Mörbylånga in 1967 and 1974 &quot;Torslunda&quot; was added.

Mörbylånga Municipality contains several ancient remains, just like the northern Öland municipality of Borgholm. All in all, there are about 20 hillforts on Öland. The most notable in southern Öland is the fortress Eketorp.

The southern parts of Öland contain certain wildlife areas. Many migratory birds halt here on their way north or south. Especially the southernmost outpost, the lighthouse &quot;Långe Jan&quot; (Tall John) is visited by many birdwatchers every day, as many birds flock here until setting away over the sea.

==Localities==
There are 9 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Mörbylånga Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Mörbylånga Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 15,717 inhabitants, with 12,229 Swedish citizens of voting age. 46.1 % voted for the left coalition and 53.1 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the first election after the municipal reform that was held in 1973. The results only include parties that have won representation in the Riksdag assembly at least once during this timeframe. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not listed at a municipal level by the SCB between 1988 and 1998 due to the party&#x27;s small size at the time. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the number of voters who cast a ballot in the polling station, but &quot;Votes&quot; only counts those casting valid ballots.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

Until then Nybro mostly consisted of minor industries, including a match factory, marked by its traditionally Småland forest nature, largely unsuitable for agriculture.

Nybro Municipality is in the eastern part of the &quot;Kingdom of Crystal&quot; area (Swedish: &quot;Glasriket&quot;), that covers a total of four municipalities.

==Localities==

In October 2020 the municipal council voted in favour of the building of Forsmark nuclear waste repository, with the final decision needing to be made by the Swedish government.

==Coat of arms==
Oskarshamn was named after King Oscar I of Sweden. The top of the coat of arms show the insignia of the King. In the other fields there are symbols for shipping (the anchor), trade (the staff of Mercury) and wealth (the cornucopia).

<text>Lessebo Municipality (&quot;Lessebo kommun&quot;) is a municipality in eastern Kronoberg County in southern Sweden, where the town Lessebo is seat.

The nationwide local government reform of 1971 saw the creation of the present municipality, when three surrounding municipalities were amalgamated with the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Lessebo (itself instituted in 1939)

In its history, Lessebo Municipality still honours the Swedish emigration in the late 19th century, whereby many poor farmers from Sweden – many of them from Småland – emigrated to the U.S.. When Vilhelm Moberg wrote his acclaimed novels about this time, he located his main characters&#x27; home to the parish of &quot;Ljuder&quot; in eastern Lessebo Municipality. An honorary &quot;Walk of the Emigrants&quot; also stretches through the municipality and continues to Karlshamn in the south.

==Localities==
There are 4 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Lessebo Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Lessebo Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

==Economy==
Lessebo Municipality is best known for the manufacture of glassware. It is located in Sweden&#x27;s so-called &quot;Glasriket&quot; (Realm of Glass), which also includes the municipalities of Uppvidinge, Emmaboda and Nybro.

The main glassblower company in Lessebo Municipality is Kosta Boda, established in 1742 as &quot;Kosta&quot;. They offer instruction for students wanting to learn the field.

Besides the glass industry, Lessebo Municipality also has a manufacturer of handmade paper which was established in 1693, today an exclusive product mainly used for finer documents.

<text>Uppvidinge Municipality (&quot;Uppvidinge kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Kronoberg County, southern Sweden, with its seat in the town of Åseda.

The present municipality, which took its name from a hundred, was formed by the local government reform of 1971 when &quot;Lenhovda&quot;, &quot;Nottebäck&quot;, &quot;Åseda&quot; and &quot;Älghult&quot; were amalgamated. The number of original entities, as of 1863, is six. The first amalgamation in the area (Granhult merged with Nottebäck) took place already in 1915.

The municipality has a rather small population but its slogan states &quot;In a Small Municipality Man Becomes Large&quot;.

More than 80% of the area is covered with forests, making it live up to the general public&#x27;s impression of the &quot;dark&quot; province of Småland. The name &quot;Uppvidinge&quot; itself means something like forest on a hill. The coat of arms is based on the insignia of Uppvidinge Hundred, from a document from 1568. It depicts a herb of unknown species in a red color.

==Localities==
There are 5 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Uppvidinge Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Uppvidinge Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

== Environmental work ==

Växjö Municipality has a long-term and strategic environmental and climate work and has called itself “The Greenest City in Europe” since 2007. It has its foundation in a long history of commitment to environmental issues, and ambitious goals for a green future. It is a vision shared with the citizens and the local companies.

In 2017 Växjö, was awarded the European Green Leaf Award 2018 by the European Commission. The prize is awarded to cities with less than 100 000 inhabitants that show good results and ambitions in terms of environment and committed to generate green growth.

=== Actions and results ===

In the early 1970s, Lake Trummen was restored with good results. Twenty years later, the same was done with Växjösjön and Södra Bergundasjön. This was done since the lakes suffered from eutrophication. Through dredging, the damaged ecosystems were restored and today the lakes are fully bath-friendly with a rich wildlife. The aim to receive good water quality for the whole lake system continues and in 2014 the Municipal Council decided to take new actions. 
In the 1980s, Växjö Energi AB, Veab, began small-scale use of biofuels in district heating. Thus, the heating plant became the first in Sweden to be fueled with biofuels in this way. In the coming decades, the project was expanded and in 2015, after the inauguration of a third co generation power plant, the heat and power production comes almost entirely from renewable sources.

In 1996, Växjö Municipality decided that it would be completely free from fossil fuels, to be achieved by year 2030. Between 1993 and 2015, carbon dioxide emissions in Växjö have decreased by 54%. This while the city has been able to show strong economic growth. In recent years, Växjö has invested a lot in high-rise wood buildings. Today Växjö is one of the cities where you find most ongoing projects of high-rise wood buildings in Sweden.

<text>Älmhult Municipality (&quot;Älmhults kommun&quot;) is a municipality in central Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. The town of Älmhult is its seat.

In 1901, Älmhult was detached from &quot;Stenbrohult&quot; and made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;). The present municipality was created by the local government reform of 1971, when Älmhult was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities.

Of historical significance is that the botanist Carl von Linné was born and grew up in the parish of Stenbrohult in the early 18th century. Today, the estate on which he was born and lived his first months has been turned into a museum at Råshult and is still surrounded by the same meadows and fields as 300 years ago.

Allegedly, the area has a variety of different specimens of plants, likely to trigger the interest of a botanical minded youngster. The geography is probably not distinguished from its neighbouring municipalities, however. Like all other Småland municipalities, it contains a variety of lakes, streams and especially forests.

The first IKEA store was opened in Älmhult by Ingvar Kamprad, who grew up in the municipality.

==Localities==

There are 5 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Älmhult Municipality.

<doc id="132071" wikidata="Q1187817" url="?curid=132071" title="Lock Haven, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lock Haven is the county seat of Clinton County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Located near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek, it is the principal city of the Lock Haven Micropolitan Statistical Area, itself part of the Williamsport–Lock Haven combined statistical area. At the 2020 census, Lock Haven&#x27;s population was 8,108.

Built on a site long favored by pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city&#x27;s growth through the end of the 19th century. In the 20th century, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.

The city has three sites on the National Register of Historic Places—Memorial Park Site, a significant pre-Columbian archaeological find; Heisey House, a Victorian-era museum; and Water Street District, an area with a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture. A levee, completed in 1995, protects the city from further flooding. While industry remains important to the city, about a third of Lock Haven&#x27;s workforce is employed in education, health care, or social services.

== History ==
=== Pre-European ===
The earliest settlers in Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000 BCE and 8000 BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding. Fluted point spearheads from this era, known as the Paleo-Indian Period, have been found in most parts of the state. Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000 years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE. First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.

===18th century===
In the early 18th century, a tribal confederacy known as the Six Nations of the Iroquois, headquartered in New York, ruled the Indian (Native American) tribes of Pennsylvania, including those who lived near what would become Lock Haven. Indian settlements in the area included three Munsee villages on the Great Island in the West Branch Susquehanna River at the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek. Four Indian trails, the Great Island Path, the Great Shamokin Path, the Bald Eagle Creek Path, and the Sinnemahoning Path, crossed the island, and a fifth, Logan&#x27;s Path, met Bald Eagle Creek Path a few miles upstream near the mouth of Fishing Creek. During the French and Indian War (1754–63), colonial militiamen on the Kittanning Expedition destroyed Munsee property on the Great Island and along the West Branch. By 1763, the Munsee had abandoned their island villages and other villages in the area.

With the signing of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, the British gained control from the Iroquois of lands south of the West Branch. However, European settlers continued to appropriate land, including tracts in and near the future site of Lock Haven, not covered by the treaty. 

In 1769, Cleary Campbell, the first European settler in the area, built a log cabin near the present site of Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, and by 1773 William Reed, another settler, had built a cabin surrounded by a stockade and called it Reed&#x27;s Fort. It was the westernmost of 11 mostly primitive forts along the West Branch; Fort Augusta, located by the confluence of the East (or North) and West branches of the Susquehanna at what is now Sunbury, was the easternmost and most defensible. In response to settler incursions, and encouraged by the British during the American Revolution (1775–83), Indians attacked colonists and their settlements along the West Branch. Fort Reed and the other European settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned in 1778 during a general evacuation known as the Big Runaway. Hundreds of people fled along the river to Fort Augusta, about from Fort Reed; some did not return for five years. In 1784, the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix, between the Iroquois and the United States, transferred most of the remaining Indian territory in Pennsylvania, including what would become Lock Haven, to the state. The U.S. acquired the last remaining tract, the Erie Triangle, through a separate treaty and sold it to Pennsylvania in 1792.

===19th century===
Lock Haven was laid out as a town in 1833, and it became the county seat in 1839, when Clinton County was created out of parts of Lycoming and Centre counties. Incorporated as a borough in 1840 and as a city in 1870, Lock Haven prospered in the 19th century largely because of timber and transportation. The forests of Clinton County and counties upriver held a huge supply of white pine and hemlock as well as oak, ash, maple, poplar, cherry, beech, and magnolia. The wood was used locally for such things as frame houses, shingles, canal boats, and wooden bridges, and whole logs were floated to Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, to make spars for ships. Log driving and log rafting, competing forms of transporting logs to sawmills, began along the West Branch around 1800. By 1830, slightly before the founding of the town, the lumber industry was well established.

The West Branch Canal, which opened in 1834, ran from Northumberland to Farrandsville, about upstream from Lock Haven. A state-funded extension called the Bald Eagle Cut ran from the West Branch through Lock Haven and Flemington to Bald Eagle Creek. A privately funded extension, the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation, eventually reached Bellefonte, upstream. Lock Haven&#x27;s founder, Jeremiah Church, and his brother, Willard, chose the town site in 1833 partly because of the river, the creek, and the canal. Church named the town &quot;Lock Haven&quot; because it had a canal lock and because it was a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other travelers. Over the next quarter century, canal boats wide and long carried passengers and mail as well as cargo such as coal, ashes for lye and soap, firewood, food, furniture, dry goods, and clothing. A rapid increase in Lock Haven&#x27;s population (to 830 by 1850) followed the opening of the canal.

A Lock Haven log boom, smaller than but otherwise similar to the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport, was constructed in 1849. Large cribs of timbers weighted with tons of stone were arranged in the pool behind the Dunnstown Dam, named for a settlement on the shore opposite Lock Haven. The piers, about from one another, stretched in a line from the dam to a point upriver. Connected by timbers shackled together with iron yokes and rings, the piers anchored an enclosure into which the river current forced floating logs. Workers called &quot;boom rats&quot; sorted the captured logs, branded like cattle, for delivery to sawmills and other owners. Lock Haven became the lumber center of Clinton County and the site of many businesses related to forest products.

The Sunbury and Erie Railroad, renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861, reached Lock Haven in 1859, and with it came a building boom. Hoping that the area&#x27;s coal, iron ore, white pine, and high-quality clay would produce significant future wealth, railroad investors led by Christopher and John Fallon financed a line to Lock Haven. On the strength of the railroad&#x27;s potential value to the city, local residents had invested heavily in housing, building large homes between 1854 and 1856. Although the Fallons&#x27; coal and iron ventures failed, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Italianate mansions and commercial buildings such as the Fallon House, a large hotel, remained, and the railroad provided a new mode of transport for the ongoing timber era. A second rail line, the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad, originally organized as the Tyrone and Lock Haven Railroad and completed in the 1860s, linked Lock Haven to Tyrone, to the southwest. The two rail lines soon became part of the network controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad.

During the era of log floating, logjams sometimes occurred when logs struck an obstacle. Log rafts floating down the West Branch had to pass through chutes in canal dams. The rafts were commonly wide—narrow enough to pass through the chutes—and to long. In 1874, a large raft got wedged in the chute of the Dunnstown Dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank with a pile of logs high. The jam eventually trapped another 200 log rafts, and 2 canal boats, &quot;The Mammoth of Newport&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Dunbar&quot;.

In terms of volume, the peak of the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs produced a total of of sawed lumber. After that, production steadily declined throughout the state. Lock Haven&#x27;s timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889.

The Central State Normal School, established to train teachers for central Pennsylvania, held its first classes in 1877 at a site overlooking the West Branch Susquehanna River. The small school, with enrollments below 150 until the 1940s, eventually became Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. In the early 1880s, the New York and Pennsylvania Paper Mill in Castanea Township near Flemington began paper production on the site of a former sawmill; the paper mill remained a large employer until the end of the 20th century.

===20th century ===

As older forms of transportation such as the canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and Mill Hall, about to the west. The trolley line extended from the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad station in Lock Haven to a station of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven&#x27;s downtown, close to the Normal School, across town to the trolley car barn on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and Nittany Valley Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, south of Mill Hall, and to Avis northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930.

William T. Piper Sr. built the Piper Aircraft Corporation factory in Lock Haven in 1937 after the company&#x27;s Taylor Aircraft manufacturing plant in Bradford, Pennsylvania, was destroyed by fire. The factory began operations in a building that once housed a silk mill. As the company grew, the original factory expanded to include engineering and office buildings. Piper remained in the city until 1984, when its new owner, Lear-Siegler, moved production to Vero Beach, Florida. The Clinton County Historical Society opened the Piper Aviation Museum at the site of the former factory in 1985, and 10 years later the museum became an independent organization.

The state of Pennsylvania acquired Central State Normal School in 1915 and renamed it Lock Haven State Teachers College in 1927. Between 1942 and 1970, the student population grew from 146 to more than 2,300; the number of teaching faculty rose from 25 to 170, and the college carried out a large building program. The school&#x27;s name was changed to Lock Haven State College in 1960, and its emphasis shifted to include the humanities, fine arts, mathematics, and social sciences, as well as teacher education. Becoming Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania in 1983, it opened a branch campus in Clearfield, west of Lock Haven, in 1989.

An industrial area in Castanea Township adjacent to Lock Haven was placed on the National Priorities List of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites, commonly referred to as Superfund sites, in 1982. Drake Chemical, which went bankrupt in 1981, made ingredients for pesticides and other compounds at the site from the 1960s to 1981. Starting in 1982, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began a clean-up of contaminated containers, buildings, and soils at the site and by the late 1990s had replaced the soils. Equipment to treat contaminated groundwater at the site was installed in 2000 and continues to operate.

=== Floods ===

Pennsylvania&#x27;s streams have frequently flooded. According to William H. Shank, the Native Americans of Pennsylvania warned white settlers that great floods occurred on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers every 14 years. Shank tested this idea by tabulating the highest floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 200-year period and found that a major flood had occurred, on average, once every 25 years between 1784 and 1972. Big floods recorded at Harrisburg, on the main stem of the Susquehanna about downstream from Lock Haven, occurred in 1784, 1865, 1889, 1894, 1902, 1936, and 1972. Readings from the Williamsport stream gauge, below Lock Haven on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, showed major flooding between 1889 and 1972 in the same years as the Harrisburg station; in addition, a large flood occurred on the West Branch at Williamsport in 1946. Estimated flood-crest readings between 1847 and 1979—based on data from the National Weather Service flood gauge at Lock Haven—show that flooding likely occurred in the city 19 times in 132 years. The biggest flood occurred on March 18, 1936, when the river crested at , which was about above the flood stage of .

The third biggest flood, cresting at in Lock Haven, occurred on June 1, 1889, and coincided with the Johnstown Flood. The flood demolished Lock Haven&#x27;s log boom, and millions of feet of stored timber were swept away. The flood damaged the canals, which were subsequently abandoned, and destroyed the last of the canal boats based in the city.

The most damaging Lock Haven flood was caused by the remnants of Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The storm, just below hurricane strength when it reached the region, made landfall on June 22 near New York City. Agnes merged with a non-tropical low on June 23, and the combined system affected the northeastern United States until June 25. The combination produced widespread rains of with local amounts up to in western Schuylkill County, about southeast of Lock Haven. At Lock Haven, the river crested on June 23 at , second only to the 1936 crest. The flood greatly damaged the paper mill and Piper Aircraft.

In 1992, federal, state, and local governments began construction of barriers to protect the city. The project included a levee of and a flood wall of along the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek, closure structures, retention basins, a pumping station, and some relocation of roads and buildings. Completed in 1995, the levee protected the city from high water in the year of the Blizzard of 1996, and again 2004, when rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan threatened the city.

==Geography==
Lock Haven is the county seat of Clinton County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land. About , 6 percent, is water.

Lock Haven is at above sea level near the confluence of Bald Eagle Creek and the West Branch of the Susquehanna River in north-central Pennsylvania. The city is approximately by highway northwest of Philadelphia and northeast of Pittsburgh. U.S. Route 220, a major transportation corridor, skirts the city on its southern edge, intersecting with Pennsylvania Route 120, which passes through the city and connects it with Renovo in northern Clinton County. Other highways entering Lock Haven include state routes 150, which connects to Avis, and 664.

The city and nearby smaller communities, including Castanea, Dunnstown, Flemington, and Mill Hall, are mainly at valley level in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, a mountain belt characterized by long, even valleys running between long continuous ridges. Bald Eagle Mountain, one of these ridges, runs parallel to Bald Eagle Creek on the south side of the city. Upstream of the confluence with Bald Eagle Creek, the West Branch Susquehanna River drains part of the Allegheny Plateau, a region of dissected highlands (also called the &quot;Deep Valleys Section&quot;) generally north of the city. The geologic formations in the southeastern part of the city are mostly limestone, while those to the north and west consist mostly of siltstone and shale. Large parts of the city are flat, but slopes rise to the west, and very steep slopes are found along the river, on the university campus, and along Pennsylvania Route 120 as it approaches U.S. Route 220.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Lock Haven is in zone &quot;Dfa&quot;, meaning a humid continental climate with hot or very warm summers. The average temperature here in January is , and in July it is . Between 1888 and 1996, the highest recorded temperature for the city was in 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature was in 1912. The average wettest month is June. Between 1926 and 1977, the mean annual precipitation was approximately , and the number of days each year with precipitation of or more was 77. Annual snowfall amounts between 1888 and 1996 varied from 0 in several years to about in 1942. The maximum recorded snowfall in a single month was in April 1894.

== Demographics ==
As of the census of 2020, there were 8,108 people living in the city. The average household size during the years 2018–22 was 2.19. The rate of home ownership was 33 percent, and the median value of owner-occupied units was about $133,000. The population density in 2020 was 3,248 people per square mile (8,410 per km2). The reported racial makeup of the city was about 91 percent White and about 4 percent African-American, with other categories totaling about 5 percent. People of Hispanic or Latino origin accounted for about 3 percent of the residents. Between 2018 and 2022, about 3 percent of the city&#x27;s residents were foreign-born, and about 3 percent of the population over the age of 5 spoke a language other than English at home. In 2020, the city&#x27;s population included about 5 percent under the age of 18 and about 15 percent who were 65 years of age or older. Females accounted for 52 percent of the total population. 

Between 2018 and 2022, of the people who were older than 25, 89 percent had graduated from high school, and 23 percent had at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In 2017, 126 businesses with employees operated in Lock Haven. The mean travel time to work for employees who were at least 16 years old was 21 minutes. The median income for a household in the city during 2018–22 was about $43,000 compared to about $75,000 for the entire United States. The per capita income for the city was about $24,000, and about 25 percent of Lock Haven&#x27;s residents lived below the poverty line.

== Economy ==
Lock Haven&#x27;s economy, from the city&#x27;s founding in 1833 until the end of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along Bald Eagle Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.

By 1900, the lumber industry had declined, and the city&#x27;s economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, maker of the Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city&#x27;s biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment rate of more than 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city&#x27;s labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city&#x27;s biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.

An eight-room home, the Heisey House, restored to its mid-19th-century appearance, displays Victorian-era collections; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is home to the Clinton County Historical Society. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has placed three cast aluminum markers—Clinton County, Fort Reed, and Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)—in Lock Haven to commemorate historic places. The Water Street District, a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture near the river, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Memorial Park Site 36Cn164, an archaeological site of prehistoric significance discovered near the airport, was added to the National Register in 1982.

The city&#x27;s media include &quot;The Express&quot;, a daily newspaper, and &quot;The Eagle Eye&quot;, the student newspaper at the university. Radio stations WBPZ (AM) and WSQV (FM) broadcast from the city. A television station, Havenscope (available on-campus only), and a radio station, WLHU (Internet station only, with no FCC broadcast license), both managed by students, operate on the university campus.

<text>Loganton is a borough in Clinton County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 469 at the 2020 census. Loganton is named after Chief James Logan.

==Geography==

==History==
In 1800, Sugar Valley (where Loganton is in) was part of Miles Township, Centre County. By 1819, Logan Township was formed out of Miles Township and all of Sugar Valley was called Logan Township, Centre County. In 1840, Clinton County was formed and that part that was Logan Township, Centre County was included in Clinton County. At this time, Logan Township, Clinton County was divided into two townships, Logan and Greene and Logansville was completely surrounded by Greene Township.

Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), celebrated Professor of Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was listed in 1790 as owning and having surveyed several thousand acres of “unseated lands” of what would later become part of Logansville. The portion of the Wistar tract of land on which Logansville eventually stood was bought by John Kleckner (who, in about 1800, built Sugar Valley’s earliest grist mill and a sawmill). He, in turn, passed the Wistar tract on to his son, Colonel Anthony Kleckner (1793-1860).

On the original survey maps the village was to be called Alpine but was officially called Logansville deriving its name from Logan Township and in turn was named after the Native American Indian, Chief James Logan, son of Chief Shikellamy.

<text>Renovo is a borough in Clinton County, Pennsylvania, United States, northwest of Lock Haven. In 1900, 4,082 people lived there, and in 1910, 4,621 lived there, but in the 2010 census the borough population was 1,228.

The borough is located on the West Branch Susquehanna River, and along Pennsylvania&#x27;s Bucktail State Park Natural Area, centered on Pennsylvania Route 120, which winds through the surrounding mountains following the river. The town is the home of the &quot;Flaming Foliage Festival&quot; held each October, generally on the second weekend, celebrating the fall colors of the trees on the area&#x27;s many mountains. The festival includes a parade and the crowning of a queen, usually chosen from one of the nearby high schools. The festival serves as a &quot;homecoming&quot; event for former residents of Renovo, many of whom return annually for the event. Various vendors from the surrounding areas sell food, clothing, and an array of novelties, memorabilia, and souvenirs.

The economy of Renovo and the surrounding area was primarily based on lumbering, until the first-growth forest was almost entirely stripped away, and the industry collapsed. There are also deposits of bituminous coal and fire clay in the region.

==History==

Renovo was built for and by the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad as the midpoint between Philadelphia and Erie. The town was laid out on a mostly-flat flood plain along the West Branch of the Susquehanna River in North-Central Pennsylvania, and was incorporated in 1866. Many of the buildings of what became the sprawling Railroad Shops complex were built before, during, and after the American Civil War.

The Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, along with many other relatively smaller lines eventually became incorporated into the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest corporation in the world with an annual GPO larger than the federal government, and is the only corporation in history to have paid out dividends due to its profitability for 100 years.

Unlike most &quot;rural&quot; towns and residential areas, Renovo was laid out in an industrially-oriented urban grid with avenues given names of the Great Lakes, and &quot;side streets&quot; numbered from 1 to 16. Houses were mostly built close to one another or incorporated into row houses. Houses with larger lots allowing for big yards were a rare luxury.

Before the town was completely built out, Renovo was known and advertised as a &quot;resort town in the mountains&quot;. One can still find newspaper ads and brochures extolling the restorative mountain air, clean water, and outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting. There were several large hotels in the town well before the turn of the 20th century. The railroad made access to this remote area seemingly quick and effortless for those living in other cities which enjoyed railroad service.

The town boasted dozens of bars and restaurants as well as churches which gave testimony to the forward-directed, optimistic, and vigorous energy which fueled the town&#x27;s growth and development. Most institutions which one would find in a town of the era or today, such as a hospital, YMCA, schools, taxi service, shops, clubs, lodges, fraternal organizations, professional services, and sports teams, were established.

The major employer was the Pennsylvania Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad shops. The shops were a massive complex, stretching from one end of town to the other, containing a 25 rail freight classification yard, service shops for diesel and steam locomotives, and even its own coal power plant. As long as the Railroad prospered, the town was a bustling center of activity. Some aspects of railroad business began to decrease as early as before World War II, but business surged back strongly during the War. However, further decline in demand for both passenger and freight transportation via the railroad came with the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the building of the Interstate Highway System, the surge of automobile ownership and use, and the consolidation of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Shop facilities to other locations such as Pittsburgh and Altoona.

The closing of the shops in the 1960s tolled the death knell for Renovo as an enterprising town with a future. Its present population is less than 2,000; it was once around 5,000. Many residents drive the two-lane, windy roads and I-80 to other towns for employment. There is also a substantial contingent of lifelong residents and transplants who are retired. The change in human activity over the years hasn&#x27;t dimmed or substantially altered the natural environment of this Allegheny Mountain area of the larger Appalachian Highlands.

In 1972, Renovo, along with many other parts of Pennsylvania were devastated by flooding and torrential rain from Hurricane Agnes, which stalled over the state, dumping up to 19 inches on parts of the state, and between 8 - 10 inches on Renovo.

In the 1980s, Renovo was a pawn in a large scandal, which sought to defraud the United States Government of millions of dollars. In 1983, a company called Chem-Con Corp. took over the vacant railroad shops after Berwick Forge &amp; Fabricating, which made railroad boxcars, closed. Chem-Con made seasheds, which are containers used to transport military vehicles, for the U.S. Navy. In 1986, Chem-con was first suspected of inflating costs to the government. The FBI began an investigation into Chem-com in the same year, and Chem-con was exposed for defrauding nearly $12 Million from the U.S. Government and Navy. In 1987, Chem-con filed for bankruptcy, and a company called American Coastal Industries resumed operations at the shop buildings, later going bankrupt too. This scandal and &quot;false hope&quot; for the town, bringing hundreds of the town&#x27;s unemployed back to work, in addition to a fire that tore through the business district on Erie Avenue, was devastating for Renovo, adding many more to the jobless and money-tight residents, who would eventually leave town for better opportunities.

== Renovo Energy Center ==
In early 2015, the Clinton County Economic Partnership announced that it would be working with Renovo Energy Center LLC. to plan out the construction of a new natural gas fired power plant on the site of the old Pennsylvania Rail Road shops across the tracks from Erie avenue. The project&#x27;s original planned construction date was 2017 but has since been pushed back. The project is expected to bring over 500 construction workers to Renovo and offer around 30 full time jobs. In November 2020, Renovo Energy Center LLC. asked the Pennsylvania DEP to review and change their clean air license to &quot;make its operations more efficient and the plant more attractive to investors&quot;. A Philadelphia-based activist group, the Clean Air Council, opposed the changes to the clean air license, posting their opposition on social media and mass mailing requests for public opposition to the plant.

On April 29, 2021, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced the approval of the Renovo Energy Center project&#x27;s air quality permit. After the permit&#x27;s approval, Renovo Energy Center LLC contracted Letterle &amp; Associates of Bellefonte, PA to conduct soil tests to assess the condition of the land.

In on May 27, 2021, three environmental groups, Clean Air Council, Penn Future, and the Center for Biological Diversity, filed an appeal for the air quality permit, saying, &quot;The permit allows the power plant to emit hundreds of tons of noxious pollutants annually and more greenhouse gases than the City of Pittsburgh. Despite DEP recognizing that Renovo is an environmental justice community, DEP failed to do the outreach required to community members before issuing the permit for one of the most-polluting facilities in Pennsylvania. The groups object to the permit on those grounds as well as the grounds that the permit allows unlawful levels of air pollution, that DEP ignored the costs to society in issuing the permit, and based on several other deficiencies spelled out in the Notice of Appeal. The groups said air pollution from the power plant would likely kill dozens of people over the course of the plant’s life and cost several billion dollars in impacts to health and communities. The power plant is being developed by Bechtel Corporation, a Virginia-based multinational engineering corporation. “Our members are deeply concerned about the very high levels of harmful air pollution from Bechtel’s enormous proposed power plant and the negative health effects it could have on our families and friends,” said Sue Cannon with Renovo Residents for a Healthy Environment. “This power plant is unwanted, unnecessary, and will provide no benefits to residents – only burdens.&quot;

On August 29, 2022, the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board granted partial summary judgement. In this partial ruling, Chief EHB Judge Thomas W. Renwand had ruled that the DEP &quot;has provided no basis for selecting a higher volatile organic compound emissions limit for the Renovo Energy Center facility&quot; and ruled in favor of the appellants. Following the ruling, REC project manager Rick Franzese stated, &quot;The REC project remains viable so long as the appeal of the project’s air permit is favorably resolved.&quot;

On April 14, 2023, Bechtel backed out of the proposed energy plant.

Maureen A. Ruhl was the key player in the demise of the proposed billion-dollar natural gas-to-electricity power plant. Ruhl proclaimed she wasn&#x27;t against the power plant itself, but the location which was anticipated to be less than a football field away from the residents&#x27; homes.

<text>Bloomsburg is a town and the county seat of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania and is located southwest of Wilkes-Barre along the Susquehanna River. It is the only Pennsylvania municipality incorporated as a town. As of the 2010 census, Bloomsburg had a population of 14,855, with an estimated population of 13,811 in 2019.

Bloomsburg is one of two principal communities of the Bloomsburg-Berwick, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan area that covers Columbia and Montour counties, and had a combined population of 85,562 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The first signs of European settlement date to the year 1772, when James McClure established a log cabin in the area. Until the mid-19th century, it was just a small village, known as Bloom Township. Traditionally, Bloomsburg&#x27;s founding in 1802 has been ascribed to settler Ludwig Eyer, son of Johann Martin Eyer, acting as agent for his brother Johann Adam. For 75 years after the discovery of ore in the area, Bloomsburg developed a booming iron industry.

Since its incorporation on March 4, 1870, Bloomsburg has held the distinction of being the only town in Pennsylvania. While some home rule municipalities may be styled as towns in their charters, they remain classified as either cities, boroughs, or townships. One particular point of confusion regards McCandless in Allegheny County, which remains a township despite taking the name &quot;Town of McCandless&quot; when adopting a home rule charter in 1975. Bloomsburg&#x27;s slogan of &quot;The only [incorporated] town in Pennsylvania&quot; reflects its unique status.

The Bloomsburg Historic District and Rupert Covered Bridge No. 56 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On October 28, 2015, a North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) blimp broke free from Aberdeen Proving Ground and headed north, taking out the town&#x27;s power supply as it went.

<text>Catawissa Township is a township near the borough of Catawissa, Columbia County, Pennsylvania. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 904 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Catawissa Township is the oldest municipality in Columbia County. It was first formed in 1785 from parts of Augusta Township. When first formed, Catawissa Township stretched from Montour County in the west to western Schuylkill County in the east. The creations of Roaring Creek Township, Franklin Township, and Main Township in 1832, 1843, and 1844 respectively, reduced the size of Catawissa Township significantly.

The first Native Americans to settle in the vicinity of the township were the Piscatawese, Conoys, or Gangawese, who built a wigwam in Catawissa. The first house in Catawissa Township was built in 1774 by Moses Roberts. By the mid to late 1770s, Quakers had arrived in the township. More settlers arrived in Catawissa Township in 1782. The same year, a group of Native Americans arrived in the area to re-establish a wigwam. This led to strife between them and the settlers, and several murders occurred.

In 1833, there were two furnaces and two forges within the boundaries of Catawissa Township as it was at that time.

The Hollingshead Covered Bridge No. 40 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==Geography==

Catawissa Township is located southwest of the center of Columbia County, across the Susquehanna River from Bloomsburg, the county seat. The township is bordered to the north and northwest by the Susquehanna, to the west by the borough of Catawissa, to the southwest by Franklin Township, to the south by Cleveland and Locust townships, and to the east by Main Township. Catawissa Mountain, elevation , occupies the southeastern part of the township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.01%, is water. Catawissa Creek flows east to west across the center of the township, entering Catawissa borough before emptying into the Susquehanna River.

===Geology===
Iron ore is abundant in Catawissa Township. The soil in the township consists of clay and gravel. The terrain in the township is predominantly hilly.

<text>Centralia ( ) is a borough and near-ghost town in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Its population declined from 1,000 in 1980 to five residents in 2020 because a coal mine fire has been burning beneath the borough since 1962. Centralia, part of the Bloomsburg–Berwick metropolitan area, is the least-populated municipality in Pennsylvania. It is completely surrounded by Conyngham Township.

All real estate in the borough was claimed under eminent domain in 1992 and condemned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Centralia&#x27;s ZIP Code was discontinued by the Postal Service in 2002. State and local officials reached an agreement with the then seven remaining residents on October 29, 2013, allowing them to remain in Centralia until their deaths, after which the rights to their houses will be taken through eminent domain. As of 2020, only five residents remain.

==History==
===Early history===
Many of the Native American tribes in what is now Columbia County sold the land that makes up Centralia to colonial agents in 1749 for £500. In 1770, during the construction of the Reading Road, which stretched from Reading to Fort Augusta (present-day Sunbury), settlers surveyed and explored the land. A large portion of the Reading Road was developed later as Route 61, the main highway east into and south out of Centralia.

In 1793, Robert Morris, a hero of the Revolutionary War and a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, acquired a third of Centralia&#x27;s valley land. When he declared bankruptcy in 1798, the land was surrendered to the Bank of the United States. A Philadelphia based sea captain, trader and banker who had been born in France, named Stephen Girard, purchased Morris&#x27; lands for $30,000, including 68 tracts east of Morris&#x27;. He had learned that there was anthracite coal in the region.

The Centralia coal deposits were largely overlooked before the construction of the Mine Run Railroad in 1854. In 1832, Johnathan Faust opened the Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern in what was called Roaring Creek Township; this gave the town its first name, Bull&#x27;s Head. In 1842, Centralia&#x27;s land was bought by the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Alexander Rae, a mining engineer, moved his family in and began planning a village, laying out streets and lots for development. Rae named the town Centreville, but in 1865 changed it to Centralia because the U.S. Post Office already had a Centreville in Schuylkill County. The Mine Run Railroad was built in 1854 to transport coal out of the valley.

=== Mining begins ===

The first two mines in Centralia opened in 1856, the Locust Run Mine and the Coal Ridge Mine. Afterward came the Hazeldell Colliery Mine in 1860, the Centralia Mine in 1862, and the Continental Mine in 1863. The Continental was located on Stephen Girard&#x27;s former estate. Branching from the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad was constructed to Centralia in 1865; it enabled transport and expansion of Centralia&#x27;s coal sales to markets in eastern Pennsylvania.

Centralia was incorporated as a borough in 1866. Its principal employer was the anthracite coal industry. Alexander Rae, the town&#x27;s founder, was murdered in his buggy by members of the Molly Maguires on October 17, 1868, during a trip between Centralia and Mount Carmel. Three men were eventually convicted of his death and were hung in the county seat of Bloomsburg, on March 25, 1878.

Several other murders and incidents of arson also took place during the violence, as Centralia was a hotbed of Molly Maguires activity during the 1860s to organize a mineworkers union in order to improve wages and working conditions. A legend among locals in Centralia tells that Father Daniel Ignatius McDermott, the first Roman Catholic priest to call Centralia home, cursed the land in retaliation for being assaulted by three members of the Maguires in 1869. McDermott said that there would be a day when St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church would be the only structure remaining in Centralia. Many of the Molly Maguires&#x27; leaders were hung in 1877, ending their crimes. Legends say that a number of descendants of the Molly Maguires still lived in Centralia up until the 1980s.

According to numbers of federal census records, the town of Centralia reached its maximum population of 2,761 in 1890. At its peak, the town had seven churches, five hotels, 27 saloons, two theaters, a bank, a post office, and 14 general and grocery stores. Thirty-seven years later the production of anthracite coal had reached its peak in Pennsylvania. In the following years, production declined, as many young miners from Centralia enlisted in the military when the US entered World War I.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 resulted in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company closing five of its Centralia-local mines. Bootleg miners continued mining in several idle mines, using techniques such as what was called &quot;pillar-robbing,&quot; where miners would extract coal from coal pillars left in mines to support their roofs. This caused the collapse of many idle mines, further complicating the prevention of the mine fire in 1962. Efforts to seal off the abandoned mines ran into the collapsed areas.

In 1950, Centralia Council acquired the rights to all anthracite coal beneath Centralia through a state law passed in 1949 that enabled the transaction. That year, the federal census counted 1,986 residents in Centralia.

Coal mining continued in Centralia until the 1960s, when most of the companies shut down. Bootleg mining continued until 1982, and strip and open-pit mining are still active in the area. An underground mine about three miles to the west employs about 40 people.
Rail service ended in 1966. Centralia operated its own school district, including elementary schools and a high school. There were also two Catholic parochial schools. By 1980, it had 1,012 residents. Another 500 or 600 lived nearby.

=== Mine fire ===

====Triggers====
Analysts disagree about the specific cause of the Centralia fire. David Dekok, author of &quot;Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire&quot;, concluded that it started with an attempt to clean up the town landfill. In May 1962, the Centralia Borough Council hired five members of the volunteer fire company to clean up the town landfill, located in an abandoned strip-mine pit next to the Odd Fellows Cemetery just outside the borough limits. This had been done prior to Memorial Day in previous years, when the landfill was in a different location.

On May 27, 1962, the firefighters, as they had in the past, set the dump on fire and let it burn for some time. Unlike in previous years, however, the fire was not fully extinguished. An unsealed opening in the pit allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia.

By contrast, other sources claim that the fire had started the previous day, when a trash hauler dumped hot ash or coal discarded from coal burners into the open trash pit. The author of &quot;The Day the Earth Caved In&quot; noted that borough council minutes from June 4, 1962, referred to two fires at the dump and that five firefighters had submitted bills for &quot;fighting the fire at the landfill area.&quot; The borough, by law, was responsible for installing a fire-resistant clay barrier between each layer of the landfill, but fell behind schedule, leaving the barrier incomplete. This allowed the hot coals to penetrate the coal seam underneath the pit and start the subsequent subterranean fire.

Another theory proposes that the Bast Colliery fire of 1932 was never fully extinguished, and that fire reached the landfill area by 1962; however, a miner named Frank Jurgill Sr. disputes that theory. Jurgill claims he operated a bootleg mine with his brother near the landfill from 1960 to 1962. If the Bast Colliery fire had not been extinguished, the brothers would likely have been overcome or killed by the noxious gases via many interconnected tunnels in the area.

====Immediate effects====
In 1979, locals became aware of the scale of the problem when a gas-station owner, then-mayor John Coddington, inserted a dipstick into one of his underground tanks to check the fuel level. When he withdrew it, it seemed hot. He lowered a thermometer into the tank on a string and was shocked to discover that the temperature of the gasoline in the tank was .

Statewide attention to the fire began to increase, culminating on February 14, 1981, when a 12-year-old resident named Todd Domboski fell into a sinkhole, wide by deep, that suddenly opened beneath his feet in his grandmother’s backyard, but saved himself by grabbing onto a tree root. His cousin, 14-year-old Eric Wolfgang, pulled Domboski out of the hole to safety. The plume of hot steam billowing from the hole was tested and found to contain a lethal level of carbon monoxide. At the time of the sinkhole collapse, U.S. Rep. James Nelligan and Governor Dick Thornburgh were visiting the town to assess the area.

Although there was physical, visible evidence of the fire, residents of Centralia were bitterly divided over the question of whether or not the fire posed a direct threat to the town. In &quot;The Real Disaster is Above Ground,&quot; Steve Kroll-Smith and Steve Couch identified at least six community groups, each organized around varying interpretations of the amount and kind of risk posed by the fire. In 1983, the U.S. Congress allocated more than $42 million for relocation efforts. Nearly all of the residents accepted the government&#x27;s buyout offers. More than 1,000 people moved out of the town and 500 structures were demolished. By 1990, the census recorded 63 remaining residents.

In 1992, Pennsylvania governor Bob Casey invoked eminent domain on all property in the borough, condemning all the buildings within. A subsequent legal effort by residents to overturn the action failed. In 2002, the U.S. Postal Service discontinued Centralia&#x27;s ZIP code, 17927. Only 16 homes were still standing by 2006, which was reduced to eleven by 2009 when Governor Ed Rendell began the formal eviction of the remaining Centralia residents. Only five homes remained by 2010.

The Centralia mine fire extended beneath the village of Byrnesville, a short distance to the south, and required it also to be abandoned.

===Condemnation and abandonment===


The underground fire is still burning, and in 2006 it was reported that it is expected to do so for another 250 years. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not renew the relocation contract at the end of 2005. The only indications of the fire, which underlies some spreading along four fronts, are low round metal steam vents in the south of the borough. Additional smoke and steam can be seen coming from an abandoned portion of Pennsylvania Route 61, the area just behind the hilltop cemetery, and other cracks in the ground scattered about the area. Several signs warn of underground fire, unstable ground, and dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. 

====Town and Residents====

Few homes remain standing in Centralia. Most of the abandoned buildings have been demolished by the Columbia County Redevelopment Authority  or reclaimed by nature. At a casual glance, the area now appears to be a field with many paved streets running through it. Some areas are being filled with new-growth forest. 

The last remaining house on Locust Avenue was demolished in September 2007. It was notable for a period for the five chimney-like support buttresses along each of two opposite sides of the house. The house had formerly been supported by a row of adjacent buildings. Another house with similar buttresses was visible from the northern side of the cemetery, just north of the burning, partially subsumed hillside.

Residents John Comarnisky and John Lokitis, Jr., were evicted in May and July 2009, respectively. In May 2009, the remaining residents mounted another legal effort to reverse the 1992 eminent domain claim. In 2010, only five homes remained as state officials tried to vacate the remaining residents and demolish what was left of the town. In March 2011, a federal judge refused to issue an injunction that would have stopped the condemnation.

In February 2012, the Commonwealth Court ruled that a declaration of taking could not be re-opened or set aside on the basis that the purpose for the condemnation no longer exists; seven people, including the borough council president, had filed suit claiming the condemnation was no longer needed because the underground fire had moved and the air quality in the borough was the same as that in Lancaster. In October 2013, the remaining residents settled their lawsuit, receiving $218,000 in compensation for the value of their homes, along with $131,500 to settle additional claims, and the right to stay in their homes for the rest of their lives.

====Route 61====

Pennsylvania Route 61 was repaired several times until it was closed. Smoke and steam caused extensive cracking in the pavement, which led to frequent closure. The current route was formerly a detour around the damaged portion during the repairs and became a permanent route in 1993. The damaged portion of PA Route 61 was abandoned, and became known as Graffiti Highway. Access berms were placed at both ends of the former route, effectively blocking off the area permanently to vehicular traffic. Pedestrian traffic was still possible due to small openings about two feet wide at the northern and southern terminus of the abandoned stretch of road. 

In April 2020, amidst the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the property&#x27;s current owners made the decision to cover over the graffiti on the highway section of old Route 61. Several hundred mounds of dirt were laid over the area, thus ending a decades-long fascination with the desolate stretch of road. Google Maps overhead satellite-view imagery copyright-dated 2023 shows the former Graffiti Highway almost entirely buried under hundreds of access-denial berms.

===Time capsule===
The town&#x27;s residents and former residents decided to open a time capsule buried in 1966 a couple of years earlier than planned after someone had attempted to unearth and steal the capsule in May 2014. The capsule was not scheduled to be opened until 2016 (50 years after it was buried). Items found in the footlocker-sized capsule, which had been inundated with about of water, included a miner&#x27;s helmet, a miner&#x27;s lamp, some coal, a Bible, local souvenirs, and a pair of bloomers signed by the men of Centralia in 1966.

==Mineral rights==
Several current and former Centralia residents believe the state&#x27;s eminent domain claim was a plot to gain the mineral rights to the anthracite coal beneath the borough. Residents have asserted its value to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact amount of coal is not known.

This theory is based on the municipality laws of the state. According to state law, when the municipality can no longer form a functioning municipal government, &quot;i.e.&quot;, when there are no longer any residents, the borough legally ceases to exist. At that point, the mineral rights, which are owned by the Borough of Centralia, would revert to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

==Demographics==
A sizeable minority of the population historically have been of Ukrainian or Russian descent, with the town once having both a Ukrainian Greek Catholic church (built 1911, still standing) and a Russian Orthodox church (built 1916, demolished 1986).

==Public services==
The Centralia Municipal Building still stands, along with its attached fire station garage. By the early 2010s, the building had fallen into disrepair, but new siding was installed in 2012. The building hosts the annual Centralia Cleanup Day, when volunteers collect illegally dumped trash in the area. Although past cleanup days avoided fire-impacted areas, the 2018 cleanup included areas around the landfill and the abandoned section of PA Route 61. Volunteers planted 250 apple trees around Centralia to restore the town&#x27;s ecosystem and wildlife habitats in April 2021. 

The borough council still had regular meetings . It was reported that the town&#x27;s highest bill at the meeting reported on came from PPL Electric Utilities at $92 and the town&#x27;s budget was &quot;in the black.&quot;

==Religion==
The remaining church in the borough, the town&#x27;s Ukrainian Catholic church, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, remains in use. It holds weekly services on Sundays and attracts worshippers from surrounding towns including people who were once residents of the town. It has not yet been directly affected by the fire. A geological survey found there was solid rock, not coal, under the church so it is not in danger of collapse due to the fire. 

The town&#x27;s four cemeteries—including one on the hilltop which has smoke rising around and out of it—are maintained in good condition. Saint Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Cemetery still stands on the northern edge of Centralia, and Saints Peter &amp; Paul Church and Cemetery, Saint Ignatius Cemetery, and the Odd Fellows Cemetery still stand on the southern edge of the town.

==Education==
The school district is the Mount Carmel Area School District.

==In popular culture==
Centralia has been used as a model for many different fictional ghost towns and manifestations of Hell. Prominent examples include Dean Koontz&#x27;s &quot;Strange Highways&quot; and David Wellington&#x27;s &quot;Vampire Zero&quot;.

Screenwriter Roger Avary researched Centralia while working on the screenplay for the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; film adaptation. While the movie took inspiration from Centralia, the original game series was not inspired by any town.

<text>Norrbotten County (, Meänkieli/, ) is the northernmost county or &quot;län&quot; of Sweden. It is also the largest county by land area, almost a quarter of Sweden&#x27;s total area. It shares borders with Västerbotten County to the southwest, the Gulf of Bothnia to the southeast, the counties of Nordland and Troms in Norway to the northwest, and Lapland Province in Finland to the northeast.

The name &quot;Norrbotten&quot; is also used for a province of the same name. Norrbotten province covers only the eastern part of Norrbotten County – the inland mostly belongs to the Swedish Lapland province (&quot;Lappland&quot;).

The capital of Norrbotten is Luleå. Other significant towns include Boden, Kiruna and Piteå. The majority of the population lives in the namesake province, whereas the Lapland part of the county is sparsely populated. Norrbotten covers a larger land area than both Austria and Portugal. The four largest municipalities in Sweden by land area are in the county. Sweden&#x27;s tallest mountain Kebnekaise and deepest lake Hornavan are both within the county. The vast mountains are the source of northern Sweden&#x27;s vast river systems running through Norrbotten.

The northern part of Norrbotten lies within the Arctic Circle.

== Provinces ==

Norrbotten County consists of the entire province of Norrbotten and about two thirds of Swedish Lapland.

== Geography ==
Norrbotten County covers almost one quarter of Sweden&#x27;s land area, but is sparsely inhabited. This is especially true for inland parts of Lapland.

The climate is generally cold, because of its northern location. However, the long summer days allow crops to ripen within two to three months, and agriculture is traditionally important, particularly near the coast and along the lower reaches of the Torne River. Grains, particularly barley, potatoes and turnips are grown to some extent, but the most important crop is hay for livestock. There are around 250,000 reindeer in the winter herd, a number regulated by the Swedish state. The reindeer are herded by the Indigenous Sámi, organised in 15 Sámi Mountain villages, 9 Forest Sámi villages and 8 concession Sámi villages. Hunting and fishing is of major importance for the local inhabitants.

Major rivers in Norrbotten County (listed north to south) include the Torne, the Lule River, Kalix River, and Pite River. Rivers shared with the Västerbotten County include the Skellefte River and Ume River. Other rivers that flow directly to the sea and that are at least 100 km long are the Sangis River, Råne River, Åby River, and Byske River.
The county includes many islands in the Bay of Bothnia, which make up the Norrbotten archipelago.
It is divided into the archipelagos of Piteå (550 islands), Luleå (1,312 islands), Kalix (792 islands) and Haparanda (652 islands).
The largest island is Rånön in the Kalix archipelago.

== Population ==
The population has increased during the last hundred years. The estimated 2002 population was 250,000. In the 1912 census, the population was 166,641 (4,000 more males than females), of which about 120,000 were in the Norrbotten province part. Twenty years earlier, in 1892, the population was only 110,000. Since the 1960s, however, most municipalities of the county have experienced a decrease in population, particularly those inland.

== Riksdag elections ==
The table details all Riksdag election results of Norrbotten County since the unicameral era began in 1970. The blocs denote which party would support the Prime Minister or the lead opposition party towards the end of the elected parliament.

== History ==
During the Middle Ages, Norrbotten was considered to be terra nullius (&quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;). The area was populated by Sami, Kvens and different people related to the Finns. From the Middle Ages on, the Swedish kings tried to colonise and Christianise the area. However; even today, Tornedalians and Sami people still live in the area and maintain their own culture and customs.

In the first half of the 17th century, several ore deposits were discovered in what is now known as Norrbotten County. The silver of Nasafjäll was discovered during the autumn of 1634 and subsequently mined from 1635 to 1659 and from the 1770s to 1810.

Following the Finnish War in 1809, Västerbotten County was split between Sweden and Finland, with the larger part remaining within the Swedish borders. In 1810, the county was divided again when &quot;Norrbotten County&quot; was created out of the northern part, on the Swedish side. Most people in Norrbotten County still refer to the entire county, including the areas in Swedish Lapland, when they say &#x27;Norrbotten&#x27;.

The natural resources (hydroelectricity, timber, and minerals, especially iron) of Norrbotten have played a key role in the industrialization of Sweden. The 20th century saw strong mobility in and out of the county, with many young people moving south and people from other parts of the country moving in. In the 1970s and 1980s, the drainage of (mostly young) workers due to high unemployment was considerable, and people in the area began to voice feelings of being misunderstood or economically abused by the south and especially the capital Stockholm.

=== Heraldry ===
The coat of arms of Norrbotten County combines the arms of the provinces Västerbotten and Lappland and was granted in 1949. Since 1995 the province Norrbotten has a coat of arms of its own, but the county arms have not been changed accordingly. When it is shown with a royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board. Blazon: &quot;Quartered, the arms of Västerbotten and the arms of Lappland.&quot;

=== Culture ===

Many different cultures can be found in Norrbotten County, including Sami culture, Tornedalian/Kven culture and the Swedish settler-culture. Many of the old local Swedish and Finnic dialects have survived in the area. The people of Norrbotten County have a saying: &quot;I am not a Swede; I am a Norrbothnian&quot;. A local way of speaking, coupled with understated irony, is also sometimes used as a means to exclude southerners. These contrasts are well known throughout Sweden and often appear in TV, films, literature and folklore connected to Norrbotten, for characterizing, satiric or dramatic purposes (e.g. some characters in the books of Eyvind Johnson or the police detective Einar Rönn in the crime novels of Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö).

The coast has the historical cities of Luleå and Piteå. Luleå&#x27;s Gammelstad (&quot;Old town&quot;), which is 10 km north of the present downtown, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Apart from the Swedish language, Sami, Meänkieli, and Finnish may be used in dealing with government agencies, courts, municipalities, preschools and nursing homes in parts of Norrbotten County. The Sami languages have official minority language status in Kiruna, Gällivare, Jokkmokk, Luleå, Arjeplog and Arvidsjaur municipalites. Meänkieli and Finnish have the same status in Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala, and Övertorneå, Luleå and Kalix municipalities.

== Administration ==
The main aims of the County Administrative Board are to fulfil the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to promote the development of the county, and to establish regional goals. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor (see List of Norrbotten Governors).

== Municipalities ==


The Sami languages have official minority language status in Kiruna, Gällivare, Jokkmokk, Luleå, Arjeplog and Arvidsjaur municipalites. Meänkieli and Finnish have the same status in Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala, and Övertorneå, Luleå and Kalix municipalities.

=== Foreign background ===
SCB have collected statistics on backgrounds of residents since 2002. These tables consist of all who have two foreign-born parents or are born abroad themselves. A majority of them are of Finnish descent. The chart lists election years and the last year on record alone.

==Transportation==
The main mode of person travel inside Norrbotten is by car. The distances are long, e.g. 345 km between Luleå and Kiruna.
The roads have been given relatively high speed limits compared to southern Sweden, usually 100–110 km/h.

Norrbotten has a railway network focused on heavy freight traffic. There are two main railways. Stambanan genom övre Norrland connects Norrbotten with central and southern Sweden. Malmbanan connects Luleå with the iron mines in Gällivare and Kiruna and the ice-free port of Narvik. Malmbanan has highest amount of freight traffic in Scandinavia, especially the part between Kiruna and Narvik.

Air travel is the main mode of travel between Norrbotten and southern Sweden. The main airport is Luleå Airport, sixth largest in Sweden. Other airports are 
Arvidsjaur Airport, Gällivare Airport, Kiruna Airport and Pajala Airport.

<text>Arjeplog Municipality (Swedish: &quot;Arjeplogs kommun&quot;, ; ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Arjeplog.

The area, which now is Arjeplog Municipality, used to be a single parish (Swedish: &quot;socken&quot;), which was made into a municipality when the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863. It has not been amalgamated with any other entity. In terms of geographical area, Arjeplog is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest, but it is also the country&#x27;s least densely populated municipality. The vast majority of the populace live in Arjeplog, which is one of Sweden&#x27;s smallest municipal seats.

==History==
People lived in the area of today&#x27;s municipality as early as 10,000 years ago, following the end of the last ice age. For a long time it was only populated by a fishing and hunting people, the Sami people, who have their own language and breed reindeer in northern Sweden, and today have special rights as a Swedish minority group.

The population in today&#x27;s municipality was only a few hundred people in the 17th and 18th century, most of them Sami, and the rest of Sweden did not know much of them. Not until 1640 did Queen Christina of Sweden order a church to be built in order to Christianize the Sami people in Arjeplog. The church was inaugurated in 1642. At first the deceased were buried under the earthen floor in the church, but eventually the stench became unbearable and the procedure had to end.

===Silver===
The interest in Arjeplog had been sparked when silver was found in the area in the 1620s, and a mining industry was established there 1635–1659. It has been estimated that the amount of silver mined was 36 kilograms per year.

In August 1659, the Danes and Norwegians – who were in the Denmark–Norway union – attacked and burned down the mining village. The mining industry was then stalled for 120 years.

It was once again taken up in 1719, probably as a means of supporting the war of King Charles XII of Sweden. The mining was upheld until 1810, when the low profits, harsh climate and the long distances led to its closure. There are still remains from that time in the village Adolfström.

There are also several names in the area such as &quot;Silvervägen&quot; (&quot;Silver Road&quot;) and &quot;Silversundet&quot; (&quot;Silver Strait&quot;) reminding of its silver history. When a Sami museum was built in the town of Arjeplog in 1965, it was appropriately named &quot;Silvermuseet&quot; (&quot;The Silver Museum&quot;). It is filled with Sami photos and artifacts.

==Geography==
Arjeplog Municipality is Sweden&#x27;s fourth largest municipality, but the fourth least populated. It is located by the shores of Lake Hornavan, Sweden&#x27;s deepest lake and one of its largest. The municipality is popular because of the scenery of Lake Hornavan, but also of its other untouched nature.

Arjeplog Municipality consists of a terrain dominated by the Scandinavian Mountains and many water areas. It boasts an unparalleled 8,000 lakes and streams, with three main rivers, namely Pite River, Skellefte River and Lais River. Skellefte River attaches south from Lake Hornavan and extends southeast to Skellefteå and the Gulf of Bothnia on the east coast.

About 80 kilometres north of the town Arjeplog one finds the national parks Padjelanta and Sarek, both being situated in the western parts of Jokkmokk Municipality.

Arjeplog Municipality also has 13 nature reserves, mostly mountain moorland, where endangered plants grow. Mountain Galtispouda, with a height of 800 metres, is both a popular place of outlook, a nature reserve, and in the winter a popular place for skiing.

===Localities===

There is only one locality (or urban area) in Arjeplog Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Arjeplog Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 2,705 inhabitants, with 2,126 Swedish citizens of voting age. 53.6% voted for the left coalition and 45.6% for the right coalition. The slight difference of results between the sole Arjeplog district and overall results was because of postal votes being counted separately. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party&#x27;s small size at a nationwide level SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results at a municipal level. The same applies to the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible voters casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of actual valid ballots cast.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Sister city==
Arjeplog Municipality has two sister cities:

* Umba, Russia
* Salla, Finland

<text>Arvidsjaur Municipality (; ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is Arvidsjaur.

==History==
Arvidsjaur Municipality was for a long time inhabited only by the Sami people. They were back then a hunting people, living off the abundance of fish and wildlife in the area. Archaeological discoveries suggest that people have been moving through the area for several thousands of years. The name &quot;Arvidsjaur&quot; itself comes from a Sami word which means &quot;generous water&quot; and was originally the name of the adjacent lake.

In the 14th and 15th century some farmers settled in the area. They acquired furs and skins from the hunters, and traded them off to southern regions, allegedly in vast numbers.

The Christianization of Arvidsjaur Municipality was slow, as it was in Norrland as a whole, because of the low population, the harsh climate and the long distances. It was also commonly believed that Norrland was inhabited by magicians.

Not until 1577 did the first settler, Per Käck, settle in Arvidsjaur. The settlers built the first chapel at the marketplace at the time, in 1560. The first church was inaugurated in 1604.

The Swedish minister and missionary Petrus Læstadius (1802–1841; brother of Lars Levi Læstadius, founder of the largest Christian revival movement in Norrland) collected old stories and myths in the area in the 19th century, which create the basis for our knowledge from that time.

==Geography==
Arvidsjaur Municipality is located about 110 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle, in the center of the northernmost land, Norrland. It is also part of the geographic area Lapland, which consists of the northern parts of Sweden, Norway and Finland. Sami people are an indigenous minority group who mainly live on breeding reindeer. Arvidsjaur Municipality still contains several Sami villages, and as a tribute to the Sami people a reindeer is the basis for the municipal coat of arms.

===Localities===
There are three localities (or urban areas) in Arvidsjaur Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Arvidsjaur Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Residents include everyone registered as living in the district, regardless of age or citizenship status. Valid voters indicate Swedish citizens above the age of 18 who therefore can vote in general elections. Left vote and right vote indicate the result between the two major blocs in said district in the 2022 general election. Employment indicates the share of people between the ages of 20 and 64 who are working taxpayers. Foreign background is defined as residents either born abroad or with two parents born outside of Sweden. Median income is the received monthly income through either employment, capital gains or social grants for the median adult above 20, also including pensioners in Swedish kronor. The section about college graduates indicates any degree accumulated after high school.

In total there were 6,139 residents, including 4,772 Swedish citizens of voting age. 56.0 % voted for the left coalition and 43.1 % for the right coalition.

In 1967 the rest of Överluleå was merged into the city together with a part of Råneå. In 1971 Edefors (which in 1892 also had been detached from Överluleå) was added and the present municipality was formed.

==History==
According to recent finds, the oldest human settlements are believed to be from around 5,000 BC. From this early time nothing is known (except some scarce finds). First accounted-for sources are from the 16th century, when Boden is referred to as &quot;Bodebyn&quot; or &quot;Bodarna&quot;, which may refer to the sheds (&quot;bod&quot; means &quot;shed&quot;). In 1543 there were seven farmers in the community (each farmer at that time might have several workers and a family). It was also mentioned that native Sami people were living in the proximity.

==Geography==
The closest larger city is Luleå, which is located some southeast on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Luleå is the largest city in Norrbotten County and hosts the main campus of Luleå University of Technology.

The main northern railway line, &quot;Stambanan genom övre Norrland&quot;, ends in Boden. By rail, Boden is connected to Luleå, and, on the same line, Uppsala, Stockholm, and finally Bräcke in the south.

===Localities===
There were six localities in the municipality as of 2018:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Boden Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 28,135 residents, including 22,002 Swedish citizens of voting age. 54.7% voted for the left coalition and 44.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Language==
In Boden Municipality, as in all of Sweden, there is no &quot;official&quot; language, but Swedish is by far the mostly used one. Some people are also, due to the proximity to the Finnish border, proficient in Finnish, and a few speak Sami. Nowadays, due to immigration, a lot of languages from around the world can also be heard.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Boden Municipality is twinned with:
* Alta, Norway
* Oulu, Finland 
* Apatity, Russia

All of these are northerly located, only Oulu being on a more southern latitude than Boden.

==Notable natives==
*Peter Englund, author, historian (tenth member of the Swedish Academy)
*Berit Granquist, fencer
*Eyvind Johnson, author (awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974)
*Niclas Wallin, ice hockey player (team member of the winner of the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Carolina Hurricanes)
*Tobias &quot;Tejbz&quot; Öjerfalk, online personality.

==Politics==
Following 2018 elections the municipal council is dominated by the Social Democrats despite their losing two seats compared to the previous elections. Two regional parties, Aktiv samling – Bodenalternativet and Health Care Party of Norrbotten, performed well, gaining 10 seats between them in the 49-member council. The head of executive is Social Democrat Claes Nordmark.

<text>Haparanda Municipality (; Meänkieli and Finnish: &quot;Haaparannan kunta&quot;) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Haparanda ().

In 1967 the &quot;City of Haparanda&quot; was merged with the rural municipalities Karl Gustav and Nedertorneå. Since 1971 Haparanda, like all other municipalities of Sweden, is a municipality of unitary type. However, it prefers to use the title &quot;stad&quot; (&quot;city&quot;) for the whole territory, including the non-urban parts.

==Geography==
In Sweden, Haparanda Municipality borders Övertorneå Municipality to the north and Kalix Municipality to the west.

Haparanda Municipality is located on the western side of where the Torne River discharges into the Bay of Bothnia. On the other side of the river lies the Finnish town Tornio (Swedish: &quot;Torneå&quot;). Haparanda and Tornio jointly call themselves &quot;EuroCity&quot;.

Although Haparanda has a boat harbor, it is not accessible for larger vessels and is not, as often thought, the Baltic Sea&#x27;s northernmost port, that honor most probably belonging to Töre further west on the Swedish coast.

The municipality includes the Haparanda archipelago, with 652 islands in the bay of Bothnia, part of the larger Norrbotten archipelago.
The Haparanda Archipelago National Park lies within the Haparanda group of islands. It includes the larger islands of Sandskär and Seskar Furö, and some smaller islands and skerries.
Some of the other islands in the Haparanda archipelago include Hanhinkari, Kataja, Seskarö, Skomakaren, Stora Hamnskär, Stora Hepokari and Torne-Furö.

===Localities===
There are five localities (or urban areas) in Haparanda Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Haparanda Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Haparanda has a high degree of people of foreign background since records were kept in 2002, mainly a result of cross-border connections with Tornio and Finland.
In total there were 6,198 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 47.7% voted for the left coalition and 51.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<doc id="132107" wikidata="Q512048" url="?curid=132107" title="Jokkmokk Municipality">
<text>Jokkmokk Municipality (, , , ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Jokkmokk.

The name &quot;Jokkmokk&quot; is Sami for the words &quot;river&quot; and &quot;bend&quot;, since the town is situated close to a bend in the nearby river. 

The municipality is the second largest in area of all Swedish municipalities and is, with an area of 19,477 km2 (approximately 7,520 square miles) slightly smaller than Slovenia or the US state of New Jersey. It has never been amalgamated with another entity, having been that large ever since municipalities were established in Sweden in 1863.

==History==
The name Jokkmokk is present in the Jokkmokk Lapland Court District, a historical jurisdiction. When the municipality was given its current borders in 1971, its municipal coat of arms were made to depict the hydro plant, the symbol of Luleå (to which Jokkmokk belonged until 1673), and the traditional Sami hammers.

==Geography==
The municipality is situated in the Scandinavian Mountains in Swedish Lapland and is sparsely populated. A large part of the area has been the habitat of reindeer herding Sami people for thousands of years and has for that reason been protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Laponian area. The Laponian area is roughly divided into the eastern flatlands and the western mountainous region. There are several well-structured and well-maintained starting locations for those interested in experiencing the majestic wilderness. For instance, the Kvikkjokk basecamp provides excursions and has a high quality hostel.

Due to the northern location, the aurora borealis can be experienced all through winter (November to March), and the midnight sun can be experienced during June and July.

The Lule River and the Lesser Lule River flows through the district. The rivers are heavily regulated for hydroelectricity, most of all in Sweden. 6 of the 10 largest hydroelectric plants are located in the area. This includes the 977 MW Harsprånget, the 480 MW Porjus, and the 460 MW Messaure. There&#x27;s a total of 11 hydroelectric plants in the area, 9 over 100 MW, 8 over 200 MW, and 4 over 400 MW.

===Localities===
There are three official localities (or urban areas) in Jokkmokk Municipality. The municipal seat is bolded:

Additional small settlements within the municipality include the Sami reindeer herding camp Udtja and the village of Puottaure.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Jokkmokk Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 4,769 residents, including 3,773 Swedish citizens of voting age. 59.6% voted for the left coalition and 38.9% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Attractions==
===National parks===
The four national parks in Jokkmokk Municipality all have their own distinct identity. The national parks are Sarek, Muddus, Padjelanta and Stora Sjöfallet.

These national parks are popular with tourists all year around but the darkest and coldest months (November to January) are not recommended for beginners. The best period for sunshine and winter activities is from February all through April, when the snow lies deep and the days are long. This time of year the national parks are easily accessible by snowmobile and skis. Visitors should understand and respect that the wilderness is just that, and snowmobiles are not allowed in the parks at any time.

The summer in Jokkmokk Municipality is short but intense. The ground is free of snow from May until late October, early November. As with most areas in the Nordic countries, the actual warm period is quite short, but as Jokkmokk Municipality has a continental climate, the temperature can top 30 degrees Celsius in the summer and reach as low as -40 degrees Celsius in the winter. During the summer months hikers and other friends of nature converge in the national parks and this is also the time when most of the parks are most easily accessed. Visitors should be warned that the amount of mosquitoes can be difficult to those not used to them and driving has an added danger in the reindeer that seek shelter from the mosquitoes. Collisions with reindeer are frequent in most of the northern parts of the Nordic countries and drivers should keep an eye out.

Fall is also short and the shifting colors of the wide forests make the surroundings burn with color. This is a good time for hiking but due to the shifting temperatures the mountainous parts of the national parks can be treacherous for those unprepared.

===Other attractions===

Jokkmokk is known for its Sami market held the first weekend every February. This market has been held for more than 400 consecutive years. Initially a gathering of traders from the entire region the market has long since grown to be more than a simple gathering of traders and is now a week-long cultural event with lectures, art exhibitions, concerts and much more.

==Mining==

There are iron ore deposits in the region, and the proposed Kallak mine, which has been met with resistance by activists, lies within the municipality. Mining exploration by British company Beowulf Mining has identified a potential mining site between the (non-Sami) villages of Björkholmen and Randijaur, which forms part of the reindeer winter grazing lands of the Sami community of Jåhkågasska tjiellde. 

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party&#x27;s small size at a nationwide level SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results at a municipal level. The same applies to the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible voters casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of actual valid ballots cast.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

<text>Kalix Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Kalix.

In 1924 Töre Municipality was detached from Nederkalix Municipality, forming a municipality of its own. In 1967 the two units were reunified, and the present municipality was created.

==History==
In historical times, Kalix was the name of the court district (Swedish: &quot;domsaga&quot;) Kalix Lower Court District. It covered two parishes: Nederkalix and Överkalix (literally &quot;Lower Kalix&quot; and &quot;Upper Kalix&quot;, respectively). The chalice on the coat of arms was present in the Nederkalix coat of arms in 1800, and was incorporated into that of Kalix Municipality in 1989. The choice of symbol originates from the similarity between the Latin root of chalice, &quot;calix&quot;, mug (itself borrowed from Greek kalyx, κάλυξ, shell, husk) and the local Sami pronunciation of &quot;Gáláseatnu&quot;, an ancient name for the Kalix River.

==Localities==
There are twelve localities (or urban areas) in Kalix Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Kalix Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 15,753 residents, including 12,447 Swedish citizens of voting age. 55.9% voted for the left coalition and 43.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party&#x27;s small size at a nationwide level, SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results at a municipal level. The same applies to the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible voters casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of actual valid ballots cast.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Language==
The traditional Swedish vernacular in Kalix is the Nederkalix dialect. It is not mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish, by which it has been largely replaced as the main language of the municipality. Finnish and Meänkieli are recognized minority languages in Kalix.

==Sport==

Kalix BF plays in the top tier of Swedish bandy, Elitserien. The municipality has two other bandy clubs, Karlsborgs BK and Nyborgs SK.

<doc id="132109" wikidata="Q83232" url="?curid=132109" title="Kiruna">
<text> (; ; ; ) is the northernmost city in Sweden, situated in the province of Lapland. It had 17,002 inhabitants in 2016 and is the seat of Kiruna Municipality (population: 23,167 in 2016) in Norrbotten County. The city was originally built in the 1890s to serve the Kiruna Mine.

The Esrange Space Center was established in Kiruna in the 1960s. Also in Kiruna are the Institute of Space Physics and Luleå University of Technology&#x27;s Department of Space Science.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Archaeological findings have shown that the region around Kiruna has been inhabited for at least 6,000 years.

Centuries before Kiruna was founded in 1900, the presence of iron ore at Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara had been known by the local Sámi population. In 1696, Samuel Mört, a bookkeeper of the Kengis works, wrote on rumours about the presence of iron in the two hills. The ore became better known after it was reported by Mangi, a Sámi man, in 1736 to Swedish authorities that had gathered in Jukkasjärvi Church. Soon after the reported finding Swedish senior enforcement officer and cartographer Anders Hackzell mapped the Kiruna area in 1736. He gave the mountains of the area their Swedish language names &quot;Fredriks berg&quot; (original Finnish name still in use as well: Kiirunavaara) and &quot;Berget Ulrika Eleonora&quot; (original Finnish name still in use as well: Luossavaara), after the King of Sweden Fredrik I and his wife Ulrika Eleonora.

Despite the findings of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century. It was extracted in summer and transported in winter, using sleds drawn by reindeer and horses. However, the costs were high and the quality of the phosphorus ore poor, until, in 1878, the Gilchrist–Thomas process, invented by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Gilchrist, allowed for the separation of phosphorus from the ore.

In 1884, a concession for a railway from Luleå to Narvik was granted to &quot;The Northern Europe Railway Company&quot;. The provisional railway between Luleå and Malmberget was finished in 1888 and the first train left Malmberget in March. Around the same time, the English company went bankrupt and had to sell the line to the Swedish state for 8 million Swedish crowns, around half the amount initially invested. After a significant rebuild, the railway to Gällivare could be used again and iron ore was extracted at Malmberget by Aktiebolaget Gellivare Malmfält (AGM).

At the initiative of Robert Schoug, the Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) was founded in 1890. In 1893, Gustaf Broms became CEO of both LKAB and AGM. LKAB pressed for continuing Malmbanan via Luossavaara and Kiirunavaara to the ice-free coast of Norway. The continuation of the railway line to Narvik was controversial, because opponents feared the influence of Russia (then controlling Finland and already connected to Sweden at Haparanda–Tornio) on an international railway line.
The decision to build was finally taken in 1898. The railway came to Kiruna 15 October 1899 and the Swedish and Norwegian sections were joined 15 November 1902. For LKAB, the great expense almost led to bankruptcy in 1901, just after the ore mining at Kiirunavaara had started. King Oscar II only opened the railway line 14 July 1903, preferring summer over winter to travel north.

The architects Per Olof Hallman and Gustaf Wickman were appointed to design the city, to be built at Haukivaara, near both iron ore mines, with then-revolutionary consideration of geographical and climatological circumstances; being built on a hill, winter temperatures are much milder than in other towns, and due to the street plan and the positioning, wind is limited. On 27 April 1900, Hallman&#x27;s plan was officially accepted.

Gustaf Broms proposed to name the settlements &quot;Kiruna&quot;, a short and practical name that could also be pronounced by Swedish-speaking inhabitants. The name means rock ptarmigan in Sámi and Finnish. LKAB appointed Hjalmar Lundbohm, who had finished neither high school nor his geology studies, as local manager in Kiruna.

=== Early history ===

Before the design for the settlement had been accepted, houses were built in a disorganized manner with illegal slums similar to those in the other mining town, Malmberget, south of Kiruna. Also, provisional buildings served as a church, a school, a hospital, a hotel and a police station. However, official residences were built at a high pace, and when the king opened the railway in 1903, all illegal residences and most other provisional buildings had been demolished and replaced. The very first building, &quot;B:1&quot;, is preserved and can be seen at &quot;Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården&quot;. In 1899, 18 people were registered as living in soon-to-be Kiruna. This increased to 222 in 1900, 7,438 in 1910 and 12,884 in 1930.

The residences did not fully keep up with this rapid growth; by 1910, there were 1,877 official rooms and some unrecognised residences, which meant that an average of three to four people lived in a single room; this density decreased steadily during the decades to follow. Kiruna became a municipalsamhälle (a community within a municipality) in 1908. This caused unhappiness in local organisations, such as &quot;Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Arbetareförening&quot;, that had hoped for status as köping, which would have kept more of the mining income inside the locality. In return, the mining company LKAB paid for a hospital, fire station, sewerage, roads, a church (opened 1912) and the priest&#x27;s home.
In April 1907, a tram began operation in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners would no longer have to walk several kilometres through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: &quot;bergbanan&quot; (funicular), &quot;stadsspårvägen&quot; (city tramway) and &quot;gruvspårvägen&quot; (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of and was unique due to the 1-meter gauge, double-glazed windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.

The iron ore industry was good in the early 20th century. Before the start of the work, Hjalmar Lundbohm worried whether the Kiruna winter would allow for working outside at all, but despite early research into underground mining, mountaintop removal mining was the primary method in the early years. Mechanisation was attempted early using steam powered excavators, but the cold climate led to considerable difficulties and only when electrical machinery became available in the 1910s, significant mechanisation was achieved. The peak of Kiirunavaara, &quot;Statsrådet&quot;, was above Luossajärvi until it was spectacularly blown off in 1910.

A general strike hit Sweden in 1909 and Kiruna was no exception. Hoping for a better future, thousands of people left Kiruna, including a group of 500 inhabitants emigrating to Brazil. Most of them returned, disappointed that life in Latin America was not what they had hoped it to be. Hjalmar Lundbohm personally lent money for the trip home to some of the emigrants.

During World War I, iron ore production dropped to the lowest level in LKAB&#x27;s history, and when exports increased again, a successful three-month strike in 1920 led to a 20% increase in salaries for the miners. Production dropped to a minimum in 1922 and a three-day work week was introduced, but during the &quot;fabulous twenties&quot;, it increased to a record nine million tonnes in 1927.

In 1921, mining started at Kiruna&#x27;s other hill, Luossavaara. However, the total amount of ore that could be mined in open pit mining here was small compared to Kiirunavaara, and LKAB preferred to concentrate resources in one place. Nevertheless, mining here continued until 1974 and later it became a research mine. While 19th-century mining in Kiruna had focused on Luossavaara the large-scale operation of LKAB focused on the Kiruna ore proper because it was both larger and not subject to legal restrictions that mandate Luossavaara ore to be refined in Sweden.

During the first decades of Kiruna&#x27;s existence, no road connected it to the outside world. The only connection was by railway or, as in the time before the railway, by boat (in summer) via the Torne and Kalix rivers to Jukkasjärvi and Håmojåkk and then proceeding by foot. A road from Kiruna was built to Tuolluvaara in 1901, Poikkijärvi in 1909, Alttajärvi in 1913 and connected to Svappavaara in 1926, from where roads already connected via Vittangi to Pajala and via Lappesuando to Gällivare and further south.

The Great Depression led to a 70% drop in ore production, a drop that would turn into a dramatic increase on the eve of World War II.

Although some tourists had already started coming to the area in the 19th century, the completion of the railway line truly made tourism possible. Tourists came for the rivers and the mountains, but also geologists and entire classes of students came to see the mine. Additionally, a yearly winter sports festival was started, which attracted people from a wide area. The Sami population was already a tourist attraction in the early days of Kiruna&#x27;s existence.

In the early 1920s a movement that became known as &quot;Kirunasvenskarna&quot; (the Kiruna Swedes) decided to emigrate to Soviet Russia, the land where they hoped for better working conditions and higher wages and general standards. They were the last Swedes who emigrated in groups. Most of these emigrants lived in Kiruna prior to their move.

=== World War II ===
The municipality of Kiruna shares borders with Norway and Finland and Kiruna is located relatively close to both countries. This led to many soldiers being transported to the area whenever mobilisation was requested; first in September 1939 after the German invasion of Poland, then in November 1939 after the Russian invasion of Finland, but in both cases, Swedish soldiers did not engage in any fighting. In March 1940, Churchill requested permission to transport soldiers from Narvik in Norway to Finland via Kiruna and Haparanda in &quot;Operation Catherine&quot;. Out of fear that the presence of British soldiers near the Kiruna ore mine would provoke a German attack on Sweden, the request was declined.

After the German invasion of Norway, at least ten soldiers were stationed along every bridge along Malmbanan, to blow up the bridges should the German army invade Sweden. Additionally, foreigners were banned from visiting Kiruna or the iron ore line, and only the Sami, military personnel, locals and people working for the government were permitted to travel between Kiruna and Riksgränsen.

After the battle at Bjørnfjell, 15 April 1940, wounded and fallen Norwegian soldiers were transported to Kiruna.

Despite the conditions for Swedish neutrality, rail cars with food, skis and helmets were transported from Kiruna to the Norwegian soldiers in Bjørnfjell.

Swedish iron ore from Kiruna was of major importance to the German war machine. A group of people working at LKAB organised in the Wollweberliga, planning to sabotage transports to Germany. In late November 1941, Edvard Nyberg, Ernst Wollweber and others produced a mine to be attached to the ore cars. Nyberg was caught, was fired from LKAB and spent years in prison. Upon his release, he founded &quot;Nybergs Mekaniska Verkstad&quot; which is still one of Kiruna&#x27;s biggest companies.

Germany requested that Sweden provide use of the railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to &quot;transitering av human karaktär, men ej underhåll till stridande trupp&quot; (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued that, now that Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported a large amount of military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.

During the war, up to 2,000 refugees from 20 countries were kept in Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south. However, small-scale sabotage, such as sand in the engines, was common and loose weapons often ended up at the bottom of the Luossajärvi lake, next to the railway stop.

North of Torneträsk, at Kaivare, a radio base &quot;Kari&quot; was built in secrecy and used by the Norwegian resistance. It was also used for the smuggling of arms to Norway and refugees from Norway.

=== Post-war ===
In 1948, Kiruna gained city rights and started to receive large amounts of money from the mine. The city centre was renovated starting in 1953; most buildings built before 1920 were demolished and replaced, and many of the current buildings were built in the following period. The town grew and new neighborhoods were built, as well as new apartment buildings and villas in existing neighborhoods. The area is currently known as &quot;Lombolo&quot; was built in the 1960s.

After World War II, the economy of Kiruna started to diversify. Initially, the mechanisation of the mining industry led to more mechanical workshops developing machinery for the mine, still dependent on the mining, but individual companies with spinoffs that could be sold to other areas than the Kiruna mine alone. In the 1950s, a fund, &quot;Norrlandsfonden&quot; was established, in which profits from LKAB would be invested in order to diversify the local economy. The municipality started to lend money to starting companies against very beneficial rates, a scheme that lasted until 1959 because the banks, that insisted this was false competition, had established more relaxed rules for lending out money. The industrial area east of the city was built in the 1950s to separate industry from neighborhoods.

On 10 November 1960, Kiruna Airport opened to separate civilian air traffic from the military airplanes that had landed at Kalixfors airport and at Luossajärvi since World War I. A road to Nikkaluokta was opened in 1971 and to Riksgränsen and Narvik in 1984. The latter had been debated heavily, for alternative plans existed to build the road to Norway on the northern side of Torneträsk, via Laimo, Kattuvuoma, Salmi to Innset and Bardu in Norway. This road was never built, but a 25 km long track between Laimo and Salmi was built at the initiatives of the locals and finished in 1962; however, this track, called Talmavägen, is not connected to any other road.

Increased communications were also beneficial for tourism. Swedish Railways had already run special trains before World War II, but started a special Dollar train in the summer months between Gothenburg and Kiruna, connecting to cruise ships from the United States. The canoe club Kiruna Långfärdspaddlare was founded in 1972 and rafting for tourists restarted after it had been discontinued for 20 years due to the drowning of Valfrid Johansson. Until the 1980s, tourism had been mainly a summer business, but touristic exploitation of dog sledging was started in 1983 in Jukkasjärvi. In 1990, the first Icehotel was built in Jukkasjärvi and advertised as the world&#x27;s largest igloo. It had been built using techniques from the building of Malmbanan 90 years before and was also inspired by the Snow Festival, that had started in 1986 to celebrate the Swedish Viking satellite. Since 1998, a special tourist area exists in the mine and since 1999, tourists can visit the various areas of research going on in Kiruna.

In 1957, the &quot;Kiruna Geophysical Observatory&quot; (KGO) (now the Swedish Institute of Space Physics) was founded and established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Esrange Space Centre is established in 1966. Here, rocket operations and ground-based observations are carried out since 1966, balloon operations since 1974, satellite operations since 1978 and testing operations since 2000 (with the Swedish Defence Material Administration). ESA has operated a satellite station at Salmajärvi, near Esrange, since 1989. In 1987, Umeå University started a space engineering program in Kiruna, and GIS education was started by Luleå University of Technology in 1991. In 1993, The Umeå space engineers moved to the same building housing IRF and a year later another Luleå University programme, civil engineering with specialisation in space technology, started at the same location. Since 2006, the &quot;Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Space Science and Technology&quot; has started with at least one semester spent at LTU. In 2007, education along IRV was split and only the Department of Space Science, belonging to Luleå University of Technology, remained, while the Umeå University programme in Space Engineering quit.

The Kiruna Icehotel has been built in Jukkasjärvi each winter since 1990 and is a major tourist attraction.

===Moving the town===
The re-development of Kiruna is a reconstruction project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by LKAB, undermines the existing town centre. Several buildings are to be moved or demolished. The town center is to be moved to the east.

In 2004, it was decided that the present centre of the municipality would have to be relocated to counter mining-related subsidence. The relocation was to be made gradually over the coming decade. On January 8, 2007, a new location was proposed, northwest to the foot of the Luossavaara mountain, by the lake of Luossajärvi.

The first actual work on moving the town was done in November 2007, when work on the new main sewage pipe started.

In the same week, the first sketches for the layout of the new part of the town became available. The sketches include a travel centre, the new locations for the city hall and the church, an artificial lake, and an extension of the Luossavaara hill into the city. The location of the new section of the E10 was still uncertain, as was the location of the railway and the railway station. A more official sketch was published early in spring 2008, which was then discussed with various interest groups before a further version was to be produced.

In June 2010, the municipal council decided that the town would be moved eastwards (to ), in the direction of Tuolluvaara, instead of the proposed northwestern location. The moving of the town was started in 2014, and the plan describes a process that continues to 2100. In the years 2012-2013, an international architectural competition concerning the vision, strategy, and design of a new city centre for a new Kiruna was arranged by the Municipality of Kiruna in partnership with the Swedish Association of Architects. White Arkitekter AB, based in Stockholm, together with Ghilardi + Hellsten Arkitekter, based in Oslo, Spacescape AB, Vectura Consulting AB, and Evidens BLW AB, won the competition with their masterplan and strategy for moving the city. The competition team was led by White Arkitekter AB, lead architect Mikael Stenqvist, SAR/MSA, in collaboration with Ghilardi + Hellsten Arkitekter, lead architect Ellen Hellsten. Together with researchers from Luleå and Delft universities, it envisages a denser city centre with a greater focus on sustainability, green and blue infrastructure, pedestrians, and public transport rather than automobiles. In 2018, the Swedish government announced that it would help arrange replacement work for radio corporation Radiotjänst after the city had been moved from its original location.

Starting in 2013, Danish explorer and photographer Klaus Thymann began a long-term project documenting the resettlement of the town. Using GPS-tagged imagery, he has returned multiple times since, replicating precise locations to show the changing landscape. In 2017 Thymann returned again to Kiruna to document the redevelopment of the town for Bloomberg Businessweek.

== Geography ==
Kiruna is located in the north of Sweden, north of the Arctic Circle. The city centre is built on the Haukavaara hill at an altitude of 530 m, high above the Torne river to the north and the Kalix River to the south. Other parts of the town are Lombolo and Tuolluvaara. Near Kiruna are the mountains Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara. Kiirunavaara is an iron ore mine that is the town&#x27;s primary economic resource. Luossavaara is a former mine and now used as a skiing slope.

The city is built near the lake Luossajärvi with outflow to the Luossajoki that flows in the Torne River at Laxforsen. The area around Kiruna is very sparsely populated. The northwest, west and southwest of Kiruna are dominated by the Scandinavian Mountains, visible from the city centre. Sweden&#x27;s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, is from the city centre and can be seen from it as well. To the west is Nikkaluokta and to the northwest are Abisko, Björkliden, Riksgränsen and the Norwegian town of Narvik, via the road. north of Kiruna is Kurravaara, on the edge of the Torne River. The land north of Kurravaara is roadless, uninhabited, partly barren and partly birch forest, up to the Norwegian and Finnish borders at Treriksröset. The lower-lying east is dominated by boreal forest, stretching thousands of kilometres through Finland and Russia. Around 15 km east of Kiruna is a group of villages at the Torne River, most notably Jukkasjärvi, where an ice hotel is built each winter, attracting tourists from all over the world. The twin cities Gällivare and Malmberget are some 120 km south of Kiruna.

Kiruna became a Swedish city on January 1, 1948, and was at one time listed as the largest city in the world by area, even if most of its territory was non-urban. After the Swedish municipality reform in the 1970s, the term &quot;city&quot; has been legally discontinued. Today only the built-up area is considered a de facto city.

=== Climate ===
Being located 145 km (90 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, Kiruna has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with short, mild summers and long, cold winters, although the city itself can be considerably milder than the surrounding forest. Snow cover generally lasts from late September to mid-May, but snowfall can occur year-round. The midnight sun between 28 May and 16 July (50 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. Polar night lasts from 11 December to 1 January (22 days), the exact boundaries depending on local topography. Even though Kiruna&#x27;s winters are very cold by Swedish standards, they are still much less severe than winters on similar latitudes in North America and Siberia, and even more southerly areas in other parts of the world due to some maritime influence. Similar winter temperatures go as far south as below the 45th parallel in the Russian Far East as well as the interior upper Midwest and northern New England in the United States. Kiruna however, has cooler summers than such areas, but still warm enough to stay above polar climate and below the northern tree line. Winter temperatures however are significantly colder than areas immediately affected by the Gulf Stream to a degree that the regular lows of Kiruna during January and February are similar to Tromsø&#x27;s all-time record low.

The coldest confirmed temperature ever in Kiruna was recorded at the nearby weather station with recorded in January 1999. The weather station recorded in July 1945, which is the all-time record. The warmest month on record at the weather station was July 2018, with average high temperatures of . Kiruna has a gloomy climate, affected by Atlantic low-pressure systems. Due to its extreme daylight cycle, the period between April and August account for 73% of Kiruna&#x27;s annual sunshine according to the 1961-1990 normals, whereas the five darkest months between October and February contain only around 10% of the annual sunshine.

=== Transportation ===

Kiruna is on the E10 road, connecting Luleå with Norway and passing near Gällivare (south of Kiruna) and Narvik (on the Norwegian coast). A short road connects to Kurravaara at the Torne river and ends there. Another road connects Kiruna with Nikkaluokta close to Kebnekaise and is used by tourists to get to the mountains. It passes by or nearby several villages in the Kalix river valley.

Buses connect Kiruna with major towns in Norrbotten province and villages nearby and in the wider region. The railway connects Luleå with Gällivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, Swedish Rail runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to Stockholm, a day train from Narvik to Luleå (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and Gothenburg), and trains to Luleå and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as &quot;Karven&quot; and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Björkliden and Riksgränsen, particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by Transdev in summer.
In 2013, the railway station was moved 2 km away from the city centre, so walking is possible but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival which starts from Kiruna bus station in the city centre.

Kiruna Airport is southeast of the city, 8 km by road. A few daily flights connect Kiruna with Stockholm, either directly or via Luleå or Umeå. An airport bus is available for all flights to and from Stockholm-Arlanda Airport.

== Economy ==

=== Mining ===
Mining plays a major role as a source of national income and employment for Kiruna and the surrounding region. As with most of Northern Sweden the area is rich with Magnetite which is mined to produce various Iron ore products which are then transported by rail to Narvik port in Norway to be shipped to customers around the world.
Large-scale mining in Kiruna started in the 19th century right around the time the major Swedish mining company LKAB was founded in 1890.

===Space research===
Space research started in the late 1940s.

The ESTRACK Kiruna Station of ESA, the European Space Agency, is located in the municipality. So is Esrange, the European Space and Sounding Rocket Range, as well as an EISCAT station and EISCAT scientific headquarters.

Also in Kiruna are the Institute of Space Physics and the Department of Space Science belonging to Luleå University of Technology.

In 2007, the Swedish government announced that Kiruna would be the host of Spaceport Sweden, signing an agreement with Virgin Galactic.

=== Tourism ===
In winter, the Icehotel in nearby Jukkasjärvi and the northern lights attract tourists. The long and certain snow cover, which generally lasts from October to May, and frozen lakes and rivers facilitate cross-country and alpine skiing, dog sledding and snowmobiling. There is ice climbing in the mountains and ice skating on lakes or rivers. The annual Snow Festival is held over the last weekend of January and includes scooter jumping, reindeer racing and an ice sculpture contest.

<text>Pajala Municipality (; Meänkieli and Finnish: &quot;Pajalan kunta&quot;) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden, bordering Finland. Its seat is located in the locality of Pajala.

In 1884 Tärendö was detached from Pajala Municipality, forming a municipality of its own. In 1914 Pajala Municipality was once again split when Junosuando broke away. They were reunited in 1971, when Korpilombolo was added as well.

Finnish and Meänkieli have the official status of being minority languages in the municipality.

==History==

Its geographical location infers that Pajala Municipality has always been a natural trading place, where people from Sweden, Finland and the native Sami people gathered. The annual Pajala market traces its history from the 18th century.

The home of Lars Levi Læstadius, famed botanist and Christian revivalist movement founder is located in Pajala. It is the red house to the right; it is now a museum. The yellow house in the middle was used as the local Lutheran vicar&#x27;s mansion from 1850 up to present day. 

==Geography==
The municipality is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest, geographically, at around 8,000 km², or roughly the size of the historical province of Södermanland, which - compared to Pajala Municipality&#x27;s population of approximately 6,500 - has more than one million inhabitants.

In Pajala is also &quot;Jupukkamasten&quot;, a 335 metre tall guyed mast for FM- and TV-transmission, which together with three other guyed masts of the same height is the tallest structure in Sweden.

===Localities===
There are four localities (or urban areas) in Pajala Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Pajala Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 4,657 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 56.0% voted for the left coalition and 42.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Government and politics==

===Riksdag===
These are the results since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party participated in 1994 but the results were not published by SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size at the time.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Överkalix Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Överkalix.

In 1870 a part of old Överkalix Municipality was detached from it, forming a municipality called Korpilombolo (now in Pajala Municipality). The municipality was not affected by the two subdivision reforms of the 20th century.

The coat of arms was designed in 1944 and based on the arms of the parish. Its exact meaning is not known, but many northern arms feature bears, reindeer or other animals.

==Geography==
Överkalix Municipality is situated along the south-going Kalix River. The unmodified scenic nature along the river attracts tourists and fishers every year. Within the municipality one also finds two of the river&#x27;s most powerful waterfalls, &quot;Jockfall&quot; (9 metres fall) and &quot;Linafall&quot; (16 metres fall).

Continuing north along the Kalix River one finds the iron ore mines. Travelling south towards the coast one finds larger towns, with Luleå being the closest, located some 100 kilometres south. Transportation is reliable thanks to the E10 highway.

The area otherwise contains much coniferous forests.

===Localities===
There are four localities (or urban areas) in Överkalix Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Överkalix Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 3,249 residents, including 2,574 Swedish citizens of voting age. 58.0% voted for the left coalition and 41.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Language==

The local Swedish dialect is known as &quot;överkalixmål&quot;, the Överkalix dialect. It is not mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish.

==Economy==
The municipality itself is the largest employer with around 430 employees. Thereafter follows &quot;Isolamin AB&quot;, a company making wall, ceiling and floor elements, with 110 employees. Other sectors:

*Service companies, 150 employees
*Forest and land companies, 45 employees
*Truck and bus companies, 35 employees
*Manufacturing companies, 20 employees

Traditionally the industry was dominated by forest industries, but this has decreased since the 1960s. It is estimated that the service sector will continue to expand and be the dominating sector some day. Many of those companies are in the field of computers and telecommunications.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party&#x27;s small size at a nationwide level SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results at a municipal level. The same applies to the Sweden Democrats between 1988 and 1998. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of eligible voters casting any ballots, whereas &quot;Votes&quot; denotes the number of actual valid ballots cast.

<text>Övertorneå Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden, bordering Finland. Its seat is located in Övertorneå.

Until the Finnish War (1808–1809) Övertorneå and the Finnish Ylitornio were a single parish. Following the war, the eastern part of the municipality was ceded to Russia as a part of Finland. In 1870 a minor part of Övertorneå Municipality was split off, forming the rural municipality Korpilombolo (now part of Pajala Municipality). In 1969 Övertorneå and Hietaniemi municipalities were merged, forming the present municipality.

Many places in the municipality have both a Swedish and a Meänkieli name, one of the minority languages of Sweden.

==Localities==
There are four localities (or urban areas) in Övertorneå Municipality:

===Smaller localities===
There are nine smaller localities in Övertorneå Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Övertorneå Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 4,211 residents, including 3,187 Swedish citizens of voting age. 58.1% voted for the left coalition and 40.9% for the right coalition. The relatively high degree of people with foreign background by Norrbotten standards is a result of cross-border connections with Finland. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag since the 1972 municipal reform. Norrbotten Party also contested the 1994 election but due to the party&#x27;s small size at a nationwide level SCB did not publish the party&#x27;s results at a municipal level.

The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party.

==Sights==

<doc id="132117" wikidata="Q255025" url="?curid=132117" title="Älvsbyn Municipality">
<text>Älvsbyn Municipality () is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Älvsbyn.

The present municipality has the same size as the original one, created at the time the municipalities of Sweden were formed in 1863. 1948-1968 a part of it constituted a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) and a municipality of its own, but the entities were reunited in 1969.

==Geography==
The municipality stretches along the Pite River for about 60 kilometres in a naturesque surrounding.

===Localities===
There are four localities (or urban areas) in Älvsbyn Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Älvsbyn Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 8,003 residents, including 6,194 Swedish citizens of voting age. 57.5% voted for the left coalition and 41.4% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Economy==
Two main industries in the town of Älvsbyn are &quot;AB Älvsbyhus&quot;, which builds houses, and &quot;Polarbageriet AB&quot;, which is nationally famous for their breads.

Polarbageriet has a production of about 1.5 million breads a day. They do not make loaves, but rather flat slices of a whitish bread. Their main distribution is within Sweden, but a small export goes to Finland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, where it is popular to use for homemade pizza.

Älvsbyhus has its base in Älvsbyn, and one of its factories there too. It is Scandinavia&#x27;s biggest producer of prefabricated homes in wood. Their average production is around two houses a day, although much of the production is located at other factories closer to the market.

RFN is a government military testing facility, not just for domestic use. It is one of very few places where live missiles can be tested over land, and attracts military testers from other countries as well.

There is also some tourism, with a popular place to visit in the nature reserve Storforsen, just west of Vidsel.

==Sister cities==
Älvsbyn Municipality has three sister cities:

* Fauske, Norway
* Haapavesi, Finland
* Monchegorsk, Russia

<text>Millville is a borough in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2023 census it had a population of 984. It is part of the Bloomsburg-Berwick micropolitan area.

==History==

John Eves, a native of Ireland living in Mill Creek Hundred, Delaware, is thought to have been one of the men to visit the Greenwood Valley and Little Fishing Creek area in 1770. (One account of this visit indicates that he purchased a sizable portion of the land he explored in the area from the Indians who had served as his guides on his journey.) Although he returned to Delaware after this initial visit, he returned the following year with his son Thomas and built a log cabin on the property. The entire Eves family arrived the next year, in 1772, and began tilling the fields adjacent to the cabin as soon as they could be cleared.

In 1774, the Eves family received a deed for their property in the valley, the largest land holding at the time in what would later become Columbia County. Title for the land, originally obtained by William and Elizabeth McMean in 1769, was passed to Reuben Haines, and then to John Eves.

An Indian uprising, the Battle of Wyoming, in mid-summer of 1778, caused the Eves family to flee their home in the valley and take refuge at a stockade near Washingtonville. Upon their return in 1785, they found their cabin burned and their fields overgrown, but immediately set about to recreate their homestead.

When the Eves family returned in the mid-1780s, they were determined to make the settlement permanent. They were accompanied or were soon followed by several other families, including Masters, Kisner, Battin, Parker, Lundy, Lemon, Oliver, and Rich. With 17 children and 104 grandchildren, John Eves looked after the building of homes for the family, a gristmill that was to stand for 100 years, and later a sawmill and several other essential structures.

Growth of the community was slow because it was not located along a main traveled route or major waterway. Until 1798, Indian trails, which crossed at Millville, were the only accessways to the area. In that year, a road was surveyed across the Mount Pleasant hills to the Susquehanna River. It was 1856 through before the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was laid out through Millville.

Early residents were almost entirely self-sufficient. Thomas Eves succeeded his father in ownership of the grist mill and built the first house in what is now Millville Borough. According to an early historian, David and Andrew Eves opened the first store in the area in 1827. David Eves was also commissioned the first postmaster in 1831, followed by his brother Andrew some years later.

While the early population was scattered, provision was made for both worship and education. In the early years of the community, services and classes were held in the homes, but in 1785, a school was started in Millville and a two-room meeting house was erected in 1795.

Local industry at the time consisted of those operations which were necessary to meet the needs of the early population. Sawmills and grist mills were the first, followed by a woolen mill, started in 1813 by John Watson, several brick plants, and a wagon shop, established by Charles Eves, in 1837.

One spurt of growth in Millville occurred in 1856 when the road from Bloomsburg to Laporte was constructed. The town experienced considerable growth in the years following construction of this roadway because the community now had adequate access to markets and other transportation links in Bloomsburg. A second period of growth was experienced in 1887 when the railroad was constructed through town. Numerous businesses and industries were created and buildings were erected to service the railroad. A local newspaper, the &quot;Weekly Tablet&quot;, published its first edition in April 1887.
