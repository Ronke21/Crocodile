== History ==

Elizabeth Town was founded in 1787 by Samuel Mackay, Colonel Stephen Bayard and his wife Elizabeth Mackay Bayard (for whom the town was named). Elizabeth was one of the first seven townships organized by Allegheny County the following year; the others being Moon, St. Clair, Mifflin, Versailles, Plum, and Pitt. The original Elizabeth Township comprised the entire triangle of land between the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers. In addition to present-day Elizabeth Borough and Elizabeth Township, this also included areas which are now Forward Township, Lincoln Borough, Port Vue Borough, Liberty Borough, the City of Glassport, and the Tenth Ward of the City of McKeesport.

In 1803, the keelboat used for the first stages of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was built in Elizabeth. (This claim is disputed by the city of Pittsburgh, which makes a similar claim. See references below.) On April 2, 1834, a charter was issued to incorporate the Town of Elizabeth as a borough.

In 1869, Forward Township and Lincoln Township were separated from Elizabeth Township.

=== Early industry ===
Among the earliest industries of Elizabeth were glass making, safe making, steamboat building, and ship building. Steamboats were built and repaired at &quot;O&#x27;Neil &amp; Company&quot; from as early as 1895, and the &quot;Elizabeth Marine Ways&quot; operated between at least 1898 to 1925. The town had two coal inclines in 1876, the O&#x27;Neil and Company Coal Incline on pool 1, and the Lobb&#x27;s Run Incline on pool 2.

===Nike missile site===
From 1956 to 1963, Elizabeth was the location of a Nike anti-aircraft missile site ().

<text>Fox Chapel is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a suburb of Pittsburgh located northeast of downtown. The population was 5,343 as of the 2020 census. The borough continually garners national prominence and is home to many of the wealthiest and most powerful patriciate families in Pennsylvania.

==History==
In the 1750s, the Seneca Indians lived in the region. Until the late 18th century, American Indian tribes hunted and fished in the general Fox Chapel area. Virginia and Pennsylvania both claimed the territory. The dispute was not resolved until after the Revolutionary War. Today, less than 1% of its population is Native American.

The first white settler in the area was James Powers, who arrived around 1790. The first schoolhouse was on Squaw Run, where it stood in 1806. It was a log house. A church was organized in 1818 on Kittanning Road, on a branch of Pine Creek. The Pittsburgh Field Club, which was established in 1882, moved to present-day Fox Chapel in 1915, and the Fox Chapel Golf Club opened in 1919. Shady Side Academy opened its senior school on property that was formerly two large farms, a gift from prominent Pittsburgh industrialist Wallace H. Rowe, in 1922. A nearby private estate, built in 1928 by steel industrialist James E. Lewis, became the academy&#x27;s standalone middle school campus in 1958.

==Geography==
Fox Chapel has six borders, including Indiana Township to the north, Harmar Township to the northeast, three of the five non-contiguous areas of O&#x27;Hara Township to the east, southeast, west and southwest, and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Lincoln–Lemington–Belmar to the south.

Four churches are located within the borough: Faith Methodist Church, Christ Church Fox Chapel, Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church, and Good Shepherd Lutheran Church.

In 1953 a group of families living in the Fox Chapel area began to worship together at Shady Side Academy; the congregation became Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church, located at the intersection of Fox Chapel Road and Field Club Road. The Rev. Bickford Lang served as the first pastor. The congregation was officially organized in October 1953 with 339 charter members. The chapel was erected in December 1953, and worship services began to be held on the site of the present church. The church facility has grown to include a Christian Education building, atrium, fellowship hall and a Georgian sanctuary. The Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church has been led by five senior pastors since its founding.

Chabad Fox Chapel - The Jewish Center, opened in 2002 and serves the entire Fox Chapel Area with a Jewish community center, Jewish day camp, Hebrew school and full adult education program with no membership fees.

==History==

Before Glassport was its own borough, the territory was part of Elizabeth Township, then of Lincoln Township, then Port Vue. In 1902, it became a separate municipality, comprising 1.52 square miles.

The town was built around a mill called The United States Glass Co., built in 1894. The factory came to be known as “the Glass House”. Other industries soon followed. The area was originally laid out in a plot plan by the Glassport Land Co., a subsidiary of the United States Glass Co.

Glassport was named after the Glassport Land Company.

The United States Glass Company was located near the Monongahela River on Seventh Street. The company specialized in &quot;pressed glass,&quot; tableware, and other glass products made from molds. In 1963, the United States Glass Company was damaged by a tornado, and their 80-foot water tower collapsed through the building&#x27;s roof. The furnaces shut down and the liquid glass cooled and hardened. Afterwards there was left a 250-ton block of solid glass, making any plans to rebuild too costly.

Former pro football player George Hays was born in Glassport. Jesse James of the Detroit Lions is from Glassport.

<text>Homestead is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Monongahela River southeast of downtown Pittsburgh. The borough is known for the Homestead strike of 1892, an important event in the history of labor relations in the United States. The population was 2,884 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

== History ==
The area on the south bank of the Monongahela River now comprising the boroughs of Homestead, Munhall and West Homestead saw the first white settlers arrive in the 1770s. One hundred years later, much of the existing farmland on the flats and hillsides by the river was purchased, laid out in lots and sold by local banks and land owners to create the town of Homestead. The town was chartered in 1880. The building of a railroad, glass factory, and in 1881 the first iron mill began a period of rapid growth and prosperity. In 1883, Andrew Carnegie bought out Homestead Steel Works, adding it to his empire of steel and coke enterprises. Carnegie had recently acquired a controlling interest in Henry Clay Frick&#x27;s coke works on the Monongahela, setting the stage for the dramatic labor clash in Homestead.

Homestead gained international notoriety in July 1892 as the site of a violent clash between locked-out steelworkers and hired Pinkerton guards, known as the Homestead Strike. When Henry Clay Frick, manager for Andrew Carnegie, owner of the local Homestead Steel Works, announced in the spring of 1892 that skilled workers would receive a reduction in wages, the advisory committee of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers refused to sign a new contract. Carnegie&#x27;s management locked the workforce out, declaring that the union would no longer be recognized at the steel works.

To break the strike and secure the mill from the disgruntled workers, industrialist Henry Clay Frick hired hundreds of armed toughs from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. When barges carrying the Pinkertons arrived at the mill on the morning of July 6, workers and townspeople met them at the riverbanks. Though eyewitness accounts differed on which side first fired a shot, a day-long armed battle ensued which resulted in eleven deaths and dozens of injuries. The governor of Pennsylvania eventually called out the National Guard to restore order to the town and take control of the mill. Frick successfully destroyed the union in Homestead and, by extension, in most of his other steel mills through the nation. The &quot;Battle of Homestead,&quot; as the event came to be known, represented a stunning setback for unionization in the highly mechanized steel industry. It also set the stage for the future steel strike of 1919, in which Homestead played an important role.

At the turn of the 20th century, in 1900, the population of Homestead was 12,554 people, of whom some 7,000 were employed in the plants. Due mostly to immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe, by 1910 the population jumped to 18,713, then to 20,452 in 1920. In the first decade of the 20th century, Homestead was studied as part of the sociological Pittsburgh Survey, the results of which were eventually published as &quot;Homestead: The Households of a Mill Town&quot;.

In 1940, 19,041 people lived in Homestead. During the early 1940s half the population was displaced as the United States government added to the steel mills to have the capacity for armor plating for ships and tanks (preparing for World War II). After the end of the war, a decline in the steel-making industry of the United States took place.

By 1980, it had become difficult to obtain employment at the Homestead Works, which was not producing much steel at that time. In 1986, the mill closed. The Homestead Works was demolished in the early 1990s, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2010 census, the borough population was 3,165. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.

==Arts and culture==
Much of Homestead and some of the surrounding communities are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Homestead Historic District. This historic district encompasses the site of the Homestead Strike of 1892, when the Carnegie Steel Company, under the leadership of Henry Clay Frick, broke the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers union. Of note is the Bost Building, a restored brick structure that served as headquarters for the strikers during the 1892 strike by workers at Carnegie Steel. The Bost Building, which was declared a National Landmark in 1999, and now houses a museum related to the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area.

The Carnegie Library of Homestead was opened to the public in 1898. It was the sixth library commissioned by Andrew Carnegie in the U.S. and the seventh to open. It is the third oldest Carnegie library in continuous operation in its original structure in the U.S. after the Main Branch and Lawrenceville Branch of Pittsburgh.

The historic St Nicholas Carpatho-Rusyn church, built in 1937, serves the local Rusyn community. Its domes were built using steel from local mills.

In 2000, Continental Real Estate Companies opened The Waterfront, a super-regional open air shopping mall built on the former site of the Homestead Steel Works. Most of the structures associated with the steel mills on this site were demolished during construction, although some of the brick stacks from the mill still stand. In addition, near the river is a former mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer.

The Great Allegheny Passage, part of a shared-use path connecting Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., runs through the borough parallel to the river.

==Transportation==
An important state route, Pennsylvania Route 837, runs through Homestead. Interstate 376 is only a few miles away from Homestead. For public transit, the Port Authority of Allegheny County has several bus routes running through Homestead that go to downtown Pittsburgh and to McKeesport.

Homestead is served by three railroads: the Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation and the Union Railroad. All three used to have large operations when the Homestead steel mill was open. Now that the mill has closed, only one company, WHEMCO, is served by the railroad. The Union Railroad had a large yard to serve the Homestead Works, which is now Waterfront Drive.

<text>Jefferson Hills is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. In the 2020 census, the population was 12,424. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
This borough&#x27;s history dates back to January 22, 1828, when it was created as a township from the old Township of Mifflin.

Jefferson Township became a first-class township in 1914, and in 1950 Jefferson was chartered as a borough. The borough of Pleasant Hills seceded from Jefferson Township in 1947 and by so doing, drastically reduced the population and urbanized area of the township.

Jefferson Hills is located along the southern border of Allegheny County and is primarily residential in nature, with approximately one-third of its area presently being used for residential purposes. The residential use is primarily single-family dwellings with slightly over one percent being multiple-family units. Another third of the borough exists in the form of open space and or vacant ground, with the balance being made up of industrial, commercial, mining, and farming land uses.

Present development has occurred almost exclusively in the flat upland areas. These developments are scattered and separated by large open tracts and or hills and valleys.

== History ==
Originally part of Pitt Township and the Depreciation Lands, reserved for Revolutionary War veterans, it was named after Jonathan Leet, a surveyor who laid out the town of Beaver Falls.

Leet&#x27;s brother, Daniel, also was a surveyor who bought several large lots in the area. Daniel Leet served on George Washington&#x27;s staff during the Revolutionary War.

Gen. Alexander Hays, a Pittsburgher who named the Mexican War Streets on the present-day North Side after that conflict, named his Civil War horse &quot;Leet&quot; after the family. One of the Leet descendants, David Shields, served as Hays&#x27; personal aide during the Civil War. After Hays died at the Battle of the Wilderness, a family friend gave his wife, Annie, a home and five acres on Big Sewickley Creek, which she named &quot;Fair Oaks&quot; after the battle in which her husband was promoted.

The original boundaries of the township included what are now Edgeworth, Leetsdale and part of Sewickley Heights.

After the Civil War, the residents decided to file a petition to form a separate municipality because they were upset at the level of services they received from Sewickley Township. The votes were counted at the home of Justice of the Peace John Way Jr., grandson of one of original property owners in the area, Caleb Way, a Quaker.

<text>Leetsdale is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located along the Ohio River, it is part of the Pittsburgh Metro Area. The population was 1,162 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Leetsdale was incorporated on March 28, 1904. Leetsdale at one time had a formidable industrial manufacturing base, with a Bethlehem Steel mill that closed in the late 1970s. The site of the mill on the shore of the Ohio River is now the Leetsdale Industrial Park, or the Port of Leetsdale, and is home to facilities leased, by The Buncher Company, to a number of companies of varying sizes. The Leetsdale Industrial Park was largely a brownfield until the 1990s. Today, only a few of the original buildings still stand. In 2022, CGI Steel and Nextracker renovated an abandoned steel factory to produce solar tracker equipment.

Leetsdale is also home to Elmridge, or the James Gardiner Coffin/John Walker house, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Leetsdale is located at (40.566667, −80.211274).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 13.91%, is water.

==Surrounding communities==
Leetsdale is bordered by Ambridge in Beaver County to the north, Leet Township to the northeast, and Edgeworth to the southeast. The borough includes the former town of Shields. The Ohio River forms the southwest border of the borough; across the river is Crescent Township.

==Government and politics==
On November 18, 2021, Democratic mayor Peter Poninsky, who had been mayor of the town for 19 years, lost his reelection bid to fellow Democrat Sandra Ford.

==Demographics==

<text>Paul Julius Oswald Teichmüller (; 18 June 1913 – 11 September 1943) was a German mathematician. He made contributions to complex analysis, including the introduction of quasiconformal mappings and differential geometric methods into the study of Riemann surfaces. The Teichmüller space is named after him, as is the Teichmüller character and the Teichmüller cocycle. 

Born in Nordhausen, Teichmüller attended the University of Göttingen, where he graduated in 1935 under the supervision of Helmut Hasse. His doctoral dissertation was on operator theory, though this was his only work on functional analysis. His next few papers were algebraic, but he switched his focus to complex analysis after attending lectures given by Rolf Nevanlinna. In 1937, he moved to the University of Berlin to work with Ludwig Bieberbach. Bieberbach was the editor of &quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot; and much of Teichmüller&#x27;s work was published in the journal, which made his papers hard to find in modern libraries before the release of his collected works.

A member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and Sturmabteilung (SA), the military wing of the NSDAP, from 1931, Teichmüller agitated against his Jewish professors Richard Courant and Edmund Landau in 1933. He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in July 1939 and took part in the invasion of Norway in 1940 before being recalled to Berlin to undertake cryptographic work with the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht. In 1942, he was released from his military duties and returned to teach at the University of Berlin. After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, he gave up his position in Berlin to volunteer for combat on the Eastern Front. He disappeared in unknown circumstances in September 1943.

Sanford L. Segal, a professor of mathematics at the University of Rochester, in his 2003 book &quot;Mathematicians Under the Nazis&quot; said: &quot;Teichmüller was a gifted, brilliant, and seminal mathematician; he was also a dedicated Nazi.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Paul Julius Oswald Teichmüller was born in 1913 in Nordhausen, and grew up in Sankt Andreasberg. His parents were Gertrude (née Dinse) and Adolf Julius Paul Teichmüller. At the time of Oswald&#x27;s birth, his father–an independent weaver by profession–was 33, and his mother was 39; they had no further children. His father was injured during World War I and died when Oswald was 12. According to Gertrude, when Oswald was three she discovered that he knew how to count and had learned to read on his own. After his father&#x27;s death, she took him out of his school in Sankt Andreasberg which &quot;he had long outgrown&quot; and sent him to live with his aunt in Nordhausen, where he attended the Gymnasium.

===Education===
Teichmüller received his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1931, and enrolled at the University of Göttingen as a &quot;brilliant but lonely student from the hinterlands.&quot; Hans Lewy, a young instructor at Göttingen at the time, later told anecdotes of the ungainly Teichmüller&#x27;s brilliance. Among Teichmüller&#x27;s professors were Richard Courant, Gustav Herglotz, Edmund Landau, Otto Neugebauer and Hermann Weyl. He also joined the NSDAP in July 1931 and became a member of the Sturmabteilung in August 1931. On 2 November 1933 he organised the boycott of his Jewish professor Edmund Landau; in 1994, Friedrich L. Bauer described Teichmüller as a &quot;genius&quot; but a &quot;fanatic Nazi&quot; who &quot;stood out with his agitation against Landau and Courant.&quot; Teichmüller later met Landau in his office to discuss the boycott, and penned a letter, at Landau&#x27;s request, regarding his motivation:
In 1934, Teichmüller wrote a draft dissertation on operator theory, which he titled &quot;Operatoren im Wachsschen Raum&quot;. The draft related to lectures he had received from Franz Rellich, but he did not bring his dissertation proposal to Rellich due to the fact Rellich was previously the assistant to the Jewish professor Richard Courant who fled Germany in 1933. Teichmüller instead brought it to Helmut Hasse. Operator theory was not in Hasse&#x27;s area of expertise, so he sent it to Gottfried Köthe. Köthe&#x27;s comments helped Teichmüller polish the dissertation, and Teichmüller submitted it for review on 10 June 1935 to his examining committee which consisted of Hasse, Herglotz and the Göttingen physicist Robert Pohl. Teichmüller passed his doctoral exam on 28 June 1935 and was officially awarded his Ph.D in mathematics in November 1935.

===Academic career===
After Teichmüller passed his doctoral exam in June 1935, Hasse petitioned for the university to appoint Teichmüller as an assistant professor in the mathematical department. In his letter he stated Teichmüller had &quot;extraordinary mathematical gifts&quot; and that his teaching style was &quot;painfully exact, in high degree suggestive, and impressive sort.&quot; Teichmüller received the position and began to devote himself more to mathematics at the expense of politics, which led fellow NSDAP members to describe him as &quot;eccentric&quot;.

Teichmüller&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was his only work on functional analysis, and his next few papers were algebraic, showing the influence Hasse had on him. In late 1936, he began to work on his habilitation thesis so that he could move to the University of Berlin to work with Ludwig Bieberbach, an outstanding mathematician, staunch supporter of the NSDAP and the editor of &quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot;. Teichmüller&#x27;s habilitation thesis, &quot;Untersuchungen über konforme und quasikonforme Abbildungen&quot;, was not influenced by Hasse, but by the lectures of Rolf Nevanlinna, who was a visiting professor at the University of Göttingen. Under the influence of Nevanlinna, Teichmüller moved away from algebra and developed an interest in complex analysis. He made four contributions to &quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot; in 1936, three of them algebraic, but thereafter he published just one algebraic paper.

Teichmüller moved to Berlin in April 1937, and habilitated at the University of Berlin in March 1938. In Berlin with Bieberbach, Teichmüller had someone who shared his political views and who was also an exceptional mathematician, which led to two years of great productivity. Between April 1937 and July 1939, Teichmüller published seven papers in addition to his 197-page monograph on &quot;extremal quasiconformal mappings and quadratic differentials,&quot; which laid the basis for the theory of the Teichmüller space.

===World War II===
On 18 July 1939, Teichmüller was drafted into the Wehrmacht. He was originally intended to do only eight weeks&#x27; training but World War II broke out before the eight weeks were up so he remained in the army and took part in Operation Weserübung in April 1940. Afterwards, he was recalled to Berlin where he became involved in cryptographic work along with other mathematicians such as Ernst Witt, Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner and Wolfgang Franz in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht.

In 1941, Bieberbach requested that Teichmüller be released from his military duties in order to continue teaching at the University of Berlin. This request was granted and he was able to teach at the university from 1942 to early 1943. After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, however, Teichmüller left his position in Berlin and volunteered for combat on the Eastern Front, entering a unit which became involved in the Battle of Kursk. In the beginning of August, he received furlough when his unit reached Kharkiv. His unit was surrounded by Soviet troops and largely wiped out by late August, but in early September he attempted to rejoin them. He is reported to have reached somewhere east of the Dnieper but west of Kharkiv (most likely Poltava), where he disappeared in unknown circumstances on 11 September 1943.

==Mathematical works==
In his career, Teichmüller wrote 34 papers in the space of around 6 years. His early algebraic investigations dealt with the valuation theory of fields and the structure of algebras. In valuation theory, he introduced multiplicative systems of representatives of the residue field of valuation rings, which led to a characterisation of the structure of the whole field in terms of the residue field. In the theory of algebras, he started to generalise Emmy Noether&#x27;s concept of crossed products from fields to certain kind of algebras, gaining new insights into the structure of p-algebras. Although from 1937 on his main interests shifted to geometric function theory, Teichmüller did not give up algebra; in a paper published in 1940, he explored further steps toward a Galois theory of algebras, resulting in the introduction of a group that was later recognised as a third Galois cohomology group.

After his habilitation in 1938, Teichmüller turned to questions in the variation of conformal structures on surfaces, raised earlier by Bernhard Riemann, Henri Poincaré, Felix Klein, and Robert Fricke. His most important innovation was the introduction of quasiconformal mappings to the field, using ideas first developed by Herbert Grötzsch and Lars Ahlfors in different contexts. Teichmüller&#x27;s main conjecture stated that variation of conformal structure can be realised uniquely by extremal quasiconformal mappings. Teichmüller also established a connection between extremal quasiconformal mappings and regular quadratic differentials using a class of related reciprocal Beltrami differentials, which led him to another conjecture proclaiming the existence of a bicontinuous bijective correspondence Φ between a space T1, of real parts of certain reciprocal Beltrami differentials and Mg, n the moduli space of all conformal structures considered. In fact, he proved the existence and injectivity of Φ.

Teichmüller also showed the existence of extremal quasiconformal mappings in the special case of certain simply connected plane regions. He then gave an existence proof for surface of type (g, 0) by a continuity argument from the uniformisation theorem and Finsler metrics. This was also intended as a first step toward a deeper investigation of moduli spaces; in one of his last papers he sketched an idea of how to endow moduli spaces with an analytic structure and how to construct an analytic fiber space of Riemann surfaces. Due to his early death, Teichmüller could not fully work out most of his ideas. However, they became seminal for later work by other mathematicians.

In 1984, Swiss mathematician Kurt Strebel gave an overview of Lars Ahlfors and Frederick Gehring&#x27;s 1982 work &quot;Oswald Teichmüller: Gesammelte Abhandlungen&quot;:

From 2007 to 2020, the European Mathematical Society published seven volumes of the &quot;Handbook of Teichmüller Theory&quot;. The volumes contain English translations of Teichmüller&#x27;s papers on complex analysis and on the field called Teichmüller theory. The volumes are edited by University of Strasbourg professor Athanase Papadopoulos.

The borough is within the Sto-Rox School District, which serves McKees Rocks and neighboring Stowe Township. The local high school is Sto-Rox High School.

The Pittsburgh, Allegheny and McKees Rocks Railroad was, and the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad is, located in an area along the river known as the &quot;Bottoms&quot;.

The McKees Rocks Bridge, which carries traffic between McKees Rocks and Pittsburgh, is the longest bridge in Allegheny County, at . McKees Rocks had one of the largest Indian mounds in the state, built by the Adena and Hopewell peoples a thousand years before Europeans entered the area.

In the past, the city was known for its extensive iron and steel interests. There were large railroad machine shops and manufacturers of locomotives and freight and passenger cars. Other factories produced springs, enamel ware, lumber, wall materials, plaster, nuts and bolts, malleable castings, chains and forgings, tin ware, concrete, and cigars.

McKees Rocks is also known as the birthplace of former Ohio Governor John Kasich and late television salesperson Billy Mays.

==History==
For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region. The Adena culture built a large earthwork mound here, which was a burial site. It was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture. This was the largest such mound in the state. The Carnegie Museum of Natural History excavated half the mound in 1896. Its archaeologists traced the construction history and unearthed the remains of 33 people. The mound crowned a high bluff that overlooks Chartiers Creek and the Ohio River. The bluff under the mound was quarried for municipal paving some time after the archaeological dig, eliminating what remained of the Indian burial site. This site was considered by George Washington as a possible location for Fort Pitt, which he eventually ordered built on the site of the destroyed French Fort Duquesne in what is now Pittsburgh&#x27;s Point State Park.

Around 1749, the French-Canadian explorer Pierre Joseph Celoron de Blainville visited the area and discovered a &quot;written rock&quot; inscribed with markings he believed were made by Native Americans. Celeron named the place after the rock, and it eventually became known as McKees Rocks. Writing in 1918, historian John Boucher stated that the inscriptions had &quot;long since faded away, if indeed they were anything other than marks made by English fur traders.&quot;

The borough derives its name from trader Alexander McKee, who also served as an Indian agent. He was given a tract of land in 1764 for his services during the French and Indian War. The name also related to a rocky projection into the river at this site. In 1769, the name McKees Rocks was placed on an official deed, and that year is considered to be its founding date. In 1892, it was incorporated as a borough. In 1900, 6,353 people resided in the borough; in 1910, 14,702; in 1920, 16,713; and in 1940, 17,021 people inhabited McKees Rocks. After industrial restructuring caused a loss of jobs in the city, the population declined, to 6,104 at the 2010 census.

Mann&#x27;s Hotel, which was possibly one of the oldest buildings in the Pittsburgh area, was located at 23 Singer Avenue in McKees Rocks. It was believed to have been built around 1803, although some sources put the construction in the 18th century. It is rumored that George Washington stayed there when he was surveying the Indian mound. In 1979, the building avoided demolition. When the county wanted to build a new Windgap Bridge beside the old one, it needed the space occupied by Mann&#x27;s Hotel. However, when a Public Utility Commission judge ruled the county had to pay to relocate the building, the county opted to build the new bridge in the place of the old instead. On October 12, 2009, Mann&#x27;s Hotel was condemned due to neglect and had to be demolished because of its deteriorating condition.

The &quot;Bottoms&quot; neighborhood is the site of the 16 feet high 85 feet diameter McKees Rocks Indian Mound, designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1896, archeologists of the Carnegie Museum, established the year prior, partially excavated the McKees Rocks mound, unearthing over 30 graves. Artifacts preserved from this excavation are the only parts of the mound that are intact today. A 1946 initiative to turn the mound into a national park petered out. By the 1950s, a large portion of the mound had fallen into the Ohio river. In 2001, an initiative to erect a historic marker was started, and on May 18, 2002 a Pennsylvania Historical Marker was dedicated at the base of the bluff. In the late 2000s, a disagreement over the remains moved from the mound was reported in local news. Industrial development, including a quarry and a cement plant have reduced the remainder and there is no public access today.

McKees Rocks was the site of one of the pivotal labor conflicts of the early 20th century, the 1909 McKees Rocks Strike. In the summer and early fall of 1909, some 5,000 workers of the Pressed Steel Car Company&#x27;s plant at McKees Rocks went on strike, joined by 3,000 others who worked for the Standard Steel Car Company of Butler and others in New Castle. The strike, led by organizers of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), was repressed by armed security guards and the state militia, resulting in at least a dozen deaths. The conflict involved participants on both sides.

In 1940, three decapitated bodies were found in boxcars in McKees Rocks during a routine train inspection. The train cars had apparently come from Youngstown. In fact, throughout the 1920s, various dismembered and decapitated bodies were recovered in or around the nearby swamp areas of New Castle and McKees Rocks. Despite similarities to a series of murders that had occurred in Cleveland during the same time period, the murders were never solved or officially connected to the killings in Ohio.

The multimillion-dollar, Father Ryan Cultural Arts Center opened in 2008, at 420 Chartiers Avenue, adjacent to the F.O.R. Sto-Rox Library (at 500 Chartiers Avenue). It offers many creative and performing arts courses to the public.

===Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods===
McKees Rocks is made up of several neighborhoods, such as West Park, Meyers Ridge, and &quot;The Bottoms&quot;. McKees Rocks has two borders by land: Kennedy Township to the west and Stowe Township to the north. Chartiers Creek separates McKees Rocks from two Pittsburgh neighborhoods and have connectors to both:
*Windgap to the southwest via Windgap Bridge. However, this is not a direct connection as a very small border of Kennedy Township separates the two communities in the middle of the bridge.
*Esplen to the south and southeast via Linden Ave. Bridge
Across the Ohio River, McKees Rocks runs adjacent to two other Pittsburgh neighborhoods:
*Brighton Heights to the northeast via McKees Rocks Bridge. As with Windgap, this is not a direct connection as Stowe Township separates the two neighborhoods in the middle of the bridge.
*Marshall-Shadeland to the southeast and under the east end of the bridge

David McKee emigrated from Scotland and was the first permanent white settler at the forks of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers, the site of present-day McKeesport, in 1755. Around the time of the French and Indian Wars, George Washington often came to McKeesport to visit his friend, Queen Alliquippa, a Seneca Indian ruler. The Colonial Government granted David McKee exclusive right of ferrage over those rivers on April 3, 1769, called &quot;McKee&#x27;s Port&quot;.

His son, John McKee, an original settler of Philadelphia, built a log cabin at this location. After taking over his father&#x27;s local river ferry business, he devised a plan for a city to be called McKee&#x27;s Port in 1795. John set out his proposal in the &quot;Pittsburgh Gazette&quot;, as part of a program under which new residents could purchase plots of land for $20.00. A lottery was used to distribute the plots to avoid complaints from new land owners concerning &quot;inferior&quot; locations.

===19th century===

McKeesport, then part of Versailles Township, began to grow in 1830 when mining of the large deposits of bituminous coal in the region began. The first schoolhouse was built in 1832, with James E. Huey as its schoolmaster.

McKeesport was incorporated as a borough in 1842, and the city&#x27;s first steel mill was established in 1851. The National Tube Works opened in 1872, and in the years directly following, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, McKeesport was the fastest growing municipality in the nation. Families arrived from other parts of the eastern United States, Italy, Germany, Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, with most working at the National Tube Works.

===20th century===

McKeesport rose to national importance during the 1900s as a center for manufacturing steel. In 1899, the National Tube Works Company was consolidated with twenty other pipemaking firms in the northeastern United States to form the National Tube Company. In 1901, the National Tube Company and nine other major American steel companies merged to form U.S. Steel.
The city&#x27;s population continued to grow steadily, reaching a peak of 55,355 in 1940. The subsequent decline since then is attributable to the general economic malaise that descended upon the region when the steelmaking industry moved elsewhere.

On June 23, 1944, an F4 tornado struck the southern part of McKeesport, killing 17 people. Many multiple-story residences collapsed. In all, 88 homes in the city were destroyed, 306 were damaged, and 400 other buildings were damaged or destroyed.

Thirteen years before both faced off in some of the most memorable televised Presidential debates, future presidents (and contemporary U.S. Representatives) Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy met in McKeesport for their first of five debates on April 22, 1947, to debate labor issues related to the Taft-Hartley Act.

On May 21, 1976, downtown McKeesport experienced the largest fire in the city&#x27;s history, referred to as the &quot;Famous Fire&quot;, due to the fire beginning in the &quot;Famous Department Store&quot; on Market and Fifth Streets. The fire destroyed seven downtown structures, heavily damaged more than 12 others, and started fires in at least 10 homes due to hot embers blowing more than a half mile due to heavy gusting winds. Around 1,000 firefighters from more than 40 neighboring fire companies responded to assist, and a contingent of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard were deployed. The McKeesport Daily News reported the next day that &quot;only shells and piles of rubble&quot; remained &quot;where city landmarks once stood.&quot;

National Tube closed in 1987, along with other U.S. Steel plants in the Mon Valley. The city, with the help of regional development agencies, has conducted efforts to revitalize the former mill sites.

==Law, government and politics==
===Government===
McKeesport operates under a home rule charter based on a “Strong Mayor”/Council form of government, adopted in 1974.

Under the Home Rule Charter, the Mayor is elected at large and cannot be a member of the City Council. The Mayor serves as the leader of the City government, and is vested exclusive executive and administrative authority. Under the Home Rule Charter, the Mayor may appoint a Deputy Mayor from among the department executives.

The current mayor of McKeesport is Democrat Michael Cherepko, a former City Councilman and McKeesport Area School District teacher, He was elected in 2011, defeating Independent candidate Raymond Malinchak and was re-elected for a second and third term, commencing in January 2016 and January 2020 respectively. Mayors assume office in the January following election.

Mayor&#x27;s Committees were first developed in their current form by Michael Cherepko and serve as advisory bodies with no formal powers. The Select Committee on Crime and Violence was formed in 2012, responsible for addressing the problems of crime and violence by utilizing resources and seeking funding for youth and adult initiatives. The McKeesport Message Committee was subsequently developed as a subgroup to promote the city&#x27;s message of &quot;Respect, Dignity, Hope, and Love&quot; which encourages residents&#x27; pride in the city. This subgroup promotes this through community and school engagement and creative marketing. The Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Community Issues was formed in 2014, responsible for providing dialogue between McKeesport residents, the Mayor&#x27;s Office and other city departments.

The McKeesport City Council consists of seven individuals elected “at large” for staggered four‐ year terms. A President and Vice President is elected among themselves. The Council acts as the legislative body and is responsible for establishing policy through the adoption of ordinances, resolutions, or motions. Most government action and legislative authority in City government rests with the City Council, as well as the confirmation of certain appointments by the mayor.

===Law enforcement===

The McKeesport Police Department is one of the largest municipal law enforcement agencies in the region, presently employing 52 sworn officers, and is one of the few departments in Allegheny County with its own detective bureau and traffic division. It operates closely with the Allegheny County Police Department, which provides investigative and forensic services for serious crimes such as homicide and the Allegheny County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, which provides transport and detention services. Other agencies also provide law enforcement within the city due to overlapping jurisdictions, such as the Port Authority Police Department, McKeesport Area School District, and Penn State Greater Allegheny Police &amp; Public Safety.

<doc id="131137" wikidata="Q1185796" url="?curid=131137" title="Millvale, Pennsylvania">
<text>Millvale is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Allegheny River, opposite Pittsburgh. The borough is located off Pennsylvania Route 28. The population was 3,376 at the 2020 census.

Current estimates place the 2024 population at around 3,247 residents.
==Geography==
Millvale is located at (40.482968, −79.973725).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.72%, is water.

Millvale is located at the confluence of Girty&#x27;s Run and the Allegheny River. Much of the borough is on a floodplain and has been subjected to extensive flooding at many times during its history. In particular, the borough&#x27;s business district frequently sustains substantial damage.

==History==
Prior to the European colonization, the Millvale area was the starting point of the Venango Path, a Native American trail which led Lake Erie. The Seneca people hunted and fished the lands. The European Simon Girty and his father settled in the area. During a major raid by Chief Tewea of the Lenape and Captain François Coulon de Villiers of the French, Girty&#x27;s stepfather was taken captive, tortured, and killed. Chief Guyasuta adopted Simon and assimilated him into Seneca culture. Due to his difficulty living with Europeans, Simon settled on the Venango Path near a creek which now bears his name. 

===18th century===
After fighting against the British Army in the American Revolution, Girty moved to Canada. The creek on which he settled is now called Girty&#x27;s Run Creek.

Following the victory of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, many Continental Army soldiers were awarded land. John Sample was awarded the Millvale area. Allegheny City later purchased 164 acres of the Sample estate to place a poor farm on the site, which ran for twenty-three years. The poor farm brought industry into Millvale, including an 1847 forge that became the rolling mill owned by Henry Phipps. Andrew Carnegie and Phipps later founded Carnegie Steel.

===19th century===
In 1849, Herrs Island and the adjacent riverfront land of Reserve Township spanning from its northeastern boundary near Girty&#x27;s Run downriver to Butcher&#x27;s Run were incorporated as the Borough of Duquesne, distinct from the modern city of the same name.

In 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased the right of way from the Pennsylvania Canal System. A massive influx of immigrants searching for work at the nearby railroad occurred at what is now the 40th Street Bridge resulting in the construction of a passenger rail station.

In 1868, Duquesne was partitioned with the downriver portion annexed by Allegheny City, and the land upriver of the northern end of Herrs Island joined with adjacent lands to the north and east taken from Shaler Township to form Millvale. 

On February 13, 1868, Millvale Borough was incorporated from parts of Shaler Township and Duquesne Borough with an initial population of 668. It was named after its industry, milling, and location, a valley. The borough expanded after the American Civil War and was connected to Lawrenceville via the Ewalt Covered Bridge and a narrow gauge railroad that would become part of Pittsburgh’s trolley system. At the turn of the century, Millvale annexed the Third Ward from the Shaler Township.

===20th century===
At the start of the Great Depression, Millvale was a target of the Works Progress Administration which attempted to reign in Girty’s Run Creek. The borough was also an important industrial center for America&#x27;s effort in World War II.

Following the conclusion of World War II, Millvale experienced an economic boom and, until 1952, the borough was served by the &quot;3 Millvale&quot; trolley operated by Pittsburgh Railways. America’s energy crisis and the downfall of the steel industries later led to a steady decline in population which continues through the present day.

==Surrounding communities==
Millvale has three land borders with Shaler Township from the northwest to east, the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Troy Hill to the southwest, and Reserve Township to the west. Across the Allegheny River, Millvale runs adjacent with Lower Lawrenceville and Central Lawrenceville. Millvale regularly collaborates with its northern riverside neighbors of Etna and Sharpsburg.

<text>Moon Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 27,261 at the 2020 census. Located northwest of Pittsburgh, the township is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area and is home to Pittsburgh International Airport.

== History ==

===18th century===
The initial settlement of Moon Township was a direct result of the westward expansion of English settlers and traders who arrived in the Ohio Valley in the early to mid-18th century. During the French and Indian War, the Iroquois, who controlled the land for hunting grounds through right of conquest, ceded large parcels of southwestern Pennsylvania lands through treaty or abandonment to settlers. In some cases, the land was already occupied by squatters who were to be forced off the land. In the face of this turmoil, Native American settlements of the south bank of the Ohio River typically relocated to more populous areas of the north bank in the current locales of Sewickley and Ambridge.

On the southern banks of the Ohio River, political disputes among settlers clouded the disposition of lands. Generally, the Pennsylvania Land Office apportioned land to owners through grants. However, some of the land encompassing what is now the Coraopolis Heights, Thorn Run valley, and Narrows Run valley were claimed through the process of &quot;Tomahawk Improvements&quot;, a non-specific and oftentimes contested method. Settlement processes were often convoluted because of differences among land policies of the several colonies claiming the land, specifically Pennsylvania and Virginia.

On April 3, 1769, Andrew Montour, an Indian interpreter who had provided service to the English settlers during the French and Indian War, was granted one of the first land patents for approximately of what later became the borough of Coraopolis and Neville Island. In 1773, the settler John Meek was awarded a land grant from Virginia above the river bottom and between the Thorn Run and Montour Run valleys, and &quot;Moon Township&quot; was born, although formal, legal recognition would have to wait until 1788.

The settlers Robert Loudon and John Vail were awarded grants to a total of . Loudon&#x27;s tract was situated on the Coraopolis Heights adjacent to the Meek grant. Vail&#x27;s grant was established between the current Thorn Run and Narrows Run valleys (although the exact location is open to some interpretation). Three other early grants were warranted by either Virginia or Pennsylvania land speculators. The boundaries of these land tracts are hard to identify, and the names of the original grantees are contested. But historians believe that they encompassed about or so, and were occupied by anonymous squatters. Given that the history is somewhat hazy, it remains that in abandoning their lands, the unidentified squatters ceded any potential claims to settlers who would otherwise improve and/or cultivate the land.

As the 18th century drew to a close, abandoned lands were taken up by new settlers who were drawn to the region by the fertility of the soil. This round of pioneers were, by and large, wealthier than their predecessors and had the means to develop the broken and hilly areas into plots suitable for farming.

Moon Township was created in 1788 as one of the original townships of the newly created Allegheny County. In 1789 by an act of the legislature a portion of Washington County south of the Ohio River was transferred to Allegheny County. The transferred area became part of Moon Township.

At this time Moon Township occupied an enormous tract of land, possibly . Some reports and, more often, legends of the time indicate that it would take one man on horseback two days to travel between the boundaries of the township. The sheer difficulty of settlers performing their civic duties (e.g., reporting to assigned polling places or attending jury trials) made it necessary for local governing authorities to parcel out the land into smaller municipalities. So, in 1790, the current Fayette Township was portioned off from Moon Township, to be followed by Findlay and Crescent townships, respectively.

===19th century===
In 1800, when Beaver County was created from Allegheny and Washington Counties that portion of Beaver County south of the Ohio River that it received from Allegheny County was in Moon Township. Upon the creation of Beaver County that portion of Moon Township that Allegheny County lost to Beaver County was divided into two new townships: First Moon and Second Moon Townships, Beaver County.

===20th century===
In 1943, the federal government designed and built a housing plan known as Mooncrest for defense workers. Mooncrest residents produced armor plates, munitions and ships at the nearby Dravo Corp. during World War II. Operated by the U.S. Air Force after 1945, homes were sold to private investors in the mid-1950s.

Moon became home to Pittsburgh International Airport in 1951, replacing the Allegheny County Airport as the main terminal for the region. The area developed mainly due to the airport. Prior to this time, the western hills of Allegheny County consisted largely of rolling farms and small residential developments. On April 1, 1956, TWA Flight 400 crashed on takeoff from the airport, killing 22 people just past the east end of the runway, which lies in Moon Township. Development of Pennsylvania Route 60 (now Interstate 376) to the Pittsburgh airport, plus the addition of the Parkway West from Pittsburgh and nearby exits of Interstate 79, allowed Moon to become the area&#x27;s crossroads for transportation via air and road.

During the Cold War, Moon Township was the location of Nike Site PI-71, which was a battery of Nike Ajax and/or Nike Hercules surface-to-air missiles, used by US armed forces for high – and medium-altitude air defense. The former missile site is now a nature preserve.

In 1991, the relocation of the landside terminal of the Pittsburgh International Airport to nearby Findlay Township resulted in a loss in traffic to the township. Moon experienced a significant loss of tax revenues but has since rebounded as the cargo area for the airport. A large part of the airport&#x27;s runways and facilities are located within the boundary of Moon Township, although the terminal and about half of the airport&#x27;s land area are in Findlay Township, to the west.

Since the loss of the airport terminal, the township has shifted its focus from airport commerce to corporate development, residences and university hub. The main campus of Robert Morris University is also located within the township.

Playing off the township&#x27;s unique name, supervisors in 2005 gave Moon a new slogan, &quot;Explore Our Universe&quot;. &quot;The slogan is a play not only on the township&#x27;s lunar name but also on Robert Morris University and the University Boulevard business corridor, which township officials would like investors and consumers to explore a little more thoroughly,&quot; wrote the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; in 2005.

Across the Ohio River to the northwest, a section of Moon runs adjacent with (from north to south) Edgeworth, Sewickley, and Glen Osborne. The Sewickley Bridge is the direct link between Moon Township and Sewickley.

==Economy==
Moon Township is home to Pittsburgh International Airport, the primary international airport serving Greater Pittsburgh, with Findlay Township. The township is home to the Air Force Reserve Command 911th Airlift Wing, which was established in 1943. Moon is also home to the 171st Air Refueling Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. Additionally, the Army has its 99th Regional Readiness Command, built in the late 1990s.

Major corporation headquarters in Moon include Nova Chemicals, FedEx Ground, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, and First Health/Coventry. Moon Township is the location of the National Weather Service forecast office that serves Pittsburgh.

Ground was broken in late 2006 on the new Cherrington Parkway extension. The extension, which opened in early 2008, created additional shovel-ready land for Class A office space, for corporate development.

As a result of Robert Morris University, the college feeds much of the economy along the township&#x27;s University Boulevard area.

US Airways was based at Pittsburgh International Airport and had its flight operations center in Moon until was closed following the 2015 merger of US Airways and American Airlines.

===Retail===
The West Hills Shopping Center, once the heart of Moon&#x27;s commercial business, was sold to Walmart for $4.7 million and announced to the public on January 3, 2007. Walmart officials announced their plans to build a supercenter location on the site of what was the West Hills Shopping Center. The store opened in fall of 2016.

On the morning of August 14, 2003, the former Beers School and Narrows Run Roads (from the I-376 Business Loop route to Thorn Run Road) became known as University Boulevard, a move that helped to promote the township as the home of Robert Morris University. The new road name also depicts the township&#x27;s efforts to re-emerge as a business-dominant community. Since the 2003 renaming, township officials have researched various zoning ordinances to piece together Moon&#x27;s main business corridor.

=== Presidential visits ===
Because Pittsburgh International Airport is adjacent to Moon, many presidential visits to the Pittsburgh area start in Moon. For example, President Gerald Ford made a surprise visit to Moon a day after pardoning President Richard M. Nixon on September 9, 1974. In 1994, President Bill Clinton greeted Prime Minister John Major of Great Britain at a hangar at the 911th Air Wing of the Air Force Reserve at the Pittsburgh International Airport in Moon Township. A day after securing the Democratic nomination for president, then–Vice President Al Gore held a rally at Moon&#x27;s high school gym on March 16, 2000. In September 2009, President Obama visited Pittsburgh for the G-20 conference. Then–Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held a rally on June 11, 2016, at the Moon Township airplane hangar. On March 10, 2018, then-President Trump held another rally at the Moon Township airplane hangar, campaigning in support of Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone for a special election within Pennsylvania&#x27;s 18th congressional district.

<doc id="131140" wikidata="Q1186932" url="?curid=131140" title="Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania">
<text>Mt. Lebanon (locally ) is a township with home rule status in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 34,075 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Pittsburgh. Established in 1912 as Mount Lebanon, the township was a farming community. With the arrival of the first streetcar lines and the development of the first real estate subdivision, both in 1901, it became a streetcar suburb, offering residents the ability to commute to Downtown Pittsburgh. Furthermore, the opening of the Liberty Tunnel in 1924 allowed easy automobile access to Pittsburgh. In 1975, the renamed Mt. Lebanon adopted one of the first home rule charters in Pennsylvania.

==History==
The first European settlers arrived in 1773–1774, having purchased the land from the descendants of William Penn; other pioneers soon bought land from the state government.

In 1912, Mount Lebanon Township was incorporated as a &quot;First Class Township&quot; under Pennsylvania state law. It had formerly been a part of Scott Township, which in turn traces its origins to the long-defunct St. Clair Township. Mount Lebanon was not named for two Cedar of Lebanon trees that were planted in 1850 on Washington Road near the top of Bower Hill Road, but was named after the area from which they came, Mount Lebanon, due to the similarities between the two landscapes. Prior to the incorporation of the township, the &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot; name was used for the area of Upper St. Clair Township near the cedar trees. In the 1880s, a post office located near the transplanted cedar trees was named &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot;. Incorporators of neighboring Dormont Borough initially tried to use the &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot; name in 1909, but were opposed by residents of the future Mount Lebanon Township.

In 1928, Mount Lebanon became the first First Class township in Pennsylvania to adopt the council–manager form of government and has had an appointed manager serving as the chief administrative officer since that time.

Mount Lebanon was a farming community until the arrival of streetcar lines, the first line to Pittsburgh opening on July 1, 1901 followed by a second in 1924. After the arrival of the streetcar lines, which enabled daily commuting to and from Downtown Pittsburgh, Mount Lebanon became a streetcar suburb, with the first real estate subdivision being laid out in November 1901. Further, the opening of the Liberty Tubes in 1924 allowed easy automobile access to Pittsburgh. Between the 1920 and 1930 censuses, the township&#x27;s population skyrocketed from 2,258 to 13,403. Today, Pittsburgh&#x27;s mass transit agency, the Pittsburgh Regional Transit, or &quot;PRT,&quot; operates a light rail system whose Red Line, which runs underneath Uptown Mt. Lebanon through the Mt. Lebanon Tunnel, merges with the Blue Line in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mt. Washington section. Mt. Lebanon&#x27;s only platform station, Mt. Lebanon Station, is in Uptown Mt. Lebanon; the adjacent Dormont Junction and Castle Shannon stations are in neighboring municipalities. And as of the census of 2000, there were 33,017 people living in Mt. Lebanon.

In 1971, Muhammad Ali attempted to purchase a home in Virginia Manor, but racial discrimination prevented him from doing so. However, some residents have claimed that the rejection was due to the anticipated publicity and crowds which would result from the sale of the property to Ali.

On May 21, 1974, the electorate approved a home rule charter, which took effect on January 1, 1975; as such, the community is no longer governed under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Township Code. Mount Lebanon became one of the first municipalities in Pennsylvania to adopt a home rule charter. In the charter, the official name of the municipality became Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania; the word &quot;Mount&quot; is abbreviated in all government documents, although the U.S. Postal Service continues to use &quot;Mount.&quot;

(U.S. Rt. 19 Truck continues into Pittsburgh and back out into the city&#x27;s northern suburbs and beyond.) Uptown Mt. Lebanon is one of the more built up central business districts outside of Pittsburgh, featuring numerous coffee shops, small galleries, pizzerias, and clothing boutiques. The neighborhood is organized as The Uptown Mt. Lebanon Business and Professional Association.

There are sizable business districts along the borders with Upper St. Clair and Castle Shannon, as well.

===Communities within Mt. Lebanon===

<doc id="131141" wikidata="Q1182767" url="?curid=131141" title="Mount Oliver, Pennsylvania">
<text>Mount Oliver is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,394 at the 2020 census. It is a largely residential area situated atop a crest about west of the Monongahela River. The borough is surrounded entirely by the city of Pittsburgh, having resisted annexation attempts by the city.

==History==
Mount Oliver was first settled by John Ormsby, an officer in the command of General Forbes, who was granted 249 acres of land along the banks of the Monongahela River. In 1788 Allegheny County was divided into townships, with Ormsby&#x27;s plot being part of St. Clair Township. In 1800 Ormsby began selling parcels of land, while retaining rent and property taxes from residents. Ormsby named his growing settlement Mount Oliver, after his son, Oliver Ormsby. Later that year St. Clair Township would be divided with residents attempting to incorporate as a borough, however, the state ruled against the effort stating that the property owner quota was not sufficient to award incorporation, and Mount Oliver would become part of Lower St. Clair Township.

In 1872 Pittsburgh began expanding southward, annexation the boroughs of South Pittsburgh, Monongahela, Allentown, Lawrenceville, Temperanceville, Birmingham, Mt. Washington, West Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Borough, East Birmingham, St. Clair Borough and Ormsby. Local residents began to feel threatened by this expansion, as well as feeling that Lower St. Clair Township was not properly dealing with their road improvements and public safety. As such, in 1892 a petition circulated to incorporate Mount Oliver as a borough, which passed the courts on November 9, 1892.

In 1927 Pittsburgh began another expansion effort, annexing the boroughs of Knoxville and Carrick, completely surrounding Mount Oliver. The city of Pittsburgh attempted to force annexation through a lengthy legal battle, however, the borough ultimately prevailed due to its population being too high to annex the municipality without a referendum approved by its residents.

To this day residents of Mount Oliver fiercely defend their independence from Pittsburgh, seeing it as a point of local pride, which is helped by how approachable the local government is, and the rapid allocation of municipal services. However, there has been a noted decline from the 1980s, when the Borough was a local commercial hub.

<text>Neville Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. Its land area consists entirely of Neville Island, which is an island on the Ohio River. The population was 1,108 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The island was formerly known as Montour&#x27;s Island, named for the Native American interpreter Andrew Montour, who lived on the land in colonial times. Before the American Revolution, the island was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. Both states awarded a claim to the island to citizens of their states. The dispute found its way to the Supreme Court in &quot;Irvine v. Sims&#x27;s Lessee&quot; (1799). Charles Simms won the case and gained possession of the island. It was eventually transferred to his partner in the lawsuit, General John Neville, for whom the island, and the township, is named. Neville lived on the island in his final years.

The township was incorporated on April 8, 1854, from a part of Ohio Township. It obtained first-class status in 1901.

A 1903 newspaper advertisement for real estate on the island promoted it as the next Manhattan Island.

==Island Sports Center==
In 1998, the Hillman Company built the Island Sports Center on the western tip of Neville Island. Robert Morris University purchased the Island Sports Center in 2003. The sports center includes a 1,200-seat hockey rink, a golf range, a miniature golf course, athletic fields and a pro shop.

==Geography==
The township boundary encompasses Neville Island and a surrounding portion of the Ohio River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (40.36%) is water. The island, nearly five miles long, is the largest by land area in Pennsylvania.

<text>North Braddock is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Monongahela River. The 2020 census had the borough population at 4,320. It is a suburb east of Pittsburgh. Organized from a part of Braddock Township in 1897, the borough prides itself in being the &quot;Birthplace of Steel&quot; as the home of Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s Edgar Thomson Steel Works that opened in 1875. 

==History==

===Origins===
In 1742, a Scottish trader named John Fraser from eastern Pennsylvania acquired land at the location of the current Edgar Thomson Steel Works from Queen Aliquippa and the Lenape people. Fraser settled his family on the location, and in 1753 Christopher Gist and George Washington met with Fraser while delivering messages from Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia to French commanders at Fort LeBoeuf, in present-day Waterford. Dinwiddie demanded the French commanders withdraw from western Pennsylvania. Fearing that a conflict was on the horizon, Fraser returned to Philadelphia in 1754.

In 1755, General Edward Braddock and British troops left Virginia and used Fraser as the guide with General Washington as the aide on the expedition. The objective of the expedition was to expel the French at Fort Duquesne. It was on July 9, 1755, when the British troops arrived at Fraser&#x27;s cabin to be met with gunfire from the French troops. During the battle Braddock was wounded, dying on July 13, 1755, in nearby Uniontown. The area where Braddock was shot became known as Braddock&#x27;s Field. Historical markers identify the site on present-day Jones Avenue across from Benjamin Fairless School. Braddock&#x27;s Battlefield History Center commemorates this battle.

===Whiskey Rebellion===
During the late 18th-century farming was prevalent in the North Braddock area with the nearby Monongahela River used for trade. Whiskey became a very profitable product to trade, with much being sent to the New Orleans area. In 1794 a whiskey tax was created, drawing in protest over 8,000 settlers from western Pennsylvania to the North Braddock area, as part of the Whiskey Rebellion. The angry settlers would not disperse easily, and President Washington led an army to suppress the rebellion.

===Wallace Mansion===
The British commander of Fort Pitt, Captain Edmondstone, had signed a grant of of land from King George III of Great Britain to Peter Rowletter. Once the French and Indian War was over, Rowletter sold the land to Pittsburgh judge George Wallace, who bought around of land, including part of Braddock&#x27;s Field, on March 4, 1791. Here Wallace built a mansion as his summer home. Later the Marquis de La Fayette visited the country as the Guest of the Nation, and while doing so he stopped by Judge Wallace&#x27;s mansion on May 28, 1825. After Wallace&#x27;s death the home was left to his nephew who lost the property to a sheriff sale. The Wallace mansion would be used as a boarding school called the Edgeworth Ladies Seminary during the 1830s.

===Coal and steel===
In 1835 the first coal mine opened between the hills near Sixth Street. During the 19th century the railroad industry was expanding across the country. Andrew Carnegie, with the increasing demands in steel for the railroad, began to build his first steel mill in 1872, named for John Edgar Thomson, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. By 1873 the demand for steel for the railroad had decreased, and the construction of the mill was halted. Good news came though when Carnegie secured a $2 million loan and finished the steel mill to roll its first steel under the supervision of superintendent William R. Jones. The mill would go on to expand, and in 1880 the first blast furnace was used at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works.

===Incorporation===
During 1897, East Pittsburgh tried to annex the land around the mill of North Braddock, known as Bessemer, that was part of Braddock Township. Residents of Shady Park village (3rd ward) and of Wolftown (1st ward) came together to hold meetings on stopping East Pittsburgh from annexing the land near the mill known as Braddock&#x27;s Field. William Yost serving as North Braddock&#x27;s attorney petitioned the Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County that Shady Park and Wolftown would join as one town, also incorporating Braddock&#x27;s Field. During the meetings 317 of 510 property owners signed an agreement helping Judge Kennedy make his ruling to form a new town. On Monday, April 26, 1897, North Braddock was incorporated as a borough. Judge Kennedy of the Quarter Sessions Court of Allegheny County made the ruling and ordered the decree for the new borough. The first election of officials was to be held on May 18, 1897. The winners of the election included the burgess Henry Anderson, councilmen Joseph Wallace, John Walberg, John Maxwell, WJ Vance, Thomas Clark, J Grant Anderson, Fred Edwards, tax collector John Hutzen, and school directors Jones, Johnson, Scott, Colmey, Crossey, and Anderson.

North Braddock celebrated its borough centennial with a festival of events in June 1997.

<text>North Versailles ( ) is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 10,079 at the 2020 census. The township derives its name from the Palace of Versailles.

==History==
North Versailles Township was formed on September 18, 1869, by a division of (the original) Versailles Township into North and South Versailles townships. Versailles Township was one of the original seven townships of Allegheny County formed in 1788 from Westmoreland County. Additionally, the land which encompasses the present day North Versailles Township was disputed territory between Pennsylvania and Virginia, which claimed the area as part of Yohogania County of the District of West Augusta.

The territory designated in 1788 as Versailles Township now contains the townships of North Versailles and South Versailles; the boroughs of White Oak, East McKeesport, Wall, Versailles, and portions of Wilmerding and Trafford; as well as the major portion (excluding 10th ward) of the city of McKeesport.

North Versailles was further divided with the formation of the boroughs of East McKeesport (1895), Wall (1904), and portions of the boroughs of Wilmerding (1890) and Trafford (1904). The section of Wilmerding on the north side of Turtle Creek was originally part of the former Patton Township, and the majority of Trafford is situated in Westmoreland County. An area of North Versailles (Allequippa Grove, later known as North McKeesport and Highland Grove) was annexed by the city of McKeesport.

Early villages and population centers in North Versailles included Port Perry, Saltsburgh and Allequippa Grove along the Monongahela River; Pleasant Hill near to what is now East McKeesport; Point Pleasant located near the present intersections of Route 30 and McKee and Naser roads; and Stewart&#x27;s Station, Spring Hill, Mosside Station, Wall Station, and Wilmerding Station along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Monongahela River.

North Versailles has a number of named neighborhoods, including the following which roughly correspond to the township&#x27;s seven wards:
*Ward 1: Park Terrace
*Ward 2: Arlington
*Ward 3: Sunset and South Wilmerding
*Ward 4: Green Valley and Fite Station
*Ward 5: West Wilmerding
*Ward 6: Dixon Hollow and Oak Hill
*Ward 7: Crestas Terrace

Fire department:
At one time, North Versailles was served by eight volunteer fire departments. Each ward was served by one department, with the exception of Ward 3, which had both the Sunset and South Wilmerding VFDs. Ward 4 and 6&#x27;s fire departments were the Green Valley VFD and Dixon VFD respectively.

Currently, three fire departments serve the township. Crestas VFD serves Crestas Terrace, West Wilmerding VFD serves West Wilmerding. The remaining five wards of the township are served by the Fire Department of North Versailles (FDNV) with 2 stations. The FDNV has the designation of Station 213 and is currently dispatched by the Allegheny County 911 center. Station 1 houses a rescue truck, an engine, and a squad. Station 2 houses an engine, and a squad. The stations are respectively the former Sunset-Central VFD, Green Valley VFD. They are now known as FDNV Station 1 and 2.

FDNV Station 1 is located at 1021 Broad Street and Station 2 is located at 518 Oakhurst Street.

Police department:
The North Versailles Police Department is led by Chief Norm Locke with over 20+ sworn police officers and police K9, Chase. the department has a detective bureau, traffic division, K-9 unit, and a tactical team.

In November 2023, Police Officer Steven Shawley and his K9 partner Chase were shot and wounded in the line of duty responding to a domestic violence call. Officer Shawley, who was shot in the hand and face, and K9 Chase in the front paw had made a full recovery and returned to full duty. The shooter, Ian Fields pleaded guilty to the shooting and is currently serving up to a 30-year sentence in the Pennsylvania state prison.

Up until the end of 2016, the North Versailles Township Police department patrolled the borough of Wilmerding.

Emergency medical services:
Emergency medical services (EMS) in the Township of North Versailles is provided by the Fire Department of North Versailles (FDNV) out of Station 1. The FDNV EMS Division is led by Kayla DiMeo and is dispatched by Allegheny County 911 and holds the station number of 390. FDNV EMS Division maintains 2 type 3 ambulances (designated 391 &amp; 392) licensed at the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level by the PA Department of Health.

==Schools==
North Versailles, East McKeesport, Wilmerding, and Wall consolidated school systems in the early 1960s to form the East Allegheny School District. East Allegheny High School (the Wildcats – 1969) is situated off Route 48 (Jack&#x27;s Run Road) near the intersection of U.S. Route 30. Green Valley School (1955) is the only surviving school of the former North Versailles School District which included (but is not limited to) the following other schools during the township&#x27;s history:

*Port Perry School
*Saltsburg(h) School
*Bowman School
*Pleasant Hills School
*Spring Hill School
*Kincaid School
*Point Pleasant School
*Oak Hill School
*North McKeesport School
*Arlington School
*Sunset School
*South Wilmerding School
*Dixon Avenue School
*Crestas School
*Keith School
*West Wilmerding School
*Park Terrace Junior High

Prior to the formation of the East Allegheny School District, North Versailles high school age students were able to choose to go to one of several high schools in other districts, including East McKeesport High School (the Rams), Westinghouse Memorial High School (the Wildcats), Turtle Creek High School (the Creekers), McKeesport Area High School (the Tigers), and East Pittsburgh High School (the Shamrocks).

At the formation of the East Allegheny School District (known as Westinghouse Valley Area Schools from 1962 to 1966), Westinghouse Memorial High School became the district&#x27;s official high school until the building of East Allegheny High School in 1969. The former East McKeesport High School was transformed into a junior high serving East McKeesport, Wilmerding, Wall and certain portions of North Versailles near East McKeesport. Park Terrace Junior High (1955—the Bobcats) served the township. During the 1968–69 school year, Park Terrace was designated a middle school serving all seventh and eighth graders in the district and East McKeesport served only 9th grade students for this one year; it would serve other populations until its closure in 1982. Neither school building exists today.

The North Versailles Police Department currently staffs police officers in East Allegheny High School and Logan Middle School.

==Points of interest==
*The Oakmont Country Club is located just outside the borough limits in the neighboring borough of Plum. The course has been consistently ranked in the top five courses of the world. It has hosted nine U.S. Opens, the most of any golf course, in 1927, 1935, 1953, 1962, 1973, 1983, 1994, 2007 and 2016, and is scheduled to host a tenth in 2025. It has also hosted three PGA Championships, five U.S. Amateurs, three NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Golf Championships, and two U.S. Women&#x27;s Opens.
*The Kerr Memorial Museum, located at 402 Delaware Avenue, was originally a family home built in 1898 for the Kerr family and is now a museum which is open for tours. The Kerr Museum brings to life the story of the middle class in late nineteenth-century America, often overshadowed by that period&#x27;s extremes of fabulous wealth and grinding poverty.

*The Carnegie Library of Oakmont was built in 1899. It was the tenth library commissioned by Andrew Carnegie in America. The library is free and open to the public. An addition was added on between 2003 and 2005.
*The Oaks Theater, located at 310 Allegheny Boulevard, first opened its doors on November 18, 1938, to a grand parade hosted by the boroughs of Oakmont and its &quot;twin&quot; borough of Verona. At the time, it was called “The Jewel of Oakmont” and featured indoor air conditioning which was a real treat for the time. In 2015 it was converted from a single-screen Art Deco-style theater to a modern, multi-purpose entertainment venue. The renovation maintained the original architectural style and grandeur of the theater, while adding modern amenities such as cabaret seating, a full-service bar, and updated lighting and sound capabilities. The theater hosts both local and national live music acts, as well as comedy performances, plays and movies.
*The Oakmont Verona Cemetery is located on Pennsylvania Avenue in Oakmont.
*The Jonathon Hulton Bridge was constructed in 1908. Spanning the Allegheny River, it connects Oakmont and Harmarville. The bridge was demolished successfully with explosives at 9:49 AM on Tuesday, January 26, 2016, to make way for the opening of a new bridge. The entire project, including implosion of the original bridge, was completed in the Spring of 2016, in time for the 2016 U.S. Open at nearby Oakmont Country Club.
*Riverside Park, located along the Allegheny River, possesses tennis courts, basketball court, running track, pavilions, and a children&#x27;s playground.
*Oakmont History Center &amp; Museum, is located at 628 Allegheny River Boulevard.

==Development==
== Hazardous waste cleanup: Edgewater Steel Company in Oakmont, Pennsylvania ==

=== EPA site identification ===
EPA ID: PAD074966789

Property area: 2.3 acres

Other names: Regional Industrial Development Corp (RIDC)

Cleanup status: Corrective Action Underway

Human exposures under control: Yes, Controlled.

Groundwater under control: Yes, Controlled.

Last update: 6/4/2011

=== Cleanup status ===
This facility is one of EPA Region III&#x27;s high priority Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action sites. Edgewater Steel Company clean closed an EAF dust waste pile in 1991 and closed in place a construction/demolition waste landfill in 1995. The facility shut down operations in 2001. In October, 2001 an environmental inspection was done. An Environmental Indicator (EI) report was prepared in March 2002. Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) determined that with the removal of waste from the manufacturing buildings, the EI&#x27;s would be under control (Sept. 2003). The buildings were demolished in 2005, but some waste (dust) was apparently disposed on site during demolition activities. Subsequent sampling in 2006 did not locate any dust or materials that exhibited a hazardous waste characteristic. Additionally as part of a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) Act 2 site characterization, limited TCE impacts to groundwater were found.

The site was divided into two parcels for remediation and redevelopment as residential, commercial and light industrial properties; the 32-acre Oakmont area and the 28 acre River Edge area. The Oakmont area remediation and redevelopment plan received PADEP Act 2 approval, and redevelopment is underway. The River Edge area is currently under remediation.
=== Contaminants at this facility ===
PADEP allowed the Edgewater Steel Corporation to cease groundwater monitoring activities for the former EAF dust landfill because (1) it could not be properly monitored due to hydraulic influences from nearby Plum Creek and (2) Edgewater removed the EAF dust and contaminated soil, thus clean closing the unit. Earth Sciences Consultants, on behalf of Edgewater, closed monitoring wells MW-903 through MW-906. Therefore, this area posed no further groundwater contamination potential. Fay Construction currently owns the property where this unit was located.

The plant has a “large asbestos situation” in the old stream boilers, and possibly asbestos contaminated furnaces, ceiling tiles, and floor tiles, none of which are Solid Waste Management Units (SWMUs). Operations have ceased at the site due to bankruptcy; hence there are currently no workers at the site. The plant is undergoing selective demolition, so any asbestos concerns will be addressed as part of any demolition work.
=== New construction at former Edgewater Steel site ===
At the site where Edgewater Steel once stood, a new greener residential neighborhood is rising. The new residential area of Oakmont will acquire condominiums, town homes, manor flats, cottage homes, village homes, green spaces, a waterfront park, and more. Edgewater will obtain 242 homes ranging from $200,000 to $700,000. These new homes will reduce energy uses by 30%. Home construction began in July 2011, with 26 home lots already sold. In addition to the residential area Edgewater will have its own commercial district.

<text>Ohio Township is a township of the Second Class in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. Ohio Township elects a board of three Supervisors, a property tax collector, and a constable. The day-to-day business of the township is managed by a Township Manager serving at will. In addition to the Administration Office, the Police Department, Road Department, and Recreation Department are also under the direct administration of the Board of Supervisors. The Ohio Township Police Department provides full-time service, not only for Ohio Township, but through contractual agreements also for the Townships of Aleppo, Kilbuck, and Neville and the Boroughs of Ben Avon, Ben Avon Heights, Emsworth and Sewickley Hills.

The population was 7,178 at the 2020 census. The township is located northwest of Pittsburgh. There is no central business district, but there are a few small shops in the Mt. Nebo area. A new shopping center has been built called Mt. Nebo Pointe. In recent years, several retail outlets have been built near the Camp Horne Road interchange of Interstate 279.

Ohio Township was named after the Ohio River.

==History==
As reported in the History of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Ohio was the third township to be formed in Allegheny County north of the Ohio River, and it was the first subdivision of Pine township. Its creation was begun in December 1802, when a petition was filed in the court of quarter sessions. Gen. John Neville signed this petition. After considerable discussion as to where the boundary line would be created, at the September term of 1803, the court confirmed absolutely a division line which is currently the western boundaries of the current jurisdictions of Pine, McCandless, and Ross townships and Bellevue Borough, including that area of Allegheny County located west of this boundary line and north of the Ohio River as well as including Neville Island.

No event of remarkable interest signaled its early settlement. Being situated on the &quot;Indian side&quot; of the Ohio River, the first Caucasian inhabitants did not appear more than a few years prior to 1800, as this section of the country was not open to settlement until 1792. The first permanent settler to Ohio township was reported as William Richey in 1801. He had been a soldier in Wayne&#x27;s expedition. While the army was lying at Legionville (near present-day Baden), he was sent on some commission to Fort Pitt. The Duff family was first represented by James Duff and his two sons, who crossed the Ohio River in 1799 and located near the river, relocating further inland in 1805. James Moore immigrated from Northumberland County with a large family about the same time. In addition to these, the Crawfords, who settled on Lowrie&#x27;s Run, have been numerously represented by their descendants, the Gillilands, the Ritchies, Shannons, and others.

Ohio township was later reduced in size by the creation of other townships within its borders: among some of them, Franklin in 1823, Sewickley in 1854, and Kilbuck in 1869. The population in 1860 was 1,350, in 1870 was 685 (after loss of Kilbuck township area), and in 1880 was 737.
Mount Nebo United Presbyterian Church was organized June 17, 1838. The land for the church was donated by two local farmers, Hugh Thompson and William Duff.
==Geography==

<text>Glen Osborne is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 590 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
The area that now comprises the borough was first surveyed by Nathaniel Breading following the Revolutionary War. Early settlers of the area included Henry Pratt in 1786 and James Park in 1805. The area became known as &quot;Glen Osborne&quot;, the glen referring to a Scottish term for a valley formed by a stream, and &quot;Osborne&quot; for local landowner Frank Osborne. By 1851, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad was built through what was then part of Pitt and Ohio townships and a station opened in the community named &quot;Osborne&quot; to prevent confusion from a similarly named station. In 1883 following petitioning by local residents, the borough of Osborne was incorporated.

In 2008, borough officials led by then-mayor William P. Boswell petitioned the state to allow the renaming of the borough to Glen Osborne to reflect the name residents have been using for over one hundred years. A judge granted the name change on May 21 of that year, leading to the immediate replacement of road signs and phasing out of the old name on stationery and welcome signs in the borough.

<text>Pitcairn is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, located east of Pittsburgh&#x27;s central business district, named for Robert Pitcairn, an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Early in the 20th century, Pitcairn was the site of large railroad yards and shops that employed nearly ten thousand men. The population increased from 2,601 in 1900 to 6,310 in 1940, but has since declined. The population was 3,101 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The settlement that would become modern Pitcairn began to grow on the banks of Turtle Creek in 1841 when farmer John McGinnis began sell land to fellow settlers.

In 1850, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased a corridor from McGinnis. In 1874, Robert Pitcairn of the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased a further 215 acres in the area to serve as a new hub for the Pittsburgh railyard, the original location of which was deemed too small to support the growing level of rail traffic in the region. 

During the late 1800s, the growing settlement was called &quot;Wallurba&quot; by residents. In 1894, the settlement separated from current-day Monroeville (formerly known as Patton Township) and was incorporated as the borough of Pitcairn.

The Pitcairn Rail Yard operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad facilitated the growth of Pitcairn into a robust industrial community during the first half of the 20th century. In 1950, the Pennsylvania Railroad decided to expand the Conway Terminal north of Pittsburgh. This led to a slow decline of the importance of the Pitcairn Rail Yard in the second half of the 20th century, and a subsequent population decline in the borough.

In 1996, the Pitcairn Rail Yard was re-opened as an intermodal facility, operated since 2012 by Norfolk Southern.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 census, there were 3,689 people, 1,675 households, and 911 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 1,901 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 98.10% White, 0.43% African American, 0.11% Native American, 0.41% Asian, 0.05% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.54% of the population.

There were 1,675 households, out of which 24.7 percent had children under the age of eighteen living with them, 35.9 percent were married couples living together, 13.8 percent had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.6 percent were non-families. Of all households, 39.3 percent were made up of individuals, and 14.6 percent had someone living alone who was sixty-five years of age or older. The average household size was 2.20 and the average family size was 2.98.

In the borough, the population was spread out, with 22.2 percent under the age of eighteen, 9.8 percent from eighteen to twenty-four, 30.7 percent from twenty-five to forty-four, 21.3 percent from forty-five to sixty-four, and 16 percent who were sixty-five years of age or older. The median age was thirty-seven years. For every 100 females, there were 90.9 males. For every 100 females age eighteen and over, there were 90.4 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $25,688, and the median income for a family was $34,226. Males had a median income of $30,637 versus $21,312 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $14,785. About 7.2 percent of families and 12 percent of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.6 percent of those under age 18 and 12.0 percent of those age 65 or over.

As of 2019, the racial composition of the borough is approximately 72.88% White, 18.25% African American or Black and 2.12% Asian. Two or more races make up 6.01% of the population.

==Notable people==
Pitcairn was the birthplace of bandleader Ted Weems and of musical instrument maker Carl Thompson, as well as early NFL football player Harry Robb. Pitcairn was also the birthplace of Robert Dewees &quot;Cutty&quot; Cutshall, a trombonist who played with the bands of Jan Savitt, Benny Goodman, Eddie Condon, and was a founding member of Lawson/Haggart&#x27;s World&#x27;s Greatest Jazz Band. Cutty&#x27;s base was out of New York City, where he made countless records and also played at the world-famous Rainbow Room.

==Economic activity==
Pitcairn Yard, which opened in 1892 and was for many decades a major switching yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad, later the Penn Central Railroad and Conrail, is now, since the 1990s, an intermodal freight transport yard for the Norfolk Southern Railway, where containers are taken off trains and transferred to trucks for delivery, or from trucks to trains.

In 1971, the first Fox&#x27;s Pizza Den was opened on Broadway Boulevard in Pitcairn. It remains open to this day.

Pitcairn operates its own power distribution system and municipally-owned Government-access television (GATV) cable television system.

==Education==
K–12 students in Pitcairn are served by the Gateway School District, a public school district with a student population of 4,300.

In February 2012, the Gateway School Board approved a Propel charter school proposal to open a kindergarten through eighth grade charter school within the district&#x27;s borders. Propel operates nine schools in Allegheny County. The Propel charter school re-opened the former Pitcairn Elementary Building on Agatha Street, which the Gateway board had closed in 2011. The school opened with little controversy to approximately 300 kindergarten through sixth grade students in August 2012, with a planned expansion to eighth grade over the following two years.

==Government and politics==
The incumbent mayor of Pitcairn is Betsy Stevick and she serves alongside seven council members. Meetings of the government are conducted inside the council chambers of the Merle and Olive Lee Gilliand Borough Building on Broadway Boulevard.

==Law enforcement==
The borough is served by the local Pitcairn Police Department. As of 2022, the Chief of Police is Scott Farally. The department&#x27;s jurisdiction covers both Pitcairn and Wilmerding. Additionally, it works in conjunction with nearby law enforcement agencies such as the Allegheny County Police Department, Turtle Creek Police Department, and Pennsylvania State Police.

<doc id="131166" wikidata="Q1187224" url="?curid=131166" title="Sewickley, Pennsylvania">
<text>Sewickley is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, west northwest of Pittsburgh along the Ohio River. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 3,907 at the 2020 census. The Sewickley Bridge crosses the Ohio River from Sewickley to Moon Township.

==Etymology==
Historian Charles A. Hanna suggested &quot;Sewickley&quot; came from Creek words for &quot;raccoon&quot; (sawi) and &quot;town&quot; (ukli). According to Hanna, the Asswikale branch of the Shawnee probably borrowed their name from the neighboring Sawokli Muscogee before the former&#x27;s migration from present-day South Carolina to Pennsylvania. Contemporary accounts from noted anthropologist Frederick Webb Hodge and the Sewickley Presbyterian Church, as well as the current Sewickley Valley Historical Society concur to varying degrees with Hanna&#x27;s etymology. Some locals alternatively consider Sewickley to be a Native American word meaning &quot;sweet water.&quot;

==History==

The valley surrounding the Big Sewickley Creek was surveyed in 1785 and sold to American Revolutionary War veterans. After the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, settlers began to trickle in to the area, with flatboats, keelboats, and steamboats forming an industry along the Ohio River.

In 1837, the Edgeworth Female Seminary was moved from Pittsburgh to what was then called Sewickley Bottom. The following year, Sewickley Academy was founded. Becoming a small center for education, by 1840 the community was formally established as Sewickleyville. The borough was incorporated as simply Sewickley on July 6, 1853, after growth continued as the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway was built through the area.

In 1911, the Sewickley Bridge was completed, bringing an end to the ferry industry. Ohio River Boulevard, later designated a part of Pennsylvania Route 65, was completed in 1934.

==Geography==
Sewickley is located at 40°32.25′N 80°10.5′W (40.5390, −80.1807). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (11.11%) is water.

<text>Sewickley Heights is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 857 at the 2020 census. It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Sewickley Heights is one of the wealthiest municipalities in Pennsylvania and in the United States.

== History ==
Sewickley Heights was established as a borough in 1935, but the area&#x27;s character was largely established with the move of the Allegheny Country Club from Pittsburgh to its Sewickley Heights location in 1902. The establishment of the country club accelerated the settlement of the area as a haven for wealthy Pittsburgh residents. Many estates established in Sewickley Heights up through the 1930s occupied hundreds of acres with houses of immense proportions. Among the grandest estates was As You Like It, the estate of banker, shipper and investor William Thaw. As You Like It was featured in a 1903 print advertisement of the United States Battery Company that promoted electric lighting for country homes. Other notable estates included the Henry Robinson Rea mansion, Farmhill (which hosted Madame Curie in May 1921), and B. F. Jones&#x27; 100-room mansion, Fairacres.

Many of the grand estates in Sewickley Heights began to fall into disrepair in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the original massive houses were demolished and the lots subdivided. Sewickley Heights preserved the country character of the borough by requiring minimum lot sizes of , though many homes are on substantially larger parcels. Many &quot;neighborhoods&quot; of Sewickley Heights are named after the original estate and the clusters of homes on the estate parcel are marked by unique stone fences original to the old estate.

In the 1960s and 1970s, several parcels of land were donated or purchased to form the Sewickley Heights Borough Park. The park now occupies approximately and is renowned regionally for its hiking and horse-riding trails and other recreation areas. Sewickley Heights is also home to the Fern Hollow Nature Center and the Sewickley Heights History Center, which are co-located on a site.

==History==

===Guyasuta and the Seneca People===
The Borough of Sharpsburg is located along the Allegheny River just over outside of downtown Pittsburgh. Sharpsburg has a rich history dating back to the 18th century when the Seneca people settled into the area. One Seneca in particular, Guyasuta, has a special connection to the community.

Guyasuta was a strong warrior and skilled hunter. He accompanied George Washington as a hunter guide with his party in 1753. When the two met again in Ohio 17 years later, General Washington greeted him with warmth and affection. In 1758, Guyasuta was involved in a bitter battle at Grant&#x27;s Hill, where the Allegheny County Courthouse stands today. In the early 1760s, Guyasuta sought peace with the British Army. Guyasuta&#x27;s peace efforts culminated in a peace treaty, in which the government received a tract of land in what is now western Pennsylvania. General James O&#x27;Hara, who had purchased a portion of the river land, donated a small portion of it, where Sharpsburg is today, to Guyasuta.

===James Sharp and the initial settlement===
In 1826, a man named James Sharp rode into this area and purchased over of land for $1,337.37 in what was then Indiana Township, building a log cabin for his wife, Isabella L. Sharp. The original deed, recorded on October 10, 1826, can be found in the Allegheny County Department of Real Estate at deed book volume 35(K2), page 156. Opening the land to settlers, Sharp built a school and church while continuing to donate his land for the growing needs of the community. On December 14, 1841, the borough applied for incorporation, and received its charter March 14, 1842. The charter was recorded on March 26, 1842.

James Sharp was born near Chambersburg, Franklin County, Pennsylvania on February 10, 1784, of Scottish descent. His colonial ancestor and grandfather was Captain James Sharp (Third Battalion, Pennsylvania Regiment), a veteran of the Forbes Campaign. Captain Sharp was present in 1758 at the capture of Fort Duquesne and served under Gen. Hugh Mercer and Col. William Clapham. His father, Matthew Sharp, was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having served as a private in the Eighth Battalion, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania Militia. In 1780 he married Elizabeth (Lindsay) Culbertson and together they had three children: Rosana, James, and Mary.

With his family, young Sharp moved to Pittsburgh in 1797 and remained in Pittsburgh until 1826 when he purchased land at Sheriff&#x27;s Sale, formerly owned by Gen. John Wilkins, &quot;being number Thirteen in Cunninghams district containing two hundred and fifty seven acres and eighty seven perches on which are a square log dwelling, a good orchard and about fifty acres of cleared land, with fine meadows, a coal bank, and one of the best springs in the County.&quot; Sharp moved permanently to the land, part of which would later become the Borough of Sharpsburg. Sharp&#x27;s first marriage to Sarah Thompson ended with the death of Thompson a few years after their nuptials. He later married Isabella Stockman, with whom he had six children. During his lifetime, Sharp was described as a gentleman: courteous in manners, affable in disposition, and generous in hospitality. Sharp was an abolitionist, a zealous advocate for universal education, a member of the temperance movement, and a member of the Presbyterian Church. Sharp died on March 12, 1861.

===Industry===
Since its incorporation, Sharpsburg became an industrial town, manufacturing iron, brick and glass while goods were transported through the canal that bisected the borough, along with the Allegheny River. When railroads became the preferred mode of transportation for that time, Sharpsburg continued to thrive as thousands came for the plethora of job opportunities available.

===H. J. Heinz Company===
One of the most well-known industries that had its beginnings in Sharpsburg was the H. J. Heinz Company. The Heinz glass works in Sharpsburg once manufactured all of the glassware for Heinz products. In 1869, Heinz began creating and bottling his first horseradish in the kitchen of his Sharpsburg residence. This house is the place where it all began. Shortly thereafter, the house became Heinz’s first factory. Although he moved his company down the Allegheny along the North Shore of Pittsburgh, he was very gracious to the people of Sharpsburg until his death, donating gifts to the community that was his family home for many years. One of these included the life-sized statue of Guyasuta that was installed at the intersection of Main and North Canal streets. The statue has twice been hit by automobiles—the first occurrence in 1930 and the second occurrence in 1988. Each incident resulted in the destruction and subsequent replacement of the statue.

===A town divided===
Less than a century ago, Sharpsburg was divided into two sections because of a railroad track that went through the location where Kennedy Park currently sits. There were two fire departments, one on each side of the tracks. There were two schools on each side of the track as well, one &quot;up street&quot; and one &quot;down street&quot;. Once the railroad tracks weren’t used anymore, the railcars sat vacant on the tracks. The Junior Chamber of Commerce in Sharpsburg went to the railroad company as well as the Heinz family to try to change something about this. The Heinz family said they would help build a park if it was used for recreation purposes only. The park was built around the time when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and that is why the area was named Kennedy Park.

Today, Sharpsburg continues to boast pride of its industrial past while looking forward to the opportunities of economic growth within the business district, and its residents enjoy being a part of this unique riverfront community.

==Public safety==

===Police===
The Sharpsburg Borough Police Department (3500 units) formed in 1883. The composition of the Department includes the Chief of Police, five full-time patrolmen, as well as numerous part-time officers. Three vehicles, all Ford Explorers, are used in day-to-day operations by the department. Police headquarters is located in the Municipal Building at 1611 Main Street, in the Borough.

=== EMS ===
The borough&#x27;s EMS services are provided by Parkview EMS. Parkview also serves O&#x27;Hara Township and Blawnox Borough.

=== Fire ===
The Sharpsburg Borough Volunteer Fire Department (Station 265) has continuously served the borough since it was first organized on August 29, 1871, with the creation of the Hook and Ladder Company by W. C. Meyer. In 1886, Sharpsburg Borough Council established the position of fire chief, appointing W. C. Meyer to the position.

In 1928, the fire department reorganized into two companies—Fire Company No. 1 and Fire Company No. 2. The need for two fire companies in a borough of Sharpsburg&#x27;s size was necessitated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which split the town in two. In the event of a fire during which a train was passing through town, one company could always respond without delay.

The current fire department is located at 1611 Main Street, adjacent to the Municipal Building. The ranks are made up of approximately twenty-six firemen and women, plus the fire chief. The department&#x27;s vehicles include one engine, one quint, and a squad.

==Public utilities==

===Water===
The Hampton Shaler Water Authority (HSWA) provides water to the borough. HSWA serves 23,600 customers across all or parts of ten municipalities in Allegheny County, north of the City of Pittsburgh. HSWA was incorporated in 2011 and started operations in January 2012 as the merged entity of Hampton Township Municipal Authority and the Shaler Water Department.

HSWA typically pumps, treats, and distributes 5 to 6 million gallons of water per day to their customers. They maintain over 314 miles of distribution mainlines and appurtenances, ten water storage tanks, twelve pumping wells, and one water treatment plant.

===Waste water===
The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) collects and treats waste water from the borough. Located along the Ohio River on Pittsburgh’s Northside, ALCOSAN provides wastewater treatment services to 83 communities. ALCOSAN&#x27;s 59-acre treatment plant is one of the largest wastewater treatment facilities in the Ohio River Valley, processing up to 250 million gallons of wastewater daily.

An environmentally and technologically focused organization, ALCOSAN recently completed a $400 million capital improvement program which addressed odor control, treatment capacity, solids handling and wet weather planning. We have now embarked on the largest public works project in the region’s history through $1 billion in engineering and construction projects to address combined sewer overflows.

===Refuse===
Waste Management is the refuse collector for the borough and conducts curbside pickup weekly.

===Recycling===
Curbside single stream recycling is provided by Waste Management to Borough residents. Residents are able to recycle aluminum, glass, metals cans, plastics, mixed paper, and cardboard with weekly pickup. Recycling was made available to Sharpsburg residents starting in early 2023.

==Religion==

Located within Sharpsburg are numerous churches and other religious gathering places. Most notably, though, in the borough, is the Catholic community. Three churches, St. Mary Church, Madonna of Jerusalem Church, and St. John Cantius Church, form the Saint Juan Diego Parish. Bishop David Zubik of the Diocese of Pittsburgh created the parish in 2009, at the behest of the parishioners, who called for the three churches to form one parish. Saint Juan Diego, a Native American from Mexico, was chosen as the name of the parish because of Sharpsburg&#x27;s ties with Native Americans, specifically Guyasuta and the Senecas.

In addition, Grace Methodist Church, Mt. Olive Baptist Church, First English Lutheran Church, First Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Sharpsburg Family Worship Center call Sharpsburg home. The basement of the Mt. Olive church was the artistic inspiration to urban lyricist Mark D. Lombardi during his 1991 recording sessions of his gold album &quot;Locked Half Cocked and Loaded&quot;.

==Sharpsburg Community Library==
In summer 2015, the Sharpsburg Community Library, a branch of the Cooper-Siegel Library, reopened after a one-million dollar renovation funded through state grants and private donations. The renovated library expanded its size and design, in addition to adding to its circulating collection. The reopening was organized by Borough residents, the Sharpsburg council, and donations from various philanthropies. For its design, the library was awarded a 2015 Certificate of Merit from the American Institute of Architects Pittsburgh chapter.

The library is also home to the Sharpsburg Community Garden, which features numerous raised beds for residents to grow and nurture vegetable gardens.
==Recreation==

===Parks===
The borough is home to five parks: James Sharp Landing, Heinz Memorial Field, Kennedy Park, Kenneth D. Curley Memorial Park, and Children&#x27;s Park located at 16th and Main Streets.

The Linden Gymnasium/Sharpsburg Recreation Center

The Linden Gymnasium/Sharpsburg Recreation Center originally served as the gymnasium for the local Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA), constructed in the late 1880s through the early 1890s. The Sharpsburg School District later purchased the gym and repurposed it for use by the Sharpsburg High School until the Sharpsburg School District merged with the Fox Chapel Area School District in 1970. The Fox Chapel Area School District sold the building to the borough in 1982 and it is operated by the Sharpsburg Recreation Committee, who have a lease with the borough to operate and manage the building.

<text>South Fayette Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 14,416 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Throughout its early history, South Fayette Township was the site of numerous conflicts between the earlier Native American residents and arriving settlers, particularly in the northern areas of the township. There are several historical relics found in South Fayette, such as Native American stone instruments and graves.

The earliest known settler was a man of English descent with the surname Miller; he came to the area sometime around 1768. He settled at the mouth of a stream that would be named Millers Run. Before later emigrating to Kentucky, Miller sold an expansive tract of land to a land speculator named Campbell for a pair of shoes. The first permanent settler was Christian Lesnett, a German immigrant who came from Baltimore, Maryland, in 1770.

In 1790, Capt. Samuel Morgan built a gristmill, later purchased by Moses Coulter, whose son converted it into a steam mill. He added a sawmill and later changed it to a steel mill. Coal and oil were discovered in the township between 1860 and 1910, and mining became a big industry.

The area that today is known as South Fayette Township originally was claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. In 1788, the area became part of Moon Township, one of the seven townships in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Two years later, Fayette Township was carved out of Moon Township. The areas that today are known as South Fayette Township and North Fayette Township comprised Fayette Township, named in honor of General Lafayette. In 1842, Fayette Township was split into North Fayette and South Fayette townships. South Fayette was officially established March 16, 1842, and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2017. Following the creation of Collier Township in 1875, South Fayette Township&#x27;s territorial limits as they stand today are formed by the Washington County line, Robinson Run, Coal Run and Chartiers Creek.

Today, South Fayette Township is a fast-growing community benefiting from its proximity to Downtown Pittsburgh, Southpointe, Pittsburgh International Airport, the Robinson Township commercial district, the South Fayette interchange of Interstate 79, the future Southern Beltway toll highway, public parks, a variety of businesses and a highly ranked school district. In 2013, South Fayette was nominated as the best Pittsburgh suburb in which to raise a family in a regional survey.

<text>Upper St. Clair is a township with home rule status in southern Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, located approximately 8 miles (13 km) south of Downtown Pittsburgh. It is known for being an affluent suburb with a nationally recognized school district. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 21,160.

Around 9% of the township&#x27;s area is dedicated to 14 parks and multiple fields, totaling approximately 733 acres. The township has six borders with neighboring communities, including South Fayette Township to the west, Bridgeville to the northwest, Scott Township and Mt. Lebanon to the north, Bethel Park to the east, and Peters Township in Washington County to the south.

== Etymology ==
St. Clair Township was named after General Arthur St. Clair of Revolutionary War fame, the ninth President of the United States in Congress Assembled. Under his administration as president from February 2, 1787, to October 29, 1787, the Northwest Ordinance and United States Constitution of 1787 were passed.

==History==
The first European settler in present-day Upper St. Clair was John Fife, who settled near what is now the intersection of Washington and McLaughlin Run roads in 1762.

St. Clair was one of the original townships of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania at the county&#x27;s creation in 1788. In 1836, the St. Clair Township was divided into two separate townships, Upper St. Clair and Lower St. Clair. The residents of Upper St. Clair formed their township to ensure better government service that could be obtained by separating from the more densely populated northern part of the township. Upper St. Clair Township was further subdivided throughout the 19th and 20th centuries as several parts of the original township separated to form new townships and boroughs. In 1973, Upper St. Clair Township adopted a home rule charter that took effect on January 5, 1976, and is no longer governed by the Pennsylvania Township Code.

The Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 had its roots in Upper St. Clair.

Formed as a volunteer militia company in 1844 by residents of the township, the &quot;St. Clair Guards&quot; later became Company H of the 62nd Pennsylvania Infantry.

The community was home to several mines beginning in the late 19th century. Freehold Real Estate Co. built the first major residential development in March 1913 along Washington Road, which at the time was conveniently close to streetcar service. During the 1930s, Upper St. Clair was recorded as a community within the city which had a school district providing regular nursing services.

Today, the community has many fashionable homes and is considered one of the wealthiest suburbs of Pittsburgh. The township has also gained fame as being a filming location for the movie &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which 0.10% is water.

==Education==
Upper St. Clair is served by a K-12 namesake public school district, consisting of three elementary schools (Baker, Eisenhower, and Streams), two middle schools (Boyce and Fort Couch), and a single Upper St. Clair High School. In addition, a church named for St. Louise de Marillac hosts a private Catholic-affiliated school serving from Pre-K to 8th grade. A K-8 school for students with special needs known as the Wesley School also operates within the township.

==Demographics==

Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 2.7% of the population.

There were 7,506 households, out of which 38.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.2% were married couples living together, and 17.9% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. 18.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<text>Wall is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 519 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Wall is located at the site of a farm purchased by James Walls in 1829. The property, on the south bank of Turtle Creek, was passed to James&#x27; sons Henry and John Walls, who lived in a log cabin near the heart of present-day Wall. A station on the Pennsylvania Railroad opened in the early 1840s, which was named &quot;Walls&#x27; Station&quot; in honor of the Walls family. Eventually, the name of the station and the town that grew up around it was shortened to &quot;Wall Station&quot;. Henry and John Walls sold their property to their cousin Frank Wall, an engineer on riverboats who developed the property around the station. Wall got its name after this Frank Wall, whose said property development led to him being the owner of the first two houses erected in the region.

The town around Wall Station was incorporated in 1904 as Wall Borough. The borough grew rapidly during the first half of the twentieth century because a freight depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad was located at Wall. The population and economic vitality of the borough declined during the second half of the twentieth century as the railroad industry was eclipsed by the airline and trucking industries.

<text>West Deer Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 12,262 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1788, the Pennsylvania Legislature created Allegheny County from some of Westmoreland and Washington counties and most of the Depreciation Lands north of the Ohio River and west of the Allegheny River. The county was expanded a year later. Of the county&#x27;s then seven townships, Pitt Township comprised most of the northern part of the county. It is this township that would be divided in 1796 to form Pine and Deer townships. Deer Township was made up of what is today the eastern parts of Richland and West Deer, Frazer, most of East Deer, part of Hampton, and all of Fawn and Harrison. Deer gets its name from Chief Deer, a sub-chief of Iroquois leader Guyasuta. Half of Deer Township was used to create Indiana Township in 1805. In 1836, upon petition of its citizens, Deer was divided into East Deer and West Deer. In 1860, the western boundary of West Deer was moved eastward, the land being used to form Richland Township. In 1861, part of the southwestern corner of West Deer was used to form Hampton Township. West Deer also annexed land along its southern border from Indiana Township in this exchange. Historically, much of West Deer&#x27;s economy has been based on farming and coal mining. Many coal towns such as Curtisville, Bairdford, and Russellton were dominant forces in the industry. In recent years, significant suburban growth has occurred in the southwestern and central portions of the township, while other portions have remained rural.

<text>West Homestead is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, southeast of Pittsburgh, on the Monongahela River. Heavy industries associated with nearby steel mills existed here, such as axle works, brickworks, and manufactories of machinery, car wheels, etc. The largest concern was Mesta Machinery, which was one of the world&#x27;s leading industrial manufacturers from 1898 until 1983. The population was 1,872 at the 2020 census.
== History ==
There are two primary residential communities in West Homestead: the historic district and the Village, a post-World War II hilltop community. The historic district consists of a series of hillside residential streets adorned by intact working-class houses reflecting the architecture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century period when Homestead first flourished. 

West Homestead&#x27;s historic district includes Doyle Ave, originally home to several notable glass manufacturing company owners. The homes of William Beck and Joseph Doyle, who co-founded Doyle &amp; Co Glass, are both excellent examples of late Italianate architecture. The ruins of the Bryce house are still visible, home of the founder of Bryce Brothers, Doyle &amp; Co&#x27;s main competitor. By the 1890s, their separate companies joined United States Glass Company, and the street became home to steel and machinery workers and their management.

Among this second wave of entrepreneurial owners, one noteworthy structure is the Mesta Mansion, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and considered the cornerstone of the district. Built in 1900 by machining engineer and magnate George Mesta, founder of Mesta Machinery, he expanded and renovated the home extensively in 1916 to welcome his bride, the celebrated socialite and political hostess Perle Mesta. After Mesta&#x27;s death in 1925, by 1932 new owners split the mansion into apartments, a fate shared by several of its neighbors during the Great Depression and after. 

Fortunately, today the Mesta Mansion continues to stand alongside its neighbors on the historic street, including the Beck-Kelly Estate (1867), the Doyle-Smith House (1872), the Wahr-Siebert House (1887), and the Mesta-Martin House (1898). 

Another feature of the historic district is the Bulgarian Macedonian National Educational and Cultural Center on West Eighth Avenue. Since 1935, this facility has continued to be the center of Bulgarian and Macedonian cultural activity in Western Pennsylvania. West Homestead&#x27;s Eighth Avenue itself is a tree-lined boulevard adorned by Victorian shops, also on the National Register of Historic Places, and the neighborhood is surrounded by the largest group of ethnic churches on the National Register.

==Geography==
West Homestead is located at (40.394369, −79.915224).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.90%, is water.

Still standing in the Waterfront development are some of the brick stacks from the Homestead Steel Works. In addition, near the river is a former mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer.

New England Elementary has been closed since June 2012. Saint Agnes School has been closed since June 2019. New Emerson has been closed since 2020. Prior to July 2016, Wilson Christian Academy existed at 1900 Clairton Road. It was merged into Cornerstone Christian Preparatory Academy, which is currently at that location.

West Mifflin school administrators&#x27; use of school credit cards for meals has been called into question. The West Mifflin School District charges tuition for nearby Duquesne students to attend.

Community College of Allegheny County also has its South Campus in the borough, at 1750 Clairton Road.

<text>West View is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, just north of downtown Pittsburgh. The population was 6,685 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==Geography==
West View is located at (40.518368, −80.033645).

== History ==
West View was first incorporated on March 20, 1905. In the early 1900s, the Allegheny-Bellevue Land Company began acquiring land in Ross Township in order to build houses. Land developer Frederick Christian Martsolf was particularly enamored by the area, so working with the Allegheny-Bellevue Land Company, he was able to incorporate 640 acres of land right in the middle of Ross Township into West View Borough. West View held its first election on May 16, 1905, with Martsolf being elected the first president of the Borough Council on May 24, 1905.

It is said that the name &quot;West View&quot; came from pioneers who, traveling north out of Pittsburgh on the Venango Trail, appreciated the view to the west. The Venango Trail was a trail that Native Americans had used for centuries by the time European settlers arrived. The trail began in Pittsburgh and went north, eventually ending in Erie, PA. Present-day U.S. Route 19, which goes right through the heart of West View, closely follows the path of the original Venango Trail.

Casper Reel was the first European settler in the West View/Ross area. Reel was born in Frankfurt, Germany on May 11, 1742. He immigrated to America around 1761. After serving in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, Reel received 727 acres of land in what was then Pine Township. He constructed a cabin in West View in 1792, but was forced to leave shortly thereafter due to Native American attacks. He did not return until 1795, when he built a second cabin which still exists in the borough today. Reel became a successful farmer and also the first tax collector north of Pittsburgh. He died on October 20, 1824. The bulk of West View today is made up of land that was once owned by Reel.

==Education==
West View, along with neighboring (and surrounding) Ross Township, is served by the North Hills School District.

==West View Park==
From 1906 to 1977, West View was home to one of the most remembered Pittsburgh amusement parks, West View Park. West View Park was conceived by Theodore Marshall Harton II. In 1905, Harton entered into a 10-year lease with the Allegheny-Bellevue Land Company for 18.42 acres in the recently-established Borough of West View. Conveniently situated at the end of the Bellevue/West View trolley line, West View Park first opened on May 23, 1906.

This one-midway trolley park featured two beloved roller coasters: The Dips, with its unique banked turn-around curve, and the Racing Whippet, which featured two coasters on a strategically placed single track so that the train that started on the left of the loading platform came back on the right side and vice versa. Another popular park attraction was &quot;Danceland&quot;, an entertainment hall that featured many performers from big band to rock and roll over the years, most notably The Rolling Stones in 1964. Danceland burned to the ground in 1973 and was not rebuilt.

West View Park closed for good at the end of the 1977 season. Its competing amusement park, Kennywood, was continuously expanding with bigger attractions, which West View was unable to do because of its location. Today, West View Park Shopping Center (originally signed with a roller coaster resembling the Dips, replaced in 2010 by a new sign with a carousel horse on top) occupies the amusement park site. The shopping center opened in 1981. There are no traces of the park left, but several nearby businesses feature old memorabilia (such as signs, photos, and tickets).

The coming-of-age novel &quot;Stick Man&quot;, about a boy growing up in a bohemian household, with an accompanying musical soundtrack, is set in West View. Several key scenes are set in West View Park. The novel was written by West View native Richard Rossi.

<text>Whitehall is a landlocked borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 15,064 at the 2020 census, an increase of 1,120 since the 2010 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Whitehall is probably named after Silas D. Prior&#x27;s tavern on Brownsville Road, which was renamed White Hall in the 1850s. The building is still in existence, but is in Brentwood. Another possible source of the borough&#x27;s name is that the area, which used to be located within the township of Baldwin, was known as Whitehall Driving Park.

In 1946, residents of Baldwin Township&#x27;s fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh wards began the process of secession. A petition was filed on October 14, 1946, in the Quarterly Sessions of Allegheny County, with 1320 signatures out of the 1627 freeholders in the proposed borough. In response to this, Baldwin Township officials called an emergency meeting to file a petition to have Baldwin Township incorporated into a borough, as it is much more difficult to secede from a borough than from a township. On January 5, 1948, Whitehall separated from Baldwin Township to become an independent municipality. According to former mayor Edwin F. Brennan, residents of Whitehall wanted better services and zoning than they received under the jurisdiction of the township.

<text>Wilkinsburg is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough has a population of 14,349 as of the 2020 census. Wilkinsburg is located as part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The borough was named for John Wilkins Jr., a United States Army officer who served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army from 1796 to 1802.

==History==
Wilkinsburg is located in an area of the Appalachian Plateau where various land and water transportation routes join, an area which historically Native Americans inhabited, for thousands of years. Geologically, Wilkinsburg centers on a valley going through the hills located east of the three rivers confluence: namely, the Allegheny River, the Monongahela River, and the Ohio River. The Wilkinsburg valley eased passage by land through the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains, for example travel to and from Philadelphia and other Atlantic coast areas, including travel through the Cumberland Gap. The nearby meeting of the three rivers facilitated passage by water and by land alongside the rivers, which eventually joining the south-flowing Mississippi River, meeting the Gulf of Mexico, and so linking with oceanic trade. This made Wilkinsburg a nexus for divergent routes, where travel from the east and from travel from the south intersected, together with other transportation routes to the north and west. A vital section of the major land road or pathway passage to the east is now Penn Avenue, still a main street of Wilkinsburg.

In the early 1700s, European traders arrived, and by mid-century had some established colonial sites, including Fort Duquesne, established by France. Subsequently, the general area became a major battleground during the French and Indian Wars, during which George Washington (who passed through what is now Wilkinsburg in 1753, on a diplomatic mission to French territory), Edward Braddock, and John Forbes gained a place in history, each built roads and otherwise enhanced the land transportation routes. The French and Indian War (1754–1763) was fought between France, England, and various Native groups for territorial control. France lost control of the area in 1758. British forces built Fort Pitt between 1759 and 1761, near the three river junction. France subsequently relinquished claims on the area. In 1776, the British colonies declared independence, and the Treaty of Paris (1783) confirmed the area west of the Appalachians as part of the newly formed United States. In 1780, Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, and the region became part of Pennsylvania, settling a dispute of which state Wilkinsburg would end up being a part of. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784) resulted in the Iroquois Nations also relinquishing their claims to the area, but this was not necessarily the case for other Native American polities.

In the 1800s, trade was increasingly augmented by major mining and manufacturing operations. The general area&#x27;s population continued to proliferate from the late 1800s and the early 1900s, with numerous immigrants from various parts of Europe and African Americans of the Great Migration migrating from the Southern United States. For Wilkinsburg, this process sometimes proceeded slowly and sometimes more rapidly.

The Land Company of the Colony of Pennsylvania began to offer deeds in the general area to become Wilkinsburg in 1769. Andrew Levi Levy Sr., purchased 266 acres of woodland, to which he officially gave the name of Africa (for reasons which remain obscure). In 1788, Levy sold his deed to William Thompson (a retired brigadier general who had served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War). Thompson died shortly after, and the land was sold to Col. Dunning Mcnair (the father of Dunning R. McNair, who would become the sergeant at arms of the United States Senate, 1853–1861).

Dunning McNair was a significant landholder. In 1790, Dunning McNair laid out a village called McNairstown on the &quot;Great Road&quot; later known as Penn Avenue. In a deed dated September 1812, McNair deeded land to a certain Patrick Green, by which Wilkinsburgh was officially registered. In 1825, Dunning McNair died. By 1812, the village was referred to as &quot;Wilkinsburgh&quot; in honor of John Wilkins Jr., a wartime friend of McNair.

James Kelly began a half-century or so of heavy involvement with the area when he paid $12,000 for McNair&#x27;s former land, which Kelly subsequently added to. James Kelly was involved in much of the civic, religious, educational and other activities during this period. In 1873 the City of Pittsburgh annexed a portion of Wilkins Township containing Wilkinsburg, but less than three years later, a legal action reversed the annexation.

On October 5, 1887, Wilkinsburg separated from the recently created Sterrett Township to become an independent borough.

Although the borough has been economically depressed in recent years, many efforts are being made to change this. In 2004, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation launched initiatives in partnership with its for-profit development affiliate, Landmark Development Corporation, to begin restoration work on historic structures in Wilkinsburg&#x27;s Hamnett Place neighborhood. Within a decade, more than 70 structures were improved, a new neighborhood center was opened, and the community&#x27;s supply of affordable housing was increased. The collaborators were subsequently honored with the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation National Preservation Award to recognize their accomplishments. During this time, the Hamnett Historic District was also established; that historic district was then approved on June 28, 2010, for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2015, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation and its for-profit affiliate, Landmark Development Corporation, entered into a collaboration with Falconhurst Development to begin an $11.5 million multi-site restoration within and near the Hamnett Historic District. In addition to restoring four vacant buildings which had been built sometime around the beginning of the 20th century, the developer had plans to open a series of new townhouses in the same area by 2016, with the collaborators again indicating that the housing would be affordable, based on United States Housing and Urban Development Department (HUD) guidelines. The ground was broken on the project in late September 2015.

===Home of modern broadcasting===
Modern broadcasting as known in its current form began when Wilkinsburg resident Frank Conrad spearheaded a radio laboratory at his home, coordinated with Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the United States Signal Corps, under a special war time permit (using call signs 2-WM and 2-WE). After moving from Swissvale to Wilkinsburg, Conrad installed a radio station on the top floor of his backyard two-story garage, with a microphone, where he worked into the wee hours of the morning, eventually resulting in the development of modern broadcasting, as do it yourself listeners who had made their own crystal radio sets began to respond, some quite enthused by the music broadcast when Frank Conrad coupled a phonograph to radio. Wilkinsburg thus became the original location for modern broadcasting, combining the concepts of &quot;the station, the audience, the programs, and a means to pay for the programs&quot; after Conrad accepted a donation from a Wilkinsburg music store to promote its musical offerings. This was all before and leading up to KDKA and the development of commercial radio. In 1916, KDKA began broadcasting, as experimental station 8XK, from the Westinghouse plant in East Pittsburgh and in a small garage owned by Frank Conrad, before it was launched with its current call letters on November 2, 1920. In 1923, Wilkinsburg-based Russian immigrant Vladimir Zworykin designed and patented the iconoscope, the photocell &quot;eye&quot; of early television cameras. Today, ABC affiliate WTAE-TV is located in the borough on Ardmore Boulevard.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

===Surrounding neighborhoods===
Wilkinsburg has ten borders, including Penn Hills Township to the northeast, Churchill to the east, Forest Hills to the southeast, Edgewood to the south, Swissvale to the southwest, and the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Regent Square, Point Breeze, and North Point Breeze to the west, Homewood South to the northwest, and East Hills to the north.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 19,196 people, 9,138 households, and 4,477 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 10,696 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the borough was 29.25% White, 66.51% African American, 0.38% Native American, 0.81% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.55% from other races, and 2.44% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.13% of the population.

There were 9,138 households, out of which 22.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 24.3% were married couples living together, 20.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 51.0% were non-families. 44.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.06, and the average family size was 2.91.

In the borough, the population was spread out, with 23.4% under 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 15.8% who were 65 years of age or older.

===Religion===

Wilkinsburg was founded and developed by highly religious European immigrants. The borough has a remarkably high concentration of churches, mostly Protestant, which is unusual in a predominantly Catholic region of the country. According to borough leader James Kelly, the reversal of Wilkinsburg&#x27;s annexation to Pittsburgh in the 1870s was to maintain the community&#x27;s religious integrity. Wilkinsburg was known during this time by many as &quot;The Holy City&quot;.

==Arts and culture==
Wilkinsburg Borough has a Community Art and Civic Design Commission charged with review and legislation for &quot;new and renovated structures, infrastructure, landscapes, works of art, memorials, and monuments on all public property and on all private property designated for commercial use.&quot; Due to its location in Allegheny County, and especially its proximity to Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg is in the neighborhood for numerous opportunities for experiences in art and culture.

The most notable agent of revitalization and development in Wilkinsburg is the Wilkinsburg Community Development Corporation (WCDC), a non-profit incorporated in 2007 with a mission &quot;to promote the revitalization of Wilkinsburg through business &amp; residential development; organizational &amp; individual civic leadership; and ethnic &amp; cultural diversity&quot;. Their notable community programs include classes for local entrepreneurs, classes on home buying, community events, and the Vacant Home Tour. The WCDC focuses primarily on the Wilkinsburg Business District, the area around the intersection of Penn Avenue and Wood Street.
The WCDC&#x27;s Business District Revitalization Plan promotes a &quot;flourishing commercial and retail environment in Wilkinsburg&quot; and consists of planning and policy recommendations. In May 2015, the WCDC&#x27;s advocacy resulted in an approved liquor license referendum, legalizing the sale of up to five restaurant liquor licenses in the borough, which had been a dry community since 1935.

===Library===
In 1899 the Wilkinsburg library was founded as a branch of the Braddock library (which was the first of the Carnegie libraries in the nation).

==Parks and recreation==
Wilkinsburg has several parks of various sizes. The largest is Hunter Park, which at almost nine acres includes sports courts, fields, playground equipment, and woodland. There are also six smaller parks.

==Government and politics==

Wilkinsburg is a borough, located in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; which means that Wilkinsburg is a self-governing municipal entity, of the sort often thought of as a town. Wilkinsburg Borough is organized into three wards: First, Second, and Third.

Overall oversight of Wilkinsburg Borough is by the borough council. The borough council generally consists of nine elected representatives, three from each ward. Wilkinsburg has or has associated various boards, committees, and authorities. Wilkinsburg also has a mayor and a borough manager. Wilkinsburg Borough authorities, boards, and commissions include the Civil Service Commission, the Community Art and Civic Design Commission, the Citizens Advisory Commission on Shade Trees, the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, the Planning Commission, the Zoning Hearing Board, the Board of Library Directors, the Industrial and Commercial Development Authority, and the Municipal Authority.

Public education is handled by the Wilkinsburg School District&#x27;s board of directors, in combination with the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education, and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The domain of public education is separate from that of the borough.

Wilkinsburg water and sewage services are provided through a municipal authority, the Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authority, a coalition serving several communities. The Wilkinsburg Borough Council appoints three members to the board.

Wilkinsburg voters voted predominantly for the Democratic Party in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.

==Crime==
Wilkinsburg was home to the infamous Larimer Avenue-Wilkinsburg (LAW) Gang, which the federal government indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The indictment started in 1995 when the federal government investigated and arrested many people with criminal ties or activities. Overall, crime in Wilkinsburg is higher than in outlying neighborhoods on average. However, crime has slightly declined in recent years.

===2000 shooting spree===

On March 1, 2000, Wilkinsburg received national attention when Ronald Taylor killed three people and wounded two others in a racially motivated shooting spree that occurred in part at the local Burger King and McDonald&#x27;s restaurants.

===2016 mass shooting===

On March 9, 2016, five people, including a pregnant woman, were killed in a shooting at a cook-out in Wilkinsburg. The city council has many plans to beautify the neighborhood and repair many of the vacant homes such as the apartment building on 855 Rebecca Avenue. Furthermore, Vice President of the City Council recently started Wilkinsburg Community Conversations, whereby community members have the opportunity to discuss current issues the borough is facing.

==Education==
In its early history, education in Wilkinsburg was completely private. Many schools were started by different teachers and held in their homes. The Wilkinsburg Academy, founded in 1852, was the beginning of large-scale schooling. The borough adopted the Free Common School Act of 1834 in 1840; James Kelly loaned money for the first common school, which served until 1850. From this time, the number of students rose exponentially. By 1910, there were 4,253 students in six public schools. 
Today, Wilkinsburg School District consists of two elementary schools, Kelly Primary and Turner Intermediate schools. Due to lack of funding, Wilkinsburg&#x27;s Junior and Senior High schools closed in 2016. The district now outsources Junior and Senior High School education to Westinghouse High School in the Pittsburgh Public School district.

Wilkinsburg is also home to the Sister Thea Bowman Catholic Academy. This is a Catholic elementary school which was formed as a merger of St. James School in Wilkinsburg and Holy Rosary in Homewood (Pittsburgh). The new school is housed in the former St. James School building and educates children from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.

== Transportation ==
Wilkinsburg is located at the nexus of various transportation systems, including road, rail, and river.

===Road===

Wilkinsburg is located along historic roadways. For example, since 1913 Wilkinsburg is one of the locations transversed by the Lincoln Highway. The historic Lincoln Highway runs from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. The Lincoln Highway legacy includes Penn Avenue and Ardmore Boulevard in Wilkinsburg: these are State Route 8 and Federal Route 30. Penn Avenue was even earlier along the main trajectory of the Forbes Road, which was used by British officer John Forbes to lead a military expedition to attack the French position at Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt), in 1758, as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). Previously British officer Edward Braddock had built a road with the same general trajectory, known as Braddock&#x27;s Road (beneath which he was later buried), which lead to the French fortifications at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.

===Rail===
Until September 14, 1975, Wilkinsburg had inter-city passenger rail service. On that day Amtrak discontinued service, citing a total of 128 passengers boarding or alighting in the first six months of 1975, the lowest system-wide. The last train serving Wilkinsburg was the &quot;National Limited&quot;, which operated daily between New York City and Kansas City, Missouri. The PennDOT-operated &quot;Parkway Limited&quot; provided commuter service to Pittsburgh for nine months in 1981 but was also canceled because of low ridership.

Wilkinsburg has multiple stations operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway:
* Wilkinsburg bus station
* Hamnett bus station

===Rivers===

Historically the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River created an important transportation nexus. Before the modern road and rail systems transportation along waterways was even more significant than it is today. Wilkinsburg is located between the Allegheny and the Monongahela rivers, near to where they meet to form the Ohio River, although Wilkinsburg does not actually border either river.

<text>Apollo is a borough in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States, northeast of Pittsburgh in a former coal-mining region. Apollo was settled in 1790, laid out in 1816, and incorporated as a borough in 1848. The population was 1,615 at the 2020 United States Census

==History==

The area was sectioned in 1769, following the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, as a farm known as &quot;Warren&#x27;s Sleeping Place&quot;, named after a Native American trader from the area named Edward Warren. It was soon surveyed and divided into lots, with the town of Warren officially being added to the Greensburg register on November 9, 1816. The log cabin home of the Drake family still stands in the area, and is one of the oldest buildings in Armstrong County.

With the introduction of the post office, the area was officially renamed from Warren to Apollo in 1848 to avoid confusion with the post office of another town in Pennsylvania of the same name. The present name is after Apollo, the Greek and Roman god of music, healing, light, prophecy and enlightenment.

By the late 19th century the Apollo Iron &amp; Steel Company dominated the local economy. In 1895, the company&#x27;s president, George Gibson McMurtry, hired prominent landscape architects Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot to design a town for Apollo Iron &amp; Steel&#x27;s workers. The result was the neighboring town of Vandergrift. In 1911, Apollo became home to the first public library in Armstrong County.

The Roaring Run Recreation Area is located one mile upriver (southeast) of Apollo and can be accessed via the Apollo Kiski River Trail. Stone remnants of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Mainline Canal, that passed through Apollo and operated between 1825 and 1850, can be found along the Roaring Run Trail. The canal made use of the Kiskiminetas River using a system of slackwater dams, and the boats floated on the river, entering a lock located at the mouth of Roaring Run. From there the canal ran along the path of the current Roaring Run Trail, through the entire length of the borough, entering the Kiskiminetas River again across the river from where the current borough of East Vandergrift is situated.

The borough suffered significant damage in the 1936 St. Patrick&#x27;s Day flood. The Kiskiminetas River rose more than 15 feet above flood stage. 95 area homes were damaged or washed away and the borough&#x27;s bridge was destroyed, according to the Apollo Area Historical Society.

The Drake Log Cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

==Geography==
Apollo is located on the Kiskiminetas River at (40.584103, -79.564363).

==Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods==
Apollo has two land borders, including North Apollo to the north and Kiskiminetas Township to the east and south. Across the Kiskiminetas River in Westmoreland County to the west, Apollo runs adjacent with Oklahoma with the 1st Street Bridge as a connector.

<text>Ford City is a borough in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States, northeast of Pittsburgh along the east bank of the Allegheny River and south of Kittanning, the county seat. The population was 2,859 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
=== Founding ===
Ford City came into being from the plans of Captain John B. Ford (1811-1903), an industrialist interested in establishing a plate-glass industry. In prior endeavors, Ford had owned and operated, among many things, a river shipping line from which he drew his capital. The site upon which Ford City is located consisted roughly 460 acres broken primarily into three farms owned by Ross, Spencer and Graff families.

Ford’s explorations of the area prior to his land acquisitions had discovered the Allegheny River offered a unique asset in its composition. Besides the obvious advantage of low-cost shipping, the Allegheny River is one of only four gravel- bottom rivers in the world. Characteristics of this type of river was massive deposits of glacial sand, an essential element in the manufacture of glass. Also discovered in the area were huge deposits of natural gas, the fuel source required to fire the immense kilns used to melt the glass’s elements. Having secured his resources, all that Ford required to begin his venture was a very large labor force.

As legends tells, Ford sent agents to glassmaking towns all across Europe. From existing European glass enterprises, his agents quietly recruited experienced glassworkers. Offering a fair day’s wage and affordable housing, Ford’s agents were highly successful in getting the workers Ford needed. They were so successful, in fact, that some towns in Europe were left nearly emptied of male adult glassworkers. An excellent example of this took place in Stolberg, Germany from which Ford recruited a large number of Ford City’s first glass-working immigrants. From Ireland and France, Ford lured away men experienced in supervision of a glassworks. The early recruited foreman were offered an excellent wage and the promise of a house with marble-mantled fireplaces. These early workers also brought with them their various faiths in God, which manifested in many different Catholic churches of Ford City, including Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church; Christ Prince of Peace; and St. Francis DePaul.

=== Early History ===
In 1886, Ford City submitted and received its charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. One of the men who delivered the original charter to Harrisburg was Robert Naismith, brother of James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. Previously part of Manor Township, Ford City Borough became one of the fastest-growing boroughs in the United States, gaining over 3,000 in population in only 10 years. Drawing workers and their families from over 35 identifiable European ethnic groups, Ford City became the quintessential example of America’s melting pot. Uniquely, Ford City never experienced racial or ethnic strife- Ford’s glass factory made all men equal.
Through the early 20th century, Ford’s company, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG Industries), became the leading manufacturer of glass in the entire world. Producing a better type of glass at a lesser price than its European competitors. PPG’s efficiency and product quality virtually ended the importation of European glass to the United States. As demand increased, the need for more laborers in the Ford City Works factory also increased. The town grew daily.

Through the early part of the 20th century, Ford City prospered. It touched every skyscraper of the United States in the glass that formed the exteriors of the magnificent structures. The common bond was found in the changing of the shifts at PPG and at the Friday-night basketball games. Ford City High School basketball has seemingly prospered the life of the town. Winning the section title was an annual event, and the teams amassed a Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) record 34 section titles. It used to be said that every garage in every alley in Ford City had a basketball hoop attached to it. Boulder Park became a mecca of summer league basketball, drawing teams from as far away as Pittsburgh and New Castle.

In the early 1970’s, manufacturing changes at PPG caused a relocation of many of the town’s workers. This trend continued for 20 years, with the workforce gradually being reduced or transferred to PPG’s other plants. Finally, in 1992, PPG permanently closed its gates and began the demolition of portions of the Ford City Works, formerly the largest plate-glass factory in the world. As its peak, PPG employed over 4,000 workers. Its loss to Ford City was profound and deeply felt. To this day, the number of pensioned workers from PPG Ford City Works is greater than the total workforces of many of PPG’s existing operating facilities. The loss of PPG was economically devastating to the town.
In 1987 Natures Blend moved to a portion of the former factory. In 1989 it began manufacturing cabinet doors, drawer fronts, and framing for some of the area’s largest housing builders. By 1999, Nature’s Blend had grown in sales and product offerings, necessitating expansion. They doubled their production floor space to over 80,000 sq. ft. and invested in additional equipment. This expansion provided them with the means to process hardwoods from kiln-dried state to finished product, ready to install. 

In 1989, KPM, founded by Sam Kube and Albert Plekker in Greensburg, Pennsylvania in 1983, moved into the new company headquarters in Ford City, Pennsylvania in a small portion of the former plant. The presidents decide to specialize in the modernization of roll grinders in 1990. In 1999, KPM became part of the Herkules Group providing employment opportunities within the Borough.
Dallas-based Eljer had operated a facility in Ford City since 1918 when the company acquired a former pottery plant from PPG Industries and Ford City founder John B. Ford. The name &quot;Eljer&quot; was formed by founders Raymond Elmer Crane and Elmer Jerome Bacchus putting together the first few letters of their middle names. Today, American Standard, which merged with the well-known plumbing brands Eljer and Crane, is owned primarily by private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, with private equity firm Bain Capital Partners Inc. holding a minority share. 

The Ford City plant had a long manufacturing history, but in prior years to its closing its work force had gradually decreased. About 20 years before, the plant employed around 700. By 2003, employment had fallen to 500, then to 300 in 2004. By early 2007, employment had fallen another 140. However, the Borough&#x27;s situation worsened with the shutdown of the plant in 2008, further impacting local employment. 

=== Recent History ===
In more recent history, Ford City has attempted recovery from its economic collapse. In 2004, Ford City Community Development Corporation secured $12 million in funds to construct a 70,000-square-foot business incubator on the site of the former Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) factory. This initiative was part of the town’s broader revitalization efforts aimed at attracting new businesses and creating job opportunities. The project was designed to help stimulate economic growth and provide a space for startups and small businesses to thrive.

The Community Development Corporation attracted as tenants a high-tech manufacturing company, Caracal, and a window-shade company, OEM Shades. But Caracal, which was fairly new, began experiencing financial problems and had trouble paying its rent. Without that income, the community-development corporation went bankrupt in 2008; Caracal followed in 2009, the same year the borough was forced to foreclose on the property. This led to the Borough being given a $580,000 fine by the U.S. Economic Development Administration for foreclosing on the property too soon, violating the EDA grant. This was soon after settled in 2016 when Borough Council authorized a $116,000 payment to the Economic Development Authority, paying the fine originally levied in 2015 and eliminating any connection to the business-incubator project.
In a turn of the tide, Belleflex Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of Blair Strip Steel Company and manufacture of Bellville Springs and other custom steel products, renovated and occupies a portion of the former PPG Plant used for the business incubator. In addition to their occupation, a second subsidiary PullFlex Technologies, an &quot;American producer of Fiberglass Reinforced Polymers focusing on specialty and custom designed applications like high strength-to-weight ratio composite materials, hybrid resin systems and custom woven and stitched material solutions&quot; renovated and now occupies an additional portion of the plant. 

=== Future Developments ===
Moving forward, the Borough is expected to see development of the former PPG Brownfields in the Southern portion of town. In 2021, Borough Council voted to approve and authorize borough officials to execute an option agreement with the Armstrong County Industrial Development Council for a 120-day term and $1,000 consideration related to 30 acres of real property owned by the borough located along 2nd Avenue at the southern end of the borough adjacent to the river. Soon after, a 10-acre portion was sold to Belleflex Technologies which neighbors the property. Additionally, a 20-acre portion was sold to Projectile Tube Cleaning Inc. of Manor Township. These businesses are expected to develop the currently vacant land bringing economic opportunities to the Borough. The Northern Brownfields are privately owned, with hopes of future development.

==Television==
Freeport was the setting for a scene in Episode 8 of NBC&#x27;s television series &quot;Revolution&quot;, which aired in November 2012. The main characters are ambushed while trying to cross a bridge over the Allegheny River. They are turned back, and subsequently decide to attempt another bridge crossing in nearby Ford City, Pennsylvania.

==History==
The first settlement was made at Freeport in the 1760s. Freeport received its name from David Todd, who declared it a free and open port. The borough was incorporated in 1833. Freeport was a port on the former Pennsylvania Canal.

Twenty-seven lots on the lands became Freeport borough, and were conveyed by William and David Todd for $24 each in 1797. This land was originally part of Westmoreland County but by the time the town was laid out, it had been made part of Allegheny County.

This land was originally called Todd&#x27;s Town after the founding Todd family, and it would go by this name until its incorporation in 1833. It was a proclamation by David Todd that gave the town the name of Freeport. Todd said: &quot;all the ground between the houses on Water Street and the river shall be free to all the lot-owners, and that boats, rafts, and other river craft landing here should be free of wharfage. Ever since the laying out of the town, it is a free port for all the river craft; so, this town christened by the proprietors has ever since been called Freeport.&quot;

Freeport&#x27;s position on the Allegheny river gave it an ideal spot for industry and trade going to Pittsburgh. Therefore, it had several industrial businesses throughout the 19th century including the Lucesco Oil Refinery and the Freeport Brick Company. Remains of these businesses can still be seen on the river and are sometimes mistaken for the remains of the old Pennsylvania canal.

Freeport P.O. appears in the 1876 Atlas of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. Its early history is detailed in Robert Walter Smith&#x27;s 1883 History of Armstrong County. A more recent account of Freeport&#x27;s history up to 2018 was published by Steven Gardner.

<doc id="131209" wikidata="Q1773129" url="?curid=131209" title="Gilpin Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Gilpin Township is a Second class Township in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a township rich in history, dating back to early 19th-century settlement. Officially incorporated on December 26, 1878, it evolved from an agricultural and timber-based economy to an industrial hub, supported by its abundant natural resources—including coal, salt, timber, natural gas, and sand—and its strategic location along the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers. These rivers not only fostered trade and transportation but also enabled Gilpin’s transformation into a manufacturing center. The township includes various communities—Bagdad, Johnetta, Schenley, Georgetown, Banfield, Forks Church, Aladdin, and Maher Heights—each contributing uniquely to its development and legacy. As of the 2020 Census, its population was 2,411.

==History==

=== Early Settlement and Formation ===
Originally part of Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, (Armstrong County effective November 1805) which was incorporated March 12, 1800, the area that is now Gilpin Township attracted settlers around 1812 due to its fertile soil, dense forests, and access to major rivers. Early families, including the Bolens, Coulters, and Klingensmiths, established homesteads, cleared land, and developed farms that would form the foundation of the township’s agrarian economy. The rivers served as vital transportation routes, allowing settlers to trade with neighboring communities and supporting early economic growth.

As the population of Allegheny grew to 2,539 at the 1870 Census and economic activities continued to expand in the 1870’s, residents began seeking local governance to better address the needs of their community. John Gilpin, Esq., a prominent attorney from Kittanning, played a crucial role in organizing the formation of the township, which was formally established on December 26, 1878, and named in his honor. Gilpin Township’s incorporation allowed for better management and governance, facilitating future growth and development.

==== Agricultural Foundations and Timber Industry ====
In its early years, Gilpin Township’s economy was largely agrarian. Settlers cultivated crops such as corn, oats, and wheat and raised livestock, establishing a self-sufficient, agriculturally driven community. Farming provided economic stability and allowed Gilpin’s population to grow and thrive.

The township’s abundant forests led to a prosperous timber industry. The first sawmill was built by Michael Barrickman on Elder’s Run in 1812, with another established by Philip Klingensmith in 1817. These sawmills processed timber for construction and trade, marking timber as one of Gilpin’s first commercial exports. Timber supplied local needs and contributed to the development of neighboring towns, providing a stable economic foundation that would support future growth in other industries.

==== Industrialization: Coal, Salt, Natural Gas, and Sand ====
The discovery of coal in the Pittsburgh Coal Seam in the mid-19th century marked a transformative period for Gilpin Township’s economy. This high-quality coal seam extended through several areas, including Maher Heights, Georgetown, Johnetta, and Aladdin, attracting mining companies and spurring rapid economic expansion. Coal mining soon became the township’s dominant industry, providing steady employment and drawing more settlers to the area. The extracted coal was transported along the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers to Pittsburgh and other industrial centers, solidifying Gilpin’s role as a key coal supplier. By the late 1800s, railroads further expanded the township’s reach, linking it to broader markets and fueling continued growth.

Salt mining also became significant, particularly in the village of Bagdad. Salt was crucial for food preservation before refrigeration, making it a valuable resource. Bagdad’s salt mines supplied local and regional markets, with salt transported along the Kiskiminetas River and the Pennsylvania Railroad. A notable section along the canal, known as “Wherry’s Defeat,” became infamous after a failed riprap wall construction by contractor James Wherry, exemplifying the challenges of infrastructure projects at that time.

Aladdin became notable for pioneering the use of natural gas. Wells drilled in Aladdin supplied gas to the nearby town of Leechburg, marking one of the first commercial uses of natural gas in Western Pennsylvania.

In addition to coal, salt, and natural gas, Gilpin Township has rich sand deposits, which were mined by companies such as Allegheny Metals &amp; Minerals for use in glassmaking and construction. Although sand mining was less prominent than other industries, it added to the township’s industrial diversity and economic resilience, contributing to Gilpin’s reputation as a resource-rich area.

=== Key Communities and Their Contributions ===
Each community within Gilpin Township contributed uniquely to its economy, culture, and historical landscape.

==== Bagdad ====
Bagdad, located along the Kiskiminetas River, emerged as an early settlement and industrial hub in Gilpin Township. Known for both salt and coal mining, Bagdad’s name is believed to have originated from the phrase “Here comes a bag, dad,” referencing the salt industry’s practice of bagging salt for transport. Bagdad’s proximity to the Pennsylvania Canal and later the Pennsylvania Railroad made it an essential transit point for the township’s resources, connecting it to larger markets.

Bagdad’s industrial importance was underscored by its location near “Wherry’s Defeat”—a segment of the canal notorious for construction difficulties. Contractor James Wherry faced significant setbacks while building a riprap retaining wall to stabilize the canal path along the river, which collapsed due to flooding. This incident left a lasting local story about the challenges of infrastructure projects in the area.

In the 1960s, Bagdad saw a major transformation when Allegheny Ludlum (now Allegheny Technologies, Inc.) acquired the land to build an industrial mill across the river from their West Leechburg plant. This acquisition led to the relocation of residents and the demolition of buildings. The mill operated until 2016, and today, Bagdad exists solely in memory. The site, now occupied by the mill’s shuttered facilities, stands as a relic of the village’s industrial past, marking the end of Bagdad’s active role in Gilpin Township’s economy.

==== Johnetta ====

Johnetta, once a thriving industrial town along the Allegheny River, was founded in 1892 when a significant 15-foot clay seam was discovered after the area’s Kittanning coal seam had been exhausted. This discovery spurred the establishment of the United States Sewer Pipe Company, which specialized in manufacturing pavers, high-grade bricks, and sewer pipes, employing about 500 workers at its peak. The town was named after John H. Jones, the head of the Pittsburgh-Buffalo Company, and his daughter Etta, reflecting its close ties to the company that created and sustained the town.

Johnetta was strategically positioned with access to the Allegheny Valley Railroad and the nearby river, making it easy to transport products to market. The discovery of natural gas below the clay seam and additional coal deposits further fueled the town’s rapid growth. With around 140 homes, a 

company store, schoolhouse, and the Johnetta Memorial Church, the town was a well-equipped community where residents could live close to their work.

Incorporated as a borough on January 26, 1905, Johnetta symbolized the boom of company towns in the industrial era. However, its fortunes declined in the 1920s when the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company acquired and subsequently closed the plant. The town struggled economically without its industrial base, and on June 4, 1930, Johnetta was officially dissolved as a borough. Today, the former site of Johnetta serves as one of Gilpin Township’s three riverside campgrounds, preserving the memory of a once-bustling community that played an important role in the region’s industrial history.

==== Schenley ====
Schenley, situated at the confluence of the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers in Gilpin Township, became a prominent center of American whiskey production and a major industrial site in the early 20th century. The land in Schenley was originally owned by Mary Elizabeth Croghan Schenley, a Pittsburgh heiress who inherited a vast real estate portfolio across Western Pennsylvania. Her estate’s holdings and strategic location made Schenley an ideal location for industrial ventures.

In 1888, chemist Frank Sinclair, his brother Harry Sinclair, and investor Henry Bischoff established the Schenley Distilling Company. The area’s pure water sources, proximity to coal mines, and access to the Allegheny Valley Railroad and major shipping routes influenced their decision to set up operations in Schenley. These resources, coupled with the rising demand for whiskey and spirits, enabled the company to grow quickly. Over time, Schenley Distilling Company became one of the largest whiskey producers in the United States, with its products gaining nationwide recognition.

During Prohibition (1920-1933), Schenley Distilling was one of the few distilleries permitted to continue operations under a government license to produce medicinal alcohol. This rare allowance enabled the company to retain its workforce and maintain its infrastructure, while many other distilleries across the country were forced to shut down. The medicinal license allowed Schenley to position itself strategically for growth after Prohibition ended. By the time the Prohibition repeal arrived, Schenley was ready to scale up rapidly, acquiring several other distilleries, brands, and distribution networks, ultimately establishing itself as an industry powerhouse.

In its peak years, Schenley was a self-contained industrial community that featured 67 buildings spread across a 60-acre complex. The site included warehouses for aging whiskey, bottling facilities, and office buildings. Additionally, the Schenley complex included recreational facilities for employees, such as a bowling alley, an auditorium, and the Schenley Club—a social venue where employees gathered, enjoying views over the river. The Schenley Club symbolized the company’s commitment to its workers, fostering a community spirit within the industrial site.

Schenley’s impact extended beyond its physical location. The company owned several other prominent brands and distilleries across the country, including the historic Glenmore Distillery and the Old Quaker distillery, contributing to its position as a leading American distiller. In 1968, the Glen Alden Corporation acquired Schenley, moving its headquarters to the Empire State Building in New York City. Despite these corporate changes, the Schenley plant in Gilpin Township continued production until November 11, 1983, when the last truckload of whiskey departed the plant, marking the end of an era.

Today, the site once occupied by Schenley Distilling Company remains active with Armstrong Terminal, Inc., and BPI Inc. utilizing the area, maintaining a connection to Schenley’s industrial past. Additionally, Schenley has become a valued recreational area within Gilpin Township, featuring two riverside campgrounds along the scenic riverbanks as well as the Schenley Trailhead of the Armstrong Trail (Formerly Allegheny Valley Land Trust). These campgrounds attract campers, fishers, and boating enthusiasts, blending Schenley’s rich industrial heritage with its modern recreational appeal, ensuring that the legacy of this once-prominent whiskey town endures.

==== Aladdin ====

Aladdin, located within Gilpin Township just north of Schenley, became an industrial center known for coal mining and natural gas production. Incorporated as a Borough on September 12, 1867 and dissolved on March 7, 1878, 1870 Census Records show a population of 29. The community’s true growth began, after its dissolution as a Borough, in 1894 when a group of miners established coal operations in the area, mining the Freeport vein, a valuable coal seam that could be accessed through “drifting” techniques. Although the miners initially faced financial challenges, the operation was revitalized in 1898 when Joseph G. Beale of Leechburg acquired the works, forming the Aladdin Coal Company and establishing a stable coal mining enterprise. This connection to the Allegheny Valley Railroad facilitated efficient transport, further boosting the industry.

Aladdin also became notable for its natural gas production. William Porterie, a Greek immigrant, drilled for gas on land acquired from the Schenley estate. His success in uncovering a reliable gas source enabled him to supply nearby towns, including Freeport and Leechburg, marking one of the first instances of commercial natural gas use in Western Pennsylvania. Aladdin’s coal and natural gas industries underscored its importance as a significant contributor to the local economy and Gilpin Township’s industrial heritage.

==== Georgetown ====

Georgetown developed as a residential community near the Kiskiminetas River for coal miners. Miners and their families typically lived in company-owned housing, which fostered a close-knit, working-class community. Although coal mining has since declined, Georgetown remains a symbol of Gilpin’s early industrial spirit.

==== Banfield ====
Banfield, a residential area near Georgetown and Leechburg and along the Kiskiminetas River, provided housing for workers in Gilpin’s mines and other industries. Its location near the river and industrial centers allowed it to support the township’s labor needs, forming part of the cohesive network of industrial communities within Gilpin.

==== Forks Church ====

Forks Church, home to the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church, is a historically significant site in Gilpin Township. Established in the early 19th century, the church began as a gathering point for German-speaking settlers near the “fork” of the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers. This location provided the name “Forks Church” and served as the foundation for the congregation, which was formally incorporated in 1849. The original frame church building was constructed shortly after incorporation but was tragically destroyed by fire in 1869. It was replaced by a new frame structure at a cost of $3,000, serving as the spiritual home for many in the township.

The church played a central role in the community, not only as a place of worship but also as a cultural and historical center. In 1937, the Daughters of the American Revolution, through the Fort Hand Chapter, undertook an effort to preserve the church’s baptismal records, translating and transcribing them from the original German. These records provide invaluable insights into the lives of early Gilpin residents and reflect the rich heritage of German immigrants in the area.

Forks Church also includes a large cemetery, sometimes referred to as the “Burial Ground,” where many Civil War veterans and soldiers from the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War are interred. A parsonage was added in 1905, offering a residence for pastors and enhancing the church’s community role. Forks Church remains a landmark of historical and cultural significance, preserving the legacy of early settlers and the generations that followed.

==== Maher Heights ====
Maher Heights, primarily a mining community, centered around coal mines operated by the Hicks Coal Company. The company provided housing for miners and their families, creating a close-knit community centered on coal production. Maher Heights extended into Georgetown, with additional housing for miners, highlighting the township’s strong connection to the coal industry.

=== Influence of the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers ===
The Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers were vital to Gilpin Township’s economic growth, supporting the movement of coal, salt, timber, and sand to broader markets, particularly Pittsburgh. These rivers linked Gilpin’s resources to larger cities, allowing the township to flourish as an industrial center. Today, these rivers contribute to Gilpin’s recreational appeal, attracting anglers, boaters, and nature enthusiasts and supporting the township’s transition to a rural and leisure-focused community.

=== Infrastructure and Notable Landmarks ===
Gilpin Township includes the Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 5, a significant infrastructure project constructed between 1920 and 1927 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This facility, which features a lock measuring 56 by 360 feet and an 11.6-foot lift, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The dam is approximately 22 feet high and 632 feet long and represents Gilpin’s role in regional waterway management and infrastructure development. As of 2024, Lock No. 5 is the northern most Lock which operates for industrial purposes.

=== Present and Future of Gilpin Township ===
Today, Gilpin Township focuses on recreational development, industrial development, and community preservation. Existing industries, such as Armstrong Terminal, Inc., and BPI Inc., maintain a modest presence, while the township’s three riverside campgrounds—two in Schenley and one in Johnetta—draw visitors for camping, fishing, and outdoor activities, bolstering tourism and supporting the local economy. Recent zoning updates and a planned comprehensive review of the township’s policies aim to balance industrial growth with rural preservation, ensuring that Gilpin’s future aligns with community values.

<doc id="131212" wikidata="Q1186994" url="?curid=131212" title="Kittanning, Pennsylvania">
<text>Kittanning ( ) is a borough in and the county seat of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is situated northeast of Pittsburgh, along the east bank of the Allegheny River. The population was 3,921 at the 2020 census.

The name is derived from &quot;Kithanink&quot;, which means &#x27;on the main river&#x27; in Lenape or the Delaware language, from &quot;kit-&quot; &#x27;big&#x27; + &quot;hane&quot; &#x27;mountain river&#x27; + -&quot;ink&quot; (suffix used in place names). &quot;The main river&quot; is a Lenape term for the Allegheny and Ohio combined, which they considered as all one river. The borough and its bridge have been used as a setting for several recent films.

==History==

The borough is located on the east bank of the Allegheny River, founded on the site of the eighteenth-century Lenape (Delaware) village of Kittanning at the western end of the Kittanning Path, an ancient Native American path.

In 1756, the village was destroyed by John Armstrong Sr. at the Battle of Kittanning during the French and Indian War. During the attack, a blast from the explosion of gunpowder stored in Captain Jacobs&#x27;s house was heard at Fort Duquesne, present day Pittsburgh, 44 miles away.

Kittanning was designated as the seat of Armstrong County when the county was organized. It was settled by European Americans largely after the American Revolutionary War, although Anthony Sadowski (also recorded by the anglicized name of Sandusky), a prominent Polish-American trader, and other Native American traders operated here before the War.

During the American Civil War, the 103rd Regiment of Pennsylvania Infantry volunteers was organized at Kittanning from September 1861 to February 1862. Among other engagements, the unit participated in the Siege of Yorktown (1862) as well as the Battle of Plymouth (1864), during which most of the regiment was captured.

By the early in the 20th century, the city had developed considerable industry: large iron and steel works, foundries, and coal mines, all associated with the steel and iron industries of Pittsburgh; glassworks, flour and lumber mills; china, pottery, brick, lime, and clay works; and mirror and typewriter factories, breweries, etc. It reached its peak of population in 1930 and was adversely affected by the Great Depression. After World War II, changes in industry and restructuring of heavy industry caused a loss of jobs in many of these works, with an associated population decline.

The playground on North Jefferson Street was developed on the former site of the historic Kittanning Cemetery. In order to enable this, the city moved 274 graves in 1960 to a new cemetery formed along Troy Hill Road.
In 1900, 3,902 people lived in Kittanning, and in 1910, there were 4,311 inhabitants. After Kittanning merged with Wickboro (1910 population 2,775), in 1914, the population was estimated at 10,000, which was likely high. The 1920 census counted 7,153 residents. In 1930, there were 7,808 residents; in 1940, 7,550. Since late 20th century industrial decline, the population was 4,044 at the 2010 census.

The Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 7 and Armstrong County Courthouse and Jail are each listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
