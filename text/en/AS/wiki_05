==History==
Staatsburg was part of the Pawling-Staats land patent, one of many granted by the English colonial government in the 1690s with the intention of encouraging more colonials to settle in the sparsely populated Hudson Valley. The original patent was made to Henry Pawling. Subsequently, a large portion of the patent was purchased by Dr. Samuel Staats, a surgeon of Dutch origins who resided in New York City. He and Dirck Vanderburgh bought it for 130 pounds from Pawling&#x27;s widow. As a result of the combination of their names, the area came to be known as &quot;Staatsburgh&quot;.

<text>Tivoli is a village in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population is 1,012, according to the 2020 census. The village, which was incorporated in 1872 from parts of Upper Red Hook Landing and Madalin, is the northernmost settlement in the county, located in the northwestern part of the town of Red Hook. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. It is entirely within the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. The village is accessible via New York State Route 9G at an intersection with Dutchess County Route 78.

The Kaatsbaan Cultural Center is located within the village boundaries. It was once known as the Kaatsbaan International Dance Center.

== History ==
For thousands of years, indigenous peoples had lived in this area. The historic Mohican Native American tribe was living in the area now known as Tivoli at the time Dutch colonists arrived in the 1600s. The Mohican derive from Lenni Lenape people who moved North from the coastal areas and settled in today’s Hudson Valley. They lived along the Hudson River which they named &quot;Mahicannituck&quot;. They originally called themselves the Muh-he-con-neok (The People of the Waters That Are Never Still). Based on their location, they were often referred to as the River Indians. Their name evolved in spelling over the years, including the name “Mahikan”, until it became today’s Mohican.
A deed to land purchased by Robert Livingston from several Mahican Indians in July 1683, is the strongest evidence that the Roeliff Jansen Kill is considered to mark the downriver boundary of Mahican territory on the East side of the Hudson Valley. This land purchased would form the majority of the manor and lordship of Livingston. Historical accounts state that the settled land of Tivoli was purchased from Native American communities “legitimately” by Colonel David Schuyler on June 2, 1688, although no records of this transaction exist today. There is speculation as to whether or not the Mohican Tribe “fully understood European notions of land ownership.&quot; This transaction would have been a trade of goods in exchange for land. This deal was part of the Schuyler Patent, a June 1688 patent defining some of the towns and villages in Dutchess County and the Poughkeepsie regional area. The patent was obtained for land in the far North-West corner of Dutchess County, lying to the East of Magdalen Island (present-day Cruger Island). The North boundary of the patent abutted the Livingston Purchase of 1683.

The village was formerly known as &quot;Upper Red Hook Landing&quot;. An adjacent community, &quot;Madalin&quot;, was contiguous to Upper Red Hook Landing.

Peter Delabegarre – also known as Pierre de la Bigarre – purchased land along the Hudson River in the 1790s south of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston&#x27;s estate Clermont, in order to build a village he called &quot;Tivoli&quot;; the name was taken from the location of the Roman resort. His planned settlement was never built as he conceived it before he went bankrupt, but the name of Tivoli remained attached to the area.

The village of Tivoli was incorporated in 1872, consolidating Madalin and Upper Red Hook Landing. The population at the time was 1,081.
=== Rose Hill ===
Rose Hill, located on Rose Hill Lane off Woods Road in Tivoli, New York, is an estate with a villa built in the Tuscan style in 1843 by John Watts de Peyster. The name Rose Hill comes from the summer home in Upper Manhattan of de Peyster&#x27;s grandfather, Watts, which in turn was named after the grandfather&#x27;s estate near Edinburgh. After his death, it became the Leake and Watts Orphan House. The estate was bought in 1964 by Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker Movement, which operated it as a farm until 1978. As of 2017, it was the home of painters Brice and Helen Marden, owners of the Hotel Tivoli.

John Cranch&#x27;s sister spent a much-enjoyed summer at Rose Hill.

==Geography==
Tivoli is located in the northwest corner of Dutchess County. The Tivoli Landing, where Tivoli meets the Hudson River, offers natural advantages that have led members of the Dutchess County Historical Society to assert that there were sporadic American Indian encampments there. The two islands nearby provided a measure of safety.

<text>Wappinger is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The town is located in the Hudson River Valley region, on the eastern bank of the Hudson River. The population was 28,216 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the Wappinger Native Americans who inhabited the area. Wappinger comprises three-fourths of the incorporated village of Wappingers Falls, several unincorporated hamlets such as Chelsea, Diddell, Hughsonville, Middlebush, Myers Corners, New Hackensack, and Swartwoutville, and a number of neighborhoods.

== History ==
The Wappinger were a confederacy of Native Americans whose territory, in the 17th century, was spread along the eastern shore of the Hudson River. Primarily based in what is now Dutchess County, their territory bordered Manhattan Island to the south, the Mahican territory bounded by the Roeliff Jansen Kill to the north, and extended east into parts of Connecticut.

They spoke an eastern-Algonkian language. Culturally they were closely related to the Lenape people (Delaware Indians) to the west and south of Wappinger lands, and also related to the Mahican people to their immediate north and to the Metoac peoples of Long Island. &quot;Wappinger&quot; means &quot;easterner&quot; in most Algonkian languages.

The town of Wappinger, originally a part of the town of Fishkill, was formed on May 20, 1875, and lies wholly within the limits of the historic Rombout Patent, granted in 1685. The geographical area of Wappinger was first illegally settled in 1659 by members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Seeking religious freedom, they settled near the mouth of the Wappinger Creek until Dutch Authorities removed them months later. It wasn&#x27;t until 1685 when Francis Rombout and Gulian Verplanck were the first to legally purchase 85,000 acres from the Wappinger This would later be known as the Rombout Patent. The patent covered the towns of Fishkill, East Fishkill, Wappinger, the City of Beacon, and parts of LaGrange and Poughkeepsie, these municipalities were once all a part of the Town of Fishkill. Following the Rombout Patent, the first legal land purchase within the Town of Wappinger was in 1714 when Elias Van Benschoten purchased land and settled in the hamlet of New Hackensack. Following him were other families from Hackensack, New Jersey. The Town of Wappinger is made up of many small hamlets and communities and was primarily agricultural, while mills lined the creek in the Village of Wappingers Falls. Once the Town of Wappinger was officially created from the Town of Fishkill on May 20, 1875, it took another year to elect officials. The first meeting was held at the Brower Brother&#x27;s Wagon Shop on Mill Street. The meetings of Town officials took place in the homes of the elected officials, whose jobs were mostly to maintain roadways and bridges.

===Historic districts===
* Wheeler Hill Historic District includes 49 contributing buildings, 15 contributing sites, and four contributing structures. It encompasses the estates of Obercreek, Elmhurst, Edge Hill, the former estates of Henry Suydam and William Crosby, and Carnwath Farms that were developed between 1740 and 1940. Also included are two 18th century riverfront commercial structures, the Lent / Waldron Store, and Stone House at Farmer&#x27;s Landing. Within this district, Wheeler Hill Road was once known as Rives Avenue or Hill, after Francis Rives who purchased the former Willis estate (Carnwath Farms) in 1870.

* The Wappingers Falls Historic District is in the center of the village of Wappingers Falls, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is roughly centered along South Avenue, West Main Street and Wappinger Creek. It includes Mesier Park and many adjacent residential neighborhoods, roughly bounded by Elm, Park, Walker, Market and McKinley streets. Much of the district was built in the wake of the industrialization of Wappingers Falls in the 19th century, and its styles represent a cross-section of that century. The east and west sides of the village are connected by an 1884 stone arch bridge over the falls that replaced earlier wooden structures.

===Hamlets===
* Chelsea – A hamlet in the southwestern part of the town near the Hudson River, primarily residential. A marina is located on the river. In the northern section of the hamlet, there is a large pumping station used by the Delaware Aqueduct New York City water supply system during droughts to take water directly from the river. Chelsea was originally known as Low Point and derived its name from a low point of land extending into the river. It also served to distinguish it from the next hamlet north on the east bank of the river, once known as High Point, now New Hamburg. The hamlet was called Low Point until the completion of the Hudson River Railroad. At that time it was named Carthage. However, as mail was being misdirected to another Carthage in Jefferson County, it was renamed Carthage Landing. In 1901, when the railroad built a new station, the name became Chelsea. The hamlet&#x27;s post office was established in 1840 as Low Point. The current post office was the former 1875 district school.
* Diddell was a hamlet in the northeastern section of the town, just east of New Hackensack. By the 1800s the Maybrook Railroad, which ran from Pawling to Poughkeepsie, established a station here. This rail line has since become the William R. Steinhaus Dutchess Rail Trail, with a trail-head at Diddell. In 2017 Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the creation of the 750-mile Empire State Trail that runs from Manhattan to Buffalo, which passes through the Diddell hamlet of Wappinger.
* Hughsonville – A hamlet situated one mile south of Wappingers Falls and which derives its name from William Hughson, one of four brothers who emigrated from England. Dr. Walter Hughson was born in Hughsonville on October 31, 1816. He became a successful surgeon in the county and died of consumption on December 9, 1857. The Presbyterian Church of Hughsonville was erected in 1840. A post office was established there in 1847. The Hughsonville Fire Company traces its date of establishment to 1912.
* Middlebush, situated approximately one mile south-east of Wappingers Falls, was an early business center. A post office was located there in 1824 that also served residents of Chelsea. The first Baptist church in the town was organized there in 1782. Abm. Van Wyck deeded the Society a piece of land for a site for a church and burying ground. The old cemetery remains, southeast of the intersection of Middlebush Road and Sgt. Palmateer Way (Old Route 9). In 1830, that meeting house became the property of the Methodist church, and was used by them as a house of worship until the present Methodist church in Wappingers Falls was erected in 1869, when it was taken down and the material used in the construction of the barn and sheds connected with that church. During the mid to late 19th century, Middlebush was known as Fowler House, named after Dr. Orson Fowler&#x27;s octagon house that once stood on Route 9. This hamlet has two schools, businesses, housing, and the Wappinger Town Hall.
* Myers Corners, at the intersection of Myers Corners Road and All Angels Hill Road was named after John Myers of Holland and was mostly farm land but had a doctor, a school and a tavern.
* New Hackensack – Johannes Schurrie was an early settler in the town. He came from Hackensack, New Jersey, &quot;circa&quot; 1740, from which the hamlet derives its name. Most of the early settlers were of Dutch and German descent. A portion of NYS route 376 is known locally as New Hackensack Road. The Main Street was present day N.Y.S. Route 376 and had a post office and several stores until the widening of the Hudson Valley Regional Airport in the early-mid-1900s.
* Swartwoutville is located at the southeastern section of town. Named after General Jacobus Swartwout. Historically important meeting place during the American Revolution. In 1760, Swartwout purchased 3,000 acres of land from Madam Brett and built his first home after his wedding to Aaltje Brinkerhoff, of Brinkerhoff, New York.[11] General George Washington was staying in Fishkill in October 1778. The headquarters of the commander-in-chief was then in the home of Captain John Brinkerhoff, father-in-law to Jacobus Swartwout, in a low stone home about midway on the highway between the settlement of Brinkerhoff and Swartwoutville. During this period Prussian-American General, Baron Frederick William Augustus de Steuben, had his headquarters at the neighboring homestead of Colonel Jacobus Swartwout, standing immediately south of his later residence at Swartwoutville. Others who visited and quartered at Jacobus Swartwout&#x27;s homestead along with General Washington and Baron Von Stueben were, Marquis de Lafayette and, Israel Putnam.

===Toponyms===
* All Angels&#x27; Hill – originally known as Mount Hope and then Underhill Road. In the 1850s, farmer William Marvin owned about between the present Pye Lane and Myers Corners. His daughter Charlotte married New York doctor Anthony Underhill. In the mid-1800s, the Underhill family built a house on her father&#x27;s land. Dr. Underhill died September 5, 1889. In 1903 the property was purchased by All Angels Episcopal Church in Manhattan as part of its ministry to the poor. The church maintained All Angels&#x27; Farm, a forerunner of the Fresh Air Fund.

<text>Wappingers Falls is a village in the towns of Poughkeepsie and Wappinger, in Dutchess County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 5,522. The community was named for the cascade in Wappinger Creek. The Wappingers Falls post office covers areas in the towns of Wappinger, Poughkeepsie, Fishkill, East Fishkill, and LaGrange. This can result in some confusion when residents of the outlying towns, who do not live in the village, give their address as &quot;Wappingers Falls&quot;.

Grinnell Library, located in the village, is the sixth-oldest library in the state.

== History ==
The Wappinger were an Algonquian-speaking confederacy of Native Americans whose territory in the 17th century extended along the eastern bank of the Hudson River. Primarily based in what is now Dutchess County, their territory was bordered by Manhattan Island to the south, the Mahican territory bounded by the Roeliff Jansen Kill to the north, and extended east into parts of Connecticut. &quot;Wappinger&quot; means &quot;easterner&quot; in most Algonquian languages.

The area was part of the Rombout Patent. In 1741, two Dutchmen, Nicholas and Adolphus Brewer, purchased of land around the falls and built the first stone house in the village near the present Mill Street. In 1742, the Brewers built a mill on the east side of Wappinger Creek. Nicholas Brewer built the Mesier Homestead, which he sold in 1777 to Matthew VanBenschoten, who, in turn, sold it to Peter Mesier Sr., a merchant from New York City.

In May 1777, soldiers and local residents attacked Peter Mesier&#x27;s house in Wappingers Falls, disputing the price of tea for sale in a small store inside his home. Mesier was a merchant from New York City and a Loyalist. The angry mob struck Mesier, beat his slaves, and drank wine stored in the cellar. They also took the tea and left a small amount of money behind.

The local waterfall was important for early industrial development. In 1819 a small cotton mill was built in the hollow created by the creek as it descends from Wappinger Lake to drain into the Hudson River. By 1856 it had become one of the largest printworks in the country. A fire that year destroyed the original buildings completely, but they were immediately rebuilt and continued in operation until 1931. The streets on the hillside opposite the mill are lined with frame houses, mostly duplexes, built by the mill for its workers. The two halves of the village are connected by an 1884 stone arch bridge that replaced earlier wooden structures.

The village of Wappingers Falls was incorporated in 1871 and included the adjacent community on the west side of the Wappinger Creek, by then called Channingville. The east side was known as Franklindale. In 1885 the Franklindale Cotton Mill, which employed about 130 people, was destroyed by fire. During President Grover Cleveland’s second administration, the Independent Comb Factory on the corner of Fulton and Prospect streets was forced to close. The repeal of the tariff made it impossible for the company to compete with German-made combs. In 1909, the Garner Print Works were sold and became the Dutchess Bleachery. The plant, which at times employed as many as 1,150 people, stopped printing calico but continued as a bleachery and dye works.

On June 3, 2017, downtown Wappingers Falls had a devastating structure fire that left more than 30 people displaced and six businesses temporarily closed. No one was injured during the fire, which spread through a strip of buildings in the East Main Street corridor on Saturday afternoon.

===Channingville===

That portion of the village lying north of the creek, in the town of Poughkeepsie, was originally known as &quot;Ednam&quot;. It later became known as Channingville (sometimes rendered &quot;Chiningville&quot;), which name is derived from the Channing family, who owned the farm on which it mostly lies.

The first merchant in this part of the village was a cooper, John Crilley, from Ireland by way of Glenham. In 1842 he built the first brick building erected on either side of the creek. By 1836, Ednam had about thirty dwellings and a cotton factory with 2,400 spindles and 90 looms, making 500,000 yards of cloth per annum.

J.J. O&#x27;Riley&#x27;s North American Hotel and Eagan&#x27;s Opera House (built in 1876 by John Eagan, with a seating capacity for five hundred people) were located here. The village&#x27;s first post office was established here in 1840. The post office bore the name of the creek.

The Bain Commercial Building is located at the corner of Church and West Main (NY 9D) streets. The Bain family is believed to have built the building in 1875, shortly after Channingville became part of the village. It was both their residence and their place of business. It is a late 19th-century brick building that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

==Historic places==

The Wappingers Falls Historic District includes downtown, several adjacent residential neighborhoods, and Mesier Park &amp; Homestead. Mesier Park has been a public park since ca. 1891, and hosts many annual events that focus around the bandstand and tree-lined paths of the park. In 1984 the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The Dutchess Company Superintendent&#x27;s House is located on Market Street in the western corner of the village. It is a large brick residence that was built as housing for the manager of the Dutchess Company, a large local printing works, shortly after the plant was built in 1848. It remained in company ownership until the company failed in the 20th century. In 1984 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Police Station is located at the corner of South Avenue (NY 9D) and East Main Street. It was originally built in 1940 as the village&#x27;s new post office, a WPA project. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took a personal interest in the project, as he had with other new post offices in Dutchess County. He wanted it to be built of fieldstone in the style of many Dutch colonial houses in the area, and chose the Brewer-Mesier House in the village as the model for its design. The old post office contains two Treasury Section of Fine Arts murals by Henry Billings. The paintings show two views of the town&#x27;s waterfall at different points in time, one from 1780 and the other from 1880, facing each other from opposite ends of the small building.

==Places of worship ==

===Zion Episcopal Church===

Zion Episcopal Church began in 1820 under the shade of an apple tree when Joanna Mesier, wife of Matthew Mesier, began a Sunday school. There were only seven or eight families living in the area at the time. The class was subsequently moved to a corn barn near the Mesier homestead where the village flagpole now stands. The Mesiers attended Trinity Church in Fishkill, the nearest Episcopal church, but felt the need for a church less distant for the farmers of the area and their families. In 1833, the Reverend Doctor George B. Andrews moved to a farm, &quot;Highmount&quot;, between Hughsonville and New Hamburg. On July 14 of that year he conducted the first official service of the Episcopal Church somewhere on the north side of Wappingers Creek. He continued to be driven up from his farm with his family and servants to spend Sundays near the falls. In December 1833, Matthew Mesier gave a small tract of land between the burial ground and the turnpike (now Main Street) in front of what was then Mr. Givens&#x27; place. One month later plans were made to construct a church. The stone for the church came from the property of Benjamin Clapp, much of which he hauled himself. Zion Protestant Episcopal Church was dedicated by Bishop Onderdonk on May 6, 1836. Mr. Andrews served as pastor, not only to the church in Wappingers, but often found time to row across the Hudson to conduct services in Marlboro. The church&#x27;s most notable pastor was Henry Yates Satterlee, assistant rector 1865-75 and senior rector 1875–83, who was elected the first bishop of the Washington Diocese in 1896 and there established the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, popularly known as Washington National Cathedral.

===Bethel Missionary Baptist Church===
The Franklindale Baptist Church was organized in 1838. Benjamin Clapp, former warden of Zion Episcopal, converted to the Baptist faith and donated land on the corner of Prospect Street and South Avenue. The church building was dedicated on December 5, 1847. In 1967 the Bethel Baptist community purchased Franklindale Baptist, which was dedicated as Bethel Missionary Baptist Church on October 15, 1967. In 1997 the need for additional space brought the purchase of the house across Prospect Street, which had belonged to Dr. Kerrigan. Referred to as &quot;Bethel Annex&quot;, the 1830s building provided space for the church school and events. In the mid-2000s, the Kerrigan House was sold and transported across South Avenue to be replaced by a new church building.

===First Presbyterian Church===
The Presbyterian Church at Wappingers Falls owed it existence to Mrs. John Fisher Sheafe, whose country seat was near New Hamburg. She asked the Rev. John D. Wells, who was then preaching at Ellessdie Chapel, situated two miles north of New Hamburg on the river road, to see if there was a need for a church in Wappingers. This resulted in the organization of the Presbyterian Society in 1848, and the same year a church edifice and parsonage were built by Mrs. Sheafe on Fulton Street. During the pastorate of Rev. O.A. Kingsbury (1879-1883) the Fulton Street property was sold and the present brick structure on South Avenue erected. The new church was dedicated July 23, 1872. The church lasted for just over 150 years before it closed, holding its final service on January 13, 2023.
===United Methodist Church of Wappingers Falls===
The first Methodist Episcopal Church in the area of Wappingers Falls was started by noted circuit riding preacher Freeborn Garrettson in 1788. By 1824, services were held in the home of Joseph C. Smith at Middlebush, before moving to a schoolhouse. In 1827, the Methodist Society purchased the former Baptist meeting house, also at Middlebush. In 1841 it became part of the Johnsville circuit. John Given donated land in the then village of Ednam, at the falls west of the Wappingers Creek. Ednamville was established as a mission church served by preachers who rode circuit to Middlebush and New Hamburg. In 1845, a church was built at the corner of West Main and Church Streets. In the spring of 1868, with the idea of merging the Wappingers Falls and Middlebush congregations, land was purchased from the estate of Margaret Reese. The old Middlebush church was taken down and the materials used to construct a barn on the new church property on Mesier Avenue. 
The church was known as the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1939 when the name was changed to The Methodist Church. In 1968, it was changed to the United Methodist Church. In 1974, with the merger with the New Hamburg Methodist Church it became known as The United Methodist Church of Wappingers. In early 2020 the church merged with the Poughkeepsie United Methodist Church and the building was sold.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Church===

Roman Catholics of what is now Wappingers Falls were cared for by priests from St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Poughkeepsie until 1845 when the parish was founded to serve southern Dutchess County. In 1850, the first pastor took up residence. Masses were offered in local homes until a church was constructed on Clinton Street. The current church building was consecrated in 1879, although the interior has been renovated a number of times, the last being in the early 2000&#x27;s. The parish also has a cemetery which is still in operation and a school which closed in 2019.

===Mount Alvernia and the Monastery of St. Clare===
Mount Alvernia Retreat Center sits on 204 acres overlooking the Hudson Valley and is run by the Franciscan Friars of the New York Province of the Immaculate Conception. It was built in 1950 and until 1967 served as a seminary to train Franciscan friars for the Roman Catholic priesthood. Its chapel offers daily Mass while the former seminary building hosts retreats and other events. 
On the property of the Retreat Center is the Monastery of St. Clare built in 2004 for the Poor Clares, Franciscan nuns who moved to Wappingers Falls from Throgs Neck in the Bronx.

<doc id="126392" wikidata="Q741229" url="?curid=126392" title="Paul is dead">
<text>&quot;Paul is dead&quot; is an urban legend and conspiracy theory alleging that English musician Paul McCartney of the Beatles died in 1966 and was secretly replaced by a look-alike. The rumour began circulating in 1966, gaining broad popularity in September 1969 following reports on American college campuses. 

According to the theory, McCartney died in a car crash, and to spare the public from grief, the surviving Beatles, aided by Britain&#x27;s MI5, replaced him with a McCartney look-alike, subsequently communicating this secret through subtle details of their albums. Proponents perceived clues among elements of Beatles songs and cover artwork; clue-hunting proved infectious, and by October 1969 had become an international phenomenon. Rumours declined after &quot;Life&quot; published an interview with McCartney in November 1969. 

The phenomenon was the subject of analysis in the fields of sociology, psychology and communications during the 1970s. McCartney parodied the hoax with the title and cover art of his 1993 live album, &quot;Paul Is Live&quot;. The legend was among ten of &quot;the world&#x27;s most enduring conspiracy theories&quot; according to &quot;Time&quot; in 2009.

==Beginnings==
Although rumours that Paul McCartney&#x27;s health was deteriorating had existed since early 1966, reports that McCartney had died only started circulating in September of that year. The Beatles&#x27; press officer, Tony Barrow, recounted this in his book, &quot;John, Paul, George, Ringo and Me.&quot; Fleet Street reporters started phoning Barrow early in that month, to confirm rumours regarding the Beatle&#x27;s health and even a possible death, to which he replied that he had recently spoken with McCartney. 

For the rest of 1966, the rumour was eclipsed by similar reports that Paul McCartney was working on a solo project and that the Beatles were splitting up, which were backed by their disappearance from the public eye and the postponement of their scheduled tours in late 1966.

In early 1967, the rumour resurfaced in London, this time claiming that Paul McCartney had been killed in a traffic accident while driving along the M1 motorway on 7 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoakum/Gadfly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour was acknowledged and rebutted in the February issue of &quot;The Beatles Book&quot;. McCartney then alluded to the rumour during a press conference held about the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in May. 

The Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin once claimed that, during the Beatles’ visit to Denver, Colorado, &quot;a number of people pretending to be Beatles&quot; were employed by the promoters of the band&#x27;s concerts in order to distract the crowds of fans from the real Beatles, while they were exiting a hotel. According to journalist Maureen O&#x27;Grady, who wrote about it in the May 1966 issue of &quot;RAVE Magazine&quot;, such a tactic was used when the Beatles first played in Baltimore, in 1964. As a result, stories began to circulate that the Beatles had sent four lookalikes to perform on stage on one of their American tours. Both Paul McCartney and George Harrison later refuted these claims. 

Despite the Beatles dismissing such accusations, they soon began accompanying the notion that McCartney had died. By late 1967, it was further stated that the Beatles had covered up his death by employing a Paul McCartney impersonator to stand in for him. For example, journalist Jay Marks was attending McCartney&#x27;s engagement party in 1967 when a friend of the band told him that McCartney had been replaced.

By the mid-1960s, the Beatles were known for sometimes including backmasking in their music. Analysing their lyrics for hidden meaning had also become a popular trend in the US. In November 1968, their self-titled double LP (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) was released containing the track &quot;Glass Onion&quot;. John Lennon wrote the song in response to &quot;gobbledygook&quot; said about &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. In a later interview, he said that he was purposely confusing listeners with lines such as &quot;the Walrus was Paul&quot; – a reference to his song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; from the 1967 EP and album &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.
On 17 September 1969, Tim Harper, an editor of the &quot;Drake Times-Delphic&quot;, the student newspaper of Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, published an article titled &quot;Is Beatle Paul McCartney Dead?&quot; The article addressed a rumour being circulated on campus that cited clues from recent Beatles albums, including a message interpreted as &quot;Turn me on, dead man&quot;, heard when the White Album track &quot;Revolution 9&quot; is played backwards. Also referenced was the back cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, where every Beatle except McCartney is photographed facing the viewer. He is wearing a black badge &quot;OPD&quot; (Officially Pronounced Dead). On the front cover, Starr in a suit looks at the flowered grave, mourning, and McCartney (in a suit) puts his hand on his shoulder. Starr looks sadly down at a tomb shaped like a P, with 4 strings looking like a bass. The front cover of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; depicts one unidentified band member in a differently coloured suit from the other three. According to music journalist Merrell Noden, Harper&#x27;s &quot;Drake Times-Delphic&quot; was the first to publish an article on the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; theory. Harper later said that it had become the subject of discussion among students at the start of the new academic year, and he added: &quot;A lot of us, because of Vietnam and the so-called Establishment, were ready, willing and able to believe just about any sort of conspiracy.&quot;

In late September 1969, the Beatles released the album &quot;Abbey Road&quot; while they were in the process of disbanding. On 10 October, the Beatles&#x27; press officer, Derek Taylor, responded to the rumour stating: 

Recently we&#x27;ve been getting a flood of inquiries asking about reports that Paul is dead. We&#x27;ve been getting questions like that for years, of course, but in the past few weeks we&#x27;ve been getting them at the office and home night and day. I&#x27;m even getting telephone calls from disc jockeys and others in the United States.
Throughout this period, McCartney felt isolated from his bandmates in his opposition to their choice of business manager, Allen Klein, and distraught at Lennon&#x27;s private announcement that he was leaving the group. With the birth of his daughter Mary in late August, McCartney had withdrawn to focus on his family life. On 22 October, the day that the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; rumour became an international news story, McCartney, his wife Linda and their two daughters travelled to Scotland to spend time at his farm near Campbeltown.

==Growth==
On 12 October 1969, a caller to Detroit radio station WKNR-FM told disc jockey Russ Gibb about the rumour and its clues. Gibb and other callers then discussed the rumour on air for the next hour, during which Gibb offered further potential clues. Two days later, &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; published a satirical review of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; by University of Michigan student Fred LaBour, who had listened to the exchange on Gibb&#x27;s show, under the headline &quot;McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light&quot;. It identified various clues to McCartney&#x27;s alleged death on Beatles album covers, particularly on the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; sleeve. LaBour later said he had invented many of the clues and was astonished when the story was picked up by newspapers across the United States. Noden writes that &quot;Very soon, every college campus, every radio station, had a resident expert.&quot; WKNR fuelled the rumour further with its two-hour programme &quot;The Beatle Plot&quot;, which first aired on 19 October. The show – which has been called &quot;infamous&quot;, a &quot;fraud&quot; and a &quot;mockumentary&quot; – brought enormous worldwide publicity to Gibb and WKNR.

The story was soon taken up by more mainstream radio stations in the New York area, WMCA and WABC. In the early hours of 21 October, WABC disc jockey Roby Yonge discussed the rumour on-air for over an hour before being pulled off the air for breaking format. At that time of night, WABC&#x27;s signal covered a wide listening area and could be heard in 38 US states and, at times, in other countries. Although the Beatles&#x27; press office denied the rumour, McCartney&#x27;s atypical withdrawal from public life contributed to its escalation. Vin Scelsa, a student broadcaster in 1969, later said that the escalation was indicative of the countercultural influence of Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, since: &quot;Every song from them – starting about late 1966 – became a personal message, worthy of endless scrutiny ... they were guidelines on how to live your life.&quot;

WMCA dispatched Alex Bennett to the Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps headquarters in London on 23 October, to further his extended coverage of the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; theory. There, Ringo Starr told Bennett: &quot;If people are gonna believe it, they&#x27;re gonna believe it. I can only say it&#x27;s not true.&quot; In a radio interview with John Small of WKNR, Lennon said that the rumour was &quot;insane&quot; but good publicity for &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. On Halloween night 1969, WKBW in Buffalo, New York, broadcast a programme titled &quot;Paul McCartney Is Alive and Well – Maybe&quot;, which analysed Beatles lyrics and other clues. The WKBW DJs concluded that the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; hoax was fabricated by Lennon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bisco/ReelRadio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of October 1969, several record releases had exploited the phenomenon of McCartney&#x27;s alleged demise. These included &quot;The Ballad of Paul&quot; by the Mystery Tour; &quot;Brother Paul&quot; by Billy Shears and the All Americans; &quot;So Long Paul&quot; by Werbley Finster, a pseudonym for José Feliciano; and Zacharias and His Tree People&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re All Paul Bearers (Parts One and Two)&quot;. Another song was Terry Knight&#x27;s &quot;Saint Paul&quot;, which had been a minor hit in June that year and was subsequently adopted by radio stations as a tribute to &quot;the late Paul McCartney&quot;. A cover version of &quot;Saint Paul&quot; by New Zealand singer Shane reached the top of that nation&#x27;s singles charts. According to a report in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in early November, Shelby Singleton Productions planned to issue a documentary LP of radio segments discussing the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB/DiskCoverage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, Polydor Records exploited the rumour in their artwork for &quot;Very Together&quot;, a repackaging of the Beatles&#x27; pre-fame recordings with Tony Sheridan, using a cover that showed four candles, one of which had just been snuffed out.

==Premise==
Many versions of this theory have arisen since its initial exposure to the public, but most proponents of the theory maintain that, on 9 November 1966 (or alternatively, 11 September), McCartney had an argument with his bandmates during a &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; recording session and drove off angrily in his car, then, distracted by a meter maid (&quot;Lovely Rita&quot;), failed to notice that the traffic lights had changed (&quot;A Day In The Life&quot;), crashed, and was decapitated (&quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;). A funeral service for McCartney was held, with eulogies by Harrison (&quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;) and Starr (&quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;), followed by a procession (&quot;Abbey Road&quot;″s front cover), with Lennon as the priest officiating his funeral and burying him (the alleged &quot;I Buried Paul&quot; statement in &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;). To spare the public from grief, or simply as a joke, the surviving Beatles replaced him with the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest. This scenario was facilitated by the Beatles&#x27; recent retirement from live performance and by their choosing to present themselves with a new image for their next album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which they began recording later that month.

In LaBour&#x27;s telling, the stand-in was an &quot;orphan from Edinburgh named William Campbell&quot; whom the Beatles then trained to impersonate McCartney.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noden/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Others contended that the man&#x27;s name was Bill Shepherd, later altered to Billy Shears, and the replacement was instigated by Britain&#x27;s MI5 out of concern for the severe distress McCartney&#x27;s death would cause the Beatles&#x27; audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shivani/Dawn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this latter telling, the surviving Beatles were said to be wracked with guilt over their actions, and therefore left messages in their music and album artwork to communicate the truth to their fans.

Dozens of supposed clues to McCartney&#x27;s death have been identified by fans and followers of the legend. These include messages perceived when listening to songs being played backwards and symbolic interpretations of both lyrics and album cover imagery. Two frequently cited examples are the suggestions that the words &quot;I buried Paul&quot; are spoken by Lennon in the final section of the song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, which the Beatles recorded in November and December 1966 (Lennon later said that the words were actually &quot;Cranberry sauce&quot;), and that the words &quot;number nine, number nine&quot; in &quot;Revolution 9&quot; (from the &quot;White Album&quot;) became &quot;turn me on, dead man, turn me on, dead man&quot; when played backwards. A similar reversal at the end of &quot;I&#x27;m So Tired&quot; (another &quot;White Album&quot; track) yielded &quot;Paul is dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him…&quot;.

Another example is the interpretation of the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album cover as depicting a funeral procession: Lennon, dressed in white, is said to symbolise the heavenly figure; Starr, dressed in black, symbolises the undertaker; George Harrison, in denim, represents the gravedigger; and McCartney, barefoot and out of step with the others, symbolises the corpse. The number plate of the white Volkswagen Beetle in the photo – containing the characters LMW 281F (mistakenly read as &quot;28IF&quot;) – was identified as further &quot;evidence&quot;. &quot;28IF&quot; represented McCartney&#x27;s age &quot;if&quot; he had still been alive (although McCartney was 27 when the album was recorded and released), while &quot;LMW&quot; stood for &quot;Linda McCartney weeps&quot; or &quot;Linda McCartney, widow&quot; (although McCartney and the then-Linda Eastman had not yet met in 1966, the year of his alleged death). That the left-handed McCartney held a cigarette in his right hand was also said to support the idea that he was an impostor.

==Rebuttal==
On 21 October 1969, the Beatles&#x27; press office again issued statements denying the rumour, deeming it &quot;a load of old rubbish&quot; and saying that &quot;the story has been circulating for about two years – we get letters from all sorts of nuts but Paul is still very much with us&quot;. On 24 October, BBC Radio reporter Chris Drake was granted an interview with McCartney at his farm. McCartney said that the speculation was understandable, given that he normally did &quot;an interview a week&quot; to ensure he remained in the news. Part of the interview was first broadcast on Radio 4, on 26 October, and subsequently on WMCA in the US. According to author John Winn, McCartney had agreed to the interview &quot;in hopes that people hearing his voice would see the light&quot;, but the ploy failed.

McCartney was secretly filmed by a CBS News crew as he worked on his farm. As in his and Linda&#x27;s segment in the Beatles&#x27; promotional clip for &quot;Something&quot;, which the couple filmed privately around this time, McCartney was unshaven and unusually scruffy-looking in his appearance. His next visitors were a reporter and photographer from &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Irate at the intrusion, he swore at the pair, threw a bucket of water over them and was captured on film attempting to hit the photographer. Fearing that the photos would damage his image, McCartney then approached the pair and agreed to pose for a photo with his family and answer the reporter&#x27;s questions, in exchange for the roll of film containing the offending pictures. In Winn&#x27;s description, the family portrait used for &quot;Life&quot;″s cover shows McCartney no longer &quot;shabbily attired&quot;, but &quot;clean-shaven and casually but smartly dressed&quot;.

Following the publication of the article and the photo, in the issue dated 7 November, the rumour started to decline. In the interview, McCartney said the rumour was &quot;bloody stupid&quot; and went on to say:

==Aftermath==
In November 1969, Capitol Records sales managers reported a significant increase in sales of Beatles catalogue albums, attributed to the rumour. Rocco Catena, Capitol&#x27;s vice-president of national merchandising, estimated that &quot;this is going to be the biggest month in history in terms of Beatles sales&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burks/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour benefited the commercial performance of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; in the US, where it comfortably outsold all of the band&#x27;s previous albums. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, both of which had been off the charts since February, re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, peaking at number 101 and number 109, respectively.

A television special dedicated to &quot;Paul is dead&quot; was broadcast on WOR in New York on 30 November. Titled &quot;Paul McCartney: The Complete Story, Told for the First and Last Time&quot;, it was set in a courtroom and hosted by celebrity lawyer F. Lee Bailey, who cross-examined LaBour, Gibb and other proponents of the theory, and heard opposing views from &quot;witnesses&quot; such as McCartney&#x27;s friend Peter Asher, brother Mike McCartney and Allen Klein. Bailey left it to the viewer to determine a conclusion. Before the recording, LaBour told Bailey that his article had been intended as a joke, to which Bailey sighed and replied, &quot;Well, we have an hour of television to do; you&#x27;re going to have to go along with this.&quot;
McCartney returned to London in December. Bolstered by Linda&#x27;s support, he began recording his debut solo album at his home in St John&#x27;s Wood. Titled &quot;McCartney&quot;, and recorded without his bandmates&#x27; knowledge, it was &quot;one of the best-kept secrets in rock history&quot; until shortly before its release in April 1970, according to author Nicholas Schaffner, and led to the announcement of the Beatles&#x27; break-up. In his 1971 song &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, in which he attacked McCartney&#x27;s character, Lennon described the theorists as &quot;freaks&quot; who “was right when they said you was dead&quot;. The rumour was also cited in the hoax surrounding the Canadian band Klaatu, after a January 1977 review of their debut album, &quot;3:47 EST&quot;, sparked rumours that the group were in fact the Beatles. In one telling, this theory contended that the album had been recorded in late 1966 but then mislaid until 1975, at which point Lennon, Harrison and Starr elected to issue it in McCartney&#x27;s memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond/Vulture&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

LaBour later became notable as the bassist for the western swing group Riders in the Sky, which he co-founded in 1977. In 2008, he joked that his success as a musician had extended his fifteen minutes of fame for his part in the rumour to &quot;seventeen minutes&quot;. In 2015, he told &quot;The Detroit News&quot; that he is still periodically contacted by conspiracy theorists who have attempted to present him with supposed new developments on the McCartney rumours.

==Analysis and legacy==
Author Peter Doggett writes that, while he thinks the theory behind &quot;Paul is dead&quot; defied logic, its popularity was understandable in a climate where citizens were faced with conspiracy theories insisting that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 was in fact a coup d&#x27;état. Schaffner said that, given its origins as an item of gossip and intrigue generated by a select group in the &quot;Beatles cult&quot;, &quot;Paul is dead&quot; serves as &quot;a genuine folk tale of the mass communications era&quot;. He also described it as &quot;the most monumental hoax since Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast persuaded thousands of panicky New Jerseyites that Martian invaders were in the vicinity&quot;. 

In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald says that the Beatles were partly responsible for the phenomenon due to their incorporation of &quot;random lyrics and effects&quot;, particularly in the White Album track &quot;Glass Onion&quot; in which Lennon invited clue-hunting by including references to other Beatles songs. MacDonald groups it with the &quot;psychic epidemics&quot; that were encouraged by the rock audience&#x27;s use of hallucinogenic drugs and which escalated with Charles Manson&#x27;s homicidal interpretation of the White Album and Mark David Chapman&#x27;s murder of Lennon in 1980.

During the 1970s, the phenomenon became a subject of academic study in America in the fields of sociology, psychology and communications. Among sociological studies, Barbara Suczek recognised it as, in Schaffner&#x27;s description, a contemporary reading of the &quot;archetypal myth wherein the beautiful youth dies and is resurrected as a god&quot;. Psychologists Ralph Rosnow and Gary Fine attributed its popularity partly to the shared, vicarious experience of searching for clues without consequence for the participants. They also said that for a generation distrustful of the media following the Warren Commission&#x27;s report, it was able to thrive amid a climate informed by &quot;The credibility gap of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s presidency, the widely circulated rumors after the Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy assassinations, as well as attacks on the leading media sources by the yippies and Spiro Agnew&quot;. 

American social critic Camille Paglia locates the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; phenomenon to the Ancient Greek tradition symbolised by Adonis and Antinous, as represented in the cult of rock music&#x27;s &quot;pretty, long-haired boys who mesmerize both sexes&quot;, and she adds: &quot;It&#x27;s no coincidence that it was Paul McCartney, the &#x27;cutest&#x27; and most girlish of the Beatles, who inspired a false rumor that swept the world in 1969 that he was dead.&quot;

&quot;Paul is dead&quot; has continued to inspire analysis into the 21st century, with published studies by Andru J. Reeve, Nick Kollerstrom and Brian Moriarty, among others, and exploitative works in the mediums of mockumentary and documentary film. Writing in 2016, Beatles biographer Steve Turner said, &quot;the theory still has the power to flare back into life.&quot; He cited a 2009 &quot;Wired Italia&quot; magazine article that featured an analysis by two forensic research consultants who compared selected photographs of McCartney taken before and after his alleged death by measuring features of the skull. According to the scientists&#x27; findings, the man shown in the post-November 1966 images was not the same.

Similar rumours concerning other celebrities have been circulated, including the unsubstantiated allegation that Canadian singer Avril Lavigne died in 2003 and was replaced by a person named Melissa Vandella.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cresci/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on the latter phenomenon, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the 1969 McCartney hoax as &quot;Possibly the best known example&quot; of a celebrity being the focus of &quot;a (completely unverified) cloning conspiracy theory&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Paul is dead&quot; in its feature on ten of &quot;the world&#x27;s most enduring conspiracy theories&quot;.

==In popular culture==
There have been many references to the legend in popular culture, including the following examples.

* The June 1970 issue of the DC Comics title &quot;Batman&quot; (#222) had a story titled &quot;Dead ... Till Proven Alive&quot; in which it was rumoured that Saul from the band the Oliver Twists was deceased and replaced with a double. On the cover of the comic book, Robin is holding an album that mimics the back of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.
* The 1972 National Lampoon comedy album &quot;Radio Dinner&quot; has several announced &quot;clues&quot; placed throughout, including backmasked segments and notes in the album&#x27;s gatefold, all parodying the hoax.
* In the Rutles&#x27; 1978 television film satirising the Beatles&#x27; history, &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;, the identity of the alleged dead band member was transferred to the George Harrison character, Stig O&#x27;Hara, who was supposed to have died &quot;in a flash fire at a water bed shop&quot; and been replaced by a Madame Tussauds wax model. Building on Harrison&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Quiet Beatle&quot;, the &quot;Stig is dead&quot; theory was supported by his lack of dialogue in the film and clues such as his trouser-less appearance on the cover of the Rutles&#x27; &quot;Shabby Road&quot; album.
* On the February 13, 1993, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Paul McCartney was interviewed on The Chris Farley Show, a recurring sketch where Chris Farley nervously asked questions of his guests, usually on if they remembered parts of their career. Regarding the &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; rumours, Farley outlined the urban legend, then asked &quot;That was, um, a hoax, right?&quot; McCartney responded by saying &quot;Yeah. I wasn&#x27;t really dead.&quot;
* McCartney titled his 1993 live album &quot;Paul Is Live&quot; in reference to the hoax. He also presented it in a sleeve that parodied the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; cover and its clues. 
* The 1995 video for &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; – a song recorded by Lennon in the late 1970s and completed by McCartney, Harrison and Starr for the band&#x27;s &quot;Anthology&quot; project – references &quot;Paul is dead&quot;, among other myths relating to the Beatles&#x27; impact during the 1960s. According to author Gary Burns, the video indulges in the same &quot;semiological excess&quot; as the 1969 hoax and thereby &quot;spoof[s]&quot; obsessive clue-hunting.
* In the 1995 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;, Paul McCartney guest stars and mentions that if his song &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; is played backwards, it contains a recipe for lentil soup. The song plays over the end credits, and, if played backwards, it not only contains the aforementioned recipe, but also McCartney himself saying &quot;oh, and by the way, I&#x27;m alive&quot;.
* &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot;, a track on the 1995 Yo La Tengo album &quot;Electr-O-Pura&quot;.
* In 2010, American author Alan Goldsher published the mashup novel &quot;Paul Is Undead: The British Zombie Invasion&quot;, which depicts all of the Beatles as zombies except Ringo Starr.
* &quot;Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison&quot; is a 2010 mockumentary directed by Joel Gilbert that purports to tell the story of George Harrison, believing himself to be on his deathbed after being stabbed on December 30, 1999, revealing that McCartney had died in a car crash with a girl named Rita and that British intelligence agencies had orchestrated a coverup through which he was replaced by a lookalike. The film is narrated by a voice actor purporting to be George Harrison, describing over archival footage and reenactment the clues left behind in songs and album art that McCartney was dead.
* In 2015, the indie rock band EL VY released a song called &quot;Paul Is Alive&quot;, which contains lyrics referencing Beatlemania and partly addresses the 1969 rumour.
* A 2018 comedy short film, &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot;, depicts a version of events where McCartney dies during a musical retreat and is replaced by a look-alike named Billy Shears.
*A graphic novel co-created by Paolo Baron and Ernesto Carbonetti called &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; was published in English by Image Comics in 2020.
*In 2023, the American supergroup Boygenius released the song called &quot;Revolution 0&quot; which was originally going to be called &quot;Paul is Dead&quot;.

<text>Washington is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 4,522 at the 2020 census. The town is named after George Washington, who passed through the town during the Revolution.

Washington is in the central part of the county, northeast of the city of Poughkeepsie. U.S. Route 44 passes across the town.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area was the abode of the sedentary Wappinger Indians.

Although some Dutch had settled in the area, it was the British grant of the Great Nine Partners Patent in 1697 that spurred growth. Lt. Col. Henry Filkins was the largest landowner and his family continued in leadership until forced to flee at the start of the American Revolution.

When Dutchess County was first organized in 1683, it was subdivided into twelve precincts. What is now the towns of Stanford, Clinton, Pleasant Valley, and Washington constituted Charlotte Precinct, later named after 
Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The town was formed as part of the county reorganization in 1788 as one of the original twelve towns, with the towns of Poughkeepsie and Clinton to the west. The town lost territory in 1793 to form the new town of Stanford.

The Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad (formerly the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad) came through in 1869 cutting north-south across the town, with a station between Mechanic and Hart&#x27;s Village.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.21%, is water. Washington is bordered by Pleasant Valley and Clinton to the west, Stanford to the north, Amenia to the east, and Dover and Union Vale to the south. A small part of LaGrange also borders the town.

The main channel of Wappinger Creek flows through the northeast corner of the town, and its East Branch flows through the center of the town.

The Canoe Hills are located on the 2,000 acre Cary Arboretum in the Town of Washington.

<text>Amherst () is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of Buffalo. As of 2020, the town had a total population of 129,595. This represents an increase from 122,366 as reported in the 2010 census. It is the 14th most populated municipality in New York.

The second-largest in area and the most populous suburb of Buffalo, the town of Amherst encompasses the village of Williamsville as well as the hamlets of Eggertsville, Getzville, Snyder, Swormville, and East Amherst. The town is in the northern part of Erie County and borders a section of the Erie Canal.

Amherst is home to the north campus of the University at Buffalo, a campus of Erie Community College, a satellite campus of Bryant &amp; Stratton College, and Daemen University.

==History==
Amherst was created by the State of New York on April 10, 1818, from part of the town of Buffalo (later the city of Buffalo), which itself had previously been created from the town of Clarence. Amherst was named after Lord Jeffrey Amherst, commander-in-chief of the British army in North America from 1758 to 1763. Timothy S. Hopkins was elected the first supervisor of the town in 1819. Part of Amherst was later separated to form the town of Cheektowaga on March 22, 1839.

The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 spurred Amherst&#x27;s growth, bringing with it with new settlers and increased commerce. German immigrants settled in the northern part of the town as farmers, attracted by the fertile land in the area. The town&#x27;s water resources encouraged the development of grist mills, saw mills, and other factories along Ellicott Creek. Several communities and hamlets started to develop around this time, such as Williamsville (1810s), Eggertsville and Snyder (1830s), East Amherst and Swormville (1850s), and Getzville (1860s).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.73%, is water.

Much of Amherst was originally floodplain and marshland, portions of which have been drained in recent years to facilitate development of new homes and businesses. The central and southern parts of the town are heavily suburbanized. Despite this development, the hamlets of Eggertsville and Snyder and the village of Williamsville have managed to retain much of their original character. The northern part of the town is still relatively undeveloped, with the prominent exception of the portions along Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route 62) bordering the towns of Tonawanda and Wheatfield. Some sections of northern and eastern Amherst have experienced problems with collapsing residential foundations as a result of unstable soil conditions. A few active farms may still be found in the northern part of the town.

Amherst is bordered on the north by Tonawanda Creek and Niagara County. Ellicott Creek flows through the town.

Areas within Amherst are referred to by the former post office station names and are not legally incorporated. During the 1990s, many of these regional post offices were closed and consolidated into the central Amherst 14226 post office on Bailey Avenue, leaving only a Williamsville (14221) post office on Sheridan Drive, a Getzville (14068) post office on Millersport Highway, and an East Amherst (14051) post office on Transit Road. Mailing addresses to areas within the town are Amherst, East Amherst, Eggertsville, Getzville, Snyder, and Williamsville. These postal districts are still recognized by the post office and widely referred to by citizens.

Some of these mailing addresses overlap: some areas of Clarence directly east of Transit Road have Williamsville addresses, although for the purposes of taxes, schools and community resources, these people are residents of the Town of Clarence.

<doc id="126396" wikidata="Q1843821" url="?curid=126396" title="Angola, New York">
<text>Angola is a village in the town of Evans in Erie County, New York, United States. Located east of Lake Erie, the village is southwest of downtown Buffalo. As of the 2010 Census, Angola had a population of 2,127. An unincorporated community known as Angola on the Lake, with a population of 1,675, lies between Angola village and Lake Erie.

==History==
The community was previously called &quot;Evans Station&quot;. &quot;Circa&quot; 1854 or 1855, a post office was established there, bearing the name &quot;Angola&quot;. The first postmaster was John H. Andrus, who later became county clerk. The new name was apparently chosen because, at that time, local residents (primarily Quakers) were supporting missionary efforts in the Portuguese colony of Angola in Africa. The economy of the village improved with the arrival of a railroad line in 1852.

The Village of Angola was incorporated in 1873. In June 2004, an attempt to dissolve the village was thwarted by a judicial ruling that the petitions for a referendum were invalid. In 2007, the village agreed to dissolve its police department and contract with the Town of Evans for police services. Angola officers would be hired by Evans.

In February 2008, local officials rejected the urging of local politician Kevin Gaughan to reduce the size of the village board, stating that no financial savings would result. Gaughan, a proponent of reducing the number of government entities in Erie County, is also a proponent of metro government. The US Post Office—Angola was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

The Friends of the Village of Angola is a non-profit group of volunteer members whose purpose is to bring more foot traffic to the village. They work to improve and maintain many behind-the-scenes things in Angola. The Friends are responsible for organizing the annual Christmas in the Village, funded by the annual summer Drifters Car Cruise and Donations from individuals and local businesses.

===Angola Horror train wreck===

On December 18, 1867, just after 3 pm, the last coach of the Buffalo-bound &quot;New York Express&quot; of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern railway derailed. It plunged off a truss bridge into Big Sister Creek just after passing Angola. The next car was also pulled from the track and rolled down the far embankment. Stoves set both coaches on fire. Forty-nine people were killed, with an additional forty being injured.

<text>Boston is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 7,948 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Boston, Massachusetts.

Boston is an interior town of the county and one of the county&#x27;s &quot;Southtowns&quot;. Boston is southeast of Buffalo.

==History==

The Iroquois, under various names, lived here until the European immigrants became predominant.

In 1804, brothers Charles and Oliver Johnson and their families became the area&#x27;s first settlers. The first Christian church was the Free Will Baptist Church, founded &quot;circa&quot; 1811. On April 5, 1817, the town of Boston was formed from a portion of the town of Eden. The first post office opened in 1832 on the north side of town.

In 1843, the town suffered an epidemic (28 of the 43 residents were affected, 10 of whom died) believed to be typhoid fever, possibly from a local well.

This town has much history that can be found on the headstones in the Maplewood Cemetery across from the Boston Town Hall. There are many old gravestones that show some of the first settlers in the town and the infamous &quot;Love&quot; murder.

===Murder of John Love===
John Love, a seaman on the Great Lakes, came to Boston in October 1824 with the prospect of buying grain futures from local farmers. He rented a room from lumberman Nelson Thayer. The Thayer family, which included Nelson and his brothers Isaac and Israel, were infamous for their profanity and crude behavior. Despite owning large tracts of farmland in Boston, they found themselves indebted to neighbors, and eventually to Love, due to their spendthrift habits. Facing financial ruin, the Thayers decided that murder was the only option.

On December 15, John Love was talking with Nelson Thayer when Isaac came up to the window from outside and shot Love in the head with a rifle. When this failed to kill him, Nelson struck him several times with a meat axe. He and Israel then dragged Love&#x27;s body to a ravine behind Israel&#x27;s house and hastily covered it with dirt.

Neighbors grew suspicious after Love hadn&#x27;t been seen in several weeks, and the Thayers, now having far more money to spend than usual, rode around on Love&#x27;s horse attempting to collect debts owed to him by others. When questioned, they would say that Love had gone to Canada and had given the Thayers power of attorney to collect debt payments. Foul play was eventually suspected, and a $10 reward was offered to whoever found Love&#x27;s body. On February 23, 1825, Love&#x27;s body was discovered in the ravine behind the Thayer cabin, in a grave so shallow that his feet were sticking out. The three brothers were arrested, as was their father Israel Sr., and taken to jail in Buffalo.

At trial, the Thayers were linked to the crime based on strong circumstantial evidence; neighbors testified to hearing a gunshot on December 15 and never seeing Love again after that date. The Thayer brothers were all found guilty of John Love&#x27;s murder and sentenced to death. The charges against their father had been dropped. On June 17, 1825, all three were hanged from the same gallows in Niagara Square, the only public hanging ever to take place in Erie County. It is said that a crowd of about 20,000 people witnessed the event, far greater than the population of Buffalo at that time.

<text>Brant is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 U.S. census, the town had a population of 2,065. The town was named after the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant.

Brant is located in the southwestern part of the county and is known as one of the &quot;Southtowns&quot;. It is southwest of Buffalo.

==History==
The first white settler, Moses Tucker, arrived around 1816. The area was originally in the town of Willink and was organized March 25, 1839, from parts of the towns of Evans and Concord.

===An early history===
J.H. French&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the State of New York&quot;, Syracuse, New York: R. Pearsall Smith, 1860, contains the following entry for the town of Brant:
&quot;:BRANDT[1] – was formed from Collins and Evans, March 25, 1839. It lies upon the shore of Lake Erie, in the S.W. corner of the co. The surface is generally level, with a gentle inclination toward the lake. Cattaraugus Creek forms a part of the S. boundary. The other principal streams are Big Sister, Delaware, and Muddy Creeks. The soil is generally a gravelly loam intermixed with clay. Brandt (p.v.) contains 20 houses. Mill Branch (Farnham p.o.) is the Saw Mill Station on the B. &amp; E.R.R., and contains 30 houses. The first settlement was made in 1817, by Moses Tucker[2]. The first religious services were conducted by Benj. Olmsted, in 1820. A union church is the only one in town.

:[1] Named from Col. Joseph Brant, the Mohawk chief. His Indian name was &quot;Tha-yan-da-nee-gah,&quot; said to signify &quot;wood partly burned,&quot; or &quot;a brand;&quot; and as the Indians are unable to distinguish &quot;d&quot; from &quot;t&quot; in their pronunciation, it became &quot;Brant&quot;. — &quot;Asher Wright, Missionary at the Cattaraugus Reservation.&quot;

:[2] John, Robert, and Major Campbell, and John West, settled in the town in 1808, and Ansel Smith, Robt. and Wm. Grannis, and Benj. Olmsted, in 1819. The first birth was that of a son of John West, in 1818; the first marriage, that of Levi Grannis and Leah Hallida, in 1819; and the first death, that of Matthew West, in 1822. The first mill was built by Sam&#x27;l Butts, in 1822; the first inn was kept by Josephus Hubbard, in 1825; and the first store, by Milton Morse, in 1835. Julia Bradley taught the first school, in 1823.&quot;
This early source is incorrect in its information about the meaning of Brant&#x27;s name. His Mohawk name meant &quot;he places two bets&quot;. His Christian name came from his stepfather. When natives were baptized, they were given Christian names, often based on the name of the white missionary or priest who converted them. Brant&#x27;s stepfather was given the Christian name &quot;Barent&quot; which was later shortened to Brant in common use. When Joseph was young, he was known in his village as &quot;Brant&#x27;s Joseph&quot; and his sister as &quot;Brant&#x27;s Mary&quot;. They later became Joseph Brant and Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Brant.

<text>Clarence is a town and affluent suburb located in the northeastern part of Erie County, New York, United States, northeast of Buffalo. The population was 32,950 according to the 2020 census estimate. This represents an increase of 7.4% from the 2010 census figure. The Clarence census-designated place occupies the southeast part of the town and roughly corresponds to a postal district with ZIP code 14031 and 14221 in the western side which it shares with nearby Williamsville. The town is named in honor of Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (1765–1837), the third son of King George III and later king himself, as William IV.

There are no incorporated villages within the town.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The local Native Americans called the area &quot;Ta-Num-No-Ga-O&quot;, which means &quot;Place of Hickory Bark&quot;.

Clarence was the first town to be established in Erie County (1808), and many other towns, villages, and cities have been formed from parts of this original town. In 1810, the town of Buffalo, from which the city of Buffalo later originated, was separated from Clarence. Then in 1823, Newstead and Alden were formed respectively from the east and southeast parts of Clarence. Then finally in 1833, Lancaster was also formed from the town. The defunct town of Willink was also a source of new towns, primarily in the south part of the county, being completely partitioned for this purpose.

Western New York was part of the Holland Purchase. When Genesee County was established in 1802, all of the region was part of the town of Batavia, the single, original town of Genesee County. Clarence was, along with Willink, originally part of Genesee County. Clarence was split off from Willink in 1804, before Niagara County was created from part of Genesee County in 1808. Clarence (in the north) and Willink (in the south) then comprised the entire area of what would, in 1821, become Erie County.

One of the first settlers (1799) in the town was Asa Ransom, who has given his name to several locations. He settled in the southeast part of the town, now known as the Clarence Hollow. In 1807, Asa Harris, a former colonial officer from the American Revolution, established a tavern in the community of Harris Hill in the southwest part of Clarence.

Some have suggested that the town is named after a type of carriage, called a clarence. Such a carriage is pictured on a sign at the eastern edge of town. However, the name probably derives from the English Dukedom of Clarence in London, which also gave its name to the aforementioned carriage.

During the War of 1812, the press of the &quot;Buffalo Gazette&quot; was moved to Clarence, out of harm&#x27;s way of the British troops.

German was a common language amongst new Clarentians in Early Clarence, most of whom moved from Germany.

=== Later history ===
By the end of the 19th century, industry came to the town in the form of brick kilns, potash mining and gypsum mining. National Gypsum and Atlas Gypsum operated mines in the 20th century west of Clarence Center north of Roll Road near the intersection with Harris Hill Road. Quarries also became more commonly established at this time in history in Clarence.

One historian credits Clarence as the site of the introduction of the carrousel to the United States. These carrousels were carried by two German immigrants, who entered Clarence in 1879. Artifacts from the Clarence carrousels are now preserved in the Circus Hall of Fame in Sarasota, Florida. Including wooden horses built by the original immigrants who brought the carrousel to Clarence.

The town celebrated its bicentennial in 2008. The former Automobile Club of Buffalo clubhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

<doc id="126408" wikidata="Q3452462" url="?curid=126408" title="Depew, New York">
<text>Depew () is a village in Erie County, New York. The population was 15,303 at the time of the 2010 census. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The village is named for Chauncey Depew, a politician and one of the original investors who bought the land for the village, which was incorporated in 1894.

The village extends across the boundary between the towns of Lancaster and Cheektowaga. The village lies on both sides of NY Route 78 (Transit Road), a major north-south route.

Village residents voted on January 17, 2017, to not dissolve the Village of Depew into the Towns of Lancaster and Cheektowaga, by a margin of 3,006–1,165.

==Geography==
Depew is located at (42.911758, -78.701600).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Depew straddles the towns of Lancaster and Cheektowaga and is east of downtown Buffalo. Depew is bordered to the east by the village of Lancaster.

== History ==

Part of the area that Depew currently inhabits was first settled in 1808 by Apollos Hitchcock, just north of Cayuga Creek on the main road that connected Buffalo (spelled as &quot;Buffaloe&quot; at the time) with Lancaster village in what was then &quot;Jukdowaageh&quot; (now Cheektowaga), which some say meant &quot;land of the crab apple&quot; or &quot;land of fruit and flowers&quot;. The land had been bought and surveyed by the Holland Land Company.

The following is from &quot;Our County and Its People A Descriptive Work of Erie County New York&quot;, edited by Truman C. White:

&quot;Depew lies partly in Lancaster and partly in the town of Cheektowaga, but its history is so thoroughly identified with the territory under consideration that it may properly be treated wholly within this chapter. It was named in honor of Chauncey M. Depew, president of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, to which it owes its existence. That great corporation decided upon this site as a permanent location for its shops and auxiliary establishments, and on May 17, 1892, ground was broken. This was the signal for a general real estate boom in the vicinity. The great shops, covering about six acres, were first opened on April 1, 1893, with forty employees. Before the close of the year 1893 the following establishments had been completed or were well under way: The National Car Wheel Works, the Gould Coupler Company (occupying over six acres), and the Union Car Company (occupying about ten acres). The brass works were burned May 23, 1895, but immediately rebuilt. The first dwelling house was erected in April, 1893, and on May 1 of the same year John T. Lyman and George M. Beeman began the publication of the Depew Herald, which has had several proprietors, the present one being John T. Earl. In 1893 sixteen houses were erected, more than nine miles of plank sidewalk and 6,000 feet of sewers were laid, a fire company was organized, the New Palmer House by Alexander Stoddard and the Cleveland House by William Cleveland were built, and the water works were constructed by the Depew and Lancaster Water Works Company, of which Henry Koons was the first president.

On July 23, 1894, the village was incorporated, and the first officers elected August 21, were Dr. William Fairbanks, president; John Zurbrick, George Waltz and John Graney, trustees; Anthony Hartung, treasurer; Martin Kiefer, collector; J. N. Oswald, clerk. The corporate limits are about two and one-fourth miles square, and the population is about 2,800. In this year (1894) a hose company was organized, the plants of the Buffalo Cleaning and Dyeing Company and the Depew Brewing Company were established, the hardware store of Pratt &amp; Matthews was opened, and the brick block of E. J. Durbin was erected. Union free school district No. 7, of Cheektowaga, taking in a part of the old district No. 4, Lancaster, was also organized, the first president being Franklin Zurbrick. At this time four schools were kept in the village. A brick school house was built on the south side in 1894-95 and another on the north side in 1895, each costing $10,000. The first principal was C. A. Walker. In 1894 the Depew Natural Gas Company was organized and began furnishing gas for lighting and fuel; three wells have been sunk on the north side. The Methodist Episcopal Society was organized July 6, 1894, with E. J. Durbin, B. C. Stoddard and A. W. Southall, trustees; an edifice was erected in 1895.

By February, 1895, the village had a population of 1,814, and by May about 500 dwellings had been erected and few large establishments were in operation employing 2,500 men. Transit Street was macadamized in this year, the German Lutheran church was built, and in December the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Emmaus Society was organized. A Roman Catholic church and an independent Polish Catholic church were erected in 1896. In 1893 a post-office was established with W. W. Turley as postmaster; he was followed by John Graney and he by Robert Hunter.

Depew has stations on the New York Central, the D., L. &amp; W., the Erie and the Lehigh Valley Railroads; the latter constructed a branch direct to Tonawanda in 1895-96. The Depew Terminal Railroad was built from Depew to Blasdell in 1897. The Depew loop of the Buffalo, Bellevue &amp; Lancaster Electric Railway was opened in 1894. Much of the growth of the village is due to the Depew Improvement Company, which donated the school, and church sites, and which was largely succeeded in 1897 by the Depew Syndicate, capitalized at $100,000.&quot;

Named after Chauncey Depew, the village was founded and it became a hub of rapid growth. Founded in 1892 as a rail center, the Village of Depew was incorporated on July 23, 1894. The Depew economy in the 19th century was based primarily on railroad-related industries, such as the Gould Coupler Company, manufacturers of knuckle-type railroad couplers.

In 1904, Quebec political figure William Clendinneng died in Depew after being hit by a train.

Depew High School has a long-standing rivalry, starting in 1919, with Lancaster High School. The rivalry between has been strong and it is still a great battle between the smaller school versus the larger school despite the fact that Lancaster has won a majority of the games between the two rivals.

== History ==
The village was founded in 1804, and incorporated in 1874.

Prior to becoming President of the United States, Millard Fillmore lived in East Aurora with his wife Abigail from 1826 to 1830. The house he built there while practicing law in the beginning of his political career is currently maintained by the Aurora Historical Society. The 1825 structure is restored to that period and features some original Fillmore furniture of the era, as well as items from Fillmore&#x27;s presidential years. The home is currently located at 24 Shearer Avenue in the village of East Aurora. 

The founder of the Roycroft Movement, Elbert Hubbard, also lived there during the turn of the twentieth century. Hubbard and his wife died on board the in 1915. One of the town&#x27;s most famous landmarks, the Roycroft Inn, was converted from the Hubbards&#x27; original print shop and opened as an inn in 1905 to accommodate the influx of famous visitors attracted by Hubbard&#x27;s ideas as well as the books, Mission-style furniture and metalware produced by the 500 Roycroft artisans on the South Grove Street Roycroft campus. The Roycroft Campus was granted National Landmark Status in 1986. The Roycroft Inn was re-opened in June 1995 through the support of the Margaret L. Wendt Foundation. The inn was completely restored and is open to the public for dining and accommodations. The Elbert Hubbard Museum on Oakwood Avenue features an extensive collection of Roycroft books and Arts &amp; Crafts pieces.

East Aurora is also the birthplace of and home to the corporate headquarters for Fisher-Price. From 1987 through 2007 the village and the Toy Town Museum (an independent non-profit organization located on the Fisher-Price campus) held the Toyfest Festival, which included the Toyfest parade featuring giant replicas of classic Fisher-Price toys. The three-day event was usually held at Hamlin Park and included an amusement park, circus-like attractions and a Fisher-Price play area where young children could play with a variety of toys.

The town was the home of the inaugural owner of the NHL franchise Buffalo Sabres, Seymour H. Knox III. The Knox Estates, now known as Knox Farm, is a New York state park. It is located on the northwest edge of the village.

==Schools==
Public schools in Elma are under the jurisdiction of the Iroquois Central School District. Iroquois Central Schools consistently enjoys top rank as the 5th or 6th best public school in Western New York. Made up of approximately 3,000 students district-wide, Iroquois divides its students in an unconventional manner, with three primary schools for students in kindergarten through 3rd grade, an intermediate school for students in 4th and 5th grade, a middle school for students from 6th to 8th grade, and a high school for students in 9th to 12th grade.

While the primary schools are in the respective towns indicated by their names (Elma Primary, Marilla Primary, and Wales Primary), the other three schools are on the same expansive campus at 2111 Girdle Road in Elma. The campus is divided such that the high school and middle school are separated by the intermediate school, acting as a buffer between the similar age groups. The three buildings are connected by walkways, but students rarely leave the building to which their grade belongs. In accord, the primary, intermediate, middle, and high school buildings each have their own gymnasium, cafeteria, library, and administrative offices.

One of the school district&#x27;s greatest assets is the expansive undeveloped areas that surround each school that provide open space for younger students to play and older students to take part in extracurricular activities.

Some of the latest additions to the school, in fact, involve the development of a large field across the street from the high school. These fields across from the high school have been developed recently into a parking lot for students as well as soccer and lacrosse fields for the teams. In addition, the middle school library was recently remodeled, an extra wing of classrooms was added to the high school, and plans call for the renovation of the high school music department.

==Industry==
The headquarters for beverage manufacturer Elmhurst 1925 are in Elma. The Made In America Franchise is also headquartered in Elma. Moog, an aerospace engineering company also resides here.

==Fire companies==
The town of Elma has four volunteer fire companies: Blossom, Elma, Jamison Road, and Spring Brook. Blossom is one of the oldest fire companies in the county, establishing in 1872.

<doc id="126414" wikidata="Q942395" url="?curid=126414" title="Grand Island, New York">
<text>Grand Island is an island town in Erie County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 21,389 representing an increase of 5.00% from the 2010 census figure. The town&#x27;s name is derived from the French name La Grande Île; Grand Island is the largest island in the Niagara River and the third largest in New York state. The phrase &quot;La Grande Île&quot; appears on the town seal.

Grand Island has been home to the Attawandaron Nation and an acquisition of both French and English colonial pursuits. In 1945, Grand Island was part of a plan to make a new World Peace Capital on the international border between Southern Ontario, Canada, and Western New York. The plan proposed placing the United Nations headquarters on adjacent Navy Island (Ontario), which was considered an ideal location because it lay on the boundary between two peaceful countries. An artist&#x27;s rendering of the World Peace Capital showed the property with bridges spanning both countries (between Grand Island in the United States and the Canadian mainland). The proposal was turned down in favor of the current U.N. headquarters in New York City.

The town of Grand Island is in the northwestern corner of Erie County, and on the Canada–US border, although there is no river crossing to Canada. It is northwest of Buffalo, south of Niagara Falls, and is traversed by Interstate 190 and New York State Route 324.

==History==

=== Period before the American Revolution===
In the early historical period of the island, French explorers found members of the Neutral Nation of Native Americans, also known as the Attawandaron, living on the island. By 1651, the nearby Seneca Nation had chased off or killed the Neutrals, having also absorbed some of the survivors. The Seneca then used the island for hunting and fishing.

In 1764, as part of the Treaty of Cession after the French and Indian War, the island became part of the British colonies in North America.

===Period after the American Revolution===
In 1815, New York State purchased Grand Island and other small islands in the Niagara River from the Iroquois nation for $1,000 in hand, and annually a perpetuity of $500 every June. The treaty was signed by Governor Daniel D. Tompkins, Peter B. Porter, Chief Red Jacket, Falling Boards, Twenty Canoes, Sharp Shins, Man Killer, and others. The Senecas reserved the right to hunt fish and fowl on the islands.

In 1824, in a precursor to modern Zionism, journalist and Utopian Mordecai Manuel Noah tried to found a &quot;Jewish homeland on Grand Island.&quot; It would be called Ararat, after Mount Ararat, the Biblical resting place of Noah&#x27;s Ark. However, the idea failed to attract Noah&#x27;s fellow Jews, and it never got further than a ceremonial laying of a cornerstone. MacArthur Award-winning cartoonist Ben Katchor fictionalized Noah&#x27;s scheme for Grand Island in his graphic novel &quot;The Jew of New York&quot;.

The town of Grand Island was organized in 1852 from part of the town of Tonawanda.

On August 25, 1993, the Seneca Nation commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York to reclaim land that allegedly was taken from them without the approval of the United States. The Senecas argued the 1815 transaction with New York State violated the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibited Native American lands from being sold without the federal government&#x27;s consent. The Senecas sought the ejection of more than 2,000 property owners on the island. By decision and order dated June 21, 2002, the trial court held the subject lands were ceded to Great Britain in the 1764 treaties of peace and the subject lands were not owned by the Seneca at the time of the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. New York state&#x27;s purchase of them in 1815 was intended to avoid conflict with the Senecas over land it already owned. This decision was appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision on September 9, 2004. The Senecas then sought review of this decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which was denied on June 5, 2006.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and , or 15.08%, is water.

The Niagara river splits into two parts at the south end of the island and rejoins at the northwest end, about upstream (east) of Niagara Falls.

The town lies adjacent to the border between Canada and the United States. As there is no direct bridge or ferry connection from the island to Canada, there are no customs or immigration services. Paired bridges connect the south end of the island to the town of Tonawanda, and another pair of bridges connects the northern end to the city of Niagara Falls in Niagara County. The two sets of bridges carry Interstate 190, a branch of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90). In addition, New York State Route 324 (Grand Island Boulevard) is conjoined with I-190 at the southern bridges and reaches its western terminus in the northern part of Grand Island.

<doc id="126417" wikidata="Q1380568" url="?curid=126417" title="Lackawanna, New York">
<text>Lackawanna is a city in Erie County, New York, United States, just south of the city of Buffalo in western New York State. The population was 19,949 at the 2020 census. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in New York, growing in population by 10% from 2010 to 2020. It is part of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The city of Lackawanna is in the western part of Erie County.

The town&#x27;s name derives from the Lackawanna Steel Company, which owned the steel plant around which the city developed. During the early 20th century, the Lackawanna steel plant was the largest in the world. The word &quot;Lackawanna&quot; refers to the steel company&#x27;s original location in the river valley of the same name, in eastern Pennsylvania. That place name, in turn, might come from Lenape &quot;lèkaohane&quot;, meaning &quot;sandy stream&quot;, or &quot;lechauhanne&quot;, [lɛxaohánɛk], meaning &quot;forks of the river&quot;.

==History==
Originally part of the Buffalo Creek Reservation, the area was not open to settlement until 1842 when the Seneca Indians sold it. In 1851 the town of Seneca was formed; the name was changed to West Seneca in 1852. The area now known as Lackawanna was then called West Seneca or Limestone Hill.

Lackawanna was a center of steel manufacture throughout most of the 20th century. In 1899, the Lackawanna Steel Company, based in Scranton, Pennsylvania since its founding, purchased all the land along the West Seneca shore of Lake Erie. Construction was started in 1900 and the Lackawanna Steel Company relocated to the area in 1902. The plant began operations in 1903. In 1909, the area&#x27;s residents voted to split from West Seneca, forming the city of Lackawanna.

With most of the city&#x27;s workers employed by Lackawanna Steel, city affairs often revolved around events at the mill. Several attempts to organize a labor union at the mill resulted in violence. In 1910, a strike was broken by mounted police, who killed one worker. In 1919, steel workers formed a union again and joined the nationwide Steel strike of 1919. The workers were joined by sympathy strikes in adjacent companies, and two picketing workers were killed by company guards. Although the strike lasted into the summer of 1920, well after the national strike had ended, the union failed to win recognition from the company. As a result of the strike, Lackawanna elected a Socialist mayor, John H. Gibbons. After another violent strike in 1941, the CIO finally succeeded in negotiating a contract for the Lackawanna steel workers.

In 1922, the Bethlehem Steel Company acquired the Lackawanna Steel Company. With the 20th-century growth of the Bethlehem Steel plant, at one time the largest in the world, came the continued growth of the city and its institutions. At its peak, the plant employed 20,000 people. It attracted immigrants from many lands to settle and make their homes. Due to industrial restructuring in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as property tax assessment increases levied on the plant by the city, the steel plant declined in business and eventually closed in 1983, following massive job layoffs.

In the 21st century, efforts have been made to develop the former steel plant brownfields to other uses. The site has a diversity of tenants, some occupying buildings remaining from the former steel plant and a few in newer buildings. Opponents say that the brownfield is not safe and claim that contaminants in the field have caused cancer and other medical issues. United States Environmental Protection Agency reports are still ongoing and contested.

As part of redevelopment, wind turbines were built on the former Bethlehem Steel property in 2007. These initial eight 2.5 megawatt turbines will provide power for up to 9,000 households and are considered a sustainable energy source.

The Buffalo Harbor South Entrance Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

On November 9, 2016, a major fire broke out at the former galvanizing plant of the Bethlehem Steel complex.

===Railroads===
The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, originally the Lackawanna and Western Railroad, operated from 1851 to 1960. In 1960 it was consolidated with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway. This operated until 1976, when it was absorbed by Conrail.

===Notable court case===
The city of Lackawanna was the defendant in the 1971 district court decision &quot;Kennedy-Park Homes Association v. City of Lackawanna&quot;. This decision forbade the municipal government (Lackawanna) from interfering with the construction of a low-income housing development in a predominantly white section of the city. The court ruled such action would amount to racial discrimination.

===The Lackawanna Six===
The Lackawanna Six (also known as the Buffalo Six) are a group of Yemeni Americans convicted of providing &quot;material support&quot; to Al-Qaeda. The group was accused of traveling to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the spring of 2001 to attend terrorist training camps. The men had claimed that their travel was to Pakistan only, and for the purpose of religious instruction.

The group was arrested in Lackawanna on September 13, 2002, by the FBI. A member of the Lackawanna Cell, Jaber A. Elbaneh, never returned to the U.S. after his trip to Afghanistan. In September 2003 the FBI announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. Captured by Yemen police, he was convicted and sentenced to a prison in Yemen for involvement in the 2002 bombing of the French oil tanker &quot;Limburg&quot; off the coast of Yemen. The remaining members of the group pleaded guilty in December 2003 and were given various sentences in federal prison.

Jaber Elbaneh escaped from a Yemeni prison in 2006 after joining a successful group prison break. He was identified as one of 23 people, 12 of them Al-Qaeda members, who escaped on February 3, 2006. On February 23, 2006, the FBI confirmed the escape, as they issued a national press release naming Elbaneh to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. On May 20, 2007, Elbaneh turned himself in to Yemen authorities on the condition that his prison sentence would not be extended. The incident of the Lackawanna Six has tarnished the city&#x27;s reputation, but it is recovering.

In July 2009, it was reported that prior to authorities sending in 130 federal and local members of the Western New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, there were suggestions that federal troops be used to capture the suspects. At the time, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld believed that the Yemeni men should be declared enemy combatants and could have been tried by a military tribunal. President Bush rejected this proposal, and the arrests proceeded without incident.

==Geography==
The city has an area of , of which , or 0.75%, is water. Lackawanna sits on Lake Erie, although the Bethlehem Steel facility&#x27;s remnants occupy the waterfront. Smokes Creek (named after Seneca Indian Chief Sayenqueraghta who was nicknamed &quot;Old Smoke&quot;) runs through the city before it discharges into Lake Erie.

Abbott Road is a major road that runs north–south through the city. Ridge Road is a main east–west road in the city.

==Religious institutions==
The city of Lackawanna is home to fourteen Protestant churches, the Masjid Alhuda Guidance Mosque (the largest mosque in the Buffalo area), ten Roman Catholic churches, including Our Lady of Victory Basilica (OLV); and Saint Stephen Serbian Orthodox Church.

===Our Lady of Victory Basilica===

Lackawanna&#x27;s Our Lady of Victory Basilica is a National Shrine. Next to the basilica is Holy Cross Cemetery. It has been a parish cemetery since 1849, although burials date to 1830.

Father Nelson Baker was responsible for the building of a working boys&#x27; home (protectory) in 1898. He also supervised construction of an infants&#x27; home in 1907, a maternity home in 1915, Our Lady of Victory Hospital in 1919, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Victory in 1926. Father Baker named the basilica after the shrine of Notre Dame des Victoires in Paris, which he visited as a seminarian in 1874. He was in charge of the basilica and the institutions of charity until his death at 94, on July 29, 1936.

Father Baker&#x27;s social programs have evolved into Baker Victory Services, which care for more than 2,500 children each day. Baker Victory Services Adoption Program has evolved into a renowned resource for a wide range of adoptive services. Their mission is to assist birth mothers, families and adoptees through the often complex and always emotional adoption process. Our Lady of Victory Hospital, closed in 1999, is being converted into senior housing. The Homes of Charity provide the funds to continue Baker&#x27;s social programs through donations.

Our Lady of Victory Basilica had its 75th anniversary in 2001. The Catholic Church named Father Baker a &quot;Servant of God&quot; in 1987, the first step towards declaring him a saint. In 1999, Father Baker&#x27;s remains were moved from Holy Cross Cemetery and re-interred inside the basilica. This was a recommended step for his canonization process. On January 14, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI approved a document of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declaring Father Baker &quot;Venerable.&quot; His cause for canonization, as an &quot;apostle of charity,&quot; continues under review by Vatican officials.

<text>Marilla is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 5,189 at the 2020 census. The name of the town is derived from Marilla Rogers, an early school teacher.

==History==
This part of the county was first settled around 1827. At the time, the land where Marilla sits (along with neighboring Elma) was part of the Buffalo Creek Reservation, and members of the Ebenezer Society were the first to settle on the Seneca lands. The land was opened to general settlement shortly after the Treaty of Buffalo Creek was finalized in 1842.

The town of Marilla was organized in 1853 from parts of the towns of Alden and Wales. Marilla Rogers gave her name to this town; she died in 1855 when she was 38, just two years after the town was given the name.

Located on Two Rod Road is one of the town&#x27;s oldest stores: the historic Marilla General Store, currently known as the Marilla Country Store.

==Communities and locations in Marilla==
* Buffalo Creek – A stream that flows westward through the south part of the town.
* Bush Gardens – A small hamlet in the northeast part of the town.
* Marilla – A hamlet in the northwest part of the town, located on Buffalo Creek and at the junction of Two Rod and Bullis Roads. The community was founded around 1829.
* Porterville – A hamlet in the southwest corner of the town, located on Buffalo Creek. The name of the community is from Archibald Porter, an early mill operator.
* Williston – location near the junction of Williston and Three Rod roads. The name comes from the Willis family, early settlers.

==Schools==
Students in Marilla attend either the Iroquois Central School District or Alden Central School District. Marilla Primary, a K-4 school in the Iroquois School District, is located in Marilla on Bullis Road.

Public schools in Marilla are under the jurisdiction of the Iroquois School District or the Alden Central School District. Both Iroquois and Alden Central Schools consistently enjoy rankings within the top school districts in the Western New York region. Alden Central Schools ranked number seven in 2011, while Iroquois came in at number eleven. Consisting of approximately 3,000 students district-wide, Iroquois divides its students in an unconventional manner, with three separate primary schools, an intermediate (5th grade)/middle school for students from 6th to 8th grade, and a high school for students in 9th to 12th grade. While the primary schools are located in the respective towns indicated by their names (Elma Primary, Marilla Primary, and Wales Primary), the other two schools are located on the same expansive campus at 2111 Girdle Road in Elma. The Campus is divided by offices in such that the high school and middle school are separated by the district offices, acting as a buffer between the similar age groups. The three buildings are connected by walkways, but it is rare that students should need to leave the building to which their grade belongs. In accord, the primary, middle, and high school buildings each have their own gymnasium, cafeteria, library, and administrative offices. One of the greatest assets of this school district is the expansive undeveloped areas surrounding every school, providing plenty of open space for younger students to play and older students to participate in extracurricular activities. Some of the latest additions to the school, in fact, involve the development of a large field directly across the street from the high school. In addition, the middle school library was recently remodeled, an extra wing of classrooms was added to the high school.

<doc id="126427" wikidata="Q3460097" url="?curid=126427" title="Town Line, New York">
<text>Town Line is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 2,367 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The community is located on the boundary between the towns of Lancaster and Alden. Town Line is notable for having held a nonbinding vote to secede from the United States in 1861, and for having held a ceremonial vote to rejoin the United States in 1946.

== History ==
According to Town Line oral lore, in 1861, 125 men gathered in an informal meeting at a local schoolhouse and passed (85 to 40) a resolution to secede from the United States. Because Town Line was never an incorporated municipal entity in the first place and had no well-defined boundaries, the resolution had no legal effect; neither the Confederacy nor the Union ever formally recognized the action. Alden Historical Society archivist Karen Muchow has stated that there are no written records of the action. According to Muchow, several members of the German-American community fled to Canada and twenty residents fought for the Union Army. While the reason behind the vote is unknown, author Daren Wang and others have opined that Town Line residents—some of whom had emigrated from Germany to avoid conscription—were motivated by opposition to a potential military draft being necessitated by the Civil War.

Town Line held a ceremony on January 24, 1946 to &quot;rejoin&quot; the Union. Hollywood celebrity Cesar Romero participated in the festivities. On that day, residents voted, 90 to 23, to rescind the 19th-century secession vote.

<text>Williamsville is a village in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 5,423 at the 2020 census. The village is named after Jonas Williams, an early settler. It is part of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area.

Williamsville is located mostly within the town of Amherst, but Creek Road and Creek Heights in the south part of the village (near the Wehrle Drive underpass of the New York State Thruway) are in the town of Cheektowaga. The village is in the northeastern quadrant of Erie County.

The Williamsville Central School District is a school system covering Williamsville, most of the eastern part of Amherst, and a small portion of the western end of Clarence.

== History ==
The community developed where the major road between Batavia and Buffalo crossed Ellicott Creek just above Glen Falls. The water power offered by the waterfall attracted millers. The first mill was built by Jonas Williams in 1811, giving the village its first name, &quot;Williams Mills&quot;. It still stands today, next to Glen Park, and is known as the Williamsville Water Mill.

Several other mills were built near Glen Falls during the 19th century. In 1841, a raceway was constructed to divert water from Ellicott Creek to the mills, creating an island known today as Island Park. A stagecoach stop, tavern, and inn was built along the main road near Ellicott Creek by Oziel Smith in 1827. Today it is known as the Eagle House. The close crossing of the main road and Ellicott Creek&#x27;s Glen Falls was the initial attraction, around which Williamsville grew. The village was incorporated in 1850.

Ss. Peter and Paul Church was loosely operating in the early 1820s, and the current church construction began in 1834 following the sale of land for the church from a non-parishioner, Oziel Smith, and was finished in 1836. St. John Neumann arrived to lead Ss. Peter and Paul Catholic Church from 1836 to 1840. Ss. Peter and Paul School was started by St. John Neumann in 1836, who also served as one of its first teachers.

During the War of 1812, American troops were stationed in Williamsville in the area between Garrison Road and Ellicott Creek. American soldiers and British prisoners were treated in a field hospital and log barracks that lined Garrison Road. A small cemetery, located on Aero Drive between Wehrle and Youngs Road, was used to bury the men who did not survive. General Winfield Scott used the Evans House as his headquarters in the Spring of 1813 when his entire army of 5,000–6,000 men were stationed in Williamsville. In 1813, when the British burned Buffalo, people fled to the safety of Williamsville, nearby Harris Hill, and Erie, Pennsylvania.

The village of Williamsville was one of more than 550 villages incorporated by New York State in 1850.

In 1983, Williamsville passed a Historic Preservation Code &quot;to promote the awareness of landmarks of historic, cultural, social and architectural significance in the Village of Williamsville and to safe guard the heritage, character and quality of life unique to the Village through the preservation of these landmarks.&quot;

Every summer in Williamsville, Old Home Days is held in Island Park, located directly on Main Street in the village. The Carnival begins with a parade on the opening Tuesday, and for four days, thousands of people enjoy rides, food, and the people of Williamsville. The Old Home Days festival is in remembrance of several women who in the mid-19th century came to the park once each summer to drink tea and catch up on the years past.

In 2010, government downsizing activist Kevin Gaughan campaigned to dissolve the village government. After a highly contentious campaign, a dissolution referendum was held on August 17, 2010, where voters rejected dissolution by a 5–1 margin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Ellicott Creek flows through the village from south to north. The Onondaga Escarpment runs through the village east to west. Glen Falls marks the place where Ellicott Creek falls over the escarpment. An early name for Ellicott Creek was &quot;Eleven Mile Creek&quot;.

Main Street is part of the east–west New York State Route 5 (NY 5). American surveyor Joseph Ellicott had the &quot;Great Iroquois Trail&quot;, an ancient path from the Hudson River to Lake Erie, improved. It was known as the &quot;Buffalo Road&quot; and, later, &quot;Main Street&quot;. North Union Road, part of NY 277, is a major north–south road through the west end of the village. Transit Road, surveyed by Joseph Ellicott, was named for an important surveying instrument (a transit level). Transit Road marks the boundary between townships (Amherst and Clarence, Cheektowaga and Lancaster), inter alia. Joseph Ellicott&#x27;s surveys of western New York divided the Holland Purchase land into a grid of more or less square of townships with boundaries aligned north–south and east–west, a system related to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) used in most of the rest of post-colonial America. In western New York, strict accordance to the PLSS was not required or followed, since the land was not federally owned, but had passed directly from the Seneca Indians to land speculators such as the Holland Land Company.

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) passes through the south part of the village and connects to I-290. A Thruway toll plaza located near the village has been a matter of controversy for years and recent proposals suggest it may be moved farther east.

<text>Crown Point is a town in Essex County, New York, United States, located on the west shore of Lake Champlain. The population was 2,024 at the 2010 census. The name of the town is a direct translation of the original French name, .

The town is on the eastern edge of Essex County. It is southwest of Burlington, Vermont, northeast of Queensbury, south of Montreal, Quebec and north of Albany.

==History==

Two European forts were built by colonists because of the area&#x27;s strategic location at the narrows of Lake Champlain. The forts preceded organization of the town by more than half a century: first was Fort Saint-Frédéric built by the French in 1731, who came to this area from their colonial settlements to the north at Quebec and Montreal. They competed with the British for the fur trade with Native Americans in the area.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War in North America), the British gained control of this area. Before that, the French retreated and destroyed their fort to keep it out of the hands of the British. The latter built Fort Crown Point in 1759, then the largest earthen fort in their colonies. With British victory in the war, after 1763 France ceded all its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River to Britain.

During colonial times and the American Revolutionary War, the fort at Crown Point continued to be important for its strategic location – on the west shore of Lake Champlain about north of Fort Ticonderoga, about a day&#x27;s travel by the modes of that time. After the failure of the patriot American invasion of Canada in 1776, Fort Crown Point represented the northernmost area under American control. During the British Saratoga campaign in 1777, General John Burgoyne organized a supply magazine here to support his Siege of Ticonderoga.

The town of Crown Point, located a few miles south of the 1759 Fort, is an original town of the county, established in 1788 following the Revolution and before the organization of Essex County. Parts of Crown Point were later drawn off to form the town of Elizabethtown (1798). The modern European-American settlement of the town began around 1800 with an influx of settlers from Vermont.

Crown Point holds the New York state January record low of .

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.99%, is water.

The eastern town line, defined by Lake Champlain, is the border of Vermont (Addison County). The Champlain Bridge (Route 17) connected Crown Point to Vermont until 2009, when the bridge was demolished as unsafe. A temporary ferry service, operated by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company and funded by the states of New York and Vermont, provided access from Crown Point to Vermont from late 2009 until late 2011. The new bridge at Crown Point, scheduled to open in August 2011, opened to traffic that November.

The town of Crown Point lies entirely within the Adirondack Park.

New York State Route 9N, New York State Route 22, and New York State Route 185 are north–south and east–west highways that pass through Crown Point. NY-9N and NY-22 are conjoined through the town. NY-185 runs up the Crown Point peninsula.

<text>Essex is a town in Essex County, New York, United States overlooking Lake Champlain. The population was 621 at the 2020 census. The town is named after locations in England.

The town is on the eastern edge of the county. It is south-southwest of Burlington, Vermont, which is on the opposite shore of Lake Champlain, south of Plattsburgh, south of Montreal, Quebec, and north of Albany. Essex is inside the Adirondack Park.

== History ==
At the time of first European contact ca. 1530, the area on the western shores of Lake Champlain were inhabited by Mohawk people of the Iroquois confederacy, with substantial Abenaki (Algonquian) contact.
Essex was part of a land grant made to Louis Joseph Robart by King Louis XV of France. The land grant was lost after the British took over the region after 1763.

The region was first settled around 1765 with the intention of forming a baronial estate like those of the lower Hudson River for landowner and investor, William Gilliland.

The town was formed from a part of the town of Willsboro in 1805. It was an important shipbuilding location and port, but that economy collapsed after 1849 with the beginning of railroad lines in the region.

The Essex Village Historic District, Foothills Baptist Church, and the Octagonal Schoolhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 15.88%, is water.

The eastern border of Essex is the Vermont state line in the middle of Lake Champlain.

New York State Route 22 is a north–south highway in Essex.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 713 people, 302 households, and 202 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 522 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 99.7% White, 0.1% Native American, and 0.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.1% of the population.

There were 302 households, out of which 24.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.0% were married couples living together, 9.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.1% were non-families. 27.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.79.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 21.3% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 23.8% from 25 to 44, 29.0% from 45 to 64, and 20.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,596, and the median income for a family was $40,104. Males had a median income of $26,905 versus $19,583 for females. The per capita income for the town was $20,087. About 10.8% of families and 11.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.1% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
The Town of Essex is a municipal corporation governed by a five-member elected town board. The board is composed of one Supervisor (two-year term beginning every even-numbered year) and four Councilmembers (four terms, of which two begin concurrently with each new supervisor term). The Town Clerk is an elected two-year term position, beginning every even numbered year. The Highway Superintendent is an elected two-year term position beginning every even numbered year and is run independently from the Town Board, except for receiving annual funding of the Highway Department budget. The Town Justice is an elected four-year position and is run independently from the Town Board, except for receiving funds on a monthly basis. There are three duly elected Assessors who each serve a four-year term, with two of them staggering their term two years apart from the other.

==Education and culture==
Most of Essex is served by Willsboro Central School District, though the Boquet Valley Central School is also used. Additionally, some travel across Lake Champlain to Vermont or drive north to Plattsburgh for private school.

For twenty years, the Essex Theatre Company, located near the ferry dock in the Masonic Lodge, has continuously produced stage plays and broadway musicals for summertime enjoyment – and also occasional winter entertainment programs.

The entire town is situated among quaint shops, cafes, and restaurants. Most notable for their placement on the National Register of Historic Places, the entire town is included on the Registry.

Periodically there are adult education programs, such as a history lecture series, at the Whallonsburgh Grange.

==Recreation==
There are a wide variety of year-round recreational offerings. Cycling is very popular in many parts of Essex. Whallons Bay Road offers magnificent views of both Vermont and the Adirondack High Peaks, with smooth roads and moderate hills. Walker Road is also a popular bike route, which sees Essex residents routinely riding from the historic hamlet to Dogwood Bakery in Wadhams via this route on the weekends. Route 22 is part of the Empire State Trail, which officially opened in 2020. Hikers will find many opportunities to access small mountains, forests and fields via the Champlain Area Trails (CATS) trails, which wind for dozens of miles throughout Essex. The newest Essex Quarry Trail, at the top of Bull Run in Essex, allows visitors to see the remains of a once-active quarry in a unique woodland. Infrequently traveled side roads throughout the entire town lend themselves to casual walks through serene and beautiful areas. On the lake, sailing, swimming, stand-up paddleboarding (SUPs) and kayaking are favorite summer pastimes. Both Lake Champlain and the Boquet River have excellent and easy to access areas for anglers of all ages.

==Public transport==
Air service transport is provided by Plattsburgh International Airport (30 miles to the north), and Burlington International Airport (across the lake via the ferry in Essex, to Charlotte, Vermont). Both are within easy driving distance. Burlington International Airport serves international customers, and Plattsburgh International Airport serves regional and national carriers.

Ferry service between Essex and Charlotte, Vermont, is provided by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. This became a year-round route in 1998.

This route is used by many residents for access to medical care, jobs, school, and shopping. While most years in the past decade the ferry service has run year-round, the ice-breaking ferries usually used on this route were redeployed to Crown Point to fill in for the Champlain Bridge which was demolished in 2009.

The first ferry service in Essex began operation &quot;circa&quot; 1790.

Amtrak service is available in Westport, to the south. In the days of peak train service, local Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway trains ending at Plattsburgh or at Rouses Point made stops in Essex, but not the named trains, &quot;Laurentian,&quot; or its overnight counterpart, the &quot;Montreal Limited.&quot;

==Access to medical care==
Essex is in a rural area in the Adirondack Park, so most of its access to medical care is via the ferry operated by Lake Champlain Transportation. The nearest emergency department is Elizabethtown Community Hospital, a 25-bed rural hospital with eighteen on its active medical staff, which is a drive. Further away, accessible via 20-minute ferry and a significant drive, is the emergency department of Fletcher Allen Hospital, a large, full-service hospital affiliated with the University of Vermont. An important fully staffed hospital and full-service emergency department is at CVPH Medical Center, in Plattsburgh, approximately to the north.

<text>Keene is a town in central Essex County, New York, United States. It includes the hamlets of Keene, Keene Valley, and St. Huberts, with a total population of 1,144 as of the 2020 census

The town is part of the Adirondack Park, and includes 15 of the 46 High Peaks, including Mount Marcy, New York&#x27;s highest mountain, and the rest of the Great Range. It also includes the Ausable Lakes, the source of the Ausable River. Trailheads for many of the High Peaks are located within the town, along with the Johns Brook Lodge of the Adirondack Mountain Club.

== History ==
The earliest settlement in the present village of Keene Center was in 1787. The town of Keene was created from splitting parts of the towns of Jay and Elizabethtown on March 19, 1808. This originally included current North Elba, but that was split in 1849 from the original Keene. The area is mountainous with bedrock close to the surface in most areas, leaving little arable land. It has a low population due to the unsuitable and often unstable soil in the region. A road along the Ausable River from Jay was extended south to Keene Center about 1797, but it was often deemed almost impassible due to the structure of the area. The town of Keene organized the first school district in the Adirondacks, which held its first recorded trustee meeting in 1813.

Early development in the area was based on lumber and iron extraction; however, exporting lumber was difficult due to lack of transportation, and most was used locally. The first sawmill was built in 1823 and was quickly followed by forges and gristmills. The riverbed region of Keene sprouted the first community, Keene Central, and Keene Flats (renamed Keene Valley in 1883) was developed by 1840. In 1892, after the Adirondack Mountain Reserve acquired the land, a privately tolled and maintained road to Lower Ausable Lake was constructed.

In 2011, the town completed a grassroots project to bring broadband service to more than 97% of the homes in Keene, and installing the service in every home with a student in the town&#x27;s public school. The extension of this network into rural areas makes it unique in the Adirondack Park.

The Hurricane Mountain Fire Observation Station, Slater Bridge (St. Huberts) and Walton Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.43%, is water.

Many of the High Peaks of the Adirondack Park are in or near the town, including Mount Marcy, elevation , the highest point in New York.

<text>Lake Placid is a village in the Adirondack Mountains in Essex County, New York, United States. In 2020, its population was 2,205.

The village of Lake Placid is near the center of the town of North Elba, southwest of Plattsburgh. Lake Placid became known internationally for hosting the 1932 and the 1980 Winter Olympics, the 1972 and 2023 Winter World University Games as well as the 2000 Goodwill Winter Games.

==History==
Lake Placid was founded in the early 19th century to develop an iron ore mining operation. By 1840, the population of &quot;North Elba&quot; (four miles southeast of the present village, near where the road to the Adirondak Loj crosses the Ausable River), was six families. In 1845, the philanthropist Gerrit Smith arrived in North Elba and not only bought a great deal of land around the village but granted large tracts to former slaves. He reformed the land law and demonstrated his support of abolitionism.

The abolitionist John Brown heard about Smith&#x27;s reforms and left his anti-slavery activities in Kansas to buy of land in North Elba. This parcel later became known as the &quot;Freed Slave Utopian Experiment,&quot; &quot;Timbuctoo&quot;. Brown would become known for his militant abolitionist work, which led to his raid on Harpers Ferry and his conviction for treason and murder. Shortly before his execution in 1859, John Brown asked to be buried on his farm, which remains preserved as the John Brown Farm State Historic Site.

As leisure time increased in the late 19th century, Lake Placid was discovered as a resort by the wealthy, drawn to the fashionable Lake Placid Club. Melvil Dewey, who invented the Dewey Decimal System, designed what was then called &quot;Placid Park Club&quot; in 1895. This inspired the village to change its name to Lake Placid, an incorporated village in 1900. Dewey kept the club open through the winter in 1905, which aided the development of winter sports in the area. It often hosted national conventions. Nearby Saranac Lake had hosted an international winter sporting event as early as 1889 and was used year-round by patients seeking treatment for tuberculosis at sanatoria. The fresh, clean mountain air was considered good for them and was a common treatment for tuberculosis.

As the dramatic surroundings became more known to residents of New York City, filmmakers started to use Lake Placid and its surroundings for shooting silent films around 1920. Many movies, among them &quot;News Parade, Summer Bachelors, The Avalanche&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Snows&quot;, were shot in the area.

By 1921, the Lake Placid area boasted a ski jump, speed skating venue, and ski association. In 1929, Godfrey Dewey, Melvil&#x27;s son, convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Lake Placid had the best winter sports facilities in the United States. The Lake Placid Club was the headquarters for the IOC for the 1932 and the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.

The Club did not allow Jews or Catholics, but there were other hotels that catered to them. Especially during and after World War Two, many cosmopolitan refugees from Hitler&#x27;s Germany and Austria spent their summers in Lake Placid. Main Street was filled with fashionable shops, albeit opened only during the season.

In addition to the John Brown Farm and Gravesite, the Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run, New York Central Railroad Adirondack Division Historic District, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Major historical hotels ==
There were three major hotels built in the 1870s, and many subsequent inns flourished. Among the most prominent hotels were: The Grand View Hotel, Stevens House, The Mirror Lake Inn, The Ruisseaumont Hotel, Northwoods Inn, Hotel Marcy, Searles House, and The Homestead. Some of them are still in business.

==Sporting events==
===Olympic Winter Games===
Lake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980. Lake Placid, St Moritz, and Innsbruck are the only sites to have twice hosted the Winter Olympic Games.

Jack Shea, a resident of the village, became the first person to win two gold medals when he doubled in speed skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics.

In the U.S., the village is especially remembered as the 1980 USA–USSR hockey game site. Dubbed the &quot;Miracle on Ice,&quot; a group of American college students and amateurs upset seasoned and professional Soviet national ice hockey team, 4–3, and two days later won the gold medal. Another historic first was the performance of American speed-skater Eric Heiden, who won five gold medals.

===Other international sporting events===

Lake Placid has continued to host international multi-sport events. The World University Games took place there on two occasions; hosting the 1972 Winter Universiade and the 2023 Winter World University Games. Lake Placid hosted the 2000 Goodwill Winter Games. 

=== Regular sporting events ===
* Since 1999 Lake Placid has been a site for the annual Ironman Lake Placid Triathlon, the second oldest Ironman in North America and one of ten official Ironman Triathlons held in the continental U.S.
* The Lake Placid and I Love New York Horse Shows have been held at the North Elba Showgrounds since 1969.
* The Winter Empire State Games are held in Lake Placid every February.

* The Lake Placid Summit Classic Lacrosse Tournament is held every year in early August since 1990; roughly 250 teams participate.

==Recreational opportunities==

Lake Placid is well known among winter-sports enthusiasts for its skiing, both Alpine and Nordic. Whiteface Mountain (), in nearby Wilmington about from Lake Placid, offers skiing, hiking, gondola rides, and mountain biking, and is the only one of the High Peaks that can be reached by an auto road. Whiteface Mountain has a vertical elevation of , the highest vertical elevation of mountains in Eastern North America. The area has one of only 16 bobsled runs in the Western Hemisphere.

In 2010, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; highlighted Lake Placid as one of the &quot;6 Forgotten Vacation Spots&quot; in North America.

Many people use Lake Placid as a base from which to climb the 46 High Peaks in the Adirondack Mountains.

Lake Placid built its first golf course in 1898, one of the first in the U.S., and has more courses than any other venue in the Adirondacks. Many of its courses were designed by well-known golf course architects, such as Seymour Dunn and Alister MacKenzie. The geographic features of the Adirondacks were considered reminiscent of the Scottish landscape, where the game started, and thus a fitting canvas for original play, or &quot;mountain golf.&quot;

Lake Placid is near the West Branch of the Ausable River, a well-known stretch of water for fly fishing.

== Music ==
Lake Placid is home to the Lake Placid Sinfonietta, a professional summer chamber orchestra that has existed since 1917. Musicians associated with New York City&#x27;s Greenwich House Music School summered in Lake Placid around 1920, as did the opera singer George Hamlin. Victor Herbert was the most famous musician to own a camp in town. The Lake Placid Club offered concerts and gala festivities for decades.

<text>Moriah is a town in Essex County, New York, United States. Lying within the Adirondack Park, it is situated in the eastern part of the county, by road south-southwest of Burlington, Vermont, south of Plattsburgh, north of Albany, and south of Montreal, Quebec. The population was 4,798 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

This area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, the area was inhabited chiefly by the historic Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk of the Iroquois Confederacy to the west of Lake Champlain, with the Algonquian-speaking Mahican people to the south.

In 1749, French Jesuits attracted numerous Iroquois (mostly Onondaga fleeing warfare in the western part of present-day New York) to a site on the Oswegatchie River near present-day Ogdensburg. The Jesuit priests founded a mission village and fort. The Iroquois were required to convert to Catholicism to live there. The converted Iroquois and their descendants became known as the &quot;Oswegatchie&quot;, and were considered &quot;nephews&quot; to the Six Nations of the Iroquois. They were among the Seven Nations of Canada that allied with the French during the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War on the North American front) and with the British during the American Revolutionary War, in part due to their strong trading ties and cultural links. After the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War) and British victory, the colonial government granted some of its soldiers land in the region, which was ceded to Britain by the French.

It was not until 1785, after the American Revolutionary War, when most of the Iroquois allies went to Upper Canada with the Loyalists, that the first European-American permanent settlement was made here. At the time, local Native Americans still hunted in the area. They were called the St. Regis and Oswegatchie Indians, although both groups were Catholic Iroquois, primarily Mohawk and Onondaga. Relations were initially friendly, but American settlement patterns pushed the Native Americans from their hunting grounds. (The St. Regis group were Catholic Mohawk who lived at the reserve of &quot;Akwesasne&quot;, whose territory along the St. Lawrence River included land within the boundaries of both Canada and New York. Today it is recognized in the United States as the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation and in Canada as Akwesasne.)

The Town of Moriah was formed in 1808 from the town of Elizabethtown.

The discovery and mining of iron in the Adirondacks caused a boom in the local economy. This area also processed iron in smelting, and shipped products from Port Henry on Lake Champlain. These operations were conducted from 1824 until 1971. The Iron Center Museum in Port Henry recalls and interprets that past era.

Winter ice-fishing for smelt on the frozen Lake Champlain has been a popular sport for more than a century. Tourists come to join residents in this activity.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.31%, is water.

The eastern town line is formed by Lake Champlain and the border of Vermont.

<text>North Elba is a town in Essex County, New York, United States. The population was 7,480 at the 2020 census.

North Elba is on the western edge of the county. It is by road southwest of Plattsburgh, south-southwest of Montreal, and north of Albany. While it is only west-southwest of Burlington, Vermont, one would have to either take a ferry across Lake Champlain, or drive around it. The entirety of the village of Lake Placid is located within the boundaries of North Elba, as is part of the village of Saranac Lake.

== History ==
The town was first settled around 1814. In 1840 there were six families in the future North Elba, which was formed from part of the town of Keene in 1849.

The abolitionist John Brown, attracted by the views of local abolitionist Gerrit Smith, came to the town in 1849 to found a community for former black slaves. Smith was trying to resettle free blacks on land in the area, but it was not suitable for family farming. Brown left from his farm for the raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859.

A visitor in 1861 noted that in North Elba there was &quot;a school house, which serves for this purpose, for a church, and a town hall.&quot; At that time, when the village of Lake Placid did not exist, a map of 1858 reveals that North Elba was at that time also a hamlet, centered at the intersection of what are today (2021) New York State Route 73 and Adirondack Loj roads. The town and its village, Lake Placid, were the site of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics.

Barngalow and the Larom-Welles Cottage were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

==Notable people==
*John Brown, the famous abolitionist, who was executed after his conviction of treason, sedition, and murder by the state of Virginia, is buried on his family&#x27;s farm in North Elba, as is his son Watson Brown. Twelve other participants in Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, including his son Oliver, were moved in 1899 to a common grave near Brown&#x27;s.
*Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal System, founded a resort in the town.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.03%, is water. 

Some of the High Peaks of the Adirondack Park are in the southern part of town. The West Branch of the Au Sable River flows out the northeastern corner of the town.

The western town line is the border of Franklin County.

New York State Route 73 and New York State Route 86 are east–west highways in the town that intersect at Lake Placid village.

<text>Port Henry is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Essex County, New York, United States. The population was 1,194 at the 2010 census.

Port Henry lies on the eastern side of the town of Moriah and is approximately one hour&#x27;s drive (52 miles or 84 km) south of Plattsburgh. It is by road south-southwest of Burlington, Vermont, north of Albany and south of Montreal, Quebec.

==History==

Port Henry is in a tract of land set aside by the British Crown for veterans of the Seven Years&#x27; War (also known as the French and Indian War). Although a mill was built in 1765, no other European-American settlers arrived until 1785, after the American Revolutionary War.

The Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk and Oswegatchie, members of the Seven Nations of Canada, were still living in the town until after 1800.

Most of the Iroquois from the territory of New York had been resettled in Canada, forced out of New York and the United States due to their alliance with the British during the war. In the early years, timber harvesting was a major industry and 20 mills were located in the area. The first dock was built on Lake Champlain by 1820 for shipping lumber to other ports.
Early settlers discovered iron ore a few miles inland. Its extraction and processing became an important industry in the township for about one hundred and fifty years. A blast furnace constructed in 1822 in Port Henry was one of the first in the United States, and Republic Steel established major operations in the county. The village residents used Lake Champlain and the Hudson River to transport its ore and products to major markets such as Albany and New York City. Later a railroad connected the village to markets.

The village of Port Henry was incorporated in 1869. By the end of the 19th century, residents harvested smelt from the lake for the restaurant trade, by ice fishing. The Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad Depot, Moriah Town Office Building, Mount Moriah Presbyterian Church, Port Henry Fire Department Building, Sherman Free Library, and Van Ornam &amp; Murdock Block are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Essex County Republication was published in Port Henry in the 19th and early 20th centuries, after which it moved to Keeseville.

Effective March 31, 2017, the Village of Port Henry was dissolved by the result of a public referendum. The village ceased to exist as a municipality. Village operations were absorbed by the Town of Moriah. Port Henry continues to exist as a hamlet within the town.

<text>Schroon ( ) is a town in the Adirondack Park, in Essex County, New York, United States. The population was 1,880 at the 2020 census. The largest community in the town is the hamlet of Schroon Lake, located at the northern end of the lake of the same name.

The Town of Schroon is in the southern part of Essex County. The town contains two lakes: the northern two-thirds of Schroon Lake, and Paradox Lake. The two lakes are connected by the Schroon River, a southward-flowing tributary of the Hudson River.

== History ==

The Town of Schroon was first settled by Europeans in 1804 from part of the Town of Crown Point, north of the current Schroon Lake hamlet, as part of France&#x27;s colonial holdings south of Quebec. The town was partitioned to form the newer Town of Minerva in 1817. In 1840, part of Schroon was returned to Crown Point. As with other towns of Essex County, the early economy was heavily involved in lumber production. The origination of the name &quot;Schroon&quot; is not precisely known. Some believe it to be derived from a Native American word for &quot;large lake&quot;. Others believe it devolved from French soldiers who inhabited the region during the French &amp; Indian Wars. The soldiers were enamored with Madame Scarron (a popular paramour of French King Louis XIV and prior to that the wife of noted French poet/playwright Paul Scarron). In the late 1800s the Village of Schroon became a destination for wealthy families from the NY Metropolitan area.  Their trip started in New York City by rail to the town of Riverside, then a stagecoach to Pottersville, and finally aboard a steamer that traveled up the lake to the Village.  By 1915, after the introduction of automobiles, people from the cities were flocking to the Schroon Lake region. Capitalizing on this booming tourist trade, grand resorts such as Taylor&#x27;s on Schroon (later Scaroon Manor), the Leland House and the Brown Swan – along with a number of Adirondack Style Lodges – made Schroon Lake a premier summer vacation spot.  

Prior to the construction of the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87), US Route 9 was the major north–south highway between Albany and Montreal, which made Schroon Lake a convenient stopping point for travelers to purchase gas, lodging, and meals.

The Scaroon Manor resort, which closed in 1962, was the site for the 1957 filming of the Warner Brothers movie &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot;, which starred Gene Kelly, Natalie Wood. Carolyn Jones and Ed Wynn. Also featured in the film was Camp Red Wing (though not mentioned by name) on the east side of the lake, from which Wood and Jones depart by canoe at night for their escape to the musical South Winds (Scaroon Manor). Open to the public for many years, the old Scaroon Manor site is now a NY State Campground.

The &quot;Scaroons&quot; is/are mentioned twice in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper, as a place seen by Hawkeye (Natty Bumppo), Chingachgook and Uncas after they had departed Horicon (the name used by Cooper for Lake George) while traveling northward chasing Magua and his two captives, Cora and Alice Munro. It is unclear from the context in the book whether Cooper is referring to the lake or a chain of mountains, the latter being a more likely interpretation.

<text>Ticonderoga () is a town in Essex County, New York, United States. The population was 5,042 at the 2010 census. The name comes from the Mohawk &quot;tekontaró:ken&quot;, meaning &quot;it is at the junction of two waterways&quot;.

The Town of Ticonderoga is in the southeastern corner of the county and is south of Plattsburgh.

==History==

In the 17th century, French explorers such as Samuel de Champlain encountered the area.
The town was on the direct route, utilizing rivers and two long lakes, between New York City to the south and the French settlement of Montreal to the north. The town was the setting for historic battles and maneuvers during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Fort Ticonderoga, constructed by the French, who called it &quot;Fort Carillon&quot;, in the 1750s, marked the location of an important portage between the two lakes, George and Champlain.

The Town of Ticonderoga was formed in 1804 from part of the town of Crown Point. By the end of the 18th century, the town was noted for wood products such as paper and lead pencils. The position of the now former Ticonderoga village at the north end of Lake George made it an important port. The village was dissolved on December 31, 1993, after a public referendum, its operations were absorbed by the Town of Ticonderoga.

As early as 1812, Ticonderoga was the site of graphite mining. Commercial mining of graphite began in 1832, though logging remained the chief Industry. Graphite was not widely used in the 19th century, as most writing was done in pen, rather than pencil. It was not until the mid-20th century that pencils came into greater use, with the No. 2 HB pencil becoming the standard writing implement in schools and universities. The iconic Dixon Ticonderoga pencil was named after the graphite that was mined and processed in Ticonderoga.

Historic Fort Ticonderoga is in this town, east of the former village of Ticonderoga.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.93%, is water.

The eastern town line is the border of Vermont, and the southern town boundary is the county line of Warren and Washington counties.

New York State Route 9N is a north–south highway. Another north–south highway, New York State Route 22, is partly conjoined with NY-9N in the town. New York State Route 74, an east–west highway, intersects NY-9N/NY-22 near Ticonderoga.

<doc id="126448" wikidata="Q3501728" url="?curid=126448" title="Westport, New York">
<text>Westport is a town in Essex County, New York, United States overlooking Lake Champlain. The population was 1,320 at the 2020 census.

The town is on the eastern border of the county and is south of Plattsburgh and south of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Westport is inside the Adirondack Park.

Westport is the birthplace of the Adirondack chair.

The Essex County Fair is held in the town. The Essex County Fairgrounds was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

== History ==
===Early history===
In 1642, Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues was tortured by Iroquois at Coles Bay. He survived and was eventually saved by merchants from New Amsterdam.

The town was founded by William Gilliland in 1764 who surveyed an area in the southern part of the town and was granted ; he also established the neighboring towns of Elizabethtown, named for his wife, and Willsboro. Gilliland originally called his patent &quot;Bessboro&quot; after his little daughter. The original settlement, which may have supplied wood to Benedict Arnold&#x27;s troops, was completely destroyed during the American Revolutionary War in connection with British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s march from Canada to Saratoga. The first permanent settlement was in 1785.

===Incorporation===
The town of Westport was established in 1815 from part of the town of Elizabethtown. The community of Westport in the center of town incorporated as a village in 1907. The community abandoned its status as an incorporated village on December 31, 1992.

===Westport the resort===
By the mid-nineteenth century, Westport was a fashionable resort town. Its social scene was regularly reported on in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and by the Boston press. Like many other East Coast resorts, its popularity gradually declined, starting in the 1930s, as first automobiles and then airplanes made possible a wider selection of vacation sites. Since the 1950s, however, Westport&#x27;s lakeshore property has steadily increased in value. Although once most of the &quot;summer people&quot; stayed for weeks, now distinctions are not as clear: there are &quot;year-round summer people&quot; whose livelihood stems from outside Westport, weekenders whose principal residence is fairly close by (for example, Albany, which is two hours distant by car), and commuters to workplaces as distant as Plattsburgh, New York, or Middlebury, Vermont.

Westport is home to Camp Dudley, the oldest summer camp in continuous operation in the United States, founded in 1885 by Sumner F. Dudley, who moved to Westport in 1891. Meadowmount, the summer school for string players founded by Ivan Galamian, is northwest of the center of town, in the town of Lewis. Westport is known as the ice fishing capital of Essex County.

Westport is home to one of the only two professional theatres in the Adirondacks proper, the second being Pendragon Theatre in Saranac Lake. The Depot Theatre was founded in 1979 and operates out of the historic Amtrak railway station. The 136-seat, air-conditioned theatre hosts plays and musicals on its main stage during the summer months, as well as an annual gala.

The Camp Dudley Road Historic District, &quot;Champlain II&quot; Shipwreck, Essex County Fairgrounds, First Congregational and Presbyterian Society Church of Westport, Lake View Grange No. 970, and &quot;Vergennes&quot; canal boat are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 12.93%, is water.

The eastern town line is formed by Lake Champlain and the border of Vermont. The town is inside the Adirondack Park.

New York State Route 9N, New York State Route 22, and County Route 44 are north-south highways in Westport. NY-9N and NY-22 become conjoined in Westport village. Interstate 87, the Northway, passes across the northwestern part of Westport, with access from Exit 31 (NY-9N).

===Birding===
Several sites on the Lake Champlain Birding Trail are located in Westport:
* Coon Mountain Preserve (administered by The Nature Conservancy)
* Webb Royce Swamp
* Westport Boat Launch

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,362 people, 593 households, and 381 families residing in the town. (Note that since the census excludes summer residents, the figures in this section are for year-round residents only.) The population density was . There were 887 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 97.7% White, 0.2% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.83.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.1% under the age of 18, 3.7% from 18 to 24, 24.5% from 25 to 44, 29.2% from 45 to 64, and 20.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $40,000, and the median income for a family was $49,917. Males had a median income of $31,042 versus $26,550 for females.

==Education==
Westport is served by the Bouquet Valley Central School. The Westport Central School merged with the Elizabethtown-Lewis Central School in 2019; high school students from Westport, Elizabethtown, and Lewis were relocated to the former Elizabethtown-Lewis School building, while elementary students moved into the former Westport campus. The new school district mascot is a Griffin (a combination of the previous two mascots of Lion and Eagle). Westport also has a branch of the Cornell University Cooperative Extension and is the mailing address of the Meadowmount School of Music (see above). Additionally, the Depot Theatre (above) runs a summer apprentice program for children ranging from elementary school to high school age.

==Public transport==

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Westport, operating its &quot;Adirondack&quot; daily in both directions between Montreal and New York City. A bus connection is available from Westport to Lake Placid. The Amtrak station also houses the Depot Theatre.

On August 28, 2006, at approximately 6:45 p.m. local time, a Greyhound bus traveling from New York City to Montreal overturned on the Adirondack Northway in Westport after suffering a blown tire, killing five and injuring 48.

==Access to medical care==
Westport is in a rural area in the Adirondack Park, and so most of its access to medical care is via the ferry operated by Lake Champlain Transportation Company. The nearest emergency department is Elizabethtown Community Hospital, a 25-bed rural hospital to the west, with eight doctors on its active medical staff. About by car to the northeast in Burlington, accessible via ferry, is the emergency department of University of Vermont Medical Center, a large, full-service hospital affiliated with the University of Vermont. During times when the ferry from Essex is not running, the nearest full-service emergency department is at CVPH Medical Center, in Plattsburgh, north of Westport. Slightly closer, though a slower drive over rural roads, is Porter Hospital in Middlebury, Vermont, accessible via the bridge at Crown Point.

Elizabethtown Community Hospital operates a small satellite clinic in Westport.

<text>Willsboro is a town in Essex County, New York, United States, and lies south of the city of Plattsburgh. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 1,905. The town is named after early landowner William Gilliland.

== History ==
During the American Revolution, British troops under John Burgoyne camped on the Bouquet River.

The region was first settled by Europeans in 1765 by William Gilliland. Originally called &quot;Milltown&quot; by its founder (for the sawmill he located on the falls of the Bouquet River, located in the center of the town), it was renamed &quot;Willsborough&quot; (subsequently shortened to &quot;Willsboro&quot;) shortly after the Revolutionary War, in honor of the founder.

The town has always had a thriving agricultural and tourism tradition, though the Industrial Revolution made its mark on the community as well. Through much of its history, Willsboro&#x27;s main employer was a paper mill (which produced the wood pulp used in the manufacture of paper). A blue limestone quarry was also an important industry locally. The stone quarried from this mine was utilized in the construction of the Albany State Capitol and the Brooklyn Bridge. 

One of the noted residents was the paper manufacturer Augustus G. Paine, Jr., who resided in Willsboro for a portion of the year, when he was not in New York, since his large business was located in Willsboro. He commissioned the architect C. P. H. Gilbert to construct the Essex County Bank in 1921. In May 1930, Paine donated a whole library to the town of Willsboro, in memory of his mother, in the sum of $150,000. Both the bank and the library were constructed by Gilbert in the Neoclassical style.

Paine also had Flat Rock Camp, his summer retreat on the shores of Lake Champlain, constructed for his family.

After the Second World War, the paper industry started to decline, and when the paper mill closed in the 1960s the town faced economic difficulties. In order to compensate for the loss, the community relied heavily on tourist dollars, focusing on the scenic landscape, lake frontage, and lush wilderness the area offered visitors. Recently, new industries have moved to the town, most notably a wollastonite mine, curtain and furniture manufacturers, and numerous web-based service companies. Willsboro is also becoming a bedroom community for the city of Plattsburgh to the north.

The Adsit Log House, Abraham Aiken House, Flat Rock Camp, Ligonier Point Historic District, Sheldon–Owens Farm, Willsboro Congregational Church, and The Willsboro School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 41.80%, is water.

The eastern town line, marked by Lake Champlain, is the border of Vermont. The Boquet River enters Lake Champlain in the town, east of Willsboro village.

New York State Route 22 is a north–south highway which passes through Willsboro.

<text>Bellmont is a town in Franklin County, New York, United States. The town is on the eastern border of the county and is southeast of Malone. The population was 1,434 at the 2010 census. The town is named after William Bell, a major landowner in the early history of the town.

== History ==
Due to the slow development of northern New York state, a homestead act was passed by the legislature in 1822 to grant plots of land to settlers. The town had few settlers before that date.

The town of Bellmont was organized in 1833 from the town of Chateaugay. Additional land was attached to Bellmont from Chateaugay in 1838.

Early attempts to extract lumber from the forests met little success due to the high cost of transportation. Mining and smelting iron became a more successful activity until the deposits diminished.

William Bell, who came to Chateaugay Lake around 1783, sold to Samuel C. Drew, of Gilmanton, New Hampshire, who came to the area about 1816 and settled on the west shore of the Lower Lake. Although there were no regular settlers at that time there was a hunter&#x27;s shanty near the site of the present Banner House, and Drew lived in the shanty while clearing the land and building on the west shore.

The first child born to parents of the Chateaugay Lake region was William Henry Drew, born in 1819.

Soon a large number of people followed the Drews from Gilmanton and took up land around the Lower Lake. Smith Bunker located on Bunker Hill about 1820 and gave it his name. Elias Beman, whose brother was a Revolutionary soldier in the army of General Washington, and Enoch Merrill settled on the east side of Bunker Hill, and Paul, his brother, on the west side of the Lake.

Jonathan Bellows, from South Charlestown, New Hampshire, settled here about 1820, being a direct descendant of John Bellows who was registered on the ship &quot;Hopewell&quot; from London in 1635.

At the close of the Papineau Rebellion in 1837, a group of English officers summered with Mr. Bellows on the Lower Lake, marking the probable beginning of the &quot;summer resort&quot; phase of this region. Bellows had a hotel called the Lake House, which by that time had grown to substantial proportions. Among those who came here for recreation purposes were A. F. Tait and Chester Harding, the artists. Here Tait had a studio and painted works such as &quot;Arguing the Point&quot;, in which there is an excellent portrait of Jonathan Bellows. Many of these pictures were lithographed by Currier and Ives. Among other famous guests were Dr. Bethums, a cousin of James Russell Lowell, and Mr. Ashman, chairman of the convention which nominated Abraham Lincoln.

In 1892, the Lake House was purchased by J. S. Kirby who changed the name to &quot;Banner House&quot;. Following his death the place was operated by F. W. Adams.

The first sawmill was built by Gates Hoit in 1828 at the outlet of the lower lake near the present dam. The mill was soon purchased by John B. Jackson, who later erected a larger mill on the west shore.

In 1874, Pope, William &amp; Company built a forge at what was then Moffits. The iron ore was brought down from Lyon Mountain mostly by barges and was of unusual quality. Most of it went into the manufacture of Bessemer steel and was much sought after by steel manufacturers. In 1880 a new company was formed with a capital of $1,500,000. They enlarged the forge to sixteen fires, making the largest &quot;Catalan&quot; forge in the world. This forge and its sixteen fires consumed annually 37,500 cords of wood, which made 1,500,000 bushels of charcoal. This forge operation lasted until 1893.

Among other places where ore was found was one above the hotel owned by Lewis Bellows. He and Edgar Keeler, of Chateaugay, operated a mine back of the hotel for a year and took out about a thousand tons of ore. The mine was finally abandoned owing to the large amount of sulfur found in the ore.

Another mine was located on land owned by Alanson Roberts. He built a separator on Thurber Brook, where he separated some amount of ore. Later another separator was built near Lewis Bellows house, but finally both were abandoned. The shaft of the old Bellows mine still exists and is a point of interest to its present-day tourists.

Chateaugay Lake has always drawn those interested in fishing and hunting; the region abounded in speckled and rainbow trout as well as deer and bear. Among those who came to hunt or fish and built cottages on the lakes were Geraldine Farrar, the singer, as well as Jack Clifford and Evelyn Nesbitt Thaw. Seth Thomas of clock fame built a beautiful cottage with a high tower containing a huge three-sided clock, which could be seen for miles around.

During the early days, long before the advent of automobiles, there was a stage route from Chateaugay to the Banner House landing. From here a small steamer— first the &quot;Adirondack&quot; and later the &quot;Emma&quot;— made regular trips up through the Narrows and around the Upper Lake, stopping at every dock to deliver mail and supplies. The arrival of this little steamer was the high spot in the day&#x27;s activities at all the camps. People felt a personal responsibility in meeting the boat and getting the latest news. The stage that came from Chateaugay was also an &quot;institution&quot;, and Pratt Hill, the driver, was well known throughout the area.

Soon the coming of private launches in large numbers made the regular streamer trips unnecessary, and they were abandoned. Most of the campers then kept boats or launches at the M. S. Bellows boat shop and from there went the rest of the way by water. Soon roads began to improve and again a change in the matter of boats. Campers now took the new road up along the lakeshore and stopped near their camps. This made the need for launches much less, and they soon dwindled in number.

Cottages have so increased that there is almost no unoccupied space on the east side of the lower lake, and shorefront values climb higher and higher each year.

The First Union Protestant Church of Mountain View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

<text>Bombay is a town in Franklin County, New York, United States. The population was 1,357 at the 2010 census. The town was named after a major port city in India, now known as Mumbai, by an early landowner whose wife was from Byculla.

Bombay is in the northwestern part of Franklin County.

== History ==
Bombay is named for the wife of Michael Hogan, an Irish ship captain who grew wealthy in the East India trade. He came to the US in 1805 with his wife, whom Hogan said was an Indian princess.

Hogan bought north of the Adirondack Mountains, including the Town of Bombay, which was named in honour of his wife&#x27;s birthplace. Their son, William Hogan, served as town supervisor, and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1822. In 1829 he was appointed as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County, and in 1830 he was elected to Congress.

Settlement of the town began around 1805. The region was known as Macomb&#x27;s Purchase, related to a massive purchase by a land speculator when New York first put up former Iroquois lands for sale. The town of Bombay was organized from part of the town of Fort Covington in 1833.

In 1877, the town was devastated by a plague of grasshoppers, which consumed more than half of the field crops.

==Geography==
The town is in northwestern Franklin County, approximately south of the Canada–United States border. The town&#x27;s neighbors are the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation to the northwest, the town of Fort Covington to the northeast and east, Bangor at the southeastern corner, Moira to the south, and the town of Brasher in St. Lawrence County to the west.

The St. Regis River, a tributary of the St. Lawrence River, forms the northwestern border of the town. The Little Salmon River meanders from the south to the north through the central part of Bombay.

New York State Route 95 is a north/south route, linking New York State Route 37 in the north at Bradley&#x27;s Corners with the town of Moira in the south, where Route 95 ends at U.S. Route 11. New York State Route 37 is an east/west state highway through Bombay and the Mohawk Reservation, leading west to Massena and east to Fort Covington. New York State Route 37C intersects NY-37 at Hogansburg in the northwestern corner of Bombay and leads south to Helena.

<text>Brighton is a town in Franklin County, New York, United States. The population was 1,435 at the 2010 census. It was named after Brighton, England, by early surveyors in the region.

The town is in the southern part of the county and is inside the Adirondack Park. Paul Smith&#x27;s College is in the community of Paul Smiths, a hamlet of Brighton.

== History ==
The Town of Brighton was set aside from the town of Duane in 1858 when settlers living in southern Duane complained loudly enough about being left out of town business discussions due to the long distance and time involved. James M. Wardner was elected its first supervisor. Apollos &quot;Paul&quot; Smith arrived in 1859 and gradually built up a hotel in the community that bears his name. Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel grew into one of the largest and most well-known, attracting U.S. presidents, governors and other prominent guests.

After Paul Smith&#x27;s death in 1912, it was run by his son, Phelps Smith, until it burned down in 1930. Paul Smith&#x27;s College was established in 1937 after the death of Phelps Smith; it matriculated its first class in 1946. The college now uses the land where the hotel once stood along Lower St. Regis Lake. Also around that time James Wardner had a small hotel on Rainbow Lake.

The hamlet now called Gabriels originated when Alfonzo Rand, William Ricketson, the Dustins, and the Otises cleared virgin forest land and began farming the sandy loam soils in the southern part of the town along the boundary with the Town of Harrietstown near Ricketson Brook and today&#x27;s Split Rock Road. It wasn&#x27;t until the Adirondack &amp; St. Lawrence Railway came in 1892 that Gabriels expanded northward with many settling near the railroad station. Following the arrival of the railroad, the Sisters of Mercy established a tuberculosis sanitorium on the small hill near the rail station in 1897. Around the same time, Muncil&#x27;s sawmill was established on a siding north of the station. Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel immediately started a stage line to the railroad station. When the Sisters of Mercy closed The Gabriels Sanatorium and moved to Lake Placid, the San was sold to Paul Smith&#x27;s College. Still later, it was sold to New York State which converted it into Camp Gabriels, a minimum-security state prison, which closed in 2009.

The Brighton Town Hall was designed and built by Benjamin A. Muncil in 1914. Muncil was a talented local builder who also designed and built Marjorie Merriweather Post&#x27;s Camp Topridge, and White Pine Camp, which was used as a summer White House of US President Calvin Coolidge. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

The village took its name from Brush&#x27;s Mills, which were located on the Little Salmon River. The mills were purchased by Mr. Henry N. Brush in 1835, and the hamlet was officially named &quot;Brushton&quot; on October 1, 1877.

From Frederick Seaver&#x27;s &quot;Historical Sketches of Franklin County, NY&quot; (1918), p. 519:
&quot;The industrial enterprises of Moira were never numerous or large. The community is distinctively agricultural, but with two small unincorporated villages -- Brushton and Moira. Each is a station on the Rutland Railroad, and each is on an improved trunk-line highway. Almost with the first settlement in the town, Appleton Foote, as the agent of Gilchrist and Fowler, erected a saw mill at what is now Brushton, and a grist mill there in the year following, which was displaced by the present stone mill in 1823, built by Robert Watts, and later improved and enlarged by Henry N. Brush.&quot;

And Seaver, p. 518:
&quot;Henry N. Brush located at Brush&#x27;s Mills (now Brushton) in 1835. He was a man of finished education, an engaging public speaker, and a man of strong parts. ... His holdings of land were large, and the business and industrial development of the eastern part of Moira were due largely to his activities. He died in 1872.&quot;

Brush&#x27;s son, Henry Corbin Brush, was born in Brush&#x27;s Mills in 1838 and was the inventor of the Brush Trolling Spoon shallow-running submersible fishing lure.

The town of Constable was founded in 1807 from part of the town of Malone. Its territory was reduced later to form other towns: Fort Covington (1817) and Westville (1829). An early business opportunity involved &quot;line stores&quot;, constructed so part of the shop was in Canada and the other end in the United States, allowing subtle shifting of merchandise across the border without the inconvenience of customs duties.

In June 2015, the town received national attention as David Sweat and Richard Matt, escaped convicts from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, were the subject of a three-week manhunt in the area. Matt was shot and killed in the nearby town of Malone, while Sweat remained on the run until June 28 when he was captured in Constable, two miles away from the Canada–U.S. border.

<doc id="126460" wikidata="Q101730" url="?curid=126460" title="1998 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 1998 FIFA World Cup was the 16th FIFA World Cup, the football world championship for men&#x27;s national teams. The finals tournament was held in France from 10 June to 12 July 1998. The country was chosen as the host nation by FIFA for the second time in the history of the tournament (the first was in 1938), defeating Morocco in the bidding process. It was the ninth time that it was held in Europe. Spanning 32 days, it was the longest World Cup tournament ever held.

Qualification for the finals began in March 1996 and concluded in November 1997. For the first time in the competition, the group stage was expanded from 24 teams to 32, with eight groups of four. 64 matches were played in 10 stadiums in 10 host cities, with the opening match and final staged at the newly built Stade de France in the Parisian commune of Saint-Denis.

The tournament was won by host country France, who beat defending champions Brazil 3–0 in the final. France won their first title, becoming the seventh nation to win a World Cup, and the sixth (after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina) to win the World Cup on home soil. As of 2022, they are the most recent team to win the tournament on home soil. Croatia, Jamaica, Japan and South Africa made their first appearances in the tournament.

== Host selection ==

France was awarded the 1998 World Cup on 2 July 1992 by the executive committee of FIFA during a general meeting in Zürich, Switzerland. They defeated Morocco by 12 votes to 7. Switzerland withdrew, due to being unable to meet FIFA&#x27;s requirements. This made France the third country to host two World Cups, after Mexico and Italy in 1986 and 1990 respectively. France previously hosted the third edition of the World Cup in 1938. England, who hosted the competition in 1966 and won it, were among the original applicants, but later withdrew their application in favour of an ultimately successful bid to host UEFA Euro 1996.

=== Bribery and corruption investigations ===

On 4 June 2015, while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, Chuck Blazer confirmed that he and other members of FIFA&#x27;s executive committee were bribed during the 1998 and 2010 World Cups host selection process. Blazer stated that &quot;we facilitated bribes in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup&quot;. Since France won the selection process it was initially thought the bribery came from its bid committee. It eventually transpired that the bribe payment was from the failed Moroccan bid.

== Qualification ==

The qualification draw for the 1998 World Cup finals took place in the Musée du Louvre, Paris on 12 December 1995. As tournament hosts, France was exempt from the draw as was defending champion Brazil, but it was also France&#x27;s first World Cup since 1986. 174 teams from six confederations participated, 24 more than in the previous round. Fourteen countries qualified from the European zone (in addition to hosts France). Ten were determined after group play – nine group winners and the best second-placed team; the other eight group runners-up were drawn into pairs of four play-off matches with the winners qualifying for the finals as well. CONMEBOL (South America) and CAF (Africa) were each given five spots in the final tournament, while three spots were contested between 30 CONCACAF members in the North and Central America and the Caribbean zone. The winner of the Oceanian zone advanced to an intercontinental play-off against the runner-up of the Asian play-off, determined by the two best second-placed teams.

Four nations qualified for the first time: Croatia, Jamaica, Japan and South Africa. The last team to qualify was Iran by virtue of beating Australia in a two-legged tie on 29 November 1997. It marked their first appearance in the finals since 1978, Chile qualified for the first time since 1982, after serving a ban that saw them miss out on the two previous tournaments. Paraguay and Denmark returned for the first time since 1986. Austria, England, Scotland and Yugoslavia returned after missing out on the 1994 tournament, with the Balkan team now appearing under the name of FR Yugoslavia. Among the teams who failed to qualify were two-time winners Uruguay (for the second successive tournament); Portugal (their last absence as of 2022); Sweden, who finished third in 1994; Russia (who failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 after losing to Italy in the play-off round); and the Republic of Ireland, who had qualified for the previous two tournaments. The highest-ranked team not to qualify was the UEFA Euro 1996 runners-up the Czech Republic (ranked 3rd), while the lowest-ranked team that did qualify was Nigeria (ranked 74th).

As of 2022, this was the last time Austria, Bulgaria, Norway, Romania and Scotland qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the only time Jamaica have qualified.

== Venues ==
France&#x27;s bid to host the World Cup centered on a national stadium with 80,000 seats and nine other stadiums located across the country. When the finals were originally awarded in July 1992, none of the regional club grounds were of a capacity meeting FIFA&#x27;s requirements – namely being able to safely seat 40,000. The proposed national stadium, colloquially referred to as the &#x27;Grand stade&#x27;, met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium&#x27;s location was determined by politics, finance and national symbolism. As Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac successfully negotiated a deal with Prime Minister Édouard Balladur to bring the Stade de France, as it was now called, to the commune of Saint-Denis just north of the capital city. Construction on the stadium started in December 1995 and was completed after 26 months of work in November 1997 at a cost of ₣2.67 billion.

The choice of stadium locations was drafted from an original list of 14 cities. FIFA and CFO monitored the progress and quality of preparations, culminating in the former providing final checks of the grounds weeks before the tournament commenced. Montpellier was the surprise inclusion from the final list of cities because of its low urban hierarchy in comparison to Strasbourg, who boasted a better hierarchy and success from its local football team, having been taken over by a consortium. Montpellier however was considered ambitious by the selecting panel to host World Cup matches. The local city and regional authorities in particular had invested heavily into football the previous two decades and were able to measure economic effects, in terms of jobs as early as in 1997. Some of the venues used for this tournament were also used for the previous World Cup in France in 1938. The Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade Municipal in Toulouse, the Gerland in Lyon, the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux and the Parc des Princes in Paris received the honour of hosting World Cup matches once again in 1998 as they had all done in 1938.

10 stadiums were used for the finals; in addition to nine matches being played at the Stade de France (the most used stadium in the tournament), a further six matches took place in Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s Parc des Princes, bringing Paris&#x27;s total matches hosted to 15. France played four of their seven matches in the national stadium; they also played in the country&#x27;s second and third largest cities, Marseille (hosting 7 total matches) and Lyon (hosting 6 total matches), as well as a Round of 16 knockout match in the northern city of Lens (also hosting 6 total matches). Nantes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Saint-Etienne also hosted 6 matches in total; all of the stadiums used also hosted knockout round matches.

=== Technologies ===
This was the first FIFA World Cup where fourth officials used electronic boards, instead of cardboard.

=== Rule changes ===
This was the first World Cup since the introduction of golden goals, banning of tackles from behind that endanger the safety of an opponent and allowance of three substitutions per game.

== Match officials ==
34 referees and 33 assistants officiated in the 1998 World Cup. As a result of the extension to 32 teams in the finals, there was an increase of 10 referees and 11 officials from the 1994 World Cup.

== Draw ==

The FIFA Organising Committee announced the eight seeded teams on 3 December 1997 at Marseille&#x27;s Stade Vélodrome. The draw was conducted by at the time FIFA general secretary Joseph Blatter and many celebrities helped with the draw such as former players as Franz Beckenbauer, George Weah, Jean-Pierre Papin, Raymond Kopa, Georges Carnus and women&#x27;s football player Mia Hamm.

The historic tradition to seed the hosts (France) and holders (Brazil) was upheld; while the remaining six seeds were granted for the other top7-ranked teams, based on their results obtained in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1, counting in total 60%) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio, counting in total 40%).

For the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots. The eight top-seeded teams were allocated in pot A and would be drawn/selected into the first position of the eight groups playing in the group stage. The remaining 24 unseeded teams were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: Nine European teams in pot B; four Asian teams and three South American teams in pot C; five African teams and three North American teams in pot D.

The general principle was to draw one team from each pot into the eight groups, although with special combined procedures for pot B and pot C, due to comprising more/less than eight teams - but sixteen teams in total. At the same time, the draw also needed to respect the geographical limitation, that each group could not feature more than one team from each confederation, except for the European teams where the limitation was maximum two per group.

* The draw took place at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, and was televised live on 4 December 1997: FIFA World Cup Draw on BBC Sport.
For the first time in history, the draw event took place in a football stadium, with 38,000 spectators and an estimated 1 billion TV viewers. The draw was officiated by FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter. Teams were drawn by football legends Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto Parreira, George Weah and Raymond Kopa.

Organiser Michel Platini, who later became president of UEFA, admitted in 2018 that the draw for the group stage of the competition had been fixed so that France and Brazil were kept apart until the final, telling France Bleu Sport: &quot;We did a bit of trickery. When we were organising the schedule. We did not spend six years organising the World Cup to not do some little shenanigans&quot;.

The statement from Platini referred to the fact that, shortly before the World Cup finals draw took place, the FIFA Organising Committee had met to finalise the draw process. At this meeting, the committee had approved the proposal to assign host nation France to group position C1 and defending champions Brazil to group position A1 ahead of the draw. As the tournament structure was also predetermined so that the winners of Groups A, D, E and H, and the runners-up of Groups B, C, F and G would be kept apart from the group winners of B, C, F and G, and the runners-up of Group A, D, E and H until the final; thus, France and Brazil could avoid meeting each other until the final if both teams finished in the same position in the top two of their respective groups.

Procedure for the draw:
# Pot A was used to draw the remaining six top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, D, E, F, G and H.
# Pot D was used to draw one team to each of the eight groups (drawing in the alphabetic order from A to H).
# Pot B was used to draw one team to each of the eight groups (drawing in the alphabetic order from A to H).
# As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two UEFA teams in each group, the remaining ninth team from Pot B, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the groups containing a top-seeded South American (CONMEBOL) team.
# Pot C was used to draw one team to each of the seven groups with an empty spot (drawing in alphabetical order from A to H). However, as each group could only contain one South American (CONMEBOL) team, the first Asian (AFC) team drawn would not be drawn into a group in alphabetical order, but instead be drawn into the remaining open group with a top-seeded South American (CONMEBOL) team.
# To decide the match schedules, the exact group position number for the un-seeded teams in each group (2, 3 or 4), were also drawn immediately from eight special group bowls, after each respective team had been drawn from pot D, B and C.

===Draw results and group fixtures===
The draw resulted in the following eight groups:







In each group, the teams played three matches, one against each of the other teams. Three points were awarded for each win, while a draw was worth one point. After completion of the group stage, the two teams with the most points in each group would advance to the knockout stage, with each group winner facing the runner-up from one of the other groups in the round of 16. This was a new format for the World Cup, following the expansion from 24 teams in 1994. A total of 64 games were played, including the final and a third-place play-off between the losers of the two semi-finals.

The fixtures for the group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:

== Squads ==

As with the preceding tournament, each team&#x27;s squad for the 1998 World Cup finals consisted of 22 players. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 22-player squad by 1 June 1998.

Out of the 704 players participating in the 1998 World Cup, 447 were signed up with a European club; 90 in Asia, 67 in South America, 61 in Northern and Central America and 37 in Africa. 75 played their club football in England – five more than Italy and Spain. Barcelona of Spain was the club contributing to the most players in the tournament with 13 players on their side.

The average age of all teams was 27 years, 8 months – five months older than the previous tournament. Samuel Eto&#x27;o of Cameroon was the youngest player selected in the competition at 17 years, 3 months, while the oldest was Jim Leighton of Scotland at 39 years, 11 months.

== Group stage ==

&quot;All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2)&quot;

===Group A===

Defending champions Brazil won Group A after only two matches as the nation achieved victories over Scotland (2–1) and Morocco (3–0). Heading into the third game, Brazil had nothing to play for but still started its regulars against Norway, who was looking to upset Brazil once again. Needing a victory, Norway overturned a 1–0 deficit with 7 minutes remaining to defeat Brazil 2–1, with Kjetil Rekdal scoring the winning penalty to send Norway into the knockout stage for the first time.

Norway&#x27;s victory denied Morocco a chance at the Round of 16, despite winning 3–0 against Scotland. It was only Morocco&#x27;s second ever victory at a World Cup, having recorded its first previous win 12 years earlier on 11 June 1986.

Scotland managed only one point, coming in a 1–1 draw against Norway, and failed to get out of the first round for an eighth time in the FIFA World Cup, a record that stands to this date.


----


===Group B===

Italy and Chile progressed to the second round, while Austria failed to win for the first time since 1958 and Cameroon failed to get out of the group stage for the second time in a row.


----


===Group C===

France, the host nation, swept Group C when the start of their path to their first FIFA World Cup trophy culminated with their 2–1 win over Denmark, who despite their loss, progressed to the second round. Saudi Arabia, after a good performance four years earlier, finished bottom with only one point. Debutant South Africa grabbed two points and also exited at the group stage.


----


===Group D===

Nigeria and Paraguay advanced to the Round of 16 after a surprise elimination of top seed Spain, while Bulgaria failed to repeat their surprise performance from the previous tournament.


----


===Group E===

The Netherlands and Mexico advanced with the same record, with the former placing first on goal difference. Belgium and eventual 2002 FIFA World Cup co-hosts South Korea failed to advance.


----


===Group F===

Germany and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia advanced, each with 7 points (Germany took 1st through goal differential tiebreak). Iran and 1994 host United States failed to advance.





===Group G===

Romania topped the group over England, while Colombia and Tunisia were unable to reach the last 16, despite Colombia having one win.


----


===Group H===

Argentina finished at the top of Group H against three debutants. Croatia took the runners-up spot while Jamaica and Japan failed to advance.


----


== Knockout stage ==

The knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by 30 minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shoot-out to determine who progressed to the next round. The Golden goal rule was also used, whereby if a team scored during extra time, they would immediately win the game.

=== Semi-finals ===


=== Third place play-off ===
Croatia beat the Netherlands to earn third place in the competition. Davor Šuker scored the winner in the 36th minute to secure the golden boot.
=== Final ===

The final was held on 12 July 1998 at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. France defeated holders Brazil 3–0, with two goals from Zinedine Zidane and a stoppage time strike from Emmanuel Petit. The win gave France their first World Cup title, becoming the sixth national team after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina to win the tournament on their home soil. They also inflicted the second-heaviest World Cup defeat on Brazil, later to be topped by Brazil&#x27;s 7–1 defeat by Germany in the semi-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The pre-match build up was dominated by the omission of Brazilian striker Ronaldo from the starting lineup only to be reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off. He managed to create the first open chance for Brazil in the 22nd minute, dribbling past defender Thuram before sending a cross out on the left side that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez struggled to hold onto. France however took the lead after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner from which Zidane scored via a header. Three minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.

French president Jacques Chirac was in attendance to congratulate the winners and commiserate the runners-up after the match. Several days after the victory, winning manager Aimé Jacquet announced his resignation from the French team with immediate effect.

=== All-star team ===
The All-star team is a squad consisting of the 16 most impressive players at the 1998 World Cup, as selected by FIFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group.

=== Final standings ===
After the tournament, FIFA published a ranking of all teams that competed in the 1998 World Cup finals based on progress in the competition and overall results.

== Marketing ==
=== Tournoi de France ===

A year before the tournament, a small, invitation-only tournament named the Tournoi de France was held in France, with Italy, Brazil, England, and hosts France participating.
===Broadcasting===

Through several companies, FIFA sold the broadcasting rights for the 1998 FIFA World Cup to many broadcasters. BBC and ITV had the broadcasting rights in the United Kingdom. The pictures and audio of the competition were supplied to the TV and radio channels by the company TVRS 98, the broadcaster of the tournament.

The World Cup matches were broadcast in 200 countries. 818 photographers were credited for the tournament. In every match, a stand was reserved for the press. The number of places granted to them reached its maximum in the final, when 1,750 reporters and 110 TV commentators were present in the stand.

=== Sponsorship ===

The sponsors of the 1998 FIFA World Cup are divided into two categories: FIFA World Cup Sponsors and France Supporters.

The absence of Budweiser on pitch side advertising hoardings is notable due to the Evin law, which forbids alcohol-related sponsorship in France, including in sports events.

=== Video games ===
In most of the world, the official video game was, &quot;World Cup 98&quot; released by EA Sports on 13 March 1998 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and the Game Boy. It was the first international football game developed by Electronic Arts since obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997 and received mostly favourable reviews.

In Japan, Konami was granted the FIFA World Cup licence and produced two distinct video games: &quot;Jikkyou World Soccer: World Cup France 98&quot; by KCEO for the Nintendo 64, and &quot;World Soccer Jikkyou Winning Eleven 3: World Cup France &#x27;98&quot; by KCET for the PlayStation. These games were released in the rest of the world as &quot;International Superstar Soccer &#x27;98&quot; and &quot;International Superstar Soccer Pro &#x27;98&quot;, without the official FIFA World Cup licence, branding or real player names.

Also in Japan, Sega was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the Saturn video game &quot;World Cup &#x27;98 France: Road to Win&quot;.

Many other video games, including &quot;World League Soccer 98&quot;, &quot;Actua Soccer 2&quot; and &quot;Neo Geo Cup &#x27;98: The Road to the Victory&quot; were released in the buildup to the 1998 World Cup and evidently were based on the tournament. &quot;&quot;, also by EA Sports focused on the qualification stage.

== Symbols ==
=== Mascot ===
The official mascot was &quot;Footix&quot;, a rooster first presented in May 1996. It was created by graphic designer Fabrice Pialot and selected from a shortlist of five mascots. Research carried out about the choice of having a cockerel as a mascot was greatly received: 91% associated it immediately with France, the traditional symbol of the nation. Footix, the name chosen by French television viewers, is a portmanteau of &quot;football&quot; and the ending &quot;-ix&quot; from the popular &quot;Astérix&quot; comic strip. The mascot&#x27;s colours reflect those of the host nation&#x27;s flag and home strip – blue for the jump suit, a red crest and with the words &#x27;France 98&#x27; coloured in white.

=== Match ball ===

The official match ball for the 1998 World Cup, manufactured by Adidas was named the &quot;Tricolore&quot;, meaning &#x27;three-coloured&#x27; in French. It was the eighth World Cup match ball made for the tournament by the German company and was the first in the series to be multi-coloured. The tricolour flag and cockerel, traditional symbols of France, were used as inspiration for the design.

=== Music ===

The official song of the 1998 FIFA World Cup was &quot;The Cup of Life&quot;, also known as &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot;, recorded by Ricky Martin.

The official anthem was &quot;La Cour des Grands (Do You Mind If I Play)&quot; by Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Axelle Red.

== Legacy ==
Honorary FIFA President João Havelange praised France&#x27;s hosting of the World Cup, describing the tournament as one that would &quot;remain with me forever, as I am sure they will remain with everyone who witnessed this unforgettable competition&quot;. Lennart Johansson, the chairman of the organising committee for the World Cup and President of UEFA added that France provided &quot;subject matter of a quality that made the world hold its breath&quot;.

Cour des Comptes, the quasi-judicial body of the French government, released its report on the organisation of the 1998 World Cup in 2000.
