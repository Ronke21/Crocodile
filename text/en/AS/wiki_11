<text>The Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the pioneers of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. The group was founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, by vocalist, songwriter and keyboardist Glenn Danzig. Over the next six years, Danzig and bassist Jerry Only were the group&#x27;s main members through numerous personnel changes. During this period, they released several EPs and singles, and with Only&#x27;s brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; (1982) and &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood&quot; (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. The band has undergone many lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the group&#x27;s only constant member.

The Misfits disbanded in 1983, and Glenn Danzig went on to form Samhain and then Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group&#x27;s dissolution, and their music later became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, hard rock, and alternative rock, including high-profile acts such as Metallica, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Marilyn Manson, Green Day, NOFX, AFI, Avenged Sevenfold and My Chemical Romance. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had more of a heavy metal sound, and released the albums &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1997) and &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour.

This lineup released an album of cover songs in 2003, titled &quot;Project 1950&quot;, and toured for several years. In 2005, Marky was replaced by Robo, who had been Misfits&#x27; drummer from 1982 to 1983 and also played with Black Flag. This lineup released a single titled &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; in 2009. The Misfits&#x27; lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric &quot;Chupacabra&quot; Arce released a new album titled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot; in October 2011. In 2015, it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only&#x27;s son Jerry Caiafa II, presented as Jerry Other. That same year Soulfly&#x27;s Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar. He filled in for Cadena, before Caiafa would become the sole guitarist for the band.

In September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only, and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows as the Original Misfits at that year&#x27;s edition of Riot Fest, along with drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade. The Original Misfits lineup has continued performing sporadically.

==History==
===1977–1978: Formation and &quot;Static Age&quot;===
The Misfits were formed in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, by Glenn Danzig, who had previous experience performing in local cover bands. The band was named after actress Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961). Danzig&#x27;s first recruit to the Misfits was drummer Mr. Jim and bassist Diane DiPiazza, however, DiPiazza never showed up. Mr. Jim was replaced by Manny Martinez shortly after. The two practiced in Martínez&#x27;s garage, with Danzig on electric piano and Martínez on drums. The duo soon encountered Jerry Caiafa, who was dating a neighbor of Martínez&#x27;s and had just received a bass guitar for Christmas. Although he was still new to the instrument, he joined the band; Caiafa and Danzig would remain the only consistent members of the Misfits until the group&#x27;s dissolution in 1983.

Danzig, Martínez, and Caiafa rehearsed for three months without a guitarist, using Danzig&#x27;s electric piano to provide the songs&#x27; rhythm. The band played their first performance at CBGB in New York City in April 1977, followed by other local performances over the following months. In May that year, they recorded their first single, &quot;Cough/Cool&quot;, which they released through their own label Blank Records that August. Caiafa&#x27;s surname was misspelled on the record&#x27;s sleeve, prompting him to insist that in the future he be credited as &quot;Jerry, only Jerry&quot;. &quot;Jerry Only&quot; became his pseudonym for the rest of his career.

In August 1977, guitarist Frank Licata joined the band under the pseudonym Franché Coma, allowing Danzig to phase out the electric piano and focus on singing while pushing the band&#x27;s sound in a punk rock direction. Danzig and Only deemed Martínez unreliable and was replaced by Mr. Jim. The band found a recording opportunity when Mercury Records wished to use the name Blank Records for one of its subdivisions and offered Danzig thirty hours of studio time in exchange for rights to the name. Danzig accepted, and in January 1978 the Misfits entered a New York recording studio to record 17 songs, 14 of which were mixed for the proposed &quot;Static Age&quot; album. The band were unable to find a record label interested in releasing it, so they released four of the songs in June 1978 as the &quot;Bullet&quot; single on their own label Plan 9 Records, named after the 1959 science fiction horror film &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. The other songs would see release on various compilation albums throughout the 1980s and 90s, but &quot;Static Age&quot; was not released in its entirety until 1996.

===1978–1981: Singles and early tours===

Following the &quot;Static Age&quot; sessions, the Misfits began a shift in songwriting and appearance, with Danzig writing more songs inspired by B horror and science fiction films. He painted skeletal patterns on his performance clothing, while Only began applying dark makeup around his eyes and styling his hair in a long point hanging from his forehead between his eyes and down to his chin, a style that became known as a &quot;devilock&quot; and which both Danzig and Only&#x27;s brother Doyle would eventually adopt. This new style and musical direction would later be described as the subgenre &quot;horror punk&quot;.

The band performed more frequently and embarked on short tours in support of the &quot;Bullet&quot; single. While in Canada in October 1978 Coma quit the band because he did not enjoy touring, and guitarist Rick Riley filled in temporarily to finish the tour. Mr. Jim also quit following the tour, citing a distaste for the horror direction in which the band was heading. Within two months the pair were replaced by drummer Joey Poole, under the pseudonym Joey Image, and guitarist Robert Kaufhold, also known as Bobby Steele. The new lineup of Danzig, Only, Image, and Steele began performing in December 1978 and continued to evolve the horror elements of the band. They released the &quot;Horror Business&quot; single in June 1979, the cover of which featured a skeletal figure inspired by a poster for the 1946 film serial &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot;.
The figure became a mascot for the band, and its skull image would serve as the Misfits&#x27; logo for the rest of their career. The band also launched a fan club named the &quot;Fiend Club&quot; which Danzig operated in a do-it-yourself fashion from his mother&#x27;s basement in Lodi, silkscreening T-shirts, assembling records, mailing merchandise catalogs, booking shows for the band, and answering fan mail.

In June 1979, the Misfits performed as openers for The Damned in New York City. Only spoke with singer Dave Vanian about the possibility of the Misfits touring the United Kingdom with The Damned. That November the band released the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; single and flew to England to tour with The Damned. Upon arriving there, however, they learned that Vanian had not taken his conversation with Only seriously and had not planned on having the Misfits on the tour. Vanian attempted to arrange for the Misfits to take part in the tour, but the band members were unhappy with the situation and left the tour after only two shows. Image then quit the band and flew back to the United States. With their return flight not scheduled until late December, the remaining band members stayed in London. Only spent time with Sid Vicious&#x27; mother, Anne Ritchie, whom he had befriended after Vicious&#x27; death in February 1979. Danzig and Steele got into a fight with skinheads while waiting to see The Jam, were arrested, and spent two nights in jail in Brixton. This experience inspired the later song &quot;London Dungeon&quot;. Although in an interview on podcast San Clemente Punk, Bobby Steele tells a completely different version of the events.

Upon their return to the United States the Misfits released the &quot;Beware&quot; EP in January 1980, then took a four-month break before adding Arthur McGuckin as their new drummer under the pseudonym Arthur Googy. During this time Only&#x27;s younger brother Paul Caiafa, a longtime fan of the band who went by the nickname Doyle, began learning to play guitar with help from Danzig and Only. The Misfits began working on an album which they planned to release through their Plan 9 label, recording twelve songs in a studio in August 1980. Doyle practiced with the band and loaned the band his gear for recording. That October Steele was ejected from the band, when Steele no-showed a scheduled recording session, in favor of the sixteen-year-old Doyle. Steele went on to form The Undead, while Doyle made his debut with the Misfits at their annual Halloween performance at Irving Plaza in New York City. After several more performances, the band took another hiatus for six months.

After reconvening, the band selected three of the twelve songs from their August 1980 album sessions and released them as &quot;3 Hits From Hell&quot; in April 1981. Throughout the rest of 1981 they continued to record tracks for a full-length album, to be titled &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;. They had planned to release it through Plan 9 but instead accepted an offer from Slash Records, deciding to rework the album before its release. In October 1981 they released two more tracks from the August 1980 sessions as the &quot;Halloween&quot; single. On November 20 they recorded a performance at Broadway in San Francisco.

Black Flag were also performing that night at the Mabuhay Gardens downstairs on Broadway, and Black Flag singer Henry Rollins, a longtime fan of the band, came up to watch the Misfits&#x27; soundcheck. He stayed to watch the band&#x27;s set and sang guest vocals on &quot;We Are 138&quot;. The two bands crossed paths again on Christmas in Lodi, where Black Flag wound up playing as the opening band for the Necros and the Misfits.

===1982–1983: Albums and dissolution===

&quot;Walk Among Us&quot; was released in March 1982 through Ruby and Slash Records. It was the first full-length Misfits album to be properly released, and the only album to be released while the early incarnation of the band was still active. A national tour in support of the album followed, and the band&#x27;s performances began to grow more intense and violent. Danzig and Googy clashed frequently during the tour, and after a heated argument at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant Danzig kicked Googy out of the band, delaying their plans to record their next EP. They offered the vacant drummer position to their friend Eerie Von, who had served as their occasional roadie and photographer, but he had already committed to drumming for Rosemary&#x27;s Babies. Henry Rollins recommended former Black Flag drummer Robo, who flew to New Jersey to join the Misfits in July 1982. Doyle graduated from high school and he and Only began working full-time at their father&#x27;s machine shop, earning money to purchase new instruments, fund the band&#x27;s tours, and press records, while Danzig ran the Fiend Club and continued writing new songs.

In September 1982 the Misfits embarked on a national tour, with the Necros as their opening act. During the tour they stopped at a studio to record the instrumental tracks for their next EP. They were arrested in New Orleans on charges of grave robbing while attempting to locate the grave of voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau, but bailed themselves out of jail and skipped their court date to drive to their next performance in Florida. Following the tour they released seven songs from the November 1981 performance in San Francisco in limited numbers only to members of the Fiend Club as the &quot;Evilive&quot; EP.

By this time Danzig was growing increasingly dissatisfied with the Misfits and had begun writings songs for a new band project. In June 1983 he confided to Henry Rollins that he planned to quit the group. In July 1983 the Misfits finished recording their EP, and Danzig decided to record two more songs that he had intended for his new project, turning it into a full album. &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood&quot; demonstrated the increased influence of hardcore punk and heavy metal on the band, though they would break up just two months before it was released. After a series of arguments with Danzig, Robo left the band in August and Danzig became further disenchanted, beginning to audition musicians for his next project.

On October 29, 1983, the Misfits played their annual Halloween performance at Greystone Hall in Detroit with the Necros. Danzig had selected Brian Damage (real name Brian Keats), formerly of Genöcide and Verbal Abuse, as the band&#x27;s new drummer. However, Damage became drunk before the show and could not play properly. After several songs Doyle escorted him off the stage and Todd Swalla of &quot;The Necros&quot; filled in for the remainder of the performance. Tensions came to a head and Danzig announced to the audience that it would be the band&#x27;s final show. Upon returning to Lodi the band members went their separate ways.

===1984–1995: New projects and legal battles===
Following the breakup of the Misfits, Danzig launched his new band Samhain, moving away from punk rock, and toward more experimental heavy metal with a grim atmosphere. Several Misfits songs were rerecorded for Samhain albums, including &quot;Horror Business&quot; (as &quot;Horror Biz&quot;), &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot; (as &quot;All Hell&quot;), and &quot;Halloween II&quot;. In 1986, the band signed to a major record label and Danzig replaced most of the rhythm section, renaming the group Danzig. He continues to front Danzig, who have released ten albums ranging in style from blues rock-influenced heavy metal to industrial rock, and has also released two solo albums.

Jerry Only and Doyle, meanwhile, moved to Vernon, New Jersey to work at their father&#x27;s machine parts factory full-time. Jerry Only had married and had a daughter and became more serious about his Christian faith, regretting some of the things he had done with the Misfits. In 1987, he and Doyle formed the short-lived Kryst the Conqueror, a Christian heavy metal band with barbarian imagery.

Although the Misfits&#x27; popularity did not extend beyond the underground punk scene during their six years of activity, public interest in the band increased in the years following their breakup. The success of Danzig&#x27;s post-Misfits&#x27; work led to interest in his past work, and several high-profile rock bands professed fondness for the Misfits. Most notably, Metallica covered the Misfits songs &quot;Last Caress&quot; and &quot;Green Hell&quot; on &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; (1987), and Guns N&#x27; Roses covered &quot;Attitude&quot; on &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; (1993). Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased Misfits material were issued between 1985 and 1987, the first being the compilation album &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot; (1985) which included many of the songs from the unreleased &quot;Static Age&quot; album. Danzig overdubbed many of the album&#x27;s instrument tracks to avoid having to pay royalties to the other former band members. &quot;Misfits&quot;, more commonly referred to as &quot;Collection I&quot;, followed in 1986. The &quot;Evilive&quot; EP was reissued as a full album in 1987 with five additional tracks.

Only contacted Danzig about receiving a portion of the royalties from these albums&#x27; sales, beginning a legal battle that lasted several years and involved other past members of the band. All of the Misfits material had been credited to Danzig, and though Only later conceded that Danzig had written nearly all of the lyrics and most of the music, he contended that he and Doyle &quot;wrote 25% or maybe 30% of the music&quot; and deserved compensation. Danzig, however, insisted that he had written all of the songs in their entirety and that the other members&#x27; creative input had been minimal. Eventually Only ceased his pursuit of songwriting credits and sought the rights to use the Misfits name and imagery, including the now-famous &quot;Crimson Ghost&quot; skull face logo.

In 1995, the parties reached an out-of-court settlement that allowed Only and Doyle to record and perform as the Misfits, sharing merchandising rights with Danzig. &quot;Collection II&quot;, a third compilation of Misfits songs, was released later that year.

===1995–2000: Reformation and new lineup===

Only and Doyle immediately set about reforming the Misfits, bringing in drummer David Calabrese, also known as Dr. Chud, who had worked with them in Kryst the Conqueror. Glenn Danzig refused to return as the band&#x27;s lead singer. Dave Vanian of The Damned was also approached but declined. The band, now reformed with one original founding member, Jerry Only, held open auditions for a new vocalist. Nineteen-year-old singer Michael Emanuel had recently recorded a demo tape in hopes of starting a music career, and the owner of the recording studio suggested that he audition for the Misfits. Being unfamiliar with the band, Emanuel listened to &quot;Collection I&quot; on a walkman to learn the lyrics and melodies while working his job as a greenskeeper. He impressed the band with his audition and was accepted as the new lead singer under the pseudonym Michale Graves, while Doyle adopted the new stage full name Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The new lineup made an appearance in the 1995 film &quot;Animal Room&quot;.

In 1996, The Misfits coffin box set was released, containing nearly all of the band&#x27;s Danzig-era material recorded from 1977 to 1983 (with the exception of &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;). The set included the incomplete fourteen-song &quot;Static Age&quot; album, released for the first time in its entirety on CD, as well as the overdubbed and alternate versions of songs that had previously been released on &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot;, &quot;Collection I&quot;, and &quot;Collection II&quot;. &quot;Static Age&quot; was also released as a separate album the following year, including all seventeen tracks that had been recorded during the January 1978 sessions. The release of the box set and &quot;Static Age&quot; made the Misfits&#x27; complete early catalog widely available for the first time.

A tribute album was also released in 1997 titled &quot;Violent World: A Tribute to the Misfits&quot;, featuring numerous punk rock and hardcore bands covering their songs. Another tribute album, &quot;Hell on Earth: A Tribute to the Misfits&quot;, was released in 2000 featuring death metal, hard rock, and gothic rock acts.

The new incarnation of the Misfits released their debut album &quot;American Psycho&quot; in 1997. They filmed music videos for the songs &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Dig Up Her Bones&quot;. The band toured Europe and North America in support of the album and appeared as characters in World Championship Wrestling as tag team for wrestler Ian &quot;Vampiro&quot; Hodgkinson. Graves took a hiatus from the band in 1998, during which Myke Itzazone of Empire Hideous filled in as singer during tours of South America and Europe. After Graves&#x27; return the band signed to Roadrunner Records, releasing &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; in October 1999 and filming a music video for the single &quot;Scream!&quot; They made additional film appearances in &quot;Big Money Hustlas&quot; (2000), &quot;Bruiser&quot; (2000), and &quot;Campfire Stories&quot; (2001) and continued to tour, but tensions between the band members began to grow. During a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando, Florida on October 25, 2000, Graves and Chud both quit the band and walked off stage. The two later released an album under the name Graves before splitting up; Graves went on to sing for Gotham Road and then launched a solo career, while Chud formed Dr. Chud&#x27;s X-Ward. Meanwhile, Doyle took an indefinite hiatus from performing as he divorced, remarried, had a fourth child, and dealt with tendonitis in his elbow.

===2001–2008: 25th anniversary and all-star lineup===
As the sole remaining founding member of the Misfits, Jerry Only took over lead vocal duties in addition to playing bass guitar and recruited veteran musicians Dez Cadena, former guitarist of Black Flag, an idea Doyle was not fond of, leading him to quit. Also Marky Ramone, former drummer of the Ramones, joined for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour which lasted intermittently for nearly three years. Former Black Flag and Misfits drummer Robo filled in for Ramone during some stretches of the tour. Only released &quot;Cuts from the Crypt&quot; in 2001, a compilation of demos and rarities covering the band&#x27;s period with Graves and Chud from 1995 to 2001. This fulfilled the band&#x27;s contractual obligations to Roadrunner Records, whom Only had grown dissatisfied with.

Also in 2001 Caroline Records announced that they would release recordings from the Misfits&#x27; August 1980 album sessions as &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot;. However, both Only and Glenn Danzig abruptly called off production of the album, citing concerns with the mixing, mastering, layout, and packaging.

Only and longtime collaborator John Cafiero soon launched their own label, Misfits Records, and released a split single featuring the Misfits and Japanese horror punk band Balzac. The Only/Cadena/Ramone lineup of the Misfits released the covers album &quot;Project 1950&quot; in 2003, performing renditions of classic rock and roll songs from the 1950s and 1960s. The album featured guest appearances from Ronnie Spector, Jimmy Destri, Ed Manion, and John Cafiero. The band toured intermittently in support of the album until 2005, when Ramone left the band and was replaced by Robo. They booked a full European tour that year, but problems with Robo&#x27;s visa led to the cancellation of all dates in the United Kingdom. A rescheduled UK tour followed in September.
Doyle had meanwhile reunited with Glenn Danzig, joining Danzig onstage during performances in December 2004 to play guitar for 30-minute sets of old Misfits songs midway through the band&#x27;s setlist. It was the first time the two had performed together in over twenty years, and the first time Doyle had performed since his hiatus. Danzig called the performances &quot;the closest thing to a Misfits reunion anyone is ever going to see&quot;. These sets featuring Doyle continued through Danzig&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Blackest of the Black&quot; tour and 2006 Australian tour. Glenn Danzig had announced his intention to retire from touring following these, though he later contradicted this by announcing a Danzig 20th anniversary tour in 2008. In 2007, he produced Doyle&#x27;s new project Gorgeous Frankenstein. Doyle later indicated that plans had been in place for the Misfits to reunite with Glenn Danzig beginning in 2002, but that Jerry Only and his manager had &quot;put a fuckin&#x27; monkey wrench in it.&quot;

===2009–2015: 30th anniversary and new albums===
In 2009 and 2010, the Misfits performed an extended 30th anniversary world tour. A new single, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; was released October 27, 2009, marking the band&#x27;s first release of new studio material in six years and the only release by the lineup of Only, Cadena, and Robo. Robo was dismissed from the band in 2010, with Only explaining that ongoing problems with his Colombian passport inhibited the band&#x27;s ability to tour consistently. He was replaced by Eric &quot;Chupacabra&quot; Arce of Murphy&#x27;s Law, who had previously filled in with the band for tours in 2000 and 2001. The Only/Cadena/Arce lineup released a new album, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot;, recorded with producer Ed Stasium and titled after the 1975 film starring William Shatner. The album was released on October 4, 2011. During the latter quarter of 2011, former vocalist Danzig and guitarist Doyle performed Misfits songs on four occasions as part of the Danzig &quot;Legacy&quot; tour. The first of the four shows, which took place on October 7 in Chicago, saw a sold-out crowd.

In 2013, the Misfits released their third live album, &quot;Dead Alive!&quot;. In October, they released a 12&quot; single fronted by a new recording of &quot;Descending Angel&quot;, backed by a cover of &quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature&quot;, a song they previously only played live. Meanwhile, Danzig and Doyle continued to regularly play Misfits songs and included a set on Danzig&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour. In October 2013, publisher Rowman &amp; Littlefield published &quot;This Music Leaves Stains&quot; by James Greene, an unofficial Misfits biography, which tells the story of each incarnation of the band as well as spin-off projects such as Samhain and Danzig. In late 2015, the Misfits released the songs &quot;Vampire Girl&quot; and &quot;Zombie Girl&quot; as a single.

===2016–present: Reunion as the Original Misfits===
In May 2016, Danzig, Only, and Doyle announced that they would perform together for the first time in 33 years, under the name The Original Misfits. Only told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the reunion stemmed from a legal discussion that &quot;was turning into another court battle and it turned into a reunion.&quot; Court documents show that Danzig and Only discussed a reunion as part of settlement negotiations as early as 2014. In June of that year, the Misfits released the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; EP featuring material written by Only with his son Jerry Other on guitar and Chupacabra on drums. In September the Misfits lineup of Danzig, Only and Doyle, along with guitarist Acey Slade and drummer Dave Lombardo, headlined their two reunion shows, performing 25-song sets at the Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; following the first reunion show Only was asked about the future of the Misfits, and if there were plans to continue and possibly record new music. &quot;I want it to continue. I know Doyle wants it to continue. I know Glenn wants it to continue. We just have to be big-enough people to make it continue. And that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at. Whatever it takes. We&#x27;re going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn&#x27;t be more perfect. Eventually Doyle&#x27;s got to write a new album; I&#x27;ve got to write a new album; Glenn&#x27;s got to write a new album. Why don&#x27;t we work together and make the greatest album ever? Now we&#x27;ve got different elements. We&#x27;ve got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We&#x27;ve got Dave, who we&#x27;re trying to figure out what the fuck he&#x27;s doing. And Glenn&#x27;s got his own thing. And Acey (Slade, second guitar) fills in good, too. And I&#x27;ve got the band where it is today. So it&#x27;s a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I&#x27;ve got.&quot; When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s got to evolve naturally. The thing is we&#x27;ve tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we&#x27;ll just do it. When we go back – I don&#x27;t know about Glenn – but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I&#x27;m going to go home and write and lift.&quot;

In December 2017, the reunited lineup performed two concerts at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and The Forum in Inglewood, California. In 2018, the band played at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey and in 2019 at the Allstate Arena in suburban Chicago. In a June 2019 interview, Danzig indicated that the reunion period might be drawing to a close, saying that, &quot;We&#x27;re not gonna do many more.&quot; The news from Danzig came on the heels of an in-depth article from MetalSucks analyzing legal documents related to the original reunion planning that revealed other details, including the statement, &quot;The parties agree to perform no fewer than ten Misfits reunion shows to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the band.&quot; Despite Danzig&#x27;s pessimism, it was announced that same month that the Original Misfits would be replacing Megadeth at the Psycho Las Vegas event in August due to Dave Mustaine&#x27;s throat cancer diagnosis. Following the Las Vegas show, the reunited lineup was booked for concerts at the Fiddler&#x27;s Green Amphitheatre in Greenwood Village, Colorado, at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, at Seattle&#x27;s White River Amphitheatre, at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, at Philadelphia&#x27;s Wells Fargo Center and at Discovery Park in Sacramento.

In May 2021, it was announced that the Original Misfits would play Riot Fest as co-headliners with My Chemical Romance alongside Nine Inch Nails.

In August 2022, they announced an Original Misfits lineup would perform its second headlining show of 2022 on Halloween weekend in Dallas, at Dos Equis Pavilion on October 29, with special guests Alice Cooper and FEAR.

Former Misfits drummer Manny Martinez died on December 16, 2023, aged 69.

In November 2024, it was announced that the Original Misfits will perform at Coachella on April 12 and April 19, 2025. The band was listed on the official tour poster with their original font logo. 

==Style==
Each incarnation of the Misfits has made use of horror film and science fiction film-inspired themes and imagery, with makeup, clothing, artwork, and lyrics drawn from B movies and television serials, many from the 1950s through 1970s. Musically the band are often recognized as progenitors of the horror punk and psychobilly subgenres and have drawn from punk rock, heavy metal, and 1950s rock and roll and rockabilly to inform their style. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describes them as &quot;the archetypal horror-punk band of the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s&quot;, and they are considered icons in punk music and culture.

The early incarnations of the Misfits are associated with the hardcore punk movement of the early 1980s, though &quot;American Hardcore: A Tribal History&quot; author Steven Blush notes that &quot;though crucial to the rise of hardcore, [they] were in fact in a league of their own...The Misfits delivered a hyper-yet-melodic assault based in 50/60s-style rock, taking the Buddy Holly/Gene Vincent foundation and making it nuclear.&quot; Jon de Rosa of Pitchfork Media describes how the band&#x27;s sound was different from the punk rock coming out of New York at the time: &quot;New York punk was just punk, simple and static. When Glenn started the Misfits, he mutated the punk sound and image into something darker and more sinister, a punk-metal hybrid that later found bloom in the quiet, boring suburbs of Oslo and the boggy backwaters surrounding Tampa. Punk belonged to the media/celebrity hubs of London and New York. Ghoul rock was for the kids in the suburbs where nothing ever happens&quot;.

Andy Weller of the Necros recalls the band&#x27;s transition from traditional punk rock in the late 1970s to hardcore in the early 1980s: &quot;(You) could hear it on the records. It went from this Ramones-type stuff, to nine months later, where they put out records that were so fast it&#x27;s unreal.&quot; By the recording of &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood&quot; the band were playing faster, more aggressive material. According to Blush, &quot;The Misfits&#x27; strengths as a hardcore group lay in non-[hardcore] attributes–melodic songs and larger-than-life-aura–but by the time of &quot;Earth AD&quot; Glenn was writing hyperspeed blasts that sounded very standard.&quot;
The new version of the Misfits launched by Jerry Only and Doyle in the 1990s had a style that was a little different from older Misfits songs. Reviewing &quot;American Psycho&quot;, Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic called the new incarnation &quot;a kitschy goth-punk outfit that relies more on metal than hardcore&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that the band&#x27;s new style blended &quot;some old-style punk, a little metal and an occasional all-out thrasher.&quot; Greg Prato, reviewing the 2001 album &quot;Cuts from the Crypt&quot;, noted that &quot;the latter-day Misfits are much more heavy metal based than in their earlier work – as their punk roots have all but been erased.&quot; The Misfits have also been described as pop punk.

===Devillock===
The devilock is a hairstyle created by Misfits in the late 1970s. In a devilock, the sides and back of the hair are kept short, while the front is kept long and combed forward.

In an early 1980s interview, Jerry Only claimed that the devilock was based on a &quot;tidal wave&quot; hairstyle seen among the 1970s skateboarding communities. In the same interview, former Misfits vocalist Glenn Danzig explains that his version of the hairstyle developed from an imitation of Eddie Munster&#x27;s hairstyle. A style similar to the Devilock was sported earlier - for instance the elephant trunk hairstyle of the 1950s, the Surfari&#x27;s cover picture of &#x27;Gum-dipped Slicks&#x27; (1964) shows a member of the band with a devilock-like quiff, as did the guitarist from the contemporaneous Tornadoes of Bustin&#x27; Surfboards fame.

<text>Liverpool is a lakeside village in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,242. The name was adopted from the city of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. The village is on Onondaga Lake, in the western part of the town of Salina and is northwest of Syracuse, of which it is a suburb.

== History ==

The area was originally inhabited by the Iroquois, starting in the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, Canadian French Jesuits visited the area, setting up missions. These were not permanent, however. An example of these missions is Sainte Marie among the Iroquois, on Onondaga Lake just outside the village. Once the (Erie Canal) and (Oswego Canal) were built, the area was settled by Irish canal workers, Yankee settlers, and, later, German immigrants. The early recorded name for the village was &quot;Little Ireland&quot;.

The Lucius Gleason House and Liverpool Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Erie Canal and salt===

Early industries included several salt works in the 19th century and a sawmill. Liverpool played an important role in the salt industry on the shores of Onondaga Lake. A history of the area&#x27;s salt mining can be found at the Salt Museum.

===Village incorporated===
The New York State surveyor general laid out the streets in the village, changed its name from &quot;Little Ireland&quot; to &quot;Liverpool&quot;, and had it incorporated on April 20, 1830. It was renamed after the city of Liverpool in England, most likely because it also produced salt and village leaders wanted to use the name recognition of another famous salt-producing region; coincidentally, 15 years later, the Great Famine caused so many people to sail from Ireland to England for a new life in Liverpool that the city gained the nickname &quot;Little Ireland&quot; and its demographic makeup remains the most overwhelmingly Irish of any community in the United Kingdom.

===Industry===
The hotel business was booming. George Ingersoll built the Globe Hotel. Liverpool was also a cigar manufacturing center during the 1890s. In 1918, the Oswego Canal was closed. Onondaga Lake Park, established in 1931, is now the location of much of the old canal bed.

==Geography==
Liverpool is at (43.105967, -76.209564). It takes up most of the northeastern bank of Onondaga Lake. Onondaga Lake Park is one of the most prominent locales in Liverpool, known for its several trams that travel the length of the park. It attracts over one million visitors each year.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has an area of , all land.

New York State Route 370 is an east–west highway that runs through the village. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes through the northern part of the village.

Liverpool is also home to a Lockheed Martin factory.

==Onondaga Lake Park==
Onondaga Lake Park is a county park on the eastern shore of Onondaga Lake outside of Syracuse at 6790 Onondaga Lake Trail in Liverpool. The park is home to the Salt Museum and the East Shore Recreation Trail. Many people living in the area use the park for exercise.

<text>North Syracuse is a village in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,739. North Syracuse is located in the towns of Cicero and Clay, north of the city of Syracuse.

== History ==
The village was originally called Centerville and changed to its present name in 1880. It became an incorporated village in 1925. Among the first settlers, the Fergerson family located there in 1826. They still occupy the same land located in what is now the village center. Many local streets are named in their honor.

On July 18, 1846, the United States&#x27; first plank road opened in North Syracuse, primarily for salt transportation. The road cost $23,000, was 16-1/2 miles long, and was planked its entire length. Thomas Alvord, a state legislator who later became lieutenant governor, helped secure the passage of an act to construct, maintain and collect tolls. There were four tollgates about four miles apart that were operated by the company, a profitable enterprise for many years. The fees were 1 cent per head of cattle, 5 cents for a single horse, and 25 cents for a horse and wagon.

There was a dirt side and planked side to the road; the East Side was dirt and the West Side planked 3&quot; thick by 8&#x27; long. Loaded wagons had the right of way on the planked side, the other side being reserved for empty wagons, single horses and for passing. Bicycles used the plank side on Sunday for racing. Due to wear and tear by horses&#x27; shoes and iron hoops on wagon wheels, a gang was constantly busy just making repairs.

North Syracuse was also the first New York State village to have its own fire district. The Volunteer Fire Department was established in 1913.

The current mayor of North Syracuse is Gary Butterfield, who has lived in North Syracuse since 1977.

During the American Revolution, the Onondagas sided with the British, and Onondaga was attacked by the Continental Army on April 21, 1779. After the war, the Onondagas were forced to cede their lands in New York to the new state, although some land was set aside to form the Onondaga Reservation. Most of the Onondagas left New York and were resettled in Upper Canada.
The Onondaga region was within what was designated the Central New York Military Tract, in which the new government allotted land grants to veterans as payment for their war service. In the postwar years, the area was flooded with migrants from New England and eastern New York. The Town of Onondaga was incorporated on April 2, 1798, from parts of other towns, with several subsequent boundary changes. When Onondaga County was formed in 1794, the town was established originally from parts of the Towns of Marcellus, Pompey, and Manlius.

The first court house for the County of Onondaga was built in 1805 on the public square in Onondaga Hill, which was then the county seat. The building was laid out by surveyor and engineer James Geddes (see Town of Geddes). After the county seat was moved to Syracuse in 1830, the building in Onondaga Hill was used as a school until 1846.

The Gen. Orrin Hutchinson House - which is now the Inn of the Seasons restaurant - at 4311 W. Seneca Turnpike is the only Town of Onondaga site listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Pompey is a town in the southeast part of Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 7,080. The town was named after the Roman general and political leader Pompey by a late 18th-century clerk interested in the Classics in the new federal republic.

==History==
The area of Pompey was originally part of the territory traditionally occupied by the historic Onondaga, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois tribes of the powerful &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, or Iroquois Confederacy. After the American Revolutionary War, when most of the Iroquois were forced to cede their land to the victorious United States, many of the Onondaga migrated to Canada. The British Crown awarded them land there for resettlement for their support during the war. New York State took over the former Iroquois lands and sold much of the public land for development (and speculation). It reserved part as the Central New York Military Tract. Veterans of the Revolution were awarded land grants in this tract as payments for service. The town was first settled by outsiders around 1789, as Yankees from New England and other migrants moved into western New York.

The town of Pompey was formed in 1789, but not completely organized until 1794, when Onondaga County was established. The original town was divided and sub-divided into many other towns in the region, including all of the towns of Fabius (1798), Tully, Preble, and Scott (the latter two now in Cortland County), along with parts of the towns of Spafford, Otisco (1806), LaFayette (1825), Onondaga (1794), Truxton and Cuyler (the latter two now in Cortland County).

The hamlet of Pompey developed about south of the main east-west Native American trail across the state, used for generations. European-American settlers improved the trail and developed it as the Genesee Road (1794) and then the Seneca Turnpike (1800), running through the villages of Cazenovia, Manlius and Onondaga Hollow (south of Syracuse). The segment of modern U.S. Route 20 (US 20), which connects Cazenovia and Skaneateles by way of Pompey and LaFayette, was not built until 1934.

The 1820 discovery of the Pompey stone was understood as proof of early European presence in North America, but it was decades later identified as a hoax.

The Oran District No. 22 Schoolhouse and Drover&#x27;s Tavern at Oran are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Salina is a town in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,223. The name of the town is derived from the Latin word for &quot;salt.&quot; Salina is a northern suburb of Syracuse.

== History ==
The region was in the domain of the Onondaga tribe and later was within the Central New York Military Tract, although it was reserved for members of the Onondaga. 
Salina received its name in 1797, when the surveyor general received authority to set aside a portion of the Salt Reservation for use in salt manufacture. The salt reservation had been created by a treaty with the Native Americans. It extended one mile around Onondaga Lake. In 1798, the village of Salina was chartered. It was located in what is now the Washington Square neighborhood, or first ward, of what became the city of Syracuse; it contained sixteen blocks. Each block was divided into four house lots, selling according to law, for no less than forty dollars. The area now known as the town of Salina was still part of the towns of Manlius and Marcellus. In March 1809, the town of Salina was organized. It included the areas later known as the town Geddes (formed 1848), part of Manlius and the city of Syracuse.

Salina&#x27;s location on the Erie Canal stimulated its industrial development. The middle section of the canal, from Salina to Utica was the first to open, in 1820, and elaborate celebrations were held.

It was not until the late 1840s that Salina was reduced to its present size. The original Town of Salina stretched around Onondaga Lake, incorporating part of what is now the Town of Geddes and much of what today is the City of Syracuse. The early history of Salina is actually the history of the area around Onondaga Lake and the salt industry.

By 1846, it was apparent that Syracuse would soon become a city. The residents of Salina and Syracuse began discussing a proposed charter, which would unify the two villages. In December 1847, the act of incorporation was passed, which defined the area as &quot;constituting a part of the town of Salina and incorporation the village of Salina and Syracuse.&quot; This act reduced the town of Salina to its present boundaries.

Salina consists of five small suburban communities: Liverpool, Mattydale, Lyncourt, Galeville, and a portion of North Syracuse.

The Alvord House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

<text>Solvay is a village located in the town of Geddes, Onondaga County, New York, United States, and a suburb of the city of Syracuse. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,645. The village is named after the Solvay brothers, Belgian inventors of the chemical process employed by the Solvay Process Company, formerly the major industry of the village.

==History==

The area was within the former Central New York Military Tract, but Solvay was in a location reserved for members of the Onondaga tribe.

The village was initially founded in 1794 by James Geddes and was initially called &quot;Geddesburgh.&quot; The first residents were mostly Irish, subsequently joined by Tyroleans and Poles. Eventually the community became known for its population largely Italian in extraction. It still retains a large segment (about 35% in 2005) of population of Italian descent. More recently many families of Ukrainian descent have settled in the village.

The village was renamed &quot;Solvay&quot; after 1884, when the Solvay Process Company built a Solvay process plant to produce soda ash. The Village of Solvay was incorporated in 1895. Other major businesses of Solvay include the Frazer &amp; Jones Company (Division of the Eastern Company), a foundry; Crucible Steel, producer of specialty steels; Iroquois China Company (Solvay China); Pass &amp; Seymour, producing electrical wiring devices.

The Solvay Process plant, by then owned by Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation, closed in 1985. The community has remained stable despite this loss. 
Reflecting paternalistic programs of the Solvay Process Company and the Hazard family, the first village and school library was in Guild Hall. Then Solvay received a Carnegie library in 1902. James A. Randall of Syracuse was the architect (1902–05). The building was constructed with Hazard support.

Since the Hazards&#x27; time, the village has provided superior services, as envisioned by the family. Solvay has its own municipal electric company which provides service to the village at one of the least expensive rates in the nation. A typical three bedroom home in the village which is completely electric (meaning no natural gas service) sees an average bill of around $225 per month in the winter and $160 in the summer (2009).

The Solvay Public Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

==Geography==
Solvay is located at (43.057316, -76.214649), immediately west of Syracuse and south of the New York State Fairgrounds (far westside). Its eastern boundary is shared with Syracuse. The village is south of the east end of Onondaga Lake and is also south of Interstate 690. The Erie Canal passes through the village.

<text>Vocal music is a type of singing performed by one or more singers, either with instrumental accompaniment, or without instrumental accompaniment (a cappella), in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered to be instrumental music (e.g. the wordless women&#x27;s choir in the final movement of Holst&#x27;s symphonic work &quot;The Planets&quot;) as is music without singing. Music without any non-vocal instrumental accompaniment is referred to as &quot;a cappella&quot;.

Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables, sounds, or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia, such as jazz scat singing. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song, although in different styles of music, it may be called an aria or hymn.

Vocal music often has a sequence of sustained pitches that rise and fall, creating a melody, but some vocal styles use less distinct pitches, such as chants or a rhythmic speech-like delivery, such as rapping. As well, there are extended vocal techniques that may be used, such as screaming, growling, throat singing, or yodelling. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music, since it does not require any instrument besides the human voice. All musical cultures have some variation of vocal music.

==Vocal music without lyrics==
===World traditions===
* Indian classical music is based on a rich vocal tradition, wherein even instruments are evaluated on their ability to follow the human voice, imitate it, or recreate the same expressions.
* Elaborate untexted vocal improvisation was and still is an important element in Turkish and Middle Eastern music traditions. Such music existed prior to the 13th century and the First Crusade into Palestine and the city of Jerusalem, possibly even before the year 900.
* The modern descendants of the ancient Kung tribes and clans of Southern Africa utilize similar traditional music techniques.
* A form of improvisation known as thillana is a very important feature of Carnatic music from South India.
* Tuvan throat singing often features wordless and improvised song. The sygyt technique is a particularly good example of this.
* The Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic communities.
* Hasidic Jews use a form of voice improvisation called nigunim. This consists of wordless tunes vocalized with sounds such as &quot;Bim-bim-bam&quot; or &quot;Ai-yai-yai!&quot; often accompanied by rhythmic clapping and drumming on the table.
* Puirt a beul, also known as &quot;Mouth Music&quot;, is a Scottish vocal technique imitating the sounds of bagpipes, fiddles, and other instruments used in traditional Scottish music. It was popularized in North America by Scottish immigrants, and has been incorporated into many forms of American music from roots music to bluegrass.
* The Cante Alentejano is just based on vocal music. It is one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, the other being Fado.

===European classical vocal music===
Solfege, a vocalized musical scale, assigns various syllables such as &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; to each note. A variety of similar tools are found in 
traditional Indian music, and scat singing of jazz.

===Jazz and popular music===
Hip hop music has a very distinct form of vocal percussion known as beatboxing. It involves creating beats, rhythms, and scratching.

The singer of the Icelandic group Sigur Rós, Jón Þór Birgisson, often uses vocals without words, as does Icelandic singer/songwriter, Björk. Her album Medúlla is composed entirely of processed and acoustic vocal music, including beatboxing, choral arrangements, and throat singing.

Singer Bobby McFerrin has recorded a number of albums using only his voice and body, sometimes consisting of a texted melody supported by untexted vocalizations.

==Vocal music with lyrics==

===Songs===
:&quot;See :Category:Song forms for short forms of music with words that are sung.&quot;

===Extended techniques that involve lyrics===
The Second Viennese School, especially Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg, pioneered a technique called Sprechstimme in which singers are half-talk, half-sing, and only approximate pitches.

==Wide-ranging voices==

*Adam Lopez – E2 to E♭8
*Ariana Grande: D3 – E7
*Avi Kaplan: E1 – F5
*Axl Rose: F1 – B6.
*Beyoncé – G#2 to F6
*Cher: C3 – E6
*Clara Butt: A2 – B5
*Daniel Gildenlöw: A1 – A5. Top range may be heard on songs such as &quot;Dea Pecuniae&quot;, &quot;A Trace of Blood&quot; or &quot;This Heart of Mine&quot;; for low range, &quot;Imago&quot;, &quot;Of Dust&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; are good examples.
*Dimash Kudaibergen: F#1 - D8.
*Elizabeth Billington: A3 – A6.
*Elvis Presley: B1 – A5. Elvis&#x27; B1 may be heard on the song &quot;Such a Night&quot;, and on &quot;Mystery Train&quot; an A5 is reached towards the end. Towards his later career, he developed a rich baritone voice which still mastered the higher register with immense power, such as on &quot;American Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; or the joking &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;&quot;.
*Ewa Podleś: A2 – E6.
*Farinelli: C3 – C6.
*Freddie Mercury: F2 – G#5.

*Lucrezia Aguiari: C4 – C7.

*Mado Robin: B3 – D7.
*Manuel García: G2 – D5.
*Maria Callas: F3 – F6. In his review of Callas&#x27;s June 11, 1951 concert in Florence, music critic Rock Ferris of &quot;Musical Courier&quot; said, &quot;Her high E&#x27;s and F&#x27;s are taken full voice.&quot; In a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes on the program &quot;L&#x27;invité du dimanche&quot;, La Scala&#x27;s maestro Francesco Siciliani speaks of Callas&#x27;s voice going to high F.
*Maria Malibran: E3 – E6.
*Mariah Carey: F2 – F8. Carey has hit an F2 while singing &quot;You and I&quot; live and an F8 while swimming with a dolphin, making her vocal range exactly six octaves and one of the biggest in popular music history. 
*Michael Jackson: E2 – B♭6
*Prince: A1 – G7
*Tim Buckley: F♯2 – A5
*Tim Storms: G−5 – G5
*Yma Sumac: her range was said to be &quot;well over four octaves&quot; and was sometimes claimed to span even five octaves at her peak. From B2 to C7

<text>Van Buren is a town located in Onondaga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 14,367. The town is named after then-Senator Martin Van Buren, who would later become the eighth president of the United States.

The town of Van Buren is located northwest of the city of Syracuse and is in the northwest part of the county. The portion of the town north and east of New York State Route 690 and south of the Seneca River is suburban in character, consisting primarily of single-family tract housing, some low-rise apartment buildings, park land, and some light industry. The rest of the town is primarily rural.

== History ==
The town was part of the Central New York Military Tract of 1789 used to pay soldiers for service in the American Revolution. Most of the soldiers chose to sell their allotments for cash so that the town was briefly in the hands of land speculators until the actual residents purchased lots. Settlement began around 1791.

The Town of Van Buren was formed in 1829 from the Town of Camillus.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.52%) is water.

Van Buren is bordered on the north and west by the Seneca River. Its neighbor across the river is the Town of Lysander. On the southwest, Van Buren is bordered by the Town of Elbridge; on the south, the Town of Camillus; and on the east, the Town of Geddes.

Van Buren contains the southern portion of the Village of Baldwinsville, which was incorporated in 1848. The northern part of the Village of Baldwinsville is in the Town of Lysander. The Baldwinsville Central School District, formed in 1949, includes most of the area of both Van Buren and Lysander.

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) crosses the south part of Van Buren. New York State Route 690 is a limited access highway connecting with Thruway Exit 39 and bypassing Baldwinsville on the west. New York State Route 31 runs northeast–southwest through Van Buren, connecting Baldwinsville and Jordan. New York State Route 173 runs northwest—southeast, connecting Van Buren with Fairmount and Onondaga Hill. New York State Route 48 follows the course of the Seneca River in the eastern part of Van Buren; prior to the construction of Route 690, it carried much of the traffic between Baldwinsville and Syracuse. County and town roads complete the highway net.

== History ==
&quot;Westvale&quot; as an identity probably evolved in the early 20th century; it refers to the area west of Wescott Reservoir, accessed by, but mostly south of, West Genesee Street (since the Village of Solvay was to the north). Farther west was Fairmount, which developed earlier than most of Westvale, where the land was held off the market. The &quot;Avery Tract&quot; lay between the reservoir and the City of Syracuse. The Avery Tract became part of the Village of Solvay. The core of Westvale was farmland retained by a major landowning family of New York State, the Schuylers. he branch holding title to much of the property was the Parsons, recalled by Parsons Drive, a centerpiece residential boulevard with a grassy median, off West Genesee Street.

A few Westvale houses predate suburban development. The Parsons farmhouse was replaced by development at the end of the 20th century. West Genesee Street has a few late 19th century residences. Early 20th century streets show houses in styles of the period, especially the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, development was rapid, and most houses of Westvale now date from the later twentieth century. Westvale Plaza, one of the earliest suburban &quot;malls&quot; of the region, appeared in the Avery Tract shortly after World War II. It is extant as a &quot;strip mall,&quot; while Fairmount Fair, immediately beyond Westvale to the west, came later. Its interior pedestrian concourse was roofed over about 1967, making it the first indoor, climate-controlled shopping mall in Central New York.

The stretch of West Genesee Street between the Avery Tract and Fairmout was spared commercial development through the political activism of the Westvale-Avery Club, a men&#x27;s organization.

==Education==
The majority of Westvale census-designated place is in the Westhill Central School District. A portion is in the West Genesee Central School District

Westvale was once part of the Village of Solvay school district. Cherry Road School originally served grades K-8, thereafter students walked to Solvay High School. Since 1962, however, the majority of Westvale has been served by the Westhill Central School District.

<text>Clifton Springs is a village located in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 2,127 at the 2010 census. The village takes its name from local mineral springs.

The Village of Clifton Springs is located primarily in the Town of Manchester, but the eastern part is in the Town of Phelps. The village is southeast of Rochester, NY.

== History ==
The location was first settled around 1801, and much of the early community endeavors exploited the sulfur springs as a health spa. The village was incorporated in 1859.

The development of the area was slow until 1849, when Dr. Henry Foster came looking for a place to begin his water cure. Modern medicine was in its early stages, and it was thought that the sulphur waters together with a strong religious revival could restore many to active and useful lives. Sulphur Springs, as it was once called, was well known throughout the eastern part of the US because of this. Over the years, thousands of people came to enjoy the benefits of the water and rest and regain their health. Some famous people who visited the area were Elvis Presley, and Bette Davis&#x27; daughter. The area around the former sanitarium was designated the Clifton Springs Sanitarium Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

In March 1917, a local convalescent and architect George Edward Barton assembled a small group of authorities from around the country to discuss the benefits of the &quot;work cure&quot;, or the value of activity in promoting recovery. During that meeting, the profession of occupational therapy was born with the incorporation of what is now The American Occupational Therapy Association. In 1968, a plaque was placed on Barton&#x27;s home, known as Consolation House, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the profession. Between 1915 and 1921, Barton maintained Consolation House as a convalescent home employing therapeutic activity.

Today, there has been a revival of interest in bathing at mineral springs. The Clifton Springs Hospital &amp; Clinic has devoted an entire wing to this treatment.

Modern-day Clifton Springs offers an excellent school system, modern hospital, YMCA, Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club and numerous other organizations, country club/golf course, national bank, library, senior citizen community, volunteer fire department, a park area, tennis courts, a skate park, shaded streets, a large manufacturing firm, and an active business section. In the summer months, the town participates in a business program dubbed &quot;Super Sundays.&quot;

The Phelps-Clifton Springs Central School District serves the students who live in Clifton Springs. The school district, also known as Midlakes, serves the students of the area. The current Superintendent is Matt Stickles.

The Oliver Warner Farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

<text>Hopewell is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 3,931 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Hopewell is in the north central part of the county, east of the City of Canandaigua.

==History==
&quot;Significant portions of this section is sourced from Conover, Chapter XXV.&quot;

The Seneca Indian village of Onnaghee (or Onaghee, aka Snyder-McClure village) was located in Hopewell. It was abandoned sometime before 1750, and the former residents likely founded the newer village at Canandaigua.

Settled beginning in 1789, the town of Hopewell, New York, was originally part of a tract of land first called &quot;District of Easton&quot; and then &quot;Lincoln&quot; and was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1788.

The original settlers in the area were former New Englanders. According to &quot;The History of Ontario County New York&quot;, some of the earliest pioneers included &quot;Daniel Gates, Daniel Warner, Ezra Platt, Samuel Day, George Chapin, Israel Chapin, Jr., Frederick Follett, Thomas Sawyer, Benjamin Wells and Mr. Sweet, all of whom were from Massachusetts, while William Wyckoff who was another pioneer, was from Pennsylvania.&quot;

In 1807, the name of the town was changed again, this time to &quot;Gorham,&quot; in honor of Nathaniel Gorham. The Town of Hopewell was formed out of the northern section of the Town of Gorham on March 29, 1822.

On April 17, 1823, the first town meeting was held and the first town officers were elected. They were:
* Supervisor – Nathan Lewis
* Town Clerk – John Prince
* Assessors – Elisha Higby, George Brundage, and James Birdseye
* Highway Commissioners – Joel S. Hart, Erastus Lamed, and William Canfield
* Overseers of the Poor – Rufus Warner and Lemuel Babcock
* Commissioner of Schools – William Buchan, Jason Angel, and Joshua Case
* Inspector of Schools – Joseph Merrill, William Bodman, and Joel Amsden
* Constables – Timothy Dunham, Hiram Dillon, William Lamed, and Joseph Parker
* Collector – Walter Wells
* Justice of the Peace – Nathaniel Lewis, John Price, Amos Jones and Elisha Higby

Between 1830 and 1890, the population of Hopewell ranged from 2,202 (1830) to 1,655 (1890).

In 1825 the County Board of Supervisors purchased farmland in the southeastern part of the town and established a home for the county poor. That land today is still owned by Ontario County and is used to house the County Health Facility, County Historian and Archives Center and other County facilities.

In 1844 members of the Fourier Society of the City of Rochester established the Ontario Union, a utopian community based on the works of French socialist Charles Fourier, in Hopewell. According to a Fourierist newspaper, the Ontario Union was located at Bates&#x27; Mills, about five miles from the main city of Canandaigua, and was home to &quot;chairmakers, carpenters, wheelrights, millwrights, edge tool makers, blacksmiths, machinists, carriage trimmers, &amp;c.&quot;

<text>Richmond is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 3,380 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Abigail Richmond Pitts, an early settler. The town of Richmond is on the western border of the county, south of Rochester.

== History ==

Richmond was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The area was first settled around 1790. The town was established in 1796 as &quot;Pittstown&quot;, after Captain Peter Pitts, and was renamed &quot;Honeoye&quot; in 1808. In 1815, the name was changed to &quot;Richmond&quot;, after Peter Pitts&#x27; wife, Abigail Richmond Pitts, regarded as the town&#x27;s &quot;founding mother.&quot; More territory was added to Richmond from the Town of Canadice in 1836. Parts of the Towns of Bristol and South Bristol were added to Richmond in 1848, but were returned to their previous towns in 1852.

In 1600 the Honeoye Lake Watershed was—apart from clearings made by Native Americans and natural causes such as fire, steep slope landslides, wind or ice—completely forested. The watershed’s primeval forest contained massive trees, some covering as much as a half-acre of ground.

Early settlers found these forests useful. Probably the first product to be transported to market was barrels of potash, made from ashes of the burned trees. As sawmills were erected, lumber from the trees cut from 1830 to 1890 were used in the construction of urban centers such as Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse.

Efforts to bring logs down from the inaccessible area between East Lake Road and Gulick led to the construction of a rail line in the bottom of Briggs Gully. In 1885, maximum deforestation and agricultural land use arrived in New York State, often on lands that would not support these practices. Since 1885, there has been a slow decline of farming in the watershed, accelerated by the Great Depression from 1929 to 1943 and a gradual re-establishment of the area’s forests.

Changes in the character of the Town of Richmond and Honeoye Lake Watershed over the past half century have been significant. The growth in the use of private automobiles and the construction of good roads in the 1920s and 1930s added to the desirability of Honeoye lakefront cottages. By the mid-twentieth century, undeveloped lake frontage had mostly disappeared and summer cottages filled the shoreline.

The years after World War II also signaled the end of agriculture as a principal use of the watershed land and the rapid residential development in the hills of Richmond and Canadice overlooking the lake. The reduction of agriculture resulted in the natural re-forestation of inactive agricultural lands, which was beneficial in reducing erosion. However, increased residential development resulted in the loss of native vegetation and an increase in impermeable surfaces. These historical changes in the watershed have impacted the watershed character and the water quality— both for better and worse.

In 1962, the Honeoye Chamber of Commerce organized a first Winter Carnival. The event became so popular that in 1971 over 50,000 visitors arrived—tying up traffic for miles. After considerable success, the Winter Carnival was discontinued due to lack of tourist infrastructure. Recent studies by the Ontario County Tourism Bureau have documented the major economic benefits of special festivals and occasions to Ontario County communities. The summer population has been estimated at 4,500.

<text>West Bloomfield is a town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 2,760 at the 2020 census.

The Town of West Bloomfield is on the county&#x27;s western border and sits parallel to the Town of East Bloomfield, both of which lie south of the City of Rochester.

== History ==
The town is within the historic homeland of the Seneca Nation, and tradition holds that three of the tribe&#x27;s villages were located in the town. As such, during the spring season when much of the town&#x27;s farmland is being plowed, it is not uncommon to find arrowheads and other artifacts.The first Europeans to visit the area were members of the Jesuits in the 17th century during their westward quests.

Settlement began around 1789 and the Town of West Bloomfield was officially established in 1833 from part of the Town of Bloomfield.

The West Bloomfield Congregational Church was founded in 1799. The Congregation would meet on top of a hill that would later (in 1806, current building erected in 1875) be home to the actual church building.

The town was home to the Batavia Branch Rail Line, or &quot;Peanut Line&quot;, of the New York Central Railroad, which brought much prosperity and business to the town for almost a century. Built in 1853, it was a spur line between the rail hubs of Batavia and Canandaigua with stops in both the town itself and its hamlet of Ionia, there was also a trestle constructed on the eastern side of the town that spans the gap now occupied by NY-64 just before entering the Town of East Bloomfield. The line provided daily freight and passenger service, with connections to larger stations, and served as an integral part of the towns development. Service was discontinued in 1939, as ridership had fallen due to the usage of the automobile, and the railroad (experiencing its own financial troubles) was not making enough on freight to justify the cost.

The Ontario and Livingston Mutual Insurance Office and John and Mary Dickson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.16%) is water.

West Bloomfield is the second smallest town in the county by area.

The west town line is the border of Livingston County, formed by Honeoye Creek.

Conjoined US Route 20 and New York State Route 5 cross the town. New York State Route 64 is by the eastern town line, and New York State Route 65 is in the northwestern corner of West Bloomfield.

The town sits on the southern edge of the Hopper Hills and the northern edge of the Bristol Hills, and features a number of high points with views of the Finger Lakes Region (including Honeoye and Canandaigua lake areas).

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,549 people, 1,013 households, and 729 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 1,049 housing units at an average density of .

The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males.

== Government ==

=== Executive ===
The town&#x27;s executive government is made up of an elected Town Board (four members) and an elected Town Supervisor, both positions are part-time; terms are four years. The town does operate its own court for minor criminal, civil and traffic matters; this is presided over by an elected Court Justice the current serving Court Justice is Richard L. Whitesell.

=== Public Works/Utilities ===
* An elected Highway Supervisor who oversees operation of the West Bloomfield Town Highway Department; this department is also largely used for general &quot;Public Works&quot; as well.
* The majority of residents have well water due to the sparse, rural population. A small, populated section in the central part of the town does have piped water for homes and fire hydrants; the town managed this via the Highway Department until control was ceded to the Monroe County Water Authority around 2011 as part of a deal to receive significant improvements to the system. 
* Electric services are provided by companies such as National Grid, Niagara Mohawk and RG&amp;E, however a growing number of residents are turning to alternative forms of power such as solar or wind. 
* The town operates Michael Prouty Memorial Park as the sole town park/recreation area. The park is home to a baseball diamond, a multi use sports field area, a pavilion and a playground. In years past, the town operated a summer recreation program for youths at the park, however in recent years due to funding concerns the town has joined with East Bloomfield to offer a joint program at the central school grounds.

=== Law Enforcement ===
The town does not operate its own police department, and the area maintains low crime rates. It instead relies on the services of the Ontario County Sheriffs Office, who post a Deputy in town, and patrolling Troopers of the New York State Police who will act as a backup unit for the Deputy should the need arise.

=== Emergency Services ===
All 911 calls in the town are directed through the Ontario County Sheriffs Office as the town does not have its own call center.

==== Fire/Rescue ====
The town utilizes two volunteer fire stations; one in the northern hamlet of Ionia and a second is located centrally by the town highway garages on Co Rd 37. In total, roughly thirty men and women operate a combined nine fire/rescue apparatus, responding to ~100 calls for service per year. The majority of fire/rescue personnel are state certified interior/exterior firefighters (those who are not provide support services at scenes) and several hold specialized certifications in the HazMat, Rope Rescue, FAST and EMS fields.

==== EMS/Ambulance ====
For many years (~1960&#x27;s-2005), the town operated its own volunteer ambulance squad. Due to low membership, aging equipment and rising costs of operation, the squad was disbanded around 2004/2005. The town initially contracted with a local paid private ambulance service that covered the neighboring towns of East Bloomfield and Bristol. Both those towns however either began paying their members or increased volunteerism and dropped the paid private service, resulting in fewer ambulances in the area and increasingly longer response times. In late 2014, the Chief of the fire department approached the Town Supervisor about concerns regarding the fire departments already limited EMS staffing being forced to deal with increased wait times for an ambulance. In 2015, the town severed its contract with the private service and entered into a new contract with the neighboring municipality of Honeoye Falls for use of their ambulance and Paramedic fly-car services on a regular basis.

==Notable people==
*Joseph H. Bottum, former South Dakota State Senator
*John Dickson, former US Congressman
*Anna Gertrude Hall, author and librarian

<doc id="126919" wikidata="Q805483" url="?curid=126919" title="Balmville, New York">
<text>Balmville is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Orange County, New York, United States. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. It is located in the southeastern part of the Town of Newburgh. The population was 3,197 at the 2020 census. Many wealthy, influential, and upper income families live in Balmville on roads such as River Road, Sloane Road, Commonwealth Avenue, Susan Drive, and Grand Avenue. Susan Drive is accredited for housing the former Delano Family Estate (Algonac). The Delano family was the family of the mother of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and she in fact was born and raised at Algonac. Many homes in Balmville are incredibly expensive due to their pristine views of the Hudson River. Balmville is also the site of the Powelton Club Country Club. It currently ranks as the highest income hamlet in the greater Newburgh area.

Balmville is immediately north of, and adjoins, the city of Newburgh.

Balmville was home to the Balmville Tree, New York&#x27;s smallest state forest. The tree was one of three federally protected trees in the nation. It was called a &quot;miracle tree&quot; due to its age (over 300 years) for its species. On August 5, 2015, because of safety concerns caused by the rapid deterioration of the tree, it was cut down and removed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

==James D. Hughes==
Balmville was the birthplace of Air Force General James D. Hughes. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (located only about 17 miles away), Gen Hughes continued to live in Balmville with his family for most of his life. General Hughes was the military aide to Richard M. Nixon during the latter&#x27;s second term as Vice President of the United States and again during his subsequent presidency.

==Notable Locations==

=== The Balmville Tree ===
The Balmville Tree was located behind the current Balmville Elementary School, where Balmville Road, River Road, and Commonwealth Avenue intersect. It was the smallest state forest in New York, and was one of only three trees protected by the federal government. It had been on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000. Rapid deterioration of the condition of the tree resulted in its removal by the New York State Department of Conservation on August 5, 2015.

=== Algonac ===
Balmville was the site of Algonac — the birthplace and home of Sara Delano, the mother of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Algonac was located at what is now Susan Drive.

=== Balmville Grange ===
The Balmville Grange Hall is located on Fostertown Road 2/10 of a mile west of the intersection with Route 9W and is the last remaining grange in the Town of Newburgh. It celebrated its 100th anniversary on September 28, 2003.

=== Newburgh Beacon Bridge and Interstate 84 ===
The western terminus of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge is in Balmville. In fact, Interstate 84, which crosses the bridge, bisects Balmville just south of the Powelton Club. Property was taken from the Powelton Club for the construction of this highway, although not as much land was taken as occurred in the 1920s for the construction of U.S. Route 9W. The New York State Bridge Authority recently constructed parking lots on Grand Avenue to accommodate hikers who utilize the pedestrian path on the bridge. This was done to discourage vehicles parking under the overpass, a security concern since the September 11, 2001 attacks.

==Education==
It is in the Newburgh Enlarged City School District.

===Balmville Elementary School===
Balmville has been a part of the Newburgh Enlarged City School District since consolidation in 1963. The original Balmville School building stood on what later became the Desmond Estate. When that building (which has long since been demolished) outgrew its space, it was replaced by a new building built on land donated by Warren Delano of the Delano family with funds donated by his daughter, Annie Delano-Hitch. Mrs. Hitch was a lifelong Balmville resident whose sister was Sara Delano Roosevelt, the mother of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This old elementary school building with a cornerstone indicating construction in 1897 is still standing today. It stands on what is now the northeast corner of U.S. Route 9W and Fostertown Road. (The current Route 9W was constructed in the late 1920s.) It is immediately north of the current elementary school, at the southeast corner of 9W and Fostertown Road, which was initially constructed in 1953-54, but was added onto many times since, most recently in 2007. In 2007, the Board of Education of the Newburgh Enlarged City School District voted to demolish the older school building and expend $375,000 to do so. The school board concluded that the building is &quot;unstable&quot; and poses a &quot;health and safety hazard even to those just walking or parking outside.&quot; This conclusion was based upon an architectural survey commissioned by the Board of Education. Local civic and historic groups rose up and demanded that this historically and architecturally significant building be spared. Local developers Rick Milton and Keith Libolt stepped forward and offered buy the building, restore it, and lease it back to the school district. Milton charged that District Administrators and the architect&#x27;s report &quot;scared the board into thinking that the building is going to fall down. It&#x27;s not true.&quot; Milton further charged that the administrators were simply looking for a quick way to create more parking spaces for the &quot;new&quot; school and contended that additional parking could be found elsewhere on the school property. The Board of Education relented and rescinded its demolition order. Although most classes have been held in the &quot;new&quot; Balmville School since 1954, some classes had been held in the &quot;old&quot; building as late as the mid-1970s, and it had been used for offices and other administrative purposes up to the mid-1980s. It had been used for storage since. Milton and Libolt propose using the &quot;old&quot; building for administrative and office space, freeing the space used in the &quot;new&quot; building for these purposes and also for expanding the school library. On Oct. 30, 2007, the Board of Education voted to table the demolition for the time being.

=== Secondary and higher education ===
While many residents of Balmville attend Newburgh Free Academy, the sole comprehensive high school of the Newburgh school district, others attend local independent schools. A large number of graduates from Balmville have attended Ivy League schools such as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.

<text>Cornwall is a town in Orange County, New York, United States, approximately north of New York City on the western shore of the Hudson River. As of the 2020 census, the population was at 12,884. Cornwall has become a bedroom community for area towns and cities including New York City. Commuter rail service to North Jersey and New York City is available via the Salisbury Mills–Cornwall train station, operated by NJ Transit on behalf of Metro-North Railroad. The town is located less than an hour from the George Washington Bridge with access to major commuter routes such as the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Parkway.

Cornwall&#x27;s Main Street includes gift shops, taverns, restaurants, coffeehouses, yoga studios and boutiques. Government offices, churches, parks, the riverfront, and St. Luke&#x27;s Cornwall Hospital, a part of the Montefiore Health System, are situated within walking distance of downtown. The town is a designated Tree City.

Cornwall was the top selection to represent New York State in &quot;The Best Places to Raise Kids 2013&quot; by Bloomberg Business Week magazine.

== Infrastructural Developments ==

==History==
When the explorer Henry Hudson visited the region in 1609 the land was occupied by the Waoraneck Indians. In 1685 a colony of twenty-five Scottish families settled around the mouth of the Moodna Creek, led by the soldier Major Patrick McGregor and his brother-in-law, David Toiseach, the laird of Monzievaird. In the ensuing 50 years, English and Scottish families came to the fertile tableland above the river meadows naming it &quot;new Cornwall&quot; because of the marked similarity to the County of Cornwall, England, It is believed that the hamlet of Canterbury was the site of this settlement. The first recorded town meeting was held in April 1765. In 1788, Orange County was subdivided into numerous townships, thus producing the town of &quot;New Cornwall.&quot; The town&#x27;s name was subsequently changed from &quot;New Cornwall&quot; to &quot;Cornwall&quot; in 1797. The late 1800s were the heyday of Cornwall&#x27;s fame. It became a summer resort because of the natural beauty of the river, its mountain vistas, scenic trails, fresh country air and convenience to New York City via riverboat or railroad.

The area that became Cornwall was part of Governor Dongan&#x27;s 1685 Tract. The Precinct of Cornwall was created in 1764. The Town was founded in 1788 as New Cornwall, which was changed in 1797 to Cornwall.

===The nineteenth century===
In the mid-19th century, Cornwall developed a reputation as a health retreat. Until the early 20th century, city folk flocked to the valley to experience the therapeutic powers they believed it to hold. The mountains, fresh air and evergreen forests were thought to offer the perfect conditions for good health and they were not far from the city. Cornwall, on the west side of the Hudson, became especially popular as a health retreat, offering numerous boarding houses and many conveniences of the day, including accessibility to the railroad and steamboats, as well as a telegraph office and large library.

Nathaniel Parker Willis, one of the &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; writers, enjoyed the time he spent here so much he bought property in Cornwall, establishing a country home he called Idlewild. His many writings on the area helped make Cornwall a popular spot for health-seekers. Winslow Homer, the famous water color artist, spent summers in the hamlet of Mountainville - then known as Ketcham Town - as a young artist and many of his pastoral themed water colors were made there and depict the local scenery.

Shifting attitudes toward a more healthy lifestyle began to make the Hudson Valley popular for outdoor activities and exercise. Hiking, rowing, swimming, fishing, hunting and biking all contributed to the development in the area of summer camps as well as the notion of the summer vacation.

===Historic buildings===

The A. J. Clark Store is located at 286 Main Street in downtown Cornwall. Archer Clark built the Italianate building to house his butcher shop around 1875, after an 1870 fire destroyed his earlier quarters. It would continue in existence in that building for a century. Later, one of his descendants converted it into a delicatessen. In 1996 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an intact commercial building dating from Cornwall&#x27;s days as a summer resort town in the late 19th century.
The &quot;Canterbury Presbyterian Church&quot; is located along Clinton Street in downtown Cornwall. A white stone and brick building in the Federal style, with later Colonial Revival style additions, it has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996. In 2018 the Church which had been in need of repairs was acquired and converted in to a Dance Studio. This helped bring much needed repairs to support the history of the building.

The Carvey–Gatfield House is a stone house along Angola Road in Cornwall. It was built in the first decade of the 19th century in the Federal style. The land was originally the property of Isaac Bobbin, an early settler, until subdivided into the present parcel and sold to Mathias Carvey in 1805, around the time the house was built. Carvey had bought the property from William Robinson, two owners removed from Bobbin, to support his mill on a nearby stream. He in turn sold it to Benjamin Gatfield, in whose family it would remain for almost a century. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
The &quot;Oliver Brewster House&quot; is a Gothic Revival home located on Willow Avenue, across from Willow Avenue Elementary School. It was originally built as a farmhouse in the mid-19th century. Later, as Cornwall became a popular summer resort for visitors from New York City, it was expanded and renovated for use as a boardinghouse as well. In 1996 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The Samuel Brooks House is located on Pleasant Hill Road north of the hamlet of Mountainville. Brooks, a descendant of one of Cornwall&#x27;s oldest families, built this as a farmhouse around 1860. After the Civil War, summer boarders from New York City began coming to Cornwall, and Brooks quickly adapted it for use as a boardinghouse. Its location, near Schunemunk Mountain made it a desirable location for the summer boarders who made Cornwall a popular resort community in the late 19th century. In 1996 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Environmental advocacy===
In 1962, a 17-year legal battle began that launched modern-day environmental activism. Consolidated Edison proposed building a giant hydroelectric plant on the river at Storm King Mountain near Cornwall. Despite pressure from local residents, Con Ed went forward with its plan, applying to the Federal Power Commission for a license to operate such a facility.

Three years later, after hearings and appeals and more hearings, the U. S. Court of Appeals set a precedent when it sent the case back to the FPC to start the process over again. Its reasoning was based on the commission&#x27;s refusal to hear much of the environmental impact testimony the first time around. For the first time in U.S. history, a court had decided that protection of natural resources was just as important as economic gain. It prompted Congress to pass the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969, which requires an environmental impact study on all major projects needing approval from the federal government.

== Geography ==

The town is located north of New York City, and north of the United States Military Academy at West Point, in eastern Orange County. It is shaped like an irregular pentagon pointing southwards. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (4.76%) is water.

Cornwall&#x27;s terrain is quite diverse, with considerable relief. It is shaped by the valleys of Moodna and Woodbury creeks, and includes estuarine salt marshes, heavily developed residential and commercial areas, rolling farms, and rocky, scrub-covered ridges and mountaintops. There are two major protected areas mostly within the town: Storm King State Park and the privately managed Black Rock Forest.

The most level section is in the northeast corner, east of the curve of US 9W, sloping gently to the river. Here is located the village of Cornwall-on-Hudson, and the most developed section of the town proper, the area usually meant by Cornwall, just to the southwest of the village. The Town has equal frontage on the river south of the Village but is primarily State Park land and inaccessible due to a railroad throughway. To its west lies another residential area, Firthcliffe, named for the carpet factory once located here along the banks of Moodna Creek. Much of the town&#x27;s population is concentrated in the village and this area. Across the river, on its eastern shore, Cornwall borders on the towns of Fishkill and Philipstown in Dutchess and Putnam counties respectively.

In its southern section, Cornwall on Hudson rises to the high area known as Deer Hill, a foothill to Storm King Mountain to its immediate south. South of Storm King the town&#x27;s southeast boundary, with Highlands, leaves the river just north of Crow&#x27;s Nest and runs through Storm King State Park, taking in most of Black Rock Forest. It turns more southerly, taking in the northwestern sliver of the United States Military Academy Reservation before reaching Cornwall&#x27;s southernmost point, its tripoint with Highlands and the town and village of Woodbury.
This area of town is also mountainous and rugged, with the border descending along a northwesterly line to the narrow Woodbury Creek valley, where NY 32 and the New York State Thruway enter the town. At the valley&#x27;s mouth, where Woodbury Creek drains into Moodna Creek, is the small hamlet of Mountainville, with its own fire district and ZIP Code. It gets its name from Schunemunk Mountain, where the town line climbs the northern end of Schunemunk, reaching the town&#x27;s highest elevation at at the tripoint with Woodbury and Blooming Grove.

Just past Schunemunk&#x27;s western ridge, the town line reaches another corner and changes course to due north. This takes in the rural, rolling countryside between the mountain and Salisbury Mills, where Storm King Art Center is located and the Moodna Viaduct, the highest and longest railroad trestle east of the Mississippi River, spans the valley between Schunemunk and the Salisbury Mills–Cornwall station on the Metro-North Port Jervis Line. This trestle was shown in the 2007 film &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; and is a well-known landmark. NY 94 runs through this section of town.

The town&#x27;s northeastern corner is another tripoint, with Blooming Grove and New Windsor, located in the middle of Beaverdam Lake. From there the New Windsor boundary runs east, trending slightly to the north, just south of the hamlet of Vails Gate back to the salt marshes where the Moodna drains into the Hudson.

Until 1953 the New York, Ontario and Western Railway operated passenger trains from the lower Catskills to Weehawken. In earlier decades the trains went to Oneida in Central New York State. Until 1958, New York Central Railroad trains carried passengers from Albany, through Cornwall to Weehawken Terminal. Cornwall was the junction point at which NYOW trains joined New York Central tracks to continue to Weehawken.

<text>Cornwall-on-Hudson is a riverfront village in the town of Cornwall, Orange County, New York, United States. It lies on the west bank of the Hudson River, approximately north of New York City. The population as of the 2020 census was 3,075. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area.

==History==
The village was part of the Governor Dongan tract of 1685. Willisville was an early name for Cornwall-on-Hudson. Settlement in the area occurred at Cornwall Landing, a hamlet on the Hudson River below Butter Hill. It was the only river landing in the town. In the early 1800s, Daniel Tobias sailed a sloop from Cornwall Landing. As there was no direct communication between the river and the table-land above, in 1807, his brother, Isaac S. Tobias, built a road, at his own expense, as far as the first bridge on the road to Willisville. The Mead and Taft Company lumberyard once employed 500 people at the Landing. Cornwall Landing became a commercial hub with its own post office. The Landing began to decline after World War II when passenger train service ended, and Conrail demolished the buildings. Cornwall-on-Hudson incorporated as a village in December 1884, within the Town of Cornwall.
===Historic places===

The Amelia Barr House, also known as &quot;Cherry Croft&quot;, is located on Mountain Road in Cornwall-on-Hudson, on the slopes of Storm King Mountain. Barr, an American writer born in the 19th century, lived here during the most prolific and successful period of her career. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Camp Olmsted is a summer camping facility in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, operated by the Five Points Mission, a Methodist organization. It is located along Bayview Avenue, NY-218, near Storm King Mountain. It was founded in 1901. Siblings Sarah and John Olmsted donated the 21-acre (8 ha) parcel. Campers would take the Hudson River Day Line ferry from the city to Cornwall and then proceed to the camp. In 1966 the New York City Society took a role in operating the camp. The camp was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (5.31%) is water. The zip code is 12520. Located just north of New York City, the village borders the western shore of the Hudson River. It is one of the most affluent communities in the Orange County area. While the village is primarily residential, it has a small commercial center and many riverfront homes adjacent to Donahue Memorial Park, formerly known as Cornwall Landing.
NY-218 passes through the village and US Route 9W passes through the Town of Cornwall west of the village. Storm King State Park lies south of the village, and, below that, the United States Military Academy.

The town of Deerpark would be established in 1798, being formed from the southeastern section of Mamakating. The town got its name from a tract of land enclosed with a brush fence, referred to as &quot;McDaniel’s Deerpark” by locals.

<text>Fort Montgomery is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 1,627 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

Fort Montgomery is in the southeastern corner of the town of Highlands, on U.S. Route 9W.

==Geography==

Fort Montgomery is located at (41.337469, -73.982746).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (2%) is water.

==History==

The town is named after the first Fort Montgomery, a fortification of the American Revolution stormed by the British on October 6, 1777. Although a loss for American forces, the battle delayed the British from sailing up the Hudson River in time to relieve Burgoyne&#x27;s forces at Saratoga. After the fort&#x27;s demolition, American defenses centered on West Point, New York, upriver, and the location was not re-used militarily.

The town subsequently became the site of a major ore dock. Ore from the Forest of Dean Mine was shipped via a railroad and an aerial tramway to the dock, where it was loaded into steamboats on the Hudson. Coal for the mine machinery travelled in the opposite direction. Some ore was also mined in the immediate vicinity of Fort Montgomery. The West Shore Railroad was constructed through the town in the early 1880s.

Local mining activity was relatively ephemeral, and the large Forest of Dean Mine was shut down in 1931. With the loss of its main industry, the town sank into decline, accelerated by the end of railroad passenger service in 1958.

Today, the hamlet is a well-known stop on the Appalachian trail due to the close proximity to the trail of its post office, food, and lodging.

<text>Gardnertown is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 4,542 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

Gardnertown is located within the town of Newburgh, and is approximately two miles northwest of the city of Newburgh, a completely separate municipality. It takes its name from Silas Gardner, an early settler whose stone house, a Registered Historic Place, remains in use as a private residence on Route 300 just north of Route 52.

Gardnertown is the geographic center of the Town of Newburgh. Accordingly, most of the governmental buildings, including the Town Hall, the Police Department, and the Code Compliance (Old Town Hall) building, are all located in Gardnertown. The Town Justice Court is located about a mile and a half to the north.

==History==
Gardnertown is named after the Silas Gardner family, whose home is still standing and in private use. Gardnertown Road was cut in half to make way for the NYS Thruway in the mid-1950s (as was Orr Avenue in the southern part of the Town). Site of the gunpowder mill, on Powder Mill Road, which is the centerpiece of the Orange Mill Historic District, the only historic district within the Town. The ruins of the mill are now part of Algonquin Park, owned and maintained by the Orange County Department of Parks and Recreation. The current Gardnertown Methodist Church building was constructed at its current location, the intersection of Gardnertown Road and Union Avenue, in 1858, replacing an earlier church built in 1825. The fellowship hall was built in 1957. The church is affiliated with Gardnertown Cemetery, one of the oldest cemeteries in the Town still in use, which is located both immediately east of the church, across Union Avenue, and south of the church, across Gardnertown Road. The Town of Newburgh American Legion Post 1420 is located on Union Avenue a short distance south of Gardnertown Methodist Church. Gardnertown Elementary School was located on Gardnertown Road. A new school was built on Plattekill Turnpike in the mid-1950s, where it remains today. The former schoolhouse then became Newburgh Town Hall. (Previously, the Town Hall was located in a building on Old South Plank Road, about a half a mile to the south. That building is no longer standing.) When the current Town Hall was constructed and opened next door in 1973 (at 1496 Route 300), the former schoolhouse became police headquarters. When the current police headquarters was built and opened next door in the other direction in 1989 (at 300 Gardnertown Road), it became an auxiliary Town Hall, housing the Code Compliance, Planning and Zoning Departments.

<text>Greenwood Lake is a village in Orange County, New York, United States, in the southern part of the town of Warwick. As of the 2020 census, the population of the village was 2,994. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Greenwood Lake was settled by Europeans as a farming community in the 1700s in the area of an earlier village occupied by the Munsee Indians. The Munsees, considered a branch of the Lenape people (also known as the Delaware), were Algonquian speakers who called the lake &quot;Quampium.&quot;

Some of the farms at the head of the lake were purchased by the Morris Canal and Banking Company in 1837, and portions of these properties were inundated after a dam was built that same year. It greatly increased the size of the lake to its current condition. The enlarged lake attracted tourists, and a grand hotel operated by Theron Felter was operating within the area of the village by at least 1851. The development of the village dates to 1856, when most of the available land was purchased by Solomon Caldwell. He divided the land for sale as “hotels, villa sites and town lots.” Subsequent plot plans suggested renaming the community the “town of Avington” in 1884, and “Montelac Park” in 1890, but it remained Greenwood Lake, becoming incorporated as a village in 1924. In the ensuing years many prominent people, such as baseball star Babe Ruth and actress Greta Garbo, regularly visited the resort. Author and composer Satella Waterstone was born in Greenwood Lake in 1875.

In July 2011, director Rob Reiner&#x27;s movie, &quot;The Magic of Belle Isle&quot; starred Morgan Freeman, Virginia Madsen and Kenan Thompson. The movie was shot entirely in Greenwood Lake.

<text>Hamptonburgh is a town located in the north central part of Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 5,489 at the 2020 census. The municipal offices are at the hamlet of Campbell Hall.

==History==
The town was part of the patent of 1703, assigned to Christopher Denn and others. Hamptonburgh was named by an early settler, William Bull, for his place of birth, Wolverhampton, England.
Bull married Sarah Wells. Bull was a stone mason and built many stone houses in area. He built what is now known as General Henry Knox&#x27;s Headquarters, used as a headquarters in the American Revolution. William and Sarah married in 1718 and built the Bull Stone House on 100 acres, now at the intersection of the Sarah Wells Trail and County Route 51. They raised 12 children to adulthood, who all married and raised children to adulthood. Today, the Bull Family still owns and occupies the Bull Stone House, hold America&#x27;s second longest annual family reunion, and have maintained their genealogy since 1796. In his lifetime, Bull amassed thousands of acres around his original 100. He left much of it to his five sons, who handed much of it down to their children. William Bull and Sarah Wells are buried in the Hamptonburgh Cemetery. William died in the winter of 1755/56. Sarah died at the age of 100 years and 15 days in 1796.

The town was established in 1830 from parts of the Towns of Blooming Grove, Goshen, and Montgomery, including land which previously belonged to Loyalist Fletcher Mathews (brother of David Mathews who was Mayor of New York City) during its occupation by the British during the American Revolution).

===Campbell Hall===
====Early years====
According to &quot;An Outline History of Orange County&quot; by Samuel Watkins Eager p. 378, the hamlet of Campbell Hall was named for Colonel Campbell who was a Scotchman, had two sons, and when the war of the Revolution commenced, one son sided with England, the other with his adopted country. The Tory brother would not speak with his Republican relative. The sentiments of this brother were changed by the happy results of the revolution.

====Railroads====
From 1900 to about 1960, Campbell Hall was a center of considerable railroad activity. The Erie, New York Ontario and Western, Lehigh and New England, New York Susquehanna and Western, came together and interchanged freight at the nearby large Maybrook railroad yard. NYO&amp;W, financially struggling from inception, abandoned operations in 1957. Freight business for the other railroads diminished too, causing a considerable loss of railroad employment for Hamptonburgh.

It is also the location of the Otterkill Fire Department and the Campbell Hall post office. Its economy is derived from a number of sources: The General Store, Campbell Hall Salvage, American Fence, a Service Station, the Bull&#x27;s Head Inn, and a number of horse and dairy farms.

==Geography==

==History==
The village is named after E. H. Harriman, former president of the Union Pacific railroad, whose estate — Arden — is adjacent to the village. Previously, the village was known as Turner, from the early restaurant of Peter Turner.

=== Charles Minot&#x27;s achievement ===
In 1851, Charles Minot was waiting in a train parked at Turner Station, until seeing the new telegraph wires next to the tracks. He ran into the station and wired to Monroe, to see if the eastbound train had passed them already, which they responded no. Minot then ordered the train engineer to proceed to Goshen, but refused. Instead of giving up, Minot got into the cab and drove the train himself to Goshen, then all the way to Port Jervis, hours ahead of schedule. Minot&#x27;s way of communication was a first for the railroad industry at the time, which prompted a monument to be erected in 1912 along with a large ceremony, with many notable people attending such as the Erie president Frederick Underwood, Mrs. Harriman and more. In the 1980&#x27;s, the bronze tablet on the monument was briefly removed by Conrail for &quot;preservation purposes&quot; but placed back after community backlash. the tablet was then stolen again by an unknown party, and has yet to be returned. It is unknown whether Conrail removed it again or if it was stolen for scrap.

=== Railroad service in Harriman ===
&quot;Main Article: Harriman Station (Erie Railroad)&quot;

In 1838, Peter Turner had constructed a large, extravagant train depot named the Orange Hotel. It was 3 stories tall, with a large dining hall and lavish rooms. It sat along the train tracks for the New York &amp; Erie Railroad and was a fairly popular place for people to stop. But on December 26th, 1873, the hotel had caught fire in the attic. Due to a lack of fire suppression equipment in the surrounding area, it was unable to be extinguished and the building completely collapsed within half an hour.

The station was replaced with a small depot that local residents described as a &quot;disgraceful shack&quot; until in 1909 when Mary Harriman (widow of E. H. Harriman) donated land farther south to build a new station, since the shack was on the verge of collapse at that point. In 1910 with the death of Harriman, the Turner Village improvement Association proposed renaming Turner to Harriman. The association voted 58 to 13 to change the name. The village was severely divided on this manner, with one church putting up a banner reading &quot;LONG LIVE TURNER.&quot; The village responded by tearing down the banner. After this controversy had subsided, work began on the new station depot. with $6,000 donated from Harriman&#x27;s widow, the station was much better designed, with a style that closely matched Tuxedo&#x27;s station to the south.

The new station served the Erie Railroad for decades, until it&#x27;s bankruptcy where service was transitioned into the newly formed Erie Lackawanna Railway, then into Conrail only 16 years later, and finally the Metro-North Railroad. by the 1980&#x27;s the station was boarded up and train service had been transitioned onto the present day route, with a new station being constructed south of Harriman on Route 17. The station remained decaying until 2006 where the Harriman building inspectors told Norfolk Southern Railway (the current owners of the land it stood on) to either refurbish the station or tear it down, which the railroad decided to tear it down to save costs. Presently, the former railroad from River Road, Harriman to East Main Street, Middletown has been converted into a 19.5 mile long shared-use path named the Heritage Trail.

=== Harriman Bicentennial Capsule ===
On July 4th, 1976, a time capsule was placed in a small park between South Main Street and Grove street. It was named the Harriman Bicentennial Capsule, and will be opened on July 4th, 2026.

=== New Village Hall ===
In 2019, the Village Hall was demolished with plans to build a larger one combining the Village Hall and Police station, but plans had been halted with the 2020 COVID Outbreak. In the meantime, village services were moved to the back portion of a closed school just a little down North Main Street.

===Harriman State Park===
Harriman State Park, just east of the village, is the second biggest state park in New York. The park is located in Orange and Rockland counties 30 miles north of New York City. The park is known for its 31 lakes, vistas, and public camping areas. Harriman State Park borders Bear Mountain State Park and the United States Military Academy&#x27;s forest reserve, as well as partially bordering Sterling Forest State Park to the southwest. 
E.H. and Mary Harriman owned 30,000 acres of land on part of their estate in Arden, New York. The state made a decision to build a prison at Bear Mountain. The Harrimans opposed this action and wanted to donate some of their land to the state in order to build a park. Once E.H. died, Mary made a proposal to the Governor that she would make a donation of 10,000 acres and $1 million for the establishment of a new state park. The state must stop the plan to build the prison with $2.5 million to gain more land and construct park facilities. 
By 1913, Major William A. Welch began constructing the road from Bear Mountain to Sloatsburg, which is known today as Seven Lakes Drive. Several roads were being created around Bear Mountain in order to make it easier for the public to get to the new park. There was even a steamboat service from Manhattan that would transport people back and forth with the cost of 85 cents for adults and 45 cents for children.

There are more than 40 known hiking trails located in Harriman, as well as over 30 lakes and ponds.

===Woodbury Common Premium Outlets===
The Woodbury Common Premium Outlets is a major tourist attraction in New York.

The outlet opened in 1985, expanded 8 years later, and again in 1998. The center has 220 stores covering over 800,000 square feet of land and is one of the largest outlet centers in the world. Because of the immense size, there are different sections that are arranged by colors to make it easier for the public to find the store they are looking for. On the weekend there is a trolley service that is available to transport shoppers around the center and from the parking lots. 
Woodbury Common is a major attraction for foreign tourists visiting the area. The most common tourists are Japanese because the outlet has cheaper prices than if the people were to get the same item in the country. Some stores claim that 40-50% of the profit they make comes from Japanese tourists. There are shuttle buses from New York City that make the trip to the commons. This outlet goes down in history as one of the most popular centers for tourism in the United States.

<text>Kiryas Joel (, ; often locally abbreviated as KJ) is a village coterminous with the Town of Palm Tree in Orange County, New York, United States. The village shares one government with the town. The vast majority of its residents are Yiddish-speaking Hasidic Jews who belong to the worldwide Satmar sect of Hasidism. 

Kiryas Joel is the largest municipality and largest principal city in the Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, supplanting Middletown in 2023, which in turn forms part of the New York Combined Statistical Area.

According to the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey, Kiryas Joel has by far the youngest median age population of any municipality in the United States, and the youngest, at 13.2 years old, of any population center of over 5,000 residents in the United States.

Residents of Kiryas Joel, like those of other Haredi and Orthodox Jewish communities, typically have large families, and this has driven rapid population growth.

According to 2020 census figures, the village has a high poverty rate with about 40% of the residents living below the federal poverty line. It is also the place in the United States with the highest percentage of people who reported Hungarian ancestry, as 18.9% of the population reported Hungarian descent in 2000.

Abe Wieder has served as mayor of Kiryas Joel since 1997; Gedalye Szegedin has served as its administrator since 2004 or earlier.

==History==
Kiryas Joel is named for Joel Teitelbaum, the late &quot;rebbe&quot; of Satmar and driving spirit behind the project.

The Satmar Hasidim came from Satu Mare, Romania, known when under Hungarian rule as Szatmár. Teitelbaum, originally from Austria-Hungary, rebuilt the Satmar Hasidic dynasty after World War II. 

In 1947, Teitelbaum settled with his followers in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City. 

By the 1970s, he decided to move the growing community to the Town of Monroe, a suburban location in Upstate New York that was more secluded from what he considered the harmful influences and immorality of the outside world, yet still close enough to the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s commercial center. The land for Kiryas Joel was purchased in the early 1970s, and 14 Satmar families settled there in the summer of 1974. Monroe town officials initially expressed skepticism over Teitelbaum&#x27;s and his followers&#x27; plans to build multi-family housing in Kiryas Joel, but they eventually allowed the village to incorporate in 1976. When he died in 1979, Teitelbaum was the first person to be buried in the village&#x27;s cemetery. His funeral reportedly brought over 100,000 mourners to Kiryas Joel.

In 2001, Kiryas Joel held a competitive election in which all candidates supported by the grand rebbe were re-elected by a 55–45% margin.

In 2019, the village of Kiryas Joel separated from the town of Monroe, to become part of the town of Palm Tree, New York&#x27;s first new town in 38 years. On July 1, 2018, governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill to create Palm Tree, triggering elections for the first governing board. The new town had 10 elected positions on the November 2018 ballot, including a supervisor, four council members, and two justices to preside over a town court.

The name &quot;Palm Tree&quot; is a calque (translation) of the surname/family name of Joel Teitelbaum. In Yiddish, &quot;teitel&quot; (טייטל) means &quot;date palm&quot; and &quot;baum&quot; means &quot;tree&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), and only a very small portion of the area (a small duck pond called &quot;Forest Road Lake&quot; in the center of the village) is covered with water.

==Demographics==


Kiryas Joel began with a 1977 founding population of 500 people.
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,229 households, and 2,137 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 2,233 housing units, at an average density of . The racial make-up of the village was 99.02% White, 0.21% African American, 0.02% Asian, 0.12% from other races, and 0.63% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.93% of the population.

Kiryas Joel has the highest percentage of people who reported Hungarian ancestry in the United States, as 18.9% of the population reported Hungarian ancestry in 2000. 3% of the residents of Kiryas Joel were Israeli, 2% Romanian, 1% Polish, and 1% European.

The 2000 census also reported that 6.3% of village residents spoke only English at home, one of the lowest such percentages in the United States. 91.5% of residents spoke Yiddish at home, while 2.3% spoke Hebrew. Of the overall population in 2000, 46% spoke English &quot;not well&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot;.

There were 2,229 households, out of which 79.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 93.2% were married couples living together, 1.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 4.1% were non-families. 2.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 5.74, and the average family size was 5.84. In the village, the population was very young, with 57.5% under the age of 18, 17.2% from 18 to 24, 16.5% from 25 to 44, 7.2% from 45 to 64, and 1.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 15 years. For every 100 females, there were 116.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 118.0 males.

The village abides by strict Jewish customs, and its welcome sign, which was installed in 2010, asks visitors to dress conservatively and to &quot;maintain gender separation in all public areas&quot;.

==Poverty and crime==
The median income for a household in the village is $40,218, and the per capita income for the village is $12,114.
According to 2020 census figures, the village has a high poverty rate with about 40% of the residents living below the federal poverty line. A 2011 &quot;New York Times&quot; report noted that, despite the town&#x27;s very high statistical poverty rates, &quot;It has no slums or homeless people. No one who lives there is shabbily dressed or has to go hungry. Crime is virtually non-existent.&quot;

==Transportation==
Kiryas Joel has a very high rate of public transportation usage. Local transit within the area is operated by the Village of Kiryas Joel Bus System, and also has service to Manhattan and to the heavily Haredi Jewish-populated Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn.

==Effects==
===Of growth===
====Friction with surrounding jurisdictions====
The village has become a contentious issue in Orange County for several reasons, mainly related to its rapid growth. Unlike most other small communities, it lacks a real downtown and much of it is given over to residential property, which has mostly taken the form of contemporary townhouse-style condominiums. New construction is ongoing throughout the community.

Population growth in Kiryas Joel is strong. In 2005, the population had risen to 18,300. The 2010 census showed a population of 20,175, for a population growth rate of 53.6% between 2000 and 2010, which was less than anticipated, as it was projected that the population would double in that time period.

====Locally====

The Town of Monroe also contains two other villages – Monroe, and Harriman. Kiryas Joel&#x27;s boundaries also come close to the neighboring towns of Blooming Grove and Woodbury.

Residents of these communities and local Orange County politicians view the village as encroaching on them. Due to the rapid population growth in Kiryas Joel, resulting almost entirely from the high birth rates of its Hasidic population, the village government has undertaken various annexation efforts to expand its area, to the dismay of the majority of the residents of the surrounding communities. Many of these area residents see the expansion of the high-density residential-commercial village as a threat to the quality of life in the surrounding suburban communities, due to suburban sprawl. Other concerns of the surrounding communities are the impact on local aquifers and the projected increased volume of sewage reaching the county&#x27;s sewerage treatment plants, already near capacity by 2005.

On August 11, 2006, residents of Woodbury voted, by a 3-to-1 margin, to incorporate much of the town as a village, to constrain further annexation. Kiryas Joel has opposed such moves in court.

In March 2007, the village of Kiryas Joel sued the county to stop it from selling off of excess capacity at its sewage plant in Harriman. Two years earlier, the county had sued the village to stop its plans to tap into New York City&#x27;s Catskill Aqueduct, arguing that the village&#x27;s environmental review for the project had inadequately addressed concerns about the additional wastewater it would generate. The village was appealing an early ruling which sided with the county. In its action, Kiryas Joel accused the county of inconsistently claiming limited capacity in its suit when it is selling the million gallons to three communities outside its sewer district.

In 2017, the village proposed to settle a lawsuit over some additional annexations it had proposed by petitioning the county legislature to allow it to become the county&#x27;s 21st town. It would be named Palm Tree, after the English translation of Joel Teitelbaum&#x27;s name. In return for the village dropping its request to annex , United Monroe and Preserve Hudson Valley, the plaintiffs, agreed to withdraw their appeal of a decision allowing the annexation of a parcel. The new town would also be prohibited from filing annexation proposals or encouraging the creation of new villages for 10 years. Two-thirds of the county legislature must approve the creation of the new town, and a vote of Monroe residents may also be required. The referendum passed on November 7, 2017.

===Local politics===

Critics of the village cite its impact on local politics. Villagers are perceived as voting in a solid bloc. While this is not always the case, the highly concentrated population often does skew strongly toward one candidate or the other in local elections, making Kiryas Joel a heavily courted swing vote for whichever politician offers Kiryas Joel the most favorable environment for continued growth. In the hotly contested 2013 Town Supervisors race, the Kiryas Joel bloc vote elected Harley Doles to the position of town supervisor. Kiryas Joel then sought to annex of land into their village and the new Monroe Town Board has had no comment on this issue. In late 2014 village leadership proposed alternatively that a new village, to be called Gilios Kiryas Joel, be created on the south of the village within Monroe, including all the land it had wanted to annex.

Kiryas Joel played a major role in the 2006 Congressional election. The village was at that time in the congressional district represented by Republican Sue Kelly. Village residents had been loyal to Kelly in the past, but in 2006, voters were upset over what they saw as lack of adequate representation from Kelly for the village. In a bloc, Kiryas Joel swung around 2,900 votes to Kelly&#x27;s Democratic opponent, John Hall. The vote in Kiryas Joel was one reason Hall carried the election, which he did by 4,800 votes.

In the 2020 presidential election, 98.5% of Kiryas Joel voters voted for Trump, one of the highest percentages in the country.

====Internal friction====
Joel Teitelbaum had no son, and thus no clear successor. His nephew, Moses, was appointed by the community&#x27;s committee members. But not all Satmar accepted Moses as the community leader, and even some of those who did questioned some of his actions and pronouncements. He responded by running the village in what they called an autocratic manner, through his deputy, Abraham Weider, who also served as mayor and president of the school board, as well as the main synagogue and yeshiva in the village.

In 1989, the village forbade any property owner from selling or renting an apartment without its permission. Teitelbaum elaborated that &quot;anyone that rents without this permission has to be dealt with like a real murderer ... and he should be torn out from the roots&quot;.

In the early 1990s, the New York State Police responded many times to the village, which has a generally low crime rate otherwise, when self-described dissidents reported harassment such as broken windows and graffiti containing profanity on their property. In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys stoning it; the boys later stoned a back-up police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider&#x27;s nephews was among those arrested. He admitted that some of the village&#x27;s young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could not bear to hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he said most of them were provoked to do so by dissidents.

&quot;Someone not following breaks down the whole system of being able to educate and being able to bring up our children with strong family values&quot;, Weider told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1992. &quot;Why do you think we have no drugs? If we lost respect for the Grand Rabbi, we lose the whole thing.&quot;

In January 1990, the village held its first, and, for a decade, only, school board election. &quot;It&#x27;s like this&quot;, Teitelbaum explained when he announced the names of seven hand-picked candidates. &quot;With the power of the Torah, I am here the authority in the rabbinical leadership ... As you know, I want to nominate seven people, and I want these people to be the people.&quot;

One dissident, Joseph Waldman, decided nevertheless to run on his own. He was made unwelcome at the synagogue, his children were expelled from yeshiva, his car&#x27;s tires slashed, and his windows broken. Several hundred residents marched in the streets in front of his house chanting, &quot;Death to Joseph Waldman!&quot;, after posters calling for that fate were posted in the synagogue. After the election, in which Waldman finished last, but still won 673 votes, 60 families who were known to have voted for him were barred from visiting their fathers&#x27; graves in the village cemetery that was owned by the rabbi, and banned from the synagogue (also, at the time, the village&#x27;s only polling place). Waldman compared Teitelbaum to Iran&#x27;s Ayatollah Khomeini.

After the election, a state court ruled that Waldman&#x27;s children had to be reinstated at the yeshiva, an action that was only taken after the judge held Teitelbaum in contempt and fined him personally. Friction continued as some of the dissidents banned from the synagogue circulated a petition calling for the polls to be moved to a neutral location. It originally drew 150 signatures, but all but 15 retracted their names after being threatened with excommunication by the grand rabbi, signing a document that they had not actually read the petition. One of the dissidents who signed was attacked while praying, and state troopers had to be called in again to disperse a mob that gathered on Waldman&#x27;s lawn and broke his windows.

In November 2017, a local divorce mediator and an Israeli rabbi with ties to the village were involved in the planning of a contract killing on an estranged husband. They were sentenced to prison.

====Electoral fraud allegations====
On four occasions since 1990, the Middletown &quot;Times-Herald Record&quot; has run lengthy investigative articles on claims of electoral fraud in the village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and in Brooklyn; a year later, the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001, absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a set date of expected return, and, thus, would not be allowed under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county grand jury investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed, and many mistakes were made, there was no evidence of deliberate intent to violate the law.

Before the 2013 Republican primary in that year&#x27;s special election for the state assembly seat vacated by Annie Rabbitt, later elected county clerk, members of United Monroe, a local group that organizes and co-ordinates political opposition to the village and those local officials it believes support it, asked the county&#x27;s Board of Elections to assign them to Kiryas Joel as election inspectors, who verify that voters are registered before allowing them to vote. The board&#x27;s Democratic commissioner, Sue Bahrens, initially agreed to appoint six to serve in the village, but later reversed that decision. The six sued the county, alleging religious discrimination; it responded that they had no standing to sue. Village Manager Gedalye Szegedin said the citizens were entitled to have inspectors who spoke Yiddish and understood their culture and customs. A state court justice dismissed the discrimination claim, but ruled that the United Monroe inspectors had been dismissed arbitrarily and capriciously, and were entitled to their appointments, but did not say when or where.

In 2014, the newspaper examined claims by poll watchers from United Monroe that they were intimidated and harassed by other poll watchers sympathetic to the village government when they tried to challenge voters whose signatures did not initially appear to match those on file during the previous year&#x27;s elections for county offices. They further alleged that election inspectors in the polling place, a banquet hall where 6,000 residents voted, sometimes gave the voters ballots before the signatures could be checked.

Some of the United Monroe poll watchers claimed that Langdon Chapman, an attorney for the Monroe town board, which they believe is controlled by members deferential to Kiryas Joel and its interests, was one of those who intimidated them. Coleman told the &quot;Record&quot; that while he had been at the banquet hall in question, he had only insisted that poll watchers state the reason for their challenges, as legally required, and had left after two hours. He was subsequently appointed county attorney (the lawyer who represents the county in civil matters) by new county executive Steve Neuhaus, whose margin of victory included all but 20 of the votes from the village.

After the election, United Monroe members found more than 800 voters in Kiryas Joel whose signatures did not match those on file, in addition to 25 they had challenged at the polls, three of whom were later investigated by the county sheriff; the rest were considered unfounded. Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler, elected along with Neuhaus, told the newspaper it was difficult to investigate the allegations, since they could not verify the identity of either signer, if, in fact, there were two. The &quot;Record&quot; attempted to contact some of those voters; the only one they reached hung up when asked about the election.

===Large families===
Women in Kiryas Joel usually stop working outside the home after the birth of a second child. Most families have only one income, and many children. The resulting poverty rate makes a disproportionate number of families in Kiryas Joel eligible for welfare benefits, when compared to the rest of the county. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote,

A 60-bed post-natal maternal care center was built with $10 million in state and federal grants. Mothers can recuperate there for two weeks away from their large families.

====Hepatitis A and vaccine trial====
In the 1990s, the first clinical trials for the hepatitis A vaccine took place in Kiryas Joel, where 70 percent of residents had been affected. This disproportionate rate of hepatitis A infection was due in part to Kiryas Joel&#x27;s high birth rate and crowded conditions among children, who bathed together in pools and ate from communal food at school. Children who were not infected with hepatitis A were separated into two groups, one receiving the experimental vaccine and the other receiving a placebo injection. Based on this study, the vaccine was declared 100 percent effective. Merck licensed the vaccine in 1995, and it became available in 1996, after which the hepatitis A infection rate fell by 75 percent in the United States.

===Litigation===
The unusual lifestyle and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel has led to litigation on a number of fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of &quot;Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet&quot; that the Kiryas Joel School District, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community&#x27;s boys must ride buses driven by women.

In 2011, a case (&quot;Kiryas Joel Alliance v. Village of Kiryas Joel&quot;) against the village was heard in federal district court; the plaintiffs, who were followers of competing factions of Satmar to Rebbe Aron Teitelbaum&#x27;s, argued that the control of the village government by the Aronite faction&#x27;s supporters was being abused to discriminate against them. The case was dismissed, and in 2012 the Second Circuit rejected their appeal of the dismissal.

==Education==
Most students go to private religious schools; in 2021 there were about 12,000 students attending them. In 2020, the area had nearly two dozen such schools. In 1994 Kiryas Joel had 5,000 children in the K-12 level with the majority going to private yeshivas and about 200 going to the public special education school.

The public Kiryas Joel School District has a school for special education students. Before 1985, special education students were taught by public school teachers in separate classes within yeshivas, and between 1985 and 1989 special education students were taught in Monroe–Woodbury Central School District facilities. In 2022–2023, the school district had a public school enrollment of 165 students.

<doc id="126944" wikidata="Q3461449" url="?curid=126944" title="Maybrook, New York">
<text>Maybrook is a village in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 3,150 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

It is located mostly in the town of Montgomery, but a small portion is in the town of Hamptonburgh. It is also defined by the 427 telephone exchange in the 845 area code and the 12543 ZIP code, as well as its own eponymous fire district.

==Geography==
Maybrook is located at (41.486660, −74.214463).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The village is centered on NY 208, which runs through it for the village&#x27;s two-mile (3.2 km) length in a northeast–southwest orientation, from the small extension in the Town of Hamptonburgh to its northern boundary. By contrast, it is only one mile wide at its widest point, near its south end, and even narrower to the north.

The village is mostly flat, rising up to hills on its western side. The summit of one is its highest elevation, at above sea level. Maybrook&#x27;s lowest point is a swampy, undeveloped area in iterns northeast corner, in elevation.

===Stewart Dairy Farm===
In 1930 Thomas &quot;Archie&quot; Stewart, an early aviation enthusiast and descendant of prominent local dairy farmer Lachlan Stewart, convinced his uncle Samuel Stewart to donate &quot;Stoney Lonesome&quot;, split between the towns of Newburgh and New Windsor, to the nearby city of Newburgh for use as an airport.

In the early 1970s, Governor Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s administration saw the potential for Stewart Airport to support the metropolitan area. Its long runway made it particularly attractive for intercontinental service via supersonic transport (SST), then under development in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was the first government body to try to convert it into the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s fourth major airport. It tripled the airport&#x27;s territory, extending its land well beyond its previous western boundary at Drury Lane, a two-lane rural road. The state government used its eminent domain powers to take for terminals, runways and a buffer zone expanding the airport from Newburgh into neighboring towns of Montgomery and a small portion of Hamptonburgh. The land was bounded by I-84 to the north, NY 207 along the south and roughly by Rock Tavern and Maybrook in the west.

==History==
The hamlet was not incorporated as a village until 1926, making it the last of the town of Montgomery&#x27;s three villages to be created. Its growth was spurred by the development of Maybrook Yard, an important railroad switching terminal where eastbound traffic from several railroads was funneled across the Poughkeepsie Bridge. At its peak, the yard employed over 1,500 workers. All yards, terminals and roundhouses have since been removed following the closing of the Poughkeepsie Bridge in 1974. There remains freight service to Maybrook via the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad.

==Transportation==
Maybrook is accessible by Interstate 84, the New York State Thruway and Stewart International Airport. New York State Route 208 is the main north–south road through the center of the village. Yellow Freight operated a center in the village (occupying a large part of the former rail yard) until it ceased operations in 2023. 

Campbell Hall station, on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Port Jervis Line, is 5.4 miles to the southwest. The station on the Hudson Line is 16.1 miles to the east.

==Education==
In almost all of the village, the school district is Valley Central School District (Montgomery). A small piece extends into the Washingtonville Central School District.

<text>Middletown is the largest city in Orange County, New York, United States. It lies in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley region, near the Wallkill River and the foothills of the Shawangunk Mountains. Middletown is situated between Port Jervis and Newburgh, New York. At the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 30,345, reflecting an increase of 2,259 from the 28,086 counted in the 2010 census. The ZIP Code is 10940. Middletown falls within the Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area, which belongs to the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY–NJ–CT–PA Combined Statistical Area.

Middletown was incorporated as a city in 1888. It grew in the 19th and early 20th centuries as a stop on several lower New York State railroads, attracting several small manufacturing businesses. SUNY Orange, the &quot;Times-Herald Record&quot;, U.S. Postal Service, County of Orange, Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, Orange &amp; Rockland Utilities, and the City of Middletown are major employers in Middletown. Many residents also work at the Galleria at Crystal Run, Walmart, Media Communications Corp, and Garnet Health in the nearby Town of Wallkill.

==History==

===Early history===
John Green purchased land from the DeLancey patent and probably settled the area around 1744. Due to its location between other settlements, residents adopted the name of Middletown, changing it later to South Middletown to avoid confusion with a nearby location. Eventually they dropped the word &quot;south&quot;, using the current name when the community became a village in 1848. The village was incorporated as a city in 1888.

The First Congregational Church of Middletown, established in 1785, has the highest spire downtown. Construction of its first building was a sign of Middletown becoming established as a village. Its current church building was constructed in 1872.

===Growth===
Middletown grew through the 19th century, stimulated by construction of the Erie Railroad and the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (among others). The city was industrialized, developing factories for various industries, such as shoes, lawnmower blades, and furniture. These did well through the World War II era.

The Webb Horton mansion and adjoining 18 acres were donated to establish Orange County Community College in 1950.

Due to industrial restructuring, most of the old manufacturing businesses had closed by the 1960s. In 1968, Middletown annexed the adjacent Village of Amchir. In the 1970s, the economy of Middletown and surrounding communities suffered additional blows due to the closing of a large Ford Motor Company plant in Mahwah, New Jersey, and the downsizing of IBM operations in the area.

Responding to higher housing costs in New York City, from the 1970s, New York City police officers, firefighters and other workers began to move to the area, as local housing offered better value. These commuters, who drove two hours each way, helped to bolster the economy of the area. After 1986, however, New York City required its municipal employees to reside in the city, and Middletown lost this source of residential development. The only railroad left in town is the Middletown and New Jersey Railway, a freight line. The population has continued to grow into the 21st century, while the economy has shifted largely to service and retail, with a regional medical center a major employer in the area.

===Modern Middletown===
The downtown business district of Middletown suffered from suburbanization that drew off retail businesses. The &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; shopping strip and Lloyd&#x27;s Supermarket were developed in the late 1960s and two later shopping malls, all located in nearby Town of Wallkill along Route 211, near the intersection of Route 17 and Interstate 84. The Orange Plaza mall in the Town of Wallkill drew several of the downtown shops into it by the mid-1970s, weakening the City of Middletown&#x27;s downtown. Also in the Town of Wallkill, the Galleria at Crystal Run opened in the early 1990s, and in 2001 the Shoppes at Orange Plaza replaced the Orange Plaza mall. Some of the buildings downtown are abandoned or underused, but there has long been an active downtown with small business, professional offices, bars and restaurants.

The downtown area has several historic churches. The Middletown City Hall and City Court are located on James Street. Prosperous neighborhoods include Presidential Heights. Highland Avenue is lined with large Victorian houses, some of the largest of which are now used as nursing homes. Other neighborhoods show the effects of loss of jobs and decline in the economy. The surrounding countryside was devoted partly to small dairy farms, but family farming has waned since the 1980s.

Middletown is the main business address for the newspaper &quot;Times Herald-Record&quot; and its owner, Local Media Group. Mediacom Communications Corp, a cable and other pay TV company, is headquartered outside the city in the Town of Wallkill. It is also a manufacturing location for Bell Flavors &amp; Fragrances.

==Places of interest==

The downtown area, particularly North and Main streets, has a variety of ethnic eateries and various small boutiques and thrift shops. Several churches are located in the neighborhood. The city has the single-screen, 1,100-seat Paramount Theatre, which also offers stage shows and concerts, a local arts council, a bowling alley, WALL and WOSR radio stations, Thrall Library and the Van Duzer Historical Society museum downtown.

Civic organizations include Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA chapters, as well as Lions Club, Elks Club, Kiwanis and Rotary Club. The Rotary Club runs a Horse Show at Fancher Davidge Park each fall. Middletown is the site of the Orange County Fair each summer and the Orange County Fair Speedway. Highland Lakes State Park is the nearest state park. Good choices for hiking, biking and country drives are nearby.

Shopping in the area includes the Galleria at Crystal Run, a mall just east of Middletown, and a long retail strip along Route 211 on the east side of town.

Middletown&#x27;s Hillside Cemetery was designed by the British architect and landscape designer Calvert Vaux, who worked with Frederick Law Olmsted to design Central Park in New York City. The J. W. Chorley Elementary School, designed by the American architect Paul Rudolph, was built in the 1960s and demolished in 2013.

==Health care==
Health care services are provided at Garnet Health Medical Center (formerly Orange Regional Medical Center), a hospital located in the town of Walkill. ORMC was completed in 2011, merging the faculties of the former Horton Medical Center and Arden Hill Hospital. It is a major employer in the region.

<doc id="126947" wikidata="Q3428372" url="?curid=126947" title="Minisink, New York">
<text>Minisink is a town located in southwestern Orange County, New York, United States, northeast of the New Jersey border between the Town of Greenville and the Town of Warwick. The population was 4,621 at the 2020 census. The town is located near Interstate 84 and New York State Route 17 and lies approximately halfway between New York City and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Minisink is one of the oldest settlements in the region, with its origins tracing back to the early 18th century and the Minisink Patent, a significant colonial land grant. The area&#x27;s rich history includes Lenape Native American heritage and early European settlers, which continue to shape the town&#x27;s identity.
== History ==

Historically, the name Minisink, which dates to the mid 17th century, has applied to a much larger area than the current town, running as far north as Minisink Ford, twenty miles northwest of present-day Minisink, south to the Delaware Water Gap, thirty miles southwest of present-day Minisink, and from the Kittatinny Ridge to the east to the Pocono Mountains to the west (See ). The Minisink Patent, granted in 1704, was a somewhat smaller area, but still far larger than the present town, which was given its present boundaries in 1800. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the New York - New Jersey border was previously seven or eight miles north of its present location: Minisink was once in New Jersey.

First settled by Europeans around 1725, the jurisdiction was organized by Americans as a town in 1788 following the Revolutionary War. In the following decades, the Town of Minisink lost territory to newer towns: Deerpark (1798), Wawayanda (1849), and Greenville (1853). In 1871, the community of Unionville set itself off from the town by incorporating as a village.

==Geography==

==History==
The Native Americans called the lake &quot;Oussuk&quot;, meaning &quot;stony pond.&quot; The Dutch settlers called it &quot;Binnin&quot;, meaning &quot;water within land&quot; or &quot;water between other waters&quot;. In 1684, Gov. Thomas Donegan purchased the lake and surrounding territory from the Native Americans and divided this patent into numerous farms, most especially dairy farms. At the time of the Revolutionary War, a man named Capt. Thomas Machin owned and operated a saw mill, grist mill, and finally a mint in what is now the hamlet, at the very beginning of the outlet stream. An historical marker marks the site of Machin&#x27;s Mill on Lakeside Road. At that time, the lake began to be called Machin&#x27;s Pond. In the 1830s, a local clergyman named James R. Willson began calling the lake Orange Lake. The reasons for this name change remain obscure, but are probably related to its location in Orange County. One source claims that the fact that the lake was round like an orange was also a factor. Local legend states that many residents objected to this name change, but it did stick and remains the name of the lake and the hamlet to this day.

Because the lake is above sea level, its outlet stream (sometimes called Bushfield Creek) became a very popular site of mills. The largest was the Newburgh Bleachery, owned and operated by the Chadwick Family.

During the 19th century, the shores of the lake became a popular location for summer cottages. Transportation to the lake and the hamlet was difficult until 1895, when trolley service was established between the City of Newburgh and the Village of Walden, and Orange Lake, approximately the halfway point, became a popular stop. Soon after this Newburgh and Walden Electric Railway initiated service, a highly successful amusement park opened on the south shore of the lake. The trolley line went out of business in 1926. The amusement park went out of business during the Great Depression and was demolished in 1941.

A one-room schoolhouse was built for local children in 1849. The building remained basically unchanged until indoor plumbing was added in 1952. When the Orange Lake school system voted to merge with the Newburgh Enlarged City School District in 1963, the schoolhouse was closed and sold. , a sharp and young couple reside in the schoolhouse.

Our Lady of the Lake Roman Catholic chapel, a mission church of St. Patrick&#x27;s parish in the City of Newburgh, was constructed in 1939 and remains in active service today. Prior to the construction of the current chapel, Roman Catholic services were held in the ice house at Lakeview House. The Dan Leghorn Fire Department was organized around 1900.

Pine Point was a highly successful resort on a peninsula off the southern shore of the lake. During the big band era, many nationally known recording acts appeared at the resort, including Frank Sinatra and Benny Goodman. It opened for business in 1896, and was closed and demolished in 1953. Lakeview House on Lakeside Road originally opened in 1866 as a boarding house, and did business as O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Bar for many years. Today, it continues to do business as a restaurant under its original name.

In the late 1940s Mickey Spillane and a friend of his from the Army bought a woodlot on Rock Cut Road and lived in a house they built while he was writing for comic books. During that time he wrote &quot;I, The Jury&quot;, his first novel.

==Education==
The CDP is divided between the Valley Central School District (Montgomery), the Newburgh City School District, and the Wallkill Central School District. The comprehensive high school of the Newburgh district is Newburgh Free Academy.

It has previously been known as &quot;Shawangunk,&quot; &quot;Crawford,&quot; and &quot;Bloomfield.&quot; Another community named &quot;Crawford&quot; is located to the northwest in bordering Ulster County. This hamlet was an early terminus for a short line railroad, the Middletown &amp; Crawford Railroad. This line was bought by the Erie Railroad, which served the town until the 1970s.

As a result of reported unusual sightings during the mid-1980s, Pine Bush developed a reputation as the UFO capital of the world. This characterization was supported by Ellen Crystall&#x27;s book, &quot;Silent Invasion: The Shocking Discoveries of a UFO Researcher.&quot; The town has held an annual UFO festival for many years.

<doc id="126952" wikidata="Q976675" url="?curid=126952" title="Port Jervis, New York">
<text>Port Jervis is a city located at the confluence of the Neversink and Delaware rivers in western Orange County, New York, United States, north of the Delaware Water Gap. Its population was 8,775 at the 2020 census. The communities of Deerpark, Huguenot, Sparrowbush, and Greenville are adjacent to Port Jervis. Matamoras, Pennsylvania, is across the river and connected by the Mid-Delaware Bridge. Montague Township, New Jersey, also borders the city. The Tri-States Monument, marking the tripoint between New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, lies at the southwestern corner of the city.

Port Jervis was part of early industrial history, a point for shipping coal to major markets to the southeast by canal and later by railroads. Its residents had long-distance passenger service by railroad until 1970. The restructuring of railroads resulted in a decline in the city&#x27;s business and economy.

In the 21st century, from late spring to early fall, many thousands of travelers and tourists pass through Port Jervis on their way to enjoying rafting, kayaking, canoeing and other activities in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River and the surrounding area.

Port Jervis is part of the Kiryas Joel-Poughkeepsie-Newburgh metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area. In August 2008, Port Jervis was named one of &quot;Ten Coolest Small Towns&quot; by &quot;Budget Travel&quot; magazine.

== History ==

The first fully developed European settlement in the area was established by Dutch and English colonists c.1690, and a land grant of was formalized on October 14, 1697. The settlement was originally known as Mahackamack, after a Lenape word. It was raided and burned in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War, by British and Mohawk forces under the command of Mohawk leader Joseph Brant before the Battle of Minisink. Over the next two decades, residents rebuilt the settlement. They developed more roadways to better connect Mahackamack with the eastern parts of Orange County.

After the Delaware and Hudson Canal was opened in 1828, providing transportation of coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to New York and New England via the Hudson River, trade attracted money and further development to the area. A village was incorporated on May 11, 1853. It was renamed as Port Jervis in the mid-19th century, after John Bloomfield Jervis, chief engineer of the D&amp;H Canal. Port Jervis grew steadily into the 1900s, and on July 26, 1907, it became a city.

===Coming of the railroad===
The first rail line to run through Port Jervis was the New York &amp; Erie Railroad, which in 1832 was chartered to run from Piermont, New York, on the Hudson River in Rockland County, to Lake Erie. Ground was broken in 1835, but construction was delayed by a nationwide financial panic, and did not start again until 1838. The line was completed in 1851, and the first passenger train – with President Millard Fillmore and former United States Senator Daniel Webster on board – came through the city on May 14. The railroad went through a number of name changes, becoming the Erie Railroad in 1897.

A second railroad, the Port Jervis and Monticello Railroad, later leased to the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (O&amp;W), opened in 1868, running northeast out of the city, and eventually connecting to Kingston, New York, Weehawken, New Jersey and eastern connections.

Like the D&amp;H Canal, the railroads brought new prosperity to Port Jervis in the form of increased trade and investment in the community from the outside. However, the competition by the railroad, which could deliver products faster, hastened the decline of the canal, which ceased operation in 1898. The railroads were the basis of the city&#x27;s economy for the coming decades. Port Jervis became Erie&#x27;s division center between Jersey City, New Jersey and Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, and by 1922, 20 passenger trains went through the city every day. More than 2,500 Erie RR employees made their homes there.

The railroads began to decline after the Great Depression. A shift in transportation accelerated after World War II with the federal subsidy of the Interstate Highway System and increased competition from trucking companies. One of the first Class I railroads to shut down was the O&amp;W, on March 29, 1957, leaving Port Jervis totally reliant on the Erie. A few years later, in 1960, the Erie, also on a shaky financial footing, merged with Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna. Railroad restructuring continued and in 1976, the Erie Lackawana became part of Conrail, along with a number of other struggling railroads, such as the Penn Central. Since the breakup of Conrail, the trackage around Port Jervis has been controlled by Norfolk Southern. The decline of the railroads was an economic blow to Port Jervis. The city has struggled to find a new economic basis.

===Lynching and Racist incidents===
On June 2, 1892, Robert Lewis, an African American, was lynched, hanged on Main Street in Port Jervis by a mob after being accused of participation in an assault on a white woman. A grand jury indicted nine people for assault and rioting rather than Lewis&#x27;s lynching. Some literary critics argue that this event influenced Stephen Crane&#x27;s 1898 novella &quot;The Monster&quot;. Crane lived in Port Jervis from 1878 until 1883 and frequently visited the area from 1891 to 1897.

In the mid-1920s some residents in the area formed a Ku Klux Klan chapter, in the period of the KKK&#x27;s early 20th-century revival. They burned crosses on Point Peter, the mountain peak that overlooks the city.


===Geological history===
The city&#x27;s location at the confluence of the Delaware and Neversink rivers has made it subject to occasional flooding. There was flooding during the 1955 Hurricane Diane, and a flood-related rumor started a panic in the population. This incident was studied and a 1958 report issued by the National Research Council: &quot;The Effects of a Threatening Rumor on a Disaster-Stricken Community&quot;.

In addition to the rivers having flooded during periods of heavy rainfall, at times ice jams have effectively dammed the Delaware, also causing flooding. In 1875 ice floes destroyed the bridge to Matamoras, Pennsylvania. In 1981 a large ice floe resulted in the highest water crest measured to date at the National Weather Service&#x27;s Matamoras river gauge .

==Geography==
Port Jervis is located on the north bank of the Delaware River at the confluence where the Neversink River – the Delaware&#x27;s largest tributary – empties into the larger river. Port Jervis is connected by the Mid-Delaware Bridge across the Delaware to Matamoras, Pennsylvania.

From here the Delaware flows to the southwest, running parallel to Kittatinny Ridge until reaching the Delaware Water Gap. It heads southeastward, continuing past New Hope, Pennsylvania and Lambertville, New Jersey; and the New Jersey capital, Trenton; to Philadelphia, and the Delaware Bay.

Port Jervis is also home to the tri-point between New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (6.64%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Port Jervis has a Humid Continental Climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with relatively hot summers and cold winters. It receives approximately 47.18 inches (1,198 mm) of precipitation per year, most of which occurs in the late spring in early summer. Extremes range from −26 °F (−32 °C) on January 14, 1912, to 105 °F (40.5 °C) on July 9, 1936.

== Points of interest ==
===State line monuments===
Port Jervis lies near the points where the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania come together. South of the Laurel Grove Cemetery, under the viaduct for Interstate 84, are two monuments marking the boundaries between the three states.

The larger monument is a granite pillar inscribed &quot;Witness Monument&quot;. It is not on any boundary itself, but instead is a witness for two boundary points. On the north side (New York), it references the corner boundary point between New York and Pennsylvania that is located in the center of the Delaware River due west of the Tri-State Rock. On the south side (New Jersey), it references the Tri-State Rock to the south.

The smaller monument, the Tri-States Monument, also known as the Tri-State Rock, marks both the northwest end of the New Jersey and New York boundary and the north end of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania boundary. It is a small granite block with inscribed lines marking the boundaries of the three states and a bronze United States Coast and Geodetic Survey marker. Both monuments were erected in 1882.

== Transportation ==

US 6, U.S. Route 209, New York State Route 42, and New York State Route 97 (the &quot;Upper Delaware Scenic Byway&quot;) pass through Port Jervis. Interstate 84 passes to the south.

Port Jervis is the last stop on the Port Jervis Line, which is a commuter railroad service from Hoboken, New Jersey and New York City (via a Secaucus Transfer) that is contracted to NJ Transit by the Metro-North Railroad of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The track itself continues on to Binghamton and Buffalo, but passenger service west of Port Jervis was discontinued in November 1966.

Short Line provides bus service between Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Port Jervis, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

== Government ==

Port Jervis is governed by a mayor and a city council under a mayor–council government system. The city council has nine members: a councilman-at-large and eight members elected from wards. The city comprises four wards, residents of which elect two council members each for two year terms. The mayor and councilman-at-large are elected at large for two year terms. Elections are held in odd number years. Terms of office begin on January 1.

Representation in the state legislature is split between Democrats and Republicans. The city is located in the 98th Assembly district, currently represented by Republican Karl Brabenec. Democrat James Skoufis represents the city in the state senate as part of the 42nd district.

Port Jervis is a part of New York&#x27;s 18th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pat Ryan. Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand represent all of New York in the U.S. Senate, including the city.

==Education==
Port Jervis City School District operates public schools serving Port Jervis. The area elementary school, Anna S. Kuhl Elementary School, is in Deerpark but with a Port Jervis postal address. Port Jervis Middle School is in Port Jervis. Port Jervis High School is also in Deerpark but with a Port Jervis postal address. Kuhl and Port Jervis High are on the same property.

==Recreation==

The Port Jervis Recreation department maintains thirteen parks and squares. The city&#x27;s largest parks are Elks-Brox Park and Riverside Park. Elks-Brox Park, which includes Skyline Drive, the Elks-Brox Campground and the overlook at Point Peter, backs up to the much larger Port Jervis Watershed Park and Recreation Area, which together include more than sixty miles of hiking and biking trails. Riverside Park is home to the Riverside Disc Golf Course, the Port Jervis Pump Track, trails, playground equipment, basketball courts, and other facilities. Riverside Park is also home to a summer concert series, as well as movies in the park. The smaller Farnum Park at the end of Ulster Place is also home to a summer concert series and a playground and a basketball court. Basketball Courts can also be found at Church Street Park and West End Beach.

<text>Tuxedo is a town and village in Orange County, New York,United States, along the Ramapo River. As of the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 3,811. The village was incorporated in 2021 and comprises all of the town that is not part of the village of Tuxedo Park. As of the 2020 Census, the village has a population of 3169. The town is in the southeastern part of the county in the Ramapo Mountains. New York State Route 17 and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) pass through the town. The name is derived from a Lenape word &quot;tucseto&quot;, which has several known meanings.

==History==
The historic occupants of what is now the town of Tuxedo were the Lenni-Lenape, a branch of the large Algonquian language family of Native Americans, whose different branches lived along the East Coast from Canada through the Upper South. The Lenape named the largest lake in the area &quot;Tucseto,&quot; meaning either &quot;place of the bear&quot; or &quot;clear flowing water.&quot; European-American colonists later adopted that name for the town they developed.

Some Lenape stayed in villages in the Ramapo Mountains, having migrated west from Connecticut. They gradually intermarried with other ethnic groups in what was long a relatively remote frontier. They maintained a culture and community of their own in this area on both sides of the later border with New Jersey. The Ramapough Mountain Indians have been recognized by New Jersey as a Native American tribe.

===1700s===
In the 18th century, ethnic English and German colonists settled in the area. The men mostly worked at the nearby Sterling Iron Works in the neighboring Sterling Forest, as did some of the Ramapough Mountain Indians. Several men from the Tuxedo area served in the Revolutionary War.

In 1779 the rebel government built the Continental Road from Eagle Valley through the present-day village of Tuxedo Park to what is now Route 17 near Warwick Brook Road. The first industry in Tuxedo was the Augusta Forge at the falls on the Ramapo River, founded by Solomon Townsend in 1783, soon after the end of the war.

The town of Southfields (now part of the town of Tuxedo) was renamed Monroe in 1808. An iron forge was operated in this area, still known as Southfields; the forge ruins are still visible. The oldest documented structure in Tuxedo is the Adam Belcher house. Dating from 1790, it is located in the Southfields area.

===1800s===
By 1812, the Augusta Forge went out of business. Townsend sold the Augusta Tract to Pierre Lorillard II, who was in the tobacco business. Mining continued into the 1840s, until the iron ore was largely depleted. The Lorillards later used the tract for lumbering. It helped supply fuel for the wood-fired Erie Railroad, which was built in 1841.

The southern part of Tuxedo, known as Eagle Valley, was devoted to farming, as were areas just south of Lake Mombasha: Helmsburg and Bramertown were named after early colonial settlers. In the northern part of town, in the area known as Arden, the Greenwood Furnace was established in 1810. During the American Civil War, this forge produced the iron for the famous Parrott rifles, which were built at the West Point Foundry by the Parrott Brothers, then owners of the Greenwood tract.

The Southfields Methodist Church was built in 1848. The Parrotts built St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Arden in 1863. The cemetery along Route 17 in Arden was associated with St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built in 1867 but later closed due to demographic changes in residents. It was demolished. By the 1890s, the area iron industry had declined due to the decrease in ore and the discovery of the rich surface beds of the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.

The Town of Tuxedo was established twice from the Town of Monroe. First, in 1863 it was founded as the Town of Southfields by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, the legislative body of the county. The supervisors changed their decision in 1865 and the area was returned to Monroe. On December 19, 1889, the Board of Supervisors approved separating the Town of Tuxedo from Monroe. The act was implemented on March 4, 1890.

====Tuxedo Park====
Pierre Lorillard IV conceived the idea of the planned community of Tuxedo Park. In 1884 he began buying up his siblings&#x27; shares in the Augusta tract, with the intention of creating a hunting-and-fishing resort surrounding the 291-acre Tuxedo Lake. The mammoth development project, laid out by the architect Bruce Price and civil engineer Ernest W. Bowditch, was constructed by some 1,800 Italian and Slovak immigrant laborers in about eighteen months. 
&quot;When the Tuxedo Club opened on June 16, 1886, close to 5,000 acres [2,000 ha] had been planned, 30 miles [48 km] of macadam roads had been built, and 40 buildings stood complete. These were soon joined by a boathouse, a school, a racetrack, a golf course (possibly the second-oldest in the country), indoor tennis courts, a game preserve and breeding ponds, a swimming pool, an electrified toboggan run, 30 miles of bridle paths, and the first water, sewer, and telephone systems outside a major metropolis.&quot; 

The resort attracted a number of the financial, industrial and social leaders of the day, particularly those who worked in New York City. During the first thirty years, more than 250 houses and stables were built in Tuxedo Park, as well as retail stores and service buildings in the so-called hamlet. Three churches, all still standing (one is used by the Tuxedo Historical Society today), a train station, a library, and a post office were also built, as well as a school and a hospital. Businessmen could commute by rail into New York City.

===1900s===
By 1915, 3,636 people lived in Tuxedo, about 20% more than were reported in the 1890 Census.

A major shift in landholding in Tuxedo started after 1910, when Mrs. W. A. Harriman gave $1 million and of her family&#x27;s land to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The state gradually purchased additional farm and forest land from scores of owners, often by eminent domain, resulting in the present Bear Mountain-Harriman State Park, which occupies about 12,500 of Tuxedo&#x27;s .

During the 1920s a new hospital and a high school were built by major donations from some residents. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 had a disproportionately adverse effect on Tuxedo Park&#x27;s affluence, as numerous residents lost their financial jobs. A slow, but severe decline in the community&#x27;s fortunes set in, resulting in a population decline and the loss of such amenities as the hospital, the Masonic Temple (now used as the Town Hall), and many retail stores.

In 1956, the Harrimans sold their Sterling Mine and Railroad Company tract to City Investing Company (now Sterling Forest LLC). It developed Maple Brook, Laurel Ridge, Clinton Woods and various offices and research centers on its in the Town of Tuxedo.

In 1952, the area known as Tuxedo Park became an incorporated village. Today it comprises , of which is three lakes, and about 340 housing units in 320 structures. Other newer housing developments include the Southfields Apartments built in 1971 on the site of a former bed factory, the Mountain View Apartments near the Sloatsburg line, and the Woodlands in Eagle Valley. Non-residential facilities include International Paper&#x27;s Research Center, the Red Apple Restaurant, and the Sterling Forest Ski Area.

The men&#x27;s evening wear known as a &quot;tuxedo&quot;, the main component of &quot;black tie&quot; dress, was associated with the wealthy residents of Tuxedo Park.

The area known as Tuxedo Park separated from the Town of Tuxedo and became incorporated in 1952, adopting the village form of government. Today it comprises , of which includes three lakes, and about 330 housing units in 340 structures. In recognition of its historical and architectural significance, the historic district was listed as Tuxedo Park on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1980. In 1982 the designation was officially presented to Mrs. Joan Richardsson Alleman, Co-Chairman of the Tuxedo Conservation and Taxpayers Association, at the Washington&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site in nearby Newburgh. The designation was presented by Mr. Oren Lehman, Commissioner of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation and is proudly displayed at the Tuxedo Park Village Office.

===Incorporation and Consolidation===

On July 16, 2019, voters from the area of the town outside of Tuxedo Park voted to incorporate the rest of the town as the Village of Tuxedo, to prevent new incorporations of villages and to enable the town government to prevent oil pipelines from crossing the town. On the same day, voters from the entire town voted to immediately consolidate the new village with the town. Supporters of this referendum wanted to avoid the conflicts brought on by the Town of Woodbury and the Village of Woodbury having separate governments. The Village of Tuxedo subsequently incorporated on December 23, 2019, and the town and village governments consolidated on January 1, 2021.

<text>Tuxedo Park is a village in Orange County, New York, United States. Its population was 645 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown metropolitan area as well as the larger New York metropolitan area. Its name is derived from an indigenous Lenape word of the Munsee language, &#x27; or&#x27;, which is said to mean &#x27;crooked water&#x27; or &#x27;crooked river&#x27;.

Tuxedo Park is a gated village in the southern part of the town of Tuxedo, near New York Route 17 and the New York State Thruway.

The evening dress for men now popularly known as a &quot;tuxedo&quot; takes its name from Tuxedo Park. It was brought there by James Brown Potter, who was introduced to the garment, which is called a dinner jacket in England, by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII).

==History==
The park is in the Ramapo Mountains. In the colonial era, it acquired a reputation for undeveloped iron deposits. In consequence, a company formed in England and headed by William Alexander, Lord Stirling, acquired a large tract in the neighborhood. The company built furnaces near Ringwood and opened mines on the Ramapo River near Sterling Lake. Pierre Lorillard II acquired the company and its land holdings in 1790. Once the iron deposits were depleted, the land was used for lumbering.

What is now the village and the areas immediately surrounding it were first developed as a private hunting-and-fishing reserve by Pierre Lorillard IV in 1885. At that time it became known as &quot;Tuxedo Park&quot;. Lorillard IV initially built small cottages, renting or selling them to his friends and family. The project grew so popular that he organized the Tuxedo Club and the Tuxedo Park Association, and surrounded the property with a high game fence. This fence fairly accurately marked the present boundaries of the area restricted to use of the residents of Tuxedo Park. In 1924 the Tuxedo Securities Corporation acquired from the Estate of Peter Lorillard, deceased, all of the stock of the Tuxedo Park Association.

The original clubhouse, designed by Bruce Price, was built in 1886 and was then replaced by a second clubhouse in 1928, which was designed by John Russell Pope. This building was destroyed by fire in 1943, and was partially rebuilt soon thereafter.

The shingle style cottages Price built at Tuxedo, with their compact massing and axial plans influenced Modernist architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright. Queen Anne architecture with Tudor elements became popular for residences.

Tuxedo Park enjoyed many prosperous years from 1885 until the 1920s. &quot;The Blue Book of Etiquette&quot; was written by Emily Post, who was the daughter of Bruce Price. She wrote the book based on what she observed inside the great stone gates of Tuxedo. Other Tuxedo notables from that era include:
* Grenville Kane – banker, heir, and longtime resident
* Dorothy Draper – interior designer
* Adele Colgate – heir to the Colgate/Palmolive fortune
* Fernando Yznaga – banker; brother of Consuelo Yznaga, Duchess of Manchester
* George Fisher Baker – banker
* J. P. Morgan – banker
* Alfred Lee Loomis – investment banker, scientist
* William Waldorf Astor
* Herbert C. Pell
* Augustus Juilliard
* Millicent Rogers
* James Whitmore

During the 1920s a new hospital and a high school were built through the generosity of a few Tuxedo Park residents, including John Insley Blair. In the years following the Great Depression, however, Tuxedo Park lost many of its socialites and wealthy inhabitants, but attracted a few new ones, as well. One of the new residences was built by Angier Biddle Duke, (cousin to Doris Duke), whose father-in-law, George Baker St. George, was an original resident of Tuxedo. St. George purchased and built for Duke and his wife, Priscilla St George, a new estate, &quot;Duck Hollow&quot;. Duck Hollow was the last built estate in Tuxedo Park by the old &quot;blue blood elite&quot;. While Duke and his wife were traveling abroad, as most elites did at that time, St. George had landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll landscape the property. By the time the Dukes returned from Europe, the property had been transformed and appeared to have been there for over 100 years.

The area known as Tuxedo Park separated from the Town of Tuxedo and became incorporated in 1952, adopting the village form of government. Today it includes , of which includes three lakes, and about 330 housing units in 340 structures. Other newer housing developments outside of the gated Village of Tuxedo Park but in the Town of Tuxedo include the Tuxedo Heights Condominiums in Southfields built in 1971 on the site of a former bed factory, the Mountain View Apartments near the Sloatsburg line, and The Woodlands at Tuxedo (townhomes HOA) in the Eagle Valley section. The former private mansion residence of Loomis of Alfred Lee Loomis is sometimes referred to as the Loomis Laboratory, and it is now private rental apartments inside the Village of Tuxedo Park.

Outside of the gated Village of Tuxedo Park, in the Town of Tuxedo were the former Red Apple Rest, and the Sterling Forest Ski Center, aka Tuxedo Ridge Ski Resort. This former ski property is home to the New York Renaissance Festival and various sporting events including Spartan Races. Also in the Town of Tuxedo is a former International Paper Research Center today owned and occupied by Watchtower Organization. Just outside the gates of Tuxedo Park is the Hamlet of The Town of Tuxedo, which consists of numerous historic structures built around the time of the original Tuxedo Park development. Historic buildings include the Tuxedo Train station (Metro-North stop Tuxedo), the Tuxedo Park Library (designed by Bruce Price), and the Tuxedo Park Post Office and Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church.

In recognition of its historical and architectural significance, the historic district was listed as Tuxedo Park on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1980. In 1982 the designation was officially presented to Mrs. Joan Richardsson Alleman, Co-Chairman of the Tuxedo Conservation and Taxpayers Association, at the Washington&#x27;s Headquarters State Historic Site in nearby Newburgh, NY. The designation was presented by Oren Lehman, Commissioner of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation and is displayed at the Tuxedo Park Village Office.

<text>Unionville is a village in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 592 at the 2020 census, making it by far the smallest village in Orange County and one of the smallest in New York State.

The village is within the town of Minisink, southeast of Port Jervis, and is part of the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, Orange County, New York metropolitan statistical area as well as the larger New York City-Newark, New Jersey-Bridgeport, Connecticut and New York-New Jersey-Connecticut-Pennsylvania combined statistical area.

== History ==
The settlement was founded in the early part of the 18th century, and became known as Unionville around 1820. According to tradition, the name &quot;Unionville&quot; was applied to the place after a land dispute had been settled. Unionville was incorporated as a village in 1871. Once an important economic zone in the area, its decline followed the changes in transportation which favored other locations: the Middletown and Unionville Railroad shuttled agricultural products (especially milk) as well as high school students in the first half of the 20th century. By World War II, however, improved roads and a high school built far away from the train tracks led to the end of these services; passenger service on the line ended in 1968.

==Geography==
Unionville is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.2 square mile (0.6 km2), all land.

<text>Vails Gate is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 3,368 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

Vails Gate is in the southern part of the Town of New Windsor, located on Route 32. It is defined largely by the junction of that highway with Routes 94 and 300, a busy commercial center which has the ZIP code 12584. Part of that also spills into adjacent regions of the Town of Cornwall to the south.

== History ==
The locale has always been referred to as a neighborhood of New Windsor. In the 19th century, it became known as Vail&#x27;s Gate, after John D. Vail, a former postmaster and keeper of the Blooming Grove Turnpike tollgate. For the same reason, it was also earlier called Tooker&#x27;s Gate.

Vail served as the first postmaster of the New Windsor post office, established on April 10, 1850, being named the Mortonville Post Office. The name was finally changed to Vails Gate Post Office, which led to the apostrophe permanently dropping from the name. Efforts to change the name of the hamlet to Mortonville, after the Morton family, residents of the Ellison House, never occurred.

<text>Public Image Ltd (abbreviated and stylized as PiL) are an English post-punk band formed by lead vocalist John Lydon (previously, as Johnny Rotten, lead vocalist of the Sex Pistols), guitarist Keith Levene (a founding member of the Clash), bassist Jah Wobble, and drummer Jim Walker in May 1978. The group&#x27;s line-up has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member.

Following Lydon&#x27;s departure from the Sex Pistols in January 1978, he sought a more experimental &quot;anti-rock&quot; project and formed PiL in June of that year. PiL released their debut studio album &quot;First Issue&quot; (1978), creating an abrasive, bass-heavy sound that drew on dub, noise, progressive rock and disco. PiL&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Metal Box&quot; (1979) pushed their sound further into the avant-garde, and is often regarded as one of the most important albums of the post-punk era.

By 1984, Levene, Wobble and Walker had departed and the group was effectively a solo vehicle for Lydon, who moved toward a more accessible sound with the commercially successful studio albums &quot;This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get&quot; (1984) and &quot;Album&quot; (1986). After a late 1990s hiatus, Lydon reformed the group in 2009 and has released several further albums, including &quot;What the World Needs Now...&quot; (2015).

==History==
===Early career===
Following the Sex Pistols&#x27; break-up in 1978, photographer Dennis Morris suggested that Lydon travel to Jamaica with him and Virgin Records head Richard Branson, where Branson would be scouting for emerging reggae musicians. Branson also flew American new wave band Devo to Jamaica, aiming to install Lydon as lead vocalist in the band. Devo declined the offer.

Upon returning to England, Lydon searched for musicians but it was difficult. He stated in the press: &quot;I&#x27;m thinking about going up north for someone. They&#x27;ve got bands up there who are trying to be different&quot;. He approached Jah Wobble (né John Wardle) about forming a band together. The pair had been friends since the early 1970s when they attended the same school in Hackney (both belonged to a circle of friends Lydon informally dubbed &quot;The Gang of Johns&quot; – John Lydon, John Wardle, John Gray, and Simon John Ritchie/Beverley, a.k.a. Sid Vicious). Lydon and Wobble had previously played music together during the final days of the Sex Pistols. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. Lydon assumed, much as he had with Sid Vicious, that Wobble would learn to play bass guitar as he went. Wobble would prove to be a natural talent. Lydon also approached guitarist Keith Levene for the new band. Levene and Lydon had become acquainted while touring in mid-1976 when Levene was still a member of the Clash. At the time, Lydon and Levene had both considered themselves outsiders even within their own bands. Jim Walker, a Canadian student newly arrived in the UK, was recruited on drums, after answering an advertisement placed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; published on May 6, 1978.

The band began rehearsing together in mid-May 1978, although they were still unnamed. In July 1978, Lydon officially named the band &quot;Public Image&quot; (the &quot;Ltd&quot; was added when the company was incorporated in July 1978), after the Muriel Spark novel &quot;The Public Image&quot; (1968). PiL debuted in October 1978 with &quot;Public Image&quot;, a song written while Lydon was still a member of the Sex Pistols, and discussed his feelings of being exploited by their manager Malcolm McLaren. The single was well received and reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, and it also performed well on import in the US.

===&quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot; (1978)===
In preparing their debut studio album, &quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot;, the band spent their recording budget well before the record was completed. As a result, the final album comprised eight tracks of varying sound quality, half of which were written and recorded in a rush after the money had run out. The album was released in December 1978.

The single &quot;Public Image&quot; was widely seen as diatribe against Malcolm McLaren and his perceived manipulation of Lydon during his career with Sex Pistols. The track &quot;Low Life&quot; (with its accusatory lyrics of &quot;Egomaniac traitor&quot;, &quot;You fell in love with your ego&quot; and &quot;Bourgeoisie anarchist&quot;) has also been regarded as an attack on McLaren, although Lydon has stated that the lyrics refer to Sid Vicious. The two-part song &quot;Religion&quot; refers contemptuously to the Catholic Church; Lydon came up with the lyrics when he was part of the Sex Pistols but he claims the other members of the band were reluctant to use them. The closing track &quot;Fodderstompf&quot;, heavily influenced by dub, comprises nearly eight minutes of a circular bass riff, played over a Lydon/Wobble double act lampooning public outrage, love songs and teenage apathy, whilst openly acknowledging the lack of effort being put into it. The track culminates with the sound of a fire extinguisher being let off in the recording studio by Wobble. The photography for the album was shot by Dennis Morris who also created the PiL logo. Lydon disputes Morris creating the logo. 

&quot;PiL was the simple thing of four different people doing different drugs at different times,&quot; Wobble observed to &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;It was only in any way together for the first two months of its existence. We had a fuckin&#x27; good drummer called Jim Walker, but he fucked off after a few months [in early 1979] and it just fell apart. Somehow it had sort of death throes that produced a couple of blinding albums.&quot;

===&quot;Metal Box&quot; (1979) and &quot;Paris au Printemps&quot; (1980)===
The departure of Jim Walker made way for a series of new drummers. Auditions were later held at Rollerball Studios in Tooley Street, London Bridge. David Humphrey was their second drummer, who went on to record two tracks at Manor Studios in Oxford, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;Albatross&quot;, for &quot;Metal Box&quot;. &quot;Death Disco&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Swan Lake&quot;) was released as a single in 1979 and reached No. 20 in the charts. The majority of the drumming on the album was provided by Richard Dudanski (formerly of the 101ers), PiL&#x27;s drummer from April to September 1979. He was replaced by Karl Burns (of the Fall), who in turn was replaced by Martin Atkins. The recording and practice sessions were chaotic; Atkins said in 2001 that his audition was playing &quot;Bad Baby&quot; during a recording session--a take which was taped and released on &quot;Metal Box&quot;. Atkins was PiL&#x27;s drummer from 1979 to 1980 and 1982 to 1985.

&quot;Metal Box&quot; was originally released as three untitled 45-rpm 12-inch (30-cm) records packaged in a metal box resembling a film canister with an embossed PiL logo on the lid (it was later reissued in more conventional packaging as a double LP set, &quot;Second Edition&quot;), and features the band&#x27;s trademark hypnotic dub reggae bass lines, glassy, arpeggiated guitar, and bleak, paranoid, stream of consciousness vocals.

PiL had a series of contentious live shows and behind-the-scenes controversies during their first American tour in 1980. Their appearance at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles was fraught with hostile exchanges between Lydon and the audience. Tensions offstage mounted as well. PiL demanded that they work only with local promoters, bucking the promotional machinery of Warner Bros. Records, their American label. For both the Los Angeles and San Francisco appearances, PiL agreed to work with David Ferguson and his independent CD Presents label. This business arrangement pitted the band and CD Presents in a pitched battle against San Francisco-based promoter Bill Graham, who negotiated with concert venue owners and San Francisco government officials to deprive PiL of a concert location. Fearing public outbursts if the show was cancelled, San Francisco city officials instead opted to allow the CD Presents-sponsored event to proceed.

On 17 May 1980, the group appeared on the teenage music show &quot;American Bandstand&quot; at the invitation of host Dick Clark. PiL&#x27;s performance was chaotic; they abandoned lip-syncing, invited the audience onto the stage while the music played and Lydon clowned. Clark named the performance among his top 100 AB favorites.

In June 1980, Lydon and Levene were interviewed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; by host Tom Snyder. The interview was awkward (and combative at times). At one point, Snyder asked Lydon if PiL was a band to which Lydon replied with, &quot;We ain&#x27;t no band, we&#x27;re a company. Simple. Nothing to do with rock and roll. Doo Da.&quot; The segment ended with Snyder apologising to the audience: &quot;The interesting part is, is that we talked to these two gentlemen a couple of weeks ago, a pre-interview, apparently that went all just fine and it made great sense, and what I read about them this afternoon, but somehow it got a little lost in translation tonight. But that&#x27;s probably my fault.&quot; Lydon re-appeared on Tom Snyder&#x27;s show in 1997, and Snyder apologised about what happened that night. Lydon shook it off by saying &quot;it&#x27;s just entertainment&quot;, and the completely normal interview proceeded without difficulty.

1980 also saw the release of PiL&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Paris au Printemps&quot; – also the group&#x27;s last album featuring Jah Wobble. On this release&#x27;s album sleeve, the band&#x27;s name and all of the track titles were translated into French. The album cover was a painting by John Lydon depicting himself, Keith Levene and Jeannette Lee.

In May 1981, PiL appeared in New York at The Ritz, playing from behind a projection screen. Lydon, Levene and Jeanette Lee were joined by a new drummer, 60-year-old jazz player Sam Ulano, who had been recruited for the gig from a bar, having apparently never heard the band before. While something reminiscent of but clearly different from PiL improvised behind the screen, PiL records were played simultaneously through the PA. Lydon taunted the audience, who expected to hear familiar material (or at least see the band), and a melée erupted in which the audience pelted the stage with bottles and pulled on a tarp spread under the band, toppling equipment. The promoters cleared the hall and cancelled the next night&#x27;s show, and a local media furore ignited in New York.

===&quot;The Flowers of Romance&quot; (1981)===
Later in 1980, Jah Wobble left the band and was not formally replaced. The resulting studio album was notable for its almost complete lack of bass parts. Martin Atkins, who had initially joined at the tail end of the &quot;Metal Box&quot; sessions, was re-recruited to drum on &quot;The Flowers of Romance&quot;. Levene had by then largely abandoned guitar in favour of synthesiser, picking up a new technique although owing a debt to Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. Atkins&#x27; propulsive marching band-style drumming, the lack of bass and guitar, and Lydon&#x27;s increasing lyrical abstraction made this album a difficult listen for rock fans, and contemporary reviews expressed great confusion. The record consists mostly of drums, vocals, musique concrète, and tape loops, with only gestures toward bass (played by Levene) and keyboards. The title &quot;Flowers of Romance&quot; was the name of a short-lived band featuring Keith Levene, Viv Albertine, and Sid Vicious in 1976. The track &quot;Francis Massacre&quot; was partially inspired by Lydon&#x27;s incarceration in Mountjoy Prison and the track &quot;Hymie&#x27;s Him&quot; began life as an instrumental piece intended for the score of Michael Wadleigh&#x27;s crime horror film &quot;Wolfen&quot; (1981).

===1983–1986: &quot;Commercial Zone&quot;, &quot;This Is What You Want...&quot; and &quot;Album&quot;===
An aborted fourth studio album recorded in 1982 was later released by Levene as &quot;Commercial Zone&quot;, which included contributions from bassist Pete Jones. Lydon and Atkins claim that Levene stole the master tapes. Atkins stayed on through a live album (one of the first digital live albums ever recorded), &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot; (1983) – in which PiL consisted of him, Lydon, and a band of session musicians—and left in 1985, following the release of &quot;This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get&quot; (1984). This album consists of re-recorded versions of five songs from &quot;Commercial Zone&quot; (several of which feature a horn section) and three new tracks (four songs from &quot;Commercial Zone&quot; were not re-recorded for the new album). PiL was moving towards a more commercial pop music and dance music direction, and while many new fans found PiL, little of their original audience (or sound) remained.

During this interim period, the band released the single &quot;This Is Not a Love Song&quot; in 1983, the song&#x27;s lyric lampooning the anger of some fans and music press over the band&#x27;s movement towards a more commercial style. The song&#x27;s title was inspired by a line in the song &quot;Her Story&quot; (1979) by Virgin label stablemates the Flying Lizards, about bands &#x27;selling out&#x27; their artistic principles for commercial success (&quot;But you can still make money, by singing sweet songs of love... this is a love song&quot;). Ironically, it gave the band their biggest international hit single, reaching No. 5 in the UK singles charts and No. 12 in the Netherlands.

A re-recorded version with harsher vocals and a brass section was included on the album &quot;This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get&quot;.

In 1985, Lydon recorded a song entitled &quot;World Destruction&quot; in collaboration with Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s band Time Zone and producer Bill Laswell. PiL&#x27;s 1986 studio album release was simply entitled &quot;Album&quot;, &quot;Compact Disc&quot;, or &quot;Cassette&quot;, depending on the format. The cover&#x27;s blue typeface and spartan design parodied generic brands; promotional photos featured Lydon in a &quot;generic blue&quot; suit surrounded by generic foods and drinking generic beer. Produced by Bill Laswell (despite Lydon-fuelled faction and disunion) and with many of Laswell&#x27;s usual rotating cast of musicians, it also featured guitar solos by Steve Vai, considered by Vai himself to be some of his best work. Jonas Hellborg, solo bassist and at the time, member of John McLaughlin&#x27;s reformed band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, played bass on the album. Jazz great Tony Williams and legendary Cream drummer Ginger Baker drummed on the album, which also featured Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). Controversy reared again, with claims that the album cover and title concept had been stolen from the San Francisco noise/punk band, Flipper, contemporaries of PiL, whose album, &quot;Album&quot;, featured a similarly unadorned sleeve. Flipper retaliated by naming their next album, &quot;Public Flipper Limited&quot;.

To tour &quot;Album&quot; in 1986, Lydon recruited former Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees guitarist John McGeoch, world music multi-instrumentalist (and former Damned guitarist) Lu Edmunds, bassist Allan Dias, and former the Pop Group and the Slits drummer Bruce Smith. (Dias had previously played with David Lloyd and Andrew Edge in Uropa Lula).
As the years went on, PiL&#x27;s line-up grew steadier as the sound of the albums drifted toward dance culture and drum-oriented pop music. Edmunds left due to tinnitus in 1988, and Smith left in 1990. McGeoch and Dias were members of PiL from 1986 until 1992, making them the group&#x27;s longest-running members besides Lydon.

===1987–1992: Later career===
PiL released the studio album &quot;Happy?&quot; in 1987, and during early 1988 were the supporting act on INXS&#x27; &quot;Kick&quot; tour in the US. Bill Laswell, who produced PiL&#x27;s previous studio album, was at one point supposed to produce &quot;Happy?&quot;, but this idea fell through allegedly because Laswell wanted to replace the PiL line-up with his own session musicians (as had been the case with &quot;Album&quot;), a request to which John Lydon would not agree. &quot;Happy?&quot; was ultimately produced by Gary Langan and PiL. The album produced the single &quot;Seattle&quot; as well as the abortion-themed single &quot;The Body&quot;, a sequel of sorts to the similarly titled Sex Pistols song &quot;Bodies&quot;. In 1989, PiL toured with New Order and the Sugarcubes as &quot;The Monsters of Alternative Rock&quot;. PiL&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;9&quot; – so called as it was the band&#x27;s ninth official album release, including the two live albums – appeared in early 1989 and featured the single &quot;Disappointed&quot;. The album was produced by Stephen Hague (who was known for working with the Pet Shop Boys and New Order), Eric &quot;E.T.&quot; Thorngren and the band.

In 1990, Public Image Ltd&#x27;s song &quot;The Order of Death&quot; (from &quot;This is What You Want... This is What You Get&quot;) was prominently featured in Richard Stanley&#x27;s film &quot;Hardware&quot;. That same year saw the release of PiL&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Greatest Hits, So Far&quot;, which featured one new song, the environmentally themed single &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot;. The rest of the album consisted of previously released material, though remixes of several songs were used rather than original album versions and the album remake of &quot;This is Not a Love Song&quot; was included rather than the original single version. Lydon claims that he wanted the album to be 28 tracks long; the eventual 14-track listing was a compromise with Virgin Records (who, according to Lydon, originally wanted only eight tracks). The compilation, which boasted album-sleeve artwork by Reg Mombassa, made No. 20 on the UK Albums Chart.

PiL&#x27;s last studio album of this period, 1992&#x27;s &quot;That What Is Not&quot;, included a sample from the Sex Pistols&#x27; song &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in the song &quot;Acid Drops&quot; (the younger Lydon&#x27;s voice is heard chanting the words, &quot;No future, no future...&quot; in the outro). Lydon disbanded the group a year later after Virgin Records refused to pay for the tour supporting the album, and Lydon had to pay for it out of his own pocket. The band&#x27;s last concert was performed on 18 September 1992 with the line-up of Lydon, McGeoch, Ted Chau (guitar, keyboards), Mike Joyce of the Smiths (drums), and Russell Webb (bass guitar). Allan Dias, PiL&#x27;s bassist since the spring of 1986, quit the band in the summer of 1992, some months before PiL itself went on hiatus.

===Hiatus===
In 1993, Lydon worked on his memoirs, first published in 1994 as &quot;&quot;, and in 1996 he regrouped with Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook for the Sex Pistols&#x27; Filthy Lucre Tour. Lydon released a solo studio album, &quot;Psycho&#x27;s Path&quot;, in 1997. 1999 saw the release of the 4-disc PiL compilation &quot;Plastic Box&quot;; it offered a more comprehensive retrospective of PiL&#x27;s recorded output than the single-disc &quot;The Greatest Hits, So Far&quot;. &quot;Plastic Box&quot; contained a mixture of previously released and unreleased material spanning PiL&#x27;s entire career, although no material from &quot;Commercial Zone&quot; or PiL&#x27;s two live albums was included (in the compilation&#x27;s liner notes, Lydon wrote that &quot;this collection represents a comma not a full stop, I fully intend to carry on with PiL, and there will be more in the future.&quot;).

===2009–present: Reunion and new albums===
In September 2009 it was announced that PiL would reform for five UK shows, their first live appearance in 17 years. Lydon financed the reunion using money he earned doing a UK TV commercial for Country Life butter. &quot;The money that I earned from that has now gone completely – lock stock and barrel – into re-forming PiL,&quot; said Lydon.

On 15 October 2009, Lydon registered the private limited company &quot;PIL Twin Limited&quot; as his new music publishing company in the UK.

The new line-up (consisting of Lydon, earlier members Bruce Smith and Lu Edmonds, plus multi-instrumentalist Scott Firth) played to generally positive reviews in late 2009, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of &quot;Metal Box&quot;. However, protested Lydon, &quot;This tour is absolutely nothing to do with an anniversary of anything… We didn&#x27;t even know that Virgin were planning on releasing a very limited edition of &quot;Metal Box&quot; because they never bothered to confer with us.&quot; The tour spawned a live album, &quot;ALiFE 2009&quot;.

In April 2010, PiL began an extensive North American tour, including a sub-headlining appearance at the Coachella Festival. The band played several European concerts in July 2010 and at the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan in August 2011.

In November 2009, Lydon said PiL might re-enter the studio if they could raise enough money from their December tour or from a record company.

PiL went to Tel Aviv to headline the Heineken Music Conference 2010 Festival in August 2010. The group met with criticism for breaking the artistic boycott of Israel by some British musicians organized in protest over Israeli policies toward Palestinians. Lydon said in response:

On 30 November 2011, the band&#x27;s own label &quot;PiL Official Limited&quot; was registered as a private limited company in the UK.

PiL released the vinyl-only EP &quot;One Drop&quot; in late April 2012, which was eventually made available for streaming. The new 12-track studio album, &quot;This is PiL&quot;, followed in May. &quot;This is PiL&quot; was the band&#x27;s first studio album in twenty years.

On 28 July 2015, the band uploaded a promo video for lead single &quot;Double Trouble&quot; from their next studio album, &quot;What the World Needs Now...,&quot; via their YouTube channel. On 21 August, PiL released the single (backed with &quot;Bettie Page&quot;) and a non-album track, &quot;Turkey Tits&quot;. &quot;What the World Needs Now...&quot; is PiL&#x27;s tenth studio album, released in September 2015. On 17 November 2015, the group played &quot;Double Trouble&quot; on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

In December 2016, the group released super deluxe editions of &quot;Metal Box&quot; and &quot;Album&quot;.

In 2018, a documentary film, &quot;The Public Image Is Rotten&quot;, was released. Also in 2018, the band
released &quot;The Public Image is Rotten – Songs from the Heart&quot;, a compilation CD/DVD box set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the band. It consists of five CDs and two DVDs that include B-sides, rarities, radio sessions, live concerts, 12&quot; mixes and promo videos.

On 9 January 2023, it was announced that the band was one of the six acts chosen to compete in &quot;Eurosong 2023&quot; for the chance to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. They competed with the song &quot;Hawaii&quot;, and ultimately finished in 4th place with 18 points. The song, called by the band &quot;the most personal piece of songwriting&quot;, was released as a single, and was described as a love letter to Lydon&#x27;s wife, Nora Forster. After her death on 5 April, the band announced their studio album &quot;End of World&quot;, released on 11 August, along with a new European tour.

<doc id="126960" wikidata="Q3473325" url="?curid=126960" title="Walden, New York">
<text>Walden is the largest of three villages of the town of Montgomery in Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 6,818 at the 2020 census. It has the ZIP Code 12586 and the 778 telephone exchange within the 845 area code. Walden is part of the Kiryas Joel−Poughkeepsie−Newburgh, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York−Newark−Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

The precursor to the village began in the early 18th century as a mill town along the Wallkill River. One miller, Jacob Walden, was so successful the village that incorporated in the mid-19th century took its name from him. Later, it would be the village&#x27;s three knife manufacturers that brought it growth and prosperity. They are gone today, but other industrial concerns remain.

==History==
The first Europeans began to arrive in the region around the 1650s, and began establishing permanent settlements in the area by the early 18th century.

The area around present-day Walden was purchased in 1736 by Alexander Kidd, and settlers of Scots-Irish, English and German descent started arriving not long afterwards. It was the first settlement west of the Wallkill River, known at the time as Kidd&#x27;s Town.

In 1813, an entrepreneur from New York City named Jacob Treadwell Walden began purchasing land on both sides of the Wallkill River, with plans to develop a manufacturing settlement along the River. He convinced some of his business partners to finance the construction of wool mills on the river, attracted by the Great Falls as a source of power and the railroad connections at nearby Maybrook. He dammed the Wallkill above the falls, creating a power station that remains in use today, and his mill was a success. By the 1820s, his mill became a notable regional producer of cotton and woolen cloth. Wool-makers followed as the Industrial Revolution picked up steam and the growing population center became known instead as Walden&#x27;s Mills. The area became a significant local producer of woolen products by the 1840s.

In 1855, Walden was formally incorporated as a village.

Most of Walden&#x27;s wool industry failed a few decades after it began, and people in the village sought to replace the mills with a different source of employment. The village began encouraging knife manufacturers to relocate from nearby Dutchess County to vacant mills. In 1856, the New York Knife Company moved to an idle cotton factory in Walden. The company would go on to make much of the cutlery employed by the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War.

After the war, other knifemakers came to Walden. In the 1870s, the Walden Knife Company set up a factory in the village, and Schrade Cutlery built a factory in Walden in 1904. The village soon became colloquially known as &quot;Little Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Knifetown&quot;. During this time, rail service arrived to Walden, facilitating passenger service and increased mobility for local manufactured goods. Other industrial concerns, making products as diverse as engines and women&#x27;s underwear, also set up shop.

In the early 1890s, President Grover Cleveland lowered tariffs on many imported goods, including knives. Competitively priced German cutlery began to flood the American market, and together with the Panic of 1893 and the economic slowdown that followed for several years, the knife companies and their owners went heavily into debt and it looked for a while as if they might not survive.

But in 1897 President William McKinley, a personal friend of Thomas Wilson Bradley of the U.S. Knife Company, pushed through the Dingley Tariff that restored the &quot;status quo ante&quot;. The knifemakers returned to profitability and were able to pay off their debts; and in gratitude Bradley had a statue of McKinley erected that remains in Walden today.

Throughout the early 1900s, the village experienced a period of substantial growth. Dense mixed-used development flourished in the village&#x27;s downtown, often taking form of residences above shops. Single-family homes also proliferated throughout the village, typically on relatively small lot sizes. During this time, numerous government buildings were constructed.

In the 1910s the facilities at the dam began to be primarily used for power and less for industry.

Walden&#x27;s Main Street was the site of an active retail trade which included Millspaugh&#x27;s Furniture as well as Roosa&#x27;s Jewelers, both still in business. Lustig&#x27;s Department Store, established by Carl Lustig in 1883, was the mainstay of Main Street until its closing in 1986.

The Depression was hard on many of the village&#x27;s economic concerns, but the knifemakers persisted. However, after World War II they gradually became less prominent and moved as the rail connections they had depended on were replaced by trucking on the growing Interstate Highways. In 1957, Schrade Cutlery (renamed to Imperial Schrade) closed down its factory, and moved to nearby Ellenville. Schrade was the last company making knives in the village, and closed down its factory after a fire. It continued production in Ellenville until 2004. The ruins of the factory still stand behind the Thruway Markets hypermarket.

Apart from knifemaking, Walden became a regional center for the garment industry from the 1930s through the 1950s.

As car dependency increased in the region during the late 20th century, aided by the construction of the New York State Thruway system and Interstate 84, downtown businesses struggle to compete with car-oriented retail centers throughout the region.

Throughout the 1990s, the village was the subject of an ongoing joke by a disc jockey at the nearby WPDH-FM radio station, who would constantly joke about Walden being a poor, redneck, and inbred town. Some villagers interviewed by The New York Times on the matter claimed the long-running joke hurt their civic esteem, and even real estate values in the village.

From 1995 until 2016, Walden was the headquarters of the Big Apple Circus.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (3.9%) is water.

The village&#x27;s most notable geographical feature is the Wallkill River, which flows from the south to the north across the village and divides one-third of it from the rest. Within the eastern portion, Tin Brook, the Wallkill&#x27;s major right tributary in New York, meanders across as well, forming part of the northern village boundary. There are two waterfalls and dams on the river within the village limits, known as the Great and Little Falls; and two auto bridges, the &quot;high&quot; (formally, the Walden Veterans&#x27; Memorial Bridge, which carries NY 52 through the village as West Main Street) and &quot;low&quot; (Oak Street) bridges).

The Wallkill passes through a small gorge between the two dams and loses approximately of elevation in the process. The surrounding topography in the village is, correspondingly, gentle rolling hills of this section of the Great Appalachian Valley between the higher rises of the Shawangunk Ridge, visible to the west from some sections of the village, and the Hudson Highlands to the southwest. The highest elevation is roughly above sea level along Overlook Road at the village&#x27;s western boundary; the lowest is along the Wallkill at the northern village line.
Walden&#x27;s growth began near the mills and later the knife-making plants, particularly the New York Knife Company, located on the steep east bank of the river just south of the Veterans&#x27; Memorial Bridge; the building&#x27;s footings are still visible on the slope. The central business district of the village is today a few blocks to the east, along Main Street. Just to its south is the village hall and the main square. East Main Street, the section of 52 from the 208 junction to the village line, has seen many newer businesses locate there, including a small strip mall. There is also some scattered commercial presence along Orange Avenue (208 south of the junction), primarily professional office space. This parallels the village&#x27;s remaining industrial presence along the railroad line to the east, which at its northern terminus abuts downtown to the southeast. Walden&#x27;s other major commercial area is the Thruway Markets complex located along the river north of Oak Street, just south of the remains of the Walden Knife Company.

On the southern side of the village is the Fox Hill Bruderhof Community where about 250 community members live and work in their factories and the Plough Publishing House.

There are two schools, public Walden Elementary School on Orchard Street and Most Precious Blood Catholic school near the northern village line along Ulster Avenue.
The village includes public parks and a walking trail.
*Bradley Park - along Albany Ave, on the high ground between Thruway Market and Ulster Ave (Rte 208), contains 4 baseball &amp; 1 softball field (Home to the Walden Little League), 2 tennis courts, a playground, and a skateboard park.
*Wooster Grove - along East Main St (Rte 52), surrounded by the Tin Brook, offers a large playground, indoor &amp; outdoor basketball courts, a bandstand, an ice rink; the village&#x27;s teen center is also here.
*James Olley Park - at the end of Sherman Ave, includes a manufactured beach with public swimming and fishing, a small playground, a picnic grove, unimproved walking trails, and a summer recreation camp.
*Alfred Place Park - the only park on the west side includes a small playground and basketball court.
*Walden–Wallkill Rail Trail - beginning at Woosters Grove, a -long paved walking and biking trail linking the village to the hamlet of Wallkill in Ulster County.

Much of the remainder of the village is residential, with houses tending from modest and small near downtown, the river and railroad, to more expansive homes (such as the Victorians along the west side of Ulster Avenue) being found on the hills, newer development near the southwestern and eastern borders with the town, and 6 small apartment and townhouse complexes.

A large tract along the river south of the power station had remained undeveloped until very recently. A small area between McKinley Avenue, South Mountgomery Street and the river remains open, used for NYSEG&#x27;s purposes. On the other end of the village, the sewage treatment plant is also in the middle of an undeveloped area.

===Climate===
Walden has a humid continental climate, and tends to be significantly cooler than Manhattan, especially at night.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 Census, there were 6,818 people living in 2,466 households in the village, giving it an average household size of 2.76. The population density was .

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 23.4% of the population. Per the 2022 American Community Survey five-year estimate, the majority of Walden&#x27;s Hispanic or Latino is of Puerto Rican origin, whom account for 11.7% of Walden&#x27;s total population.

Of the village&#x27;s 2,466 households, 1,121 (45.5%) comprised married couples living together, 10.3% were cohabiting couples, 15.8% were male householders with no spouse, and 28.4% were female householders with no spouse. 23.1% of Walden&#x27;s population was under 18 years old, and 12.9% was 65 year old and over. The median age was 36.2 years old. Walden has a sex ratio of 108.5 females per 100 males.

The median income for families in the village is $103,672, and the mean income for families is $106,984. 17.6% of Walden&#x27;s population and 13.2% of Walden&#x27;s families are below the poverty line. 22.9% of people under 18 years old, and 19.9% of people 65 years old and over live below the poverty line.&#x27;

==Economy==

For 95 years, Walden was the home of Spence Engineering, a steam regulator manufacturer founded by Paulson Spence in 1926. He located his manufacturing facilities in Walden to serve the district steam heating loops in the northeast, especially ConEd in New York City. In 2019, Emerson Electric purchased Spence Engineering, ultimately moving it to Mexico in 2021 to improve their profitability.

The knife making plants are also gone, but other light-industrial concerns remain along the rail spur. The growing service sector is most strongly represented by two regional banks, Walden Federal and Walden Savings Bank, are based in the village (though the latter has moved to new headquarters at Scotts Corners, the 17K/208 intersection).

Retailing has long been a strong point for the village. The opening of Thruway Markets in 1955 filled the need not only for a supermarket but the entire big box sector, long before it existed in the country at large. While it eventually drove smaller stores from Main Street, it remains a substantial part of the village&#x27;s tax base and a major draw for consumers from outside not only Walden but the Town of Montgomery (particularly the nearby hamlet of Wallkill, which has no large retailers of its own), despite the openings of chain supermarkets in several nearby communities. The Thruway complex also boasts an outdoor-recreation store, tire-repair shop and the oldest of the village&#x27;s three Chinese restaurants. In 2013, Thruway&#x27;s owners closed the supermarket and hardware store after selling that space to the Maine-based Hannaford supermarket chain. Building of the new Hannaford supermarket is complete. The Ace hardware store has also since reopened.

While vacant space remains on Main Street, specialty stores and restaurants have managed to thrive there. Millspaugh Furniture, founded in Walden (but with another outlet in Poughkeepsie), is another popular draw for out-of-town shoppers due to its long history in the area and reputation for quality merchandise. National and regional chain stores once had little presence in Walden beyond two filling stations along the 52/208 section of Main Street, but in the last decade the amount of convenience stores has doubled.

Outside of jobs at the enterprises in the village, most residents work in the area. The nearby interstate and its associated &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; (with the New York State Thruway/I-87 and NY 17 (the future I-86) provide many jobs in transportation and distribution, particularly at Maybrook&#x27;s Yellow Freight facility and the large Staples warehouse just north of I-84. Local government agencies, and some state ones such as the Department of Correctional Services, also employ residents. More recently, residents of the newer housing have been commuters traveling to jobs in New York City or other areas close to it.

==Government==

As a village of the Town of Montgomery, Walden residents are taxpayers and electors in both.

The village has seven elected officials, a village board consisting of the mayor and six nonpartisan trustees, per the New York State Village Law. Most of the executive functions are handled by the village manager, who serves at the board&#x27;s pleasure.

Walden has had this system of government since 1964. A 1972 referendum to return to a strong-mayor system was defeated.

The village has its own police force, which provides 24-hour protection for residents; a public works department which maintains roads, water and sewer lines; a skate park in Bradley Park which was built in fall 2006 due to the ongoing complaints from older residents about all the skateboarders, a recreation department which maintains several parks within the village, including one with a pond in which swimming is permitted; and a village court presided over by an elected justice. Fire protection is provided for the village and surrounding fire district by the Walden Fire Department.

The Village Hall, pictured left, housed both the Walden Fire Department and Police Station until 1994 when the Fire District moved to a newly constructed firehouse at 230 Old Orange Avenue, near the edge of the village. Since then, the police station on the ground floor has grown from a tiny office and a few cells to nearly encompassing the entire ground floor. Fire department meeting rooms on the second story have been converted since then to a children&#x27;s section of the local Josephine-Louise Library.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Two state highways and two county roads serve Walden. Route 52 crosses the town from east to west, providing connections to Newburgh, in the former direction and Pine Bush, the Shawangunks and the Catskills in the latter. NY 208 crosses from north to south, with the nearest settlements in each direction being Wallkill and Maybrook, respectively. The two share a brief block in the center of town. Most traffic from outside the area comes in via Route 208 from the south due to its exit on Interstate 84 about south of the village, as well as its intersection with paralleling NY 17K at Scotts Corners to the south. 
County routes 23 (River Road) and 75 (Coldenham Road) connect to 17K at Montgomery to the southwest and the hamlet of Coldenham to the southeast, respectively.

The remaining spur of the old Wallkill Valley Railroad, now operated by Norfolk Southern, serves several businesses in the village and ends just short of East Main Street. There have been suggestions that commuter rail service via the Metro-North Port Jervis Line, where the spur connects at Campbell Hall, currently the nearest passenger rail station, be initiated. Metro-North rail service directly into New York City is available just across the Hudson River from Newburgh at Beacon and other stations on the Hudson Line. Amtrak stops at Poughkeepsie, the Hudson Line&#x27;s northern terminus. The nearest airport to Walden, Orange County Airport, is a general aviation facility just south of Montgomery. Commercial airlines, both freight and passenger, fly out of Stewart International Airport.

Short Line serves Walden on its route from Newburgh to Middletown.

==Education==
It is in the Valley Central School District (Montgomery).

<text>Washingtonville is a village in the town of Blooming Grove, Orange County, New York, United States. The population was 5,657 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. The village is named in honor of George Washington.

==History==

Washingtonville was first settled in 1731. The village maintained a slow but steady growth during the second half of the 18th century. In 1809, John Jaques, a boot and shoemaker, set up his shop in this tiny settlement of nine houses, then known as &quot;Little York.&quot; In 1839 he established Brotherhood Winery, now the oldest continuously operating winery in the United States. 

In its earlier years, Washingtonville was called &quot;Matthews Field,&quot; even before it was known as Little York. A part of the Rip Van Dam patent, it was sold to Vincent Matthews in 1721. Matthews was the first white European settler of the region. Its earliest known inhabitant was an Indian by the name of Moringamus, whose wigwam or tepee was once pitched in back of where the Coleman bottled-gas plant is located now.

Samuel Moffat built a trading post on the village square in 1811 at the junction of the New Windsor and Blooming Grove Turnpike with the Goshen Road. His son David later endowed Moffat Library on the spot. The hamlet began to prosper with a tannery, grist and plaster mills. A hotel was needed and Samuel Moffat built his Washington Tavern in 1818. The same year Samuel and John Jaques bestowed the village with a new name, Washingtonville, in honor of the late general and first president of the United States. George Washington was said to have come through and watered his horse at the trough which had been located under an elm tree in the center of the village. 

Washingtonville grew after 1850, when the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway built its branch through the village. Incorporated in 1895, the village had become an important dairying center where two creameries, Borden&#x27;s (later used as a bus garage for the Washingtonville Central School District) and the Farmers Cooperative Market on South Street, several groceries, a bank, feed and lumber dealers, wagon shops, furniture makers and a hub shop all prospered. Its greatest growth in that time occurred in the seventh and eighth decades.

C.R. Shons opened up a cooperative on Depot Street and also had a large orchard on Goshen Avenue. Thomas Fulton&#x27;s grist mill was destroyed by fire in the early 1900s. Hugh Lunney had his slaughterhouse on Goshen Avenue, near where the Spear Printing Company plant was, and also had a large ice house beside the point to Coopers Creek, harvesting ice for commercial use from the pond in the winter.

Borden&#x27;s Creamery maintained a bottling plant and its refrigerator cars, loaded with milk, were shipped to Greycourt (Harriman) on either the Erie freight or passenger runs. This firm cut its ice from the small pond south of its creamery, storing it in the ice house on the east side of the plant.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of . The village developed on each side of Moodna Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River. It is prone to seasonal flooding. There are also three lakes in the village, none of these have a formal name.

Washingtonville is at the junction of highways NY-94 and NY-208.

<doc id="126966" wikidata="Q679753" url="?curid=126966" title="West Point, New York">
<text>West Point is the oldest continuously occupied military post in the United States. Located on the Hudson River in New York, General George Washington stationed his headquarters in West Point in the summer and fall of 1779 during the American Revolutionary War, and later called it &quot;the most important Post in America&quot; in 1781 following the war&#x27;s end. West Point also was the site of General Benedict Arnold&#x27;s failed attempt at treason during the Revolutionary War.

West Point was first occupied by the United States Armed Forces in January 1778 by Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons. Since, West Point has been occupied by the United States Army. It comprises land and water including the campus of the United States Military Academy, which is commonly referred to as &quot;West Point&quot;.

West Point is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of Highlands in Orange County, located on the western bank of the Hudson River. The population was 7,341 at the 2020 census. It is part of the New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

=== American Revolutionary War ===

==== Construction ====
The site for West Point was originally picked because of the pronounced S-curve in the Hudson River at that point during the American Revolutionary War, and was the subject of a committee reporting on fortifications in the Hudson River in November 1775, which first recommended occupying the land. Construction of the fort was begun under Captain Louis de la Radiere as chief engineer of the fort, however, New York Governor George Clinton thought that Radiere was &quot;lacking&quot; in the knowledge needed to hold his position. Thus it was completed under Polish Colonel Tadeusz Kościuszko between 1778–1780; it was a key defensive fortification, overlooking the turn in the Hudson River and the Great Chain. On January 27, 1778, Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and his brigade, including elements of Connecticut Colony&#x27;s patriot militia, crossed an iced over Hudson River and climbed to the plain on West Point.

General George Washington watched the construction of the fort closely and considered the fort to be General Alexander McDougall&#x27;s &quot;first priority&quot;.

In 1778, Major General Israel Putnam wrote, &quot;The place agreed upon to obstruct the navigation of Hudson river was at West Point.&quot; A fort there, Fort Clinton, named after the governor&#x27;s brother, Colonel James Clinton (whose brigade built the main fort), was built as well. The southern and western walls were nine feet high and twenty feet thick. Three redoubts and batteries on the south were named Forts Meigs, Wyllys, and Webb.
==== After construction ====
West Point was staffed by a small garrison of Continental Army Soldiers from early in 1776 through the end of the war. A great iron chain was laid across the Hudson at this point in 1778 in order to prevent British Navy vessels from sailing further up the Hudson River, which was never tested by the British. The site comprised multiple redoubts, as well as Fort Putnam, situated on a high hill overlooking the river. Named after its builder, Revolutionary War General and engineer Rufus Putnam, the fort is still preserved in its original design.

Parliament sent instructions to General Sir Henry Clinton to force George Washington out of West Point. Clinton decided to capture the strategically important posts Stony Point and Verplanck&#x27;s Point, which were twelve miles south of West Point. Clinton captured the forts on June 1, 1779. To block the British advance, Washington moved his troops further up the Hudson.

Early on in May 1779, General Benedict Arnold had met with a Philadelphia merchant named Joseph Stansbury. Afterwards, Stansbury had gone to Sir Henry Clinton, to whom he offered Arnold&#x27;s &quot;services&quot;. Clinton had been pursuing a campaign to take control of the Hudson River, so he had been interested in the plans and information of the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River. Arnold wrote a series of letters to Clinton, one of which was written on July 12, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point to the British, later for a finalized offer of £20,000. On August 3, 1780, Arnold obtained command of West Point, which also gave him command of the American-controlled portion of the Hudson. Arnold then intentionally started weakening the fort&#x27;s defenses, and through a letter sent to Clinton, proposing a meeting with British Major John André to discuss information on West Point. A meeting was set for September 11, however, Arnold and André did not meet until September 21. Carrying the plans for West Point, André was captured on September 23 by three militiamen, and the information to West Point was found. After Arnold&#x27;s betrayal, the fort, which was also known as Fort Arnold at the time, was renamed to Fort Clinton after General James Clinton.

=== Post-war ===
After the conclusion of the American Revolution, West Point was used as a storage facility for cannon and other military property used by the Continental Army and until November 28, 1779, was used as the temporary headquarters to George Washington, who called it &quot;the most important Post in America&quot; in 1781. Viewing a standing army as &quot;dangerous&quot;, Congress demobilized American forces but left fewer than a hundred men at West Point. However, it was still the largest post in the army in the immediate years after the Revolutionary War.Favoring West Point due to its location and defenses, Henry Knox and Alexander Hamilton made the first official recommendation to establish a military academy at West Point in 1790. However, Congress rejected the proposal, although earlier in 1790, New York merchant and American Revolution patriot Stephen Moore sold his estate (known as &quot;Moore&#x27;s Folly&quot;) to the United States, following an Act of Congress that solidified the sale on September 10, 1790, for $11,085, which meant Congress had gained full possession of the fort. The United States Military Academy was established at West Point in 1802. It is the nation&#x27;s oldest service academy, and is metonymically called &quot;West Point&quot; as well.

<text>Woodbury is a town and village in Orange County, New York, United States. The town population was 12,197 at the 2020 census. The village was incorporated in 2006 and comprises all of the town that is not part of the village of Harriman. The region was once called Woodbury Clove. It is part of the Kiryas Joel–Poughkeepsie–Newburgh, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. Woodbury is in the southeastern part of Orange County. The town also has four schools, which are part of the Monroe-Woodbury Central school District.

== History ==
The region was once called Woodbury Clove (&quot;valley&quot;), and not to be confused with Woodbury, Nassau County, Long Island, New York.

The town of Woodbury (which comprises the hamlets of Central Valley and Highland Mills) and the area formerly known as the hamlet of Woodbury Falls was officially created on December 19, 1889, by an act of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. The first town meeting was held on March 4 the following year, with John A. Patterson presiding as supervisor. The second supervisor was James Seaman. Even though the land is no longer used for farming, the Seaman family property can still be identified by a sign which reads “Sweet Clover Farm” along Route 32 at the northern end of town. This is now the home of Palaia Vineyards.

This was the second time this town was created; the first was in 1863, when the Board of Supervisors approved the division of Monroe into the three communities of Monroe, Southfields and Highland. The Highland portion was what would become Woodbury in 1889. Objections to this arose, and two years later the legislature was asked to overrule the board&#x27;s decision; it did, by recreating the old town of Monroe. In 1889 the Board of Supervisors reinstated the original separation, and the town now known as Woodbury was reformed.

Woodbury had undergone numerous geographic and name changes prior to its incorporation in 1889. Until 1764, the area was part of an enlarged Goshen. Goshen was then divided into two parts, with Woodbury becoming part of Cornwall. During the American Revolution, the area was shown on maps as Woodbury Clove. By 1799 Cornwall was also divided, with Woodbury joining present-day Monroe and Tuxedo to become the town of Cheesekook. This name was changed to Smithfield (or Southfield) and in 1808 became Monroe (supposedly in honor of newly elected US president James Monroe; however, Thomas Jefferson was president in 1808. James Monroe served from 1817 to 1825, and some believe Monroe was named for a local family).

The derivation of the name “Woodbury&quot; is uncertain. Some say it may have come from the Dutch word &quot;wode&quot; for &quot;wood&quot;, meaning &quot;a dwelling place in the woods&quot;. Others claim that the many English families who settled here bestowed the name of a famous English family named Woodbury upon the area. As for the hamlets, Central Valley and Highland Mills were once called Lower Smith&#x27;s Clove (&quot;clove&quot; meaning valley). Highland Mills was also known as Orange Post Office but the residents changed it in 1824, with the present name most likely reflecting the water and flour mills and tannery businesses in the area. A map dated about 1790 shows Woodbury Falls as Smithfields. It may have later taken its name from the once-lovely falls there. The first Cuban president, Thomas Estrada Palma, lived in Central Valley and Estrada Road was named in his honor. 

In addition to flour and grist mills, the area&#x27;s industry was dominated by tourism and fly rod (fishing rod) manufacturing businesses; Woodbury was home to the Payne and Leonard Rod Companies.

The town&#x27;s major attraction is Woodbury Common Premium Outlets – one of the largest outlet malls in the world, visited by people from Japan, China, Europe and the Americas. The shopping boom in the area (which began in the 1980s) has inspired construction projects including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, many chain restaurants, car dealerships, other retailers and proposed projects. This has caused conflict and controversy with local residents and surrounding municipalities. Orange County is prospering from the tax revenue this area produces; however, commuting on Route 32 during peak holiday shopping days is extremely irritating to local residents.
The NYS Department of Transportation is currently undertaking a $30 million project to redirect traffic flow, attempting to ease the unsafe conditions arising on peak shopping weekends.

On August 10, 2006, residents voted by a 4½-to-1 ratio to create the village of Woodbury. The village incorporates all the town&#x27;s land, except for a small portion of the village of Harriman which lies within the town of Woodbury.

Most Woodbury residents have either a Central Valley, NY 10917 address or a Highland Mills, NY 10930 address (Woodbury, NY 11797 is for Woodbury, Nassau County, Long Island, NY).

==Town and village officials==

===Town===

The town is governed by a board of four elected councilmen, elected for staggered four-year terms. Woodbury is governed under New York Town Law, by which the board holds executive and legislative powers. The day-to-day operations of the town are administered by a supervisor, elected for a two-year term. The supervisor also serves as a full voting member of (and chairs) the Town Board. The town voters also elect a town clerk, two town justices, a tax collector and a highway superintendent. Town elections are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in odd-numbered calendar years. Elected officials take office the following January 1.

Woodbury has been a town dominated by the Republican Party since its establishment. However, Democrats have now succeeded in securing a majority of the town&#x27;s enrolled voters, and won majority control of the Town Board for the first time in over 20 years at the 2007 elections. From January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011, no Republican served on the Town Board following the 2009 election – the first time in town history the board had no Republican member. However, in the 2011 town elections, the two Republican candidates for two council seats were elected. This put Republican representation back on the town board as of January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2015, Republicans took a majority on the town board when Ralph Caruso became Town Supervisor. Republicans lost the majority in the 2015 elections when Supervisor Ralph Caruso and Councilman Marilyn Prestia were defeated.

Effective with the village elections held in 2012, the election is now held in June. This change in date was approved by village voters in March 2011.

Village officials were originally elected on independent-party ballot lines. The two primary village parties were the Woodbury CommUNITY Party and the Woodbury Preservation Party. In the 2009 village elections, a third party named the Common Sense Party emerged, whose members were voted into office at the March 18, 2009, elections. They took office at the organizational meeting, held at the beginning of April.

Residents voted in 2013 to change the election date to November to coincide with the general elections, and to have Orange County election officials run the village elections. Following the November 2021 elections, the current village officials are:

&quot;Mayor&quot; - Andrew Giacomazza (R)

&quot;Village board&quot; - Susan Ciriello (R), Vic Ferrarelli (R), Matthew Fabbro (D), Jim Freiband (D)

&quot;Village attorney&quot; - Kelly Naughton

&quot;Village Treasurer&quot; - Desiree Potvin

&quot;Village Clerk&quot; - Jessica McClennan

This historical church was built circa 1830 and served the community until 1980 when the church&#x27;s contents were sold off. shortly after it was turned into an antiques &amp; book shop.

<doc id="126972" wikidata="Q927382" url="?curid=126972" title="Holley, New York">
<text>Holley is a village in the town of Murray in Orleans County, New York, United States. The population was 1,811 at the 2010 census. According to the 2020 census, the population decreased to 1,754. It is part of the Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The village of Holley was incorporated in 1850. Originally named Saltport, the name was changed to honor Myron Holley, a commissioner of the Erie Canal.

In 2002, A major chemical spill known as the Diaz pipeline incident occurred at the Diaz chemical production plant after a pipeline from a reactor vessel bursted, contaminating 31,000 tons of concrete and scrap metal as well as multiple houses, temporarily rendering Holley a ghost town.

The village of Holley hosted an annual &quot;Hazzard County Squirrel Slam,&quot; from 2006 until the last event in 2016, a squirrel hunt that raises funds for the village&#x27;s fire department. The event went off without incident for six consecutive years until the 2013 edition drew the sudden ire of a coalition of wildlife rehabilitators, animal rights activists and gun control advocates. Approximately 30 people stood outside of the Holley Fire Department to protest the event. Protests also occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Several lawsuits to stop the event took place, none of which were successful. Due to the controversy, the &quot;Squirrel Slam&quot; hasn&#x27;t taken place since 2016.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Holley is located on the Erie Canal.

The village is located at the junction of east-west highway New York State Route 31 (West Albion Street and State Street) and north-south highway New York State Route 237 (North and South Main Street).

It is located approximately 21 miles from Rochester NY.

==Economy==
Holley&#x27;s main economy is farming based, due to the lack of trade in the area, as well as the growing townships nearby, such as Brockport and Albion. The town has small shops and businesses, including a dance studio, Kyokushin Karate dojo, a pizzeria, a diner and gas station.

==Education==
There are two public schools in Holley: Holley Elementary School and Holley Junior/Senior High School. These two schools are located in close proximity to each other in the northeastern portion of the village.

Residents of the Holley School district currently pay the highest rate of school taxes in the county. The older high school, located in the center of town, was closed in 1976 due to a growing population that needed a larger facility and one closer to athletic fields.

Norwegian-American pioneer leader Cleng Peerson subsequently founded a settlement in the Fox River Valley of Illinois during 1834, near the community of Norway, Illinois.

The Town of Kendall was incorporated from the Town of Murray. On April 7, 1837, about half of the Town of Murray became the new Town of Kendall. It was formerly called &quot;North Murray&quot; and was settled slowly due to swampy terrain, being called the &quot;Black North&quot;, due to the bogs and forests.

<doc id="126977" wikidata="Q3470455" url="?curid=126977" title="Medina, New York">
<text>Medina is a village in the Towns of Shelby and Ridgeway in Orleans County, New York, United States. It is located approximately 10 miles south of Lake Ontario. The population was 6,065 at the 2010 census, making it the county&#x27;s most populous municipality. The village was named by its surveyor, Ebenezer Mix. It is part of the Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Medina zip code, 14103, encompasses the village of Medina and the surrounding towns of Ridgeway and Shelby. 

The village developed after construction of the Erie Canal, which bends as it passes through the village, creating a basin that served as a stopover point. This became the center of businesses that served trade and passenger traffic on canal boats. In addition, mills were constructed on Oak Orchard Creek to take advantage of its water power. The fertile lands around the village yielded fruit which was exported to major markets of New York City and west via the canal. At the start of the 20th century, Medina was a thriving industrial town.

Medina is located about an hour drive from two major cities, Rochester, to the east, and Buffalo, to the west. It is also about 30 minutes from two small cities, Batavia and Lockport.

==History==
Joseph Ellicott, the agent of the Holland Land Company, once owned land that encompassed part of the village, purchased from the Holland Land Company. With the opening of the Erie Canal through Medina, the village enjoyed more trade and business associated with freight and passengers on canal boats.

The Village of Medina was incorporated March 3, 1832, creating an entity contained within the two towns of Ridgeway and Shelby. The charter of incorporation called for five Trustees to be elected as village officials. That same year the first printing press was set up in the village and the first newspaper published, The Medina Herald.

In 1852, the railroad arrived in Medina and passenger service quickly became popular.

=== Early Industry ===
Medina&#x27;s first known industry was an ashery. The area was mostly covered in trees and brush when Ebenezer Mix was assigned to survey the area. Clearing the area would have been necessary for the village to be laid out and the Erie Canal built. An ashery would convert hardwood ash into lye or other usable products. Most of these industries would rely on the Erie Canal for their transportation needs.

==== Mills ====
Medina had a variety of mills over the years. Grain and flour mills were very important to the area and built as early as 1830. Two stave mills existed in the 1870s, producing wood strips for the production of barrels. A Cloth mill also existed for a time though exactly when is not known. Saw mills were used for creating rough lumber and finished boards for other local industry.

==== Barrel Manufacturing ====
The popularity of flour production resulted in a large need for barrels to transport the flour down the Erie Canal.

==== Foundries ====
The Bignall Foundry began selling iron pumps, sinks, and more in 1861. After several fires, the company was part of a consolidation into the Central Foundry Company along with two other local foundries, A.L. Swett Company and Beach &amp; Co in 1899.

==== Medina Sandstone ====
Medina is known for its Medina Sandstone, a stone used widely in buildings across the region. Some local examples include the &quot;million dollar staircase&quot; at the New York State Capitol in Albany, the Richardson Olmsted Complex in Buffalo, and in buildings at the University of Rochester and Cornell University. Sandstone varies in color from light grey to a deep reddish brown.

The first commercial sandstone quarry was opened in 1837 by John Ryan. At their peak, sandstone quarries were one of the largest employers in the county with upwards of 2,000 employees. With the discovery of cheaper alternatives, Medina Sandstone&#x27;s popularity began to decline around World War 1.

=== Pearl Street Armory ===
In 1901, a State Armory was built of Medina Sandstone and located on the corner of Pearl St and Prospect Ave. Company F moved into the facility in 1902 with units serving in WWI and WWII. The Armory was officially closed by NYS in 1977. Company F records can found at Lee-Whedon Memorial Library. A bronze statue and memorial was erected in front of the building in honor of Company F in 2019. The building now houses the YMCA.

=== POW Camp ===
Medina&#x27;s Heinz factory housed a POW camp from 1943 to 1946. Seventy-one Italian soldiers arrived at the Heinz barracks in September 1943. They were allowed to work at the Heinz factory, local farms, or other local factories. In May 1944, the Italian soldiers were moved to a new location and replaced with 116 German soldiers.

During their tenure in Medina, the German prisoners went on strike to protest the smoking regulations at the Heinz factory. The soldiers wanted to smoke in the factory building and on the loading platforms. After having all of their possessions removed and not being allowed to sleep in the barracks, all of the soldiers voluntarily returned to work the following day.

In 1946, the Heinz camp was closed and all remaining prisoners were moved to local military installations in preparation for their return to Germany. During its use, the Heinz barracks housed up to 300 soldiers and 50 military police.

<text>Ridgeway is a town in Orleans County, New York, United States. The population was 6,886 at the 2000 census. The name of the town is derived from &quot;Ridge Road,&quot; an important highway in the 19th century.

The Town of Ridgeway is on the western border of the county, which is bordered to the north by Lake Ontario.

== History ==

This area was settled after the American Revolutionary War largely by migrants from New England and eastern New York state, after the Seneca Nation, of the Haudenosaunee, or Six Nations ceded it in the Treaty of Big Tree, in 1797. The Seneca controlled this area at the time of the influx of White Americans but until the period of 1644-1647, it was the realm of The Wenro &amp; Neuter People. Much of the area was purchased by Dutch speculators, known as the Holland Land Company, in 1792-1793.

The Town of Ridgeway was formed from Batavia in 1812, in the period of the War of 1812, when Britain and the United States fought over the border with Canada. In 1818, part of the town was used to create the new Town of Shelby. Orleans County was formed by the State Legislature in 1825.

In 1823, Ebenezer Mix was hired to survey and lay out the future village of Medina, the northern portion of which lies within Ridgeway.

Shelby and Ridgeway have one town court to serve both towns. Additionally, both towns share an assessor.

The Servoss House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
