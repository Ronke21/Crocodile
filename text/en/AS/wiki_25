<text>Clinton ( , ) is a city in and the county seat of Sampson County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,383. Clinton is named for Richard Clinton, a Brigadier General of the North Carolina militia in the American Revolution.

==History==
The first settlers came to the Clinton area around 1740. The community was originally known as Clinton Courthouse. There was an earlier incorporated town of Clinton elsewhere in the state; however, that town folded in 1822 and Clinton was incorporated as a town in the same year. In 1852, the General Assembly passed several acts to improve regulation of towns, including Clinton. As part of the &quot;Act for the Better Regulation of the Town of Clinton in the County of Sampson,&quot; the General Assembly appointed five commissioners: James Moseley, Isaac Boykin, Dr. Henry Bizzel, John Beaman, and Alfred Johnson. The corporate limits of the town at that time extended a half mile each way from the courthouse. The first records of an election were in February 1852 and the first tax rate was $0.50 per $100 valuation of real property. In July 1953, the town became a city.

Clinton is the geographic center of the county, and because Sampson County is primarily rural farmland, Clinton developed as the major agricultural marketing center. Clinton is also where future 13th Vice President William R. King, (1786-1853), later of Alabama, under 14th President Franklin Pierce, (1804-1869), of New Hampshire, was born and began his legal career. He was inaugurated in March 1853 in Havana, Cuba, the only American executive official to be sworn in on foreign soil. He died shortly after being separately sworn in.

Clinton had a minor league baseball team in the Tobacco State League from 1946 to 1950, which was the last stop in the colorful career of Brooklyn Dodgers All-star pitcher Van Lingle Mungo.

<text>Roseboro is a town in Sampson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,163 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Roseboro was founded when the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railroad built a line from Fayetteville to Wilmington, and it joined Stedman, Autryville, Garland, Kerr Station and several other communities that sprang to life when depots were built and commerce came into being. The railroad was built in 1889-1890.

There are two stories of how Roseboro got its name, but research has proven it to be named after John M. Rose, secretary of the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railroad. The town has grown since 1889. Roseboro was incorporated in 1891 by the North Carolina General Assembly and the first mayor was Almond Butler, an ancestor of Miss Ossie Butler, long time town clerk for Roseboro. According to a copy of the town charter on file in the town office, E.R. Johnson was the first town marshal. All but one of the first commissioner&#x27;s last names is still prominent in the town. Roseboro did not do a lot of growing at first. First accounts of the town are of a few houses and several general stores.

Roseboro&#x27;s oldest building was constructed around 1897 by W.J. Fisher. In 1908, Dr. Paul M. Crumpler practiced medicine in front of the building while Whit Tart operated a drug store in the rear, thus the beginning of Tart &amp; West Drug Store. In 1930, Paul and Sammy Butler opened a barber shop at the site. In the 1950s, Willie Butler moved in and began a mortgage and finance company. In the late 1950s, it was leased to Vander Simmons who used it for an accounting office. In 1961, Mr. Lennon H. Fisher, grandson of W.J. Fisher, took occupancy of this building and formed Fisher Insurance Agency. It remained at that location until 1978. In 1989, Jim Buchanan moved into this building and opened a photography business. In 1990, he changed the name to Jim B’S E-Z Rental. Currently, Summerlyn Naylor, great-great-granddaughter of W.J. Fisher, operates a business in the building.

The Dan E. Caison Sr. House, Troy Herring House, and Howell–Butler House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

<text>East Laurinburg is an unincorporated community in Scotland County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 345 at the 2020 census. The town was incorporated in 1903 but, due to financial improprieties and failing finances, the town&#x27;s charter was revoked by the state effective June 30, 2022, in which the area became an unincorporated part of Scotland County.

== History ==
Scotland Village was incorporated as a town in southern Scotland County in 1903. In 1909, the name was changed to East Laurinburg. Early in East Laurinburg&#x27;s history, Waverly Mills established a textile mill in the locale, which grew to include numerous homes and several churches and stores. The mill workers largely lived separately from the residents of nearby Laurinburg, the latter looking down upon the former and stalling attempts to enroll East Laurinburg children in Laurinburg city schools. In May 1934, 500 workers from four Waverly Mills plants in the town went on strike in protest of work conditions in the mills and living conditions in the company housing. The strike gained state-wide media attention after the strikers engaged in a brawl with loyalist workers, with nine people wounded by gunfire. The standoff ended 44 days later when the strikers and Waverly management agreed to arbitration, and the company subsequently promised to make improvements to plumbing in the village.

East Laurinburg&#x27;s population peaked in 1940 with 890 residents and thereafter declined. In June 2016 the town ceased submitting annual audit reports to the state government, as required by law. In October 2021 the North Carolina State Auditor published an audit which accused the town finance officer of embezzling $11,000 of public funds. North Carolina State Treasurer Dale Folwell subsequently urged the North Carolina Local Government Commission to vote to revoke the town&#x27;s incorporation, saying the town was not a financially viable unit of government. In December the commission voted to unanimously do so, reverting the town&#x27;s governing jurisdiction to Scotland County on July 1, 2022.

== History ==
Gibson was originally located in Richmond County, North Carolina. A post office was built in the area in 1846, and the town was named for its first postmaster, Noah Gibson.

In anticipation of the railroad connection, Gibson residents erected a depot, hotel, academy, and several additional stores. The spur was built in 1884 and opened on July 1 with daily rail service to Hamlet. In 1891 the Charleston, Sumter and Northern Railroad line from Bennettsville, South Carolina was linked to the Air Line at the Gibson depot. Scotland County was created in 1899 and Gibson became a part of the new jurisdiction. The town was incorporated that year. In 1904 a bank was established. A civic ruritan club was founded in 1946.

<text>Laurinburg is a city in and the county seat of Scotland County, North Carolina, United States. Located in southern North Carolina near the South Carolina border, Laurinburg is southwest of Fayetteville and is home to St. Andrews University. The population was 14,978 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
Settlers arrived at the present town site around 1785. The settlement was named for a prominent family, the McLaurins. The name was originally spelled Laurinburgh and pronounced the same as Edinburgh, though the &quot;h&quot; was later dropped. The community was initially located within the jurisdiction of Richmond County. In 1840, Laurinburg had a saloon, a store, and a few shacks. Laurinburg High School, a private school, was established in 1852. The settlement prospered in the years following. A line of the Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad was built through Laurinburg in the 1850s, with the first train reaching Laurinburg in 1861. The railroad&#x27;s shops were moved to Laurinburg in 1865 in the hope they would be safer from Union Army attack; however, in March of that year, Union forces reached Laurinburg and burned the railroad depot and temporary shops. The shops were later rebuilt. Laurinburg was incorporated in 1877. In 1894 the railway shops were moved out of the town and, combined with low cotton prices, property values in the area decreased and the town experienced an economic depression.

By the late 1800s Richmond County had a majority black population and tended to support the Republican Party in elections, while the state of North Carolina was dominated by the Democratic Party. As a result of this, white Democrats built up a political base in Laurinburg and in 1899 the town and the surrounding area was split off from Richmond into the new Scotland County. The town was declared the seat of Scotland County in 1900 and the first courthouse was erected the following year. As their influence in public affairs and share of public resources declined, local black citizens created the Laurinburg Normal Industrial Institute, later known as Laurinburg Academy, in 1904.

Main Street in Laurinburg was paved in 1914. Beginning in 1929, the Great Depression severely impacted Laurinburg, causing two banks to fail. A new courthouse was built in 1964. Laurinburg&#x27;s downtown suffered an economic decline beginning in the 1980s when the Belk department store moved to a shopping center further away. The downtown was heavily impacted by Hurricane Florence in 2018.

<text>Boulogne-sur-Mer (; ; ; or &quot;Bononia&quot;), often called just Boulogne (, ), is a coastal city in Northern France. It is a sub-prefecture of the department of Pas-de-Calais. Boulogne lies on the Côte d&#x27;Opale, a touristic stretch of French coast on the English Channel between Calais and Normandy, and the most visited location in the region after the Lille conurbation. Boulogne is its department&#x27;s second-largest city after Calais, and the 183rd-largest in France. It is also the country&#x27;s largest fishing port, specialising in herring.

Boulogne is an ancient town and was the main Roman port for trade and communication with its Province of Britain. After a period of Germanic presence following the collapse of the Empire, Boulogne was integrated into the County of Boulogne of the Kingdom of France during the Middle Ages. It was occupied by the Kingdom of England numerous times due to conflict between the two nations. In 1805 it was a staging area for Napoleon&#x27;s troops for several months during his planned invasion of the United Kingdom.

The city&#x27;s 12th-century belfry is recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site (along with other belfries of Belgium and France), while another popular attraction is the marine conservation centre Nausicaa.

==Name==
The French name &quot;Boulogne&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;Bononia&quot;, which was also the Roman name for Bologna in Italy. Both places – and Vindobona (Vienna) – are thought to have derived from native Celtic placenames, with &quot;bona&quot; possibly meaning &quot;foundation&quot;, &quot;citadel&quot;, or &quot;granary&quot;. The French epithet &quot;-&quot; (&quot;on sea&quot;) distinguishes the city from Boulogne-Billancourt on the edge of Paris. In turn, the &quot;Boulogne&quot; in Boulogne-Billancourt originates from a church there dedicated to Notre-Dame de Boulogne, &quot;Our Lady of Boulogne[-sur-Mer]&quot;.

==History==

===Origin of the city===

The foundation of the city known to the Romans as Gesoriacum is credited to the Celtic Boii. In the past, it was sometimes conflated with Caesar&#x27;s Portus Itius, but that is now thought to have been a site near Calais which has since silted up. A tall lighthouse was built at Gesoriacum circa 39 AD by order of the Emperor Caligula, possibly in preparation for an invasion of Britain. Known as the Tour d&#x27;Ordre, coastal erosion caused it to topple into the sea in 1644.From the time of Claudius&#x27;s invasion in AD 43, Gesoriacum formed the major port connecting the rest of the empire to Britain. It was the chief base of the Roman navy&#x27;s Britannic fleet until the rebellion of its admiral Carausius in 286. As part of the imperial response, the junior emperor Constantius Chlorus successfully besieged it by land and sea in 293. The name of the settlement was changed to Bononia at some point between the sack of Gesoriacum and 310, possibly as a consequence of its refounding or possibly by the replacement of the sacked and lower-lying city by another nearby community.

The city was an important town of the Morini (the &#x27;sea people&#x27;), and Zosimus called it &quot;Germanorum&quot; (&quot;Germanic-speaking&quot;) at the end of the 4th century.

===Middle Ages===

In the Middle Ages Boulogne was the capital of an eponymous county, founded in the mid-9th century. An important Count, Eustace II, assisted William the Conqueror in his conquest of England. His wife founded the city&#x27;s Notre Dame cathedral, which became a site of pilgrimage from the 12th century onwards, attended by fourteen French kings and five of England. It was an important whaling center prior to 1121. The city survived on herring fishing and received its municipal charter from Count Renaud of Dammartin in 1203.

The area was fought over by the French and the English, including several English occupations during the course of the Hundred Years War. In 1492 Henry VII laid siege to Boulogne before the conflict was ended by the Peace of Étaples. Boulogne was again occupied by the English from 1544 to 1550. In 1550, The Peace of Boulogne ended the war of England with Scotland and France. France bought back Boulogne for 400,000 crowns. A culture of smuggling was present in the city until 1659, when French gains in Flanders from the Treaty of the Pyrenees moved the border northwards.

=== 19th century ===

Boulogne received its current status as a subprefecture of the Pas-de-Calais department in 1800 due to the territorial re-organisation in Revolutionary France. France became the French Empire in 1804; in 1803 Boulogne became an Imperial City &quot;(Ville Impériale)&quot;.

The 19th century was a prosperous one for Boulogne, which became a bathing resort for wealthy Parisians after the 1848 completion of the Longueau–Boulogne railway connecting the town with the French capital. In the 19th century, the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne was reconstructed by the priest Benoît Haffreingue, who claimed to have received a call from God in 1820 to reconstruct the town&#x27;s ruined basilica. During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon amassed La Grande Armée in Boulogne to invade the United Kingdom in 1805. However, his plans were halted by other European matters and by the supremacy of the Royal Navy.

A nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (subsequently the emperor Napoleon III), returned to France in secret from his exile in Britain, passing through Boulogne in August 1840. He was later jailed for trying to lead a revolt in Strasbourg.

===World wars===


During the First World War, this was the entrepôt for the first unit of the British Expeditionary Force to land in France and for many others thereafter. Boulogne was one of the three base ports most extensively used by the Commonwealth armies on the Western Front throughout the First World War. It was closed and cleared on 27 August 1914 when the Allies were forced to fall back ahead of the German advance, but was opened again in October and from that month to the end of the war, Boulogne and Wimereux formed one of the chief hospital areas.

Until June 1918, the dead from the hospitals at Boulogne were buried in the Cimetiere de L&#x27;Est, one of the town&#x27;s cemeteries, the Commonwealth graves forming a long, narrow strip along the right hand edge of the cemetery. In the spring of 1918, it was found that space was running short in the Eastern Cemetery in spite of repeated extensions to the south and the site of the new cemetery at Terlincthun was chosen. It also was the site of an Allied (French and British) armaments production conference.
On 22 May 1940 during the Battle of France, two British Guards battalions and some pioneers attempted to defend Boulogne against an attack by the German 2nd Panzer Division. Despite fierce fighting, the British were overwhelmed and the survivors were evacuated by Royal Navy destroyers while under direct German gunfire. On 15 June 1944, 297 aircraft (155 Avro Lancasters, 130 Handley Page Halifaxes, and 12 De Havilland Mosquitos) of the Royal Air Force bombed Boulogne harbour to suppress German naval activity following D-Day. Some of the Lancasters carried Tallboy bombs and the harbour and the surrounding area were completely destroyed. In August 1944 the town was declared a &quot;fortress&quot; by Adolf Hitler but it succumbed to Operation Wellhit, the assault and liberation by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division in September. In one incident, a French civilian guided the Canadians to a &quot;secret passage&quot; leading into the walled old town and by-passing the German defenders.

To replace the destroyed urban infrastructure, affordable housing and public facility projects in functional, brutalist building styles were carried out in the 1950s and 60s.

==Geography==

<text>Albemarle () is a city in and the county seat of Stanly County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 16,432 in the 2020 census.

==History==

===Etymology===
This place-name is derived from the English surname Albemarle. According to a 1905 publication by the United States Geologic Survey, based on research by University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill history professor Kemp P. Battle, it was named specifically for General George Monck, the first Duke of Albemarle and one of the original proprietors of the colony of Carolina, which included the town.

===Ancient and colonial===
The site of modern-day Albemarle was originally peopled by small tribes of hunter-gatherers and mound builders whose artifacts and settlements have been dated back nearly 10,000 years. Large-scale European settlement of the region came in the mid-18th century via two primary waves: immigrants of Dutch, Scots-Irish and German descent moved from Pennsylvania and New Jersey seeking enhanced religious and political tolerance, while immigrants of English backgrounds came to the region from Virginia and the Cape Fear River Basin in Eastern North Carolina.

In early English colonial times, the Albemarle area was politically part of the New Hanover Precinct, out of which the Bladen Precinct was created in 1734. The renamed Bladen County was subdivided to create Anson County in 1750, which in turn spawned Montgomery County in 1779.

===Establishment of Stanly County and Albemarle===

The Albemarle region&#x27;s first post office was established in 1826; it was then known as Smith&#x27;s Store. The nearby crossroads of the Old Turnpike Road from Fayetteville to Salisbury and the Old Stage Road connecting Charlotte and Raleigh emerged as an important hub for regional commerce and trade. The region remained part of Montgomery County until 1841, when after years of attempted separation, prominent residents of the increasingly populous areas west of the Yadkin/Pee Dee River system successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly for the establishment of Stanly County as an independent entity. 
Soon after the new county was formed, its Board of Commissioners was tasked with establishing a permanent county seat within eight miles (13 km) of the home of Eben Hearne (the County&#x27;s first sheriff), and with laying out a new town, in which a courthouse would be erected. Nehemiah Hearne&#x27;s heirs donated from his plantation near the intersection of the Old Turnpike and Old Stage Roads for the construction of the new County Seat. The County Commissioners established the town&#x27;s boundaries, laid out streets and surveyed and marked parcels of property within Hearne&#x27;s donated land. The first land lot sale financed the new town&#x27;s public buildings and paid some part of the elected officials&#x27; salaries. The courthouse was erected in 1842 and used for 50 years. The City of Albemarle was formally incorporated in 1857. The town was named for Albemarle County, the first county established in North Carolina, which was in turn named for the Duke of Albemarle, George Monck, one of the Lords Proprietors granted the province of Carolina in 1663 by King Charles II.

===Economic history===
The Albemarle region&#x27;s early economic growth was fueled by agriculture (with cotton as the primary crop), regional mercantile trade and a short-lived gold rush in the nearby Uwharrie Mountains, all later supplanted by textile manufacturing. The Efird Manufacturing Co. (later American and Efird Mills) opened its first mill in Albemarle in 1896, and was followed soon thereafter by the Wiscasset Mill Company, the Cannon Mill Company, the Lillian Knitting Mill and others. In 1899, Wiscassett Mills Company established Cabarrus Bank and Trust, the first bank in Albemarle. By 1910, an electrical distribution plan for the city was underway.

The Yadkin Railroad began rail service to Albemarle from Salisbury in 1891. In 1911, the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway (WSS) constructed its own line through Albemarle to support the booming textile and market, eventually driving the Yadkin Railroad into obsolescence. The WSS still provides freight service through Albemarle, but since 1933 there has been no passenger service to the city. The Old Market Street Station on the WSS line has been restored, and is now the site of a popular farmer&#x27;s market. The railbed of the Yadkin Railroad has been ripped up and paved over, though a one-mile (1.6 km) segment of its route south of Albemarle now serves as a hiking trail in Rock Creek Park.

In 1923, a state contract was let to construct NC-24/27 to Charlotte, the first paved highway out of Albemarle. In 1950, Stanly County Memorial Hospital opened on land donated by Wiscassett Mills.

Albemarle got its first indoor shopping center in 1966, known as Quenby Mall, and would later be converted to house governmental services in 1993.

In 2024, a new cryptocurrency was developed in Albemarle as part of a fundraiser to save the local restaurant &quot;Jay&#x27;s Seafood&quot;, which had been damaged in a fire.

===Historic preservation===
Albemarle was recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a National Main Street City in 1993. There are a number of historic preservation and adaptive reuse projects in its downtown that have been recently completed or are underway, including an initiative to create a greenway linking many of the City&#x27;s parks and historic sites. The Freeman-Marks House, probably built during the 1820s, is the oldest known surviving house in Albemarle. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, along with the Romanesque Revival Opera House/Starnes Jewelers Building (1908) and three small historic districts in the city&#x27;s downtown area. Another important historic property is the Isaiah W. &quot;Buck&quot; Snuggs House, an antebellum home on Third Street then owned and now named for a Stanly County sheriff who lost his leg in the Civil War Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. The Stanly County Museum in Albemarle provides a focal point for regional historic research and preservation.

The Albemarle Graded School-Central Elementary School, Thomas Marcellus Denning House, Downtown Albemarle Historic District, Five Points Historic District, Opera House-Starnes Jewelers Building, Pee Dee Avenue Historic District, Second Street Historic District, and Isaiah Wilson Snugs House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

The city is centered on the junction of U.S. Route 52 and the duplexed NC-24/27 in the Piedmont Region of North Carolina. Its topography is characterized by rolling, eroded hills, deciduous forests, and fast-running, narrow, shallow streams that feed the Yadkin/Pee Dee River Basin. Little Long Creek and Town Creek are the major non-seasonal streams through Albemarle; both flow generally southward into the Long and Big Bear Creek Sub-basin.

===Geology===
Albemarle is located in the Floyd Church Formation of the Carolina Slate Belt. Thickly bedded, axially cleaved meta-mudstone and meta-argillite are common in this formation, interbedded with meta-sandstone, meta-conglomerate and meta-volcanic rock. Biotite is the most prevalent Paleozoic metamorphic rock in the region.

<text>Malung-Sälen Municipality (&quot;Malung-Sälens kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Dalarna County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Malung.

&quot;Malung Municipality&quot; was created in 1971 by the amalgamation of &quot;old&quot; Malung with the adjacent entities Lima and Transtrand. In 2007 the Government of Sweden decided to approve the present name, which took effect on 1 January 2008. The reason for the double name, the only of its kind in Sweden, is to promote the skiing resort area Sälen in the northern part of the municipality.

==Geography==

The terrain in the area is largely submontane, with plenty of bog and forest. The Transtrandsfjällen in the north are the southernmost mountains in Sweden, marking the start of the Scandinavian mountain range. Rocks are mostly metamorphic and sedimentary, with occurrences of basalt. Most settlements are located in and around the valley of Västerdalälven river.

===Localities===
The municipal population was around 13,000 in the 1960s, but has decreased continually since then.

The villages in the municipality, with population figures from 2005, are:
* Lima (418)
* Limedsforsen (443)
* Malung (seat) (5,146)
* Malungsfors (559)
* Sälen (508) - Is a nationally renowned skiing resort.
* Transtrand (373)
* Yttermalung (216)
* Öje (202) (population figure from 2000)

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Malung-Sälen Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 10,210 inhabitants, with 7,983 Swedish citizens of voting age. 37.6 % voted for the left coalition and 60.7 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<text>New London is a town in Stanly County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 600 at the 2010 census, and was estimated to be 724 as of 2019. The town lies between Albemarle and Richfield along U.S. 52 in the southern Piedmont region of the state, approximately east-northeast of Charlotte. It was the site of a gold mine, which was active during periods of the mid-1800s and early 1900s.

== History ==

New London was founded as the unincorporated settlement of Bilesville, north of Albemarle, &quot;circa&quot; 1830, and named after Thomas &quot;Uncle Tommy&quot; Biles, a local landowner and farmer. At the time, the land was part of Montgomery County until Stanly County was formed in 1841. Near the area where the first Carolina Gold Rush took place, gold was found near Bilesville and the first mine was opened in 1859, though it closed during the Civil War. When the New London &amp; States Company purchased the mine to reopen it in the early 1870s, and at the suggestion of company executive W. A. Judd, the settlement voted to rename itself after the company. The settlement became officially incorporated as a town on March 25, 1891. The main gold mine, known as the Parker Mine (after the farmer on whose land it was discovered) ceased operation in 1894, though several other local industries continued to provide employment for the town, including a cordage mill, a lumber mill, a brick mill, and a livery stable. In 1923, less than three years after the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment granting women the right to vote, the town elected Mrs. T. V. Staton as their mayor, becoming the first female mayor, as well as the first female to serve in municipal government in the state. The mine was reopened for a time starting in 1934, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s, modern amenities such as telephone service, electrical service, paved roads, and a state highway were built in town. Town sewer and water service was completed in 2002.

<text>Rättvik Municipality (&quot;Rättviks kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Dalarna County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Rättvik.

In 1963 the municipality was reunited with &quot;Boda&quot;, which had been detached from it in 1875, and in 1974 &quot;Ore&quot; was added, thus forming the present municipality.

== Geography ==
Rättvik municipality is situated in the middle of Sweden in the province of Dalarna, in between the three Swedish cities Borlänge, Falun and Mora.

It is located in a traditional forest and agriculture environment, which is how most of Sweden looked in the 19th century and earlier. Nowadays, its culture also attracts a significant number of tourists.

The area near Rättvik municipality has the highest population of brown bears in Sweden.

==Town==
The contiguous urban area, or locality of Rättvik lies on Lake Siljan, and had 4,588 inhabitants in 2005; it is widely known for its old tradition of folkmusic and the beauty of the surroundings close to Lake Siljan; it is included on many tours of Sweden as an example of a traditional Swedish and Scandinavian way of living.

Its culture and landscape are by some regarded as being genuinely Swedish as it gets. For instance, Rättvik still has its picturesque old church located by the water, where it is surrounded by old &quot;church stables&quot; where the church visitors used to leave their horses.

Every year the folk music festival &quot;Music at Siljan&quot; is held in Rättvik, by the shores of Siljan.

The annual summer opera festival, the Dalhalla Opera, takes place 7 km north of the town in an open-air theatre located in a former limestone quarry.

The bandy club IFK Rättvik has an indoor arena.


==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Rättvik Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Residents include everyone registered as living in the district, regardless of age or citizenship status. Valid voters indicate Swedish citizens above the age of 18 who therefore can vote in general elections. Left vote and right vote indicate the result between the two major blocs in said district in the 2022 general election. Employment indicates the share of people between the ages of 20 and 64 who are working taxpayers. Foreign background is defined as residents either born abroad or with two parents born outside of Sweden. Median income is the received monthly income through either employment, capital gains or social grants for the median adult above 20, also including pensioners in Swedish kronor. The section about college graduates indicates any degree accumulated after high school.

In total there were 9,064 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 42.8 % voted for the left coalition and 55.8 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

The present municipality was formed in two steps during the last nationwide local government reform in Sweden. In 1967 the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) Smedjebacken was reunited with &quot;Norrbärke&quot; from which it had been detached in 1918. In 1974 &quot;Söderbärke&quot; was added.

The municipality borders to eight other municipalities.

The coat of arms depicts a sailing ship and cogwheels. These are intended to show the old and new industry sectors of the municipality. It was first granted 1947, but has undergone a few redesigns since. In Smedjebacken there is a skiingclub NSKalpin.com which has a live webcamera from the slope. Also close by is Lernbo where the biggest sportsfishing retailer in Europe has its headquarters.

==About==

Norwood is currently served by two railroads, one US Highway, and one NC Route. Water and sewer service is provided by the town through their own water and sewer plant. A branch library and museum provide educational opportunities. Bordered by Lake Tillery and the Rocky River, recreation is abundant. Golf is available at Piney Point Golf Club.

Fork Stables is located approximately two miles south of town and a Michelin tire plant, which manufactures aircraft tires, is located in town.

Police and fire protection are provided by the town by full-time officers.

Norwood is nestled in an area between two rivers next to the Uwharrie Mountains. There are two town parks for relaxation, recreation and exercise. The Darrell Almond Community Park is on North Main Street. This park features a gazebo next to the central pond and the Skidmore House which is available for community use. The park also features two walking trails, picnic shelters, horseshoe pits, a shuffle board court and playground equipment. Picnic shelters and the Skidmore House can be reserved at Town Hall. Norwood Memorial Park, located between Turner and College streets, has athletic fields and a larger community building. The building can be reserved for a fee at Town Hall.

Norwood has recently adopted a comprehensive transportation plan, pedestrian plan, and land use plan. These plans will help the town grow in a meaningful way and provide more sidewalks and trails along with an overall plan for better roads and transportation. Several state bicycle trails pass through town and there are scenic by-ways along N.C. 24/27/73 and other highways.

Celebrations throughout the year include Arbor Day in April, Picnic in the Park in October, and the annual Christmas parade. The nearby Fork Stables host Outdoor Heritage Days and two weeks of equestrian cross country, dressage, and show jumping competitions.

Located in the southern Piedmont region of North Carolina in Stanly County, Norwood is situated at the confluence of the Pee Dee River and the Rocky River. Lake Tillery borders the town on the east. To the west is the Rocky River. The great natural resources of Morrow Mountain State Park, Uwharrie National Forest, lakes, rivers and streams of the Yadkin - Pee Dee valley are among the many historic and beautiful places to visit.

==History==

The first settlements in the Norwood area began in the 1740s with settlers from Delaware and other middle Atlantic colonies following Indian trails and rivers. These early settlements were along the local river valleys. One family, the Colsons, chose to settle near the confluence of the Rocky and Pee Dee rivers and built an ordinary, a tavern serving food and providing lodging. The Colsons also operated a mill and a ferry. Anson County granted a permit for Colson&#x27;s Ordinary in the mid-18th century, at that time Stanly County was part of Anson. That permit may have been the first such granted in North Carolina. During the Revolutionary War Colson&#x27;s land was the site of a patriot victory over local Tory forces. This is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Colson&#x27;s Mill, the Battle of Colson&#x27;s Ordinary or the Fight at Colson&#x27;s. This area is now known as The Fork, named for the fork of the two rivers.

In the early 19th century at the centerline between the Rocky River and the Pee Dee River a camp meeting place was created. The area became known as Center. In 1826 Methodists built the first church on the camp meeting grounds. More activity and building occurred and the Center area became a trading center. The town of Norwood was incorporated in 1881 and named after the Norwood brothers&#x27; store, an early establishment in the Center community that housed the area&#x27;s post office.

The local economy in the 19th century was primarily agricultural and Norwood was a commercial center. Mercantile stores (Wal-Marts of their day) in the town sold farm implements and most other necessities for everyday life. Norwood’s first high school, a private school, was built in 1879. Industries came to town in the late 1890s beginning with Norwood Manufacturing Company, a cotton mill which built the town&#x27;s first mill and mill village. In the mid-1940s that facility was purchased and modernized by Collins &amp; Aikman.

As with many communities, railroads changed the face of Norwood. The arrival of the Yadkin Railroad in 1891 allowed greater access to larger markets across the state and nation. Eventually two other railroads would serve Norwood; the original Norfolk Southern and the Winston-Salem Southbound. Until 1928 one could ride from Norwood to Albemarle and Badin in a rail car on the Yadkin Railroad. The Winston-Salem Southbound in the early 20th century saw a large number of passengers until improved roads and competition from the automobile ended that service in 1933.

In the early 20th century Norwood’s business district suffered a major disaster. A downtown fire spread up the east side of Main Street consuming all of the wooden buildings until it stopped at the two-story brick building housing Harris-McAulay Mercantile (now M. B. Irvin Unlimited). The fire was so intense that it blew out all the showcase windows of the U.B. Blalock building across the street (where the Family Dollar building now stands). When the downtown was rebuilt most buildings were built in brick. Norwood’s first public school was built in 1913 on the site of the present Norwood Elementary School.

The Pee Dee River was a natural resource to be tapped for producing electricity. The Yadkin had already been developed in the prior decade by Alcoa to produce electricity for their smelting facility in Badin. Carolina Power &amp; Light Company began construction of the Tillery Hydroelectric development in 1926 and started producing electricity in the spring of 1928.

The Great Depression affected the town into the 1940s. Businesses and farms failed and property was sold at the courthouse steps for delinquent taxes. Norwood&#x27;s only bank at the time failed also. Some businesses that did survive the depression operated only on a part-time basis.

In the 1950s a new town hall and police station was built on the corner of Pee Dee Avenue and Campbell Street where the Norwood Library and the Norwood Museum are now located. The police station has been moved to North Main Street in what was France Byrd&#x27;s Pure service station. Town Hall is now on South Main Street, in what was originally the First National Bank of Albemarle.

The Randle House was listed on the National Register of Historic Placesin 1992.

<text>Vansbro Municipality (&quot;Vansbro kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Dalarna County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Vansbro.

During the local government reform of 1971 &quot;Järna&quot;, &quot;Nås&quot; and &quot;Äppelbo&quot; were amalgamated to form the new Vansbro Municipality. The name was taken from the locality Vansbro, which also became the municipal seat.

*Nås, pop. 465
*Äppelbo, pop. 261

== History ==

Many of the parishes and towns of today can be traced several centuries back. Around Järna has been found ovens from the Viking Age or older, showing that the town had been used in the processing of iron for a long time, and probably leading to its name (&quot;Järn&quot; means iron in Swedish).

Nås parish was mentioned in 1479, Järna parish in 1417, Äppelbo as Äppelboda parish 1417.

Äppelbo (literally &quot;Apple Village&quot;) was in the 1690s the seat for the Västerdal regiment, Western Dalarnas regimente. Swedish warlike kings Charles XII and Gustaf IV Adolf made use of the men when they fought around in Europe.

Modern iron works were not established until the early 19th century, and had a short history that ended before the end of the century. The industry then became dominated by wood industry. Around the year 1900, three large saw mills were built in the town, making it prosper. With the railroad located through the town Vansbro in 1898, it further enhanced communications for industries.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Vansbro Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 6,766 inhabitants, including 5,305 Swedish citizens of voting age. 43.6 % voted for the left coalition and 54.9 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

<doc id="128259" wikidata="Q123855" url="?curid=128259" title="Älvdalen Municipality">
<text>Älvdalen Municipality () is a municipality in Dalarna County in central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Älvdalen.

The two parishes &quot;Särna&quot; and &quot;Idre&quot; were ceded to Sweden from Norway under the treaty of Brömsebro on 13 August 1645. In 1971 the three municipalities &quot;Särna&quot;, &quot;Idre&quot; (which itself had been split off from Särna in 1916) and &quot;Älvdalen&quot; were amalgamated to form the present municipality.

Älvdalen literally means &quot;River Valley&quot;, a name stemming from the area around the town Älvdalen, situated along the Österdal River, in the municipality&#x27;s southern part.

The middle part of the coat of arms is meant to depict the landscape: streams and hills.

== Geography ==
Geographically, it is considered divided into three parts. From north to south: the mountainous (fjäll) part, the forest part, and the valley (Älv) part.

=== North ===
The northern part is located within the Scandinavian mountain range. It has cultural influences from the native Sámi people.

Idre, with about 800 inhabitants is a notable skiing resort.

This part has some high mountains including Storvätteshågna at 1,204 meters and &quot;Städjan&quot; at 1,131 m. The Töfsingdalen National Park is also located in the northernmost parts.

The Northern part is the northernmost point of Svealand, one of the three crowns under the Swedish throne.

=== Central ===
The forest part has forests, with the national park Fulufjället also belonging to this part. Its influences come from it bordering to Norway, and its history has many examples and remains from its border conflicts. To symbolize this, the lower part of the coat of arms depict a crossbow. The point furthest away from any seas in Scandinavia is located here.

The town Särna is located along the Österdal River, with 930 inhabitants. Like Idre, its main industry is tourism. The town once belonged to Norway, but in 1644 it was occupied by 200 Swedish peasants, which in effect made it a Swedish town, although it was official granted first with new borders of 1751.

=== South ===
The southern area is populated by 5,000 persons, of whom most speak or understand the Elfdalian (or &quot;Övdalsk&quot;, &quot;Älvdalsmål&quot;) dialect/language, which is very different from standard Swedish.

This area may be said to have the most interesting culture, with the town Älvdalen and several notable villages such as Evertsberg, Blyberg, Klitten, Brunnsberg, Västermyckeläng and Åsen.

=== Localities ===
==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Älvdalen Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 5,481 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 40.8 % voted for the left coalition and 56.4 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

The town was named after an engineer who helped complete the railroad through the present day town. Once the rail line was completed, the mail was delivered by train to Stanfield, thus moving the post office from Locust to Stanfield. Three local area schools were combined to create Stanfield School. Pete Henkel Park was created in the 1970s. Today, Stanfield School is now Stanfield Elementary School that runs pre-k through the 5th grade, and the students then go to West Stanly High School in Red Cross, Stanly Early College in Albemarle or to Gray Stone Day School in Misenheimer.

It borders County Antrim to the north, the Irish Sea to the east, County Armagh to the west, and County Louth across Carlingford Lough to the southwest.

In the east of the county is Strangford Lough and the Ards Peninsula. The largest settlement is Bangor, a city on the northeast coast. Three other large towns and cities are on its border: Newry lies on the western border with County Armagh, while Lisburn and Belfast lie on the northern border with County Antrim. Down contains both the southernmost point of Northern Ireland (Cranfield Point) and the easternmost point of Ireland (Burr Point).

It was one of two counties of Northern Ireland to have a Protestant majority at the time of the 2001 census. The other Protestant-majority County was County Antrim to the north. However, as of the 2021 Census, it is now the only county in which there is a Protestant background majority, as Antrim has Protestant background plurality. In the 2021 census, Ards and North Down had the highest number of &quot;No Religion&quot; responses (30.6%) for Northern Ireland.

In March 2018, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published its list of Best Places to Live in Britain, including five in Northern Ireland. The list included three in County Down: Holywood, Newcastle, and Strangford.

The county has two cities: Newry and Bangor. The latter is the more recent, gaining city status on 2 December 2022.

==Toponymy==
County Down takes its name from &quot;dún&quot;, the Irish word for dun or fort, which is a common root in Gaelic place names (such as Dundee, Dunfermline and Dumbarton in Scotland and Donegal and Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland). The fort in question was in the historic town of Downpatrick, originally known as &quot;Dún Lethglaise&quot; (&quot;fort of the green side&quot; or &quot;fort of the two broken fetters&quot;).

==History==

During the 2nd century the region was home to the Voluntii tribe, according to Ptolemy. From the 400s–1177 County Down formed a central part of the kingdom of Ulaid. Ulaid was a frequent target of Viking raids in the eighth and ninth centuries, however fierce local resistance prevented the Norse from setting up permanent settlements in the region. In 1001 a fleet led by Sigtrygg Silkbeard raided much of the region in retribution for the Ulaiden&#x27;s refusal to offer him sanctuary from Brian Boru the previous year.

The region was invaded by the Normans in 1177. From the 1180s–1600s the region saw waves of English and Scottish immigration. In 1569 the Irish Parliament passed &quot;An Act for turning of Countries that be not yet Shire Grounds into Shire Grounds&quot;. In 1570 a commission was issued in pursuance of that statute &quot;to survey and make enquiry in the countries and territories ... that are not shire ground, or are doubtful to what shire they belong; to limit and nominate them a shire or county; to divide them into countries, baronies or hundreds, or to join them to any existing shire or barony&quot; &quot;for the countries or territories of Arde, as well this side Blackstafe as the other side, Copelande islands, the Dufferin, Clandeboy, Kilultoghe, the Glynes with the Raughlines, Momerie and Carie, the Rowte M&#x27;William (McQuillan) and all lands between lough Coine and lough Eaghe, and the water of Strangforde and the Banne. To certify their proceedings before the 1st August.&quot; The county was privately planted during the Plantation period (16th–17th centuries). During the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–1691) the county was a centre of Protestant rebellion against the rule of the Catholic James II. After forming a scratch force the Protestants were defeated by the Irish Army at the Break of Dromore and forced to retreat, leading to the whole of Down falling under Jacobite control. Later the same year Marshal Schomberg&#x27;s large Williamite expedition arrived in Belfast Lough and captured Bangor. After laying siege to Carrickfergus, Schomberg marched south to Dundalk Camp, clearing County Down and much of the rest of East Ulster of Jacobite troops.

==Geography==

Down contains two significant peninsulas: Ards Peninsula and Lecale peninsula.

The county has a coastline along Belfast Lough to the north and Carlingford Lough to the south (both of which have access to the sea). Strangford Lough lies between the Ards Peninsula and the mainland. Down also contains part of the shore of Lough Neagh. Smaller loughs include Lough Island Reavy and Castlewellan Lake near Castlewellan, Clea Lough near Killyleagh, Lough Money and Loughinisland near Downpatrick and, within the Mourne Mountains, Silent Valley Reservoir, Ben Crom Reservoir, Spelga Dam and Lough Shannagh.

The River Lagan forms most of the border with County Antrim. The River Bann also flows through the southwestern areas of the county. Other rivers include the Clanrye and Quoile.

There are several islands off the Down coast: Mew Island, Light House Island and the Copeland Islands, all of which lie to the north of the Ards Peninsula. Gunn Island lies off the Lecale coast. In addition, there are at least seventy islands (several inhabited) along with many islets – or pladdies – in Strangford Lough, although folk tradition says there are 365 islands in Strangford Lough, one for every day of the year.

County Down is where, in the words of the song by Percy French, &quot;The mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea&quot;, and the area around the granite Mourne Mountains continues to be known for its scenery. Slieve Donard, at , is the highest peak in the Mournes, in Northern Ireland and in the province of Ulster. Another important peak is Slieve Croob, at , the source of the River Lagan.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Star of the County Down&quot; is a popular Irish ballad.

The county is named in the lyrics of the song &quot;Around the World&quot;, from the film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, which was an American top ten hit for Bing Crosby and UK top ten hit for Ronnie Hilton, both in 1957, although it was Mantovani&#x27;s instrumental version which was actually used in the film. Rihanna&#x27;s video &quot;We Found Love&quot; was filmed there in 2011, causing complaints when the singer removed her clothes to reveal a bikini.

The Ulster singer Van Morrison has made reference to the County Down in the lyrics to several songs including &quot;Northern Muse (Solid Ground)&quot;, &quot;Mystic of the East&quot; and the nostalgic &quot;Coney Island&quot;, which names several places and landmarks in the county. Van Morrison also covered &quot;Star of the County Down&quot; with The Chieftains as a part of their collaboration album &quot;Irish Heartbeat&quot;.

C. S. Lewis, author of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, was inspired by the Mourne Mountains. There is a Narnia trail in Kilbroney Park, in Rostrevor.

Sam Hanna Bell based his novel of Ulster rural life, &quot;December Bride&quot; (1951) in the Ards peninsula. A film version of the novel, also called &quot;December Bride&quot;, was produced in 1990 and released in November 1991.

Several areas of County Down served as filming locations for the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; including Castle Ward (Winterfell), Inch Abby (Riverlands), and Tollymore Forest Park.

The Academy Award-winning short film &quot;The Shore&quot; (2011) was filmed in and around Killough bay by director/writer Terry George and his daughter Oorlagh. The film starred Ciaran Hynds, Kerry Condon and Connleth Hill.

<text>Danbury is a city located in Danbury Township, Stokes County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 142. It is the county seat of Stokes County.
Danbury is located on North Carolina Highway 8/89 approximately north of Winston-Salem and is the &quot;Gateway to Hanging Rock&quot;. The Stokes County Government Center, Arts Council, school board, county jail, a public library, a post office, and other public services are found within the town limits. LifeBrite Community Hospital of Stokes is located about a half mile northwest of the town. North Stokes High School, a big part of town, is located 7.4 miles to the northwest (North NC Highway 89 to Piney Grove Church Road, then left onto North Stokes School Road). 

Danbury is a popular rest stop for bicyclists, motorcyclists, and driving enthusiasts due to the numerous scenic roads in Stokes County. Danbury also attracts outdoor enthusiasts because of its location on the Dan River and near the entrance to Hanging Rock State Park.

There are no regional or national franchises in Danbury, only local shops like the Danbury General Store, and small restaurants. J.E.Priddy&#x27;s General Store, a local historic landmark dating from the late 19th century, is still in business selling goods old and new. It is located about east of town on Sheppard Mill Rd.

==History==
Danbury was founded in 1851 specifically to serve as the new centrally-located county seat after Stokes County was divided in 1849, creating Forsyth County to the south (with the new county seat of Winston, later Winston-Salem) and a smaller Stokes County. Danbury was briefly known as Crawford.

No battles occurred in Danbury during the Civil War, but it housed and supported the war efforts of the Confederate Army. The Moratock Iron Furnace, which is still found in Moratock Park, was used in the smelting of iron ore. General George Stoneman&#x27;s raid passed through Danbury on April 9, 1865, the day of the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House, Va. Other historical features in the town include the Wilson Fulton House, the Old Stokes County Court House, and Moody&#x27;s Tavern (later McCanless Hotel).

In addition to the Moratock Iron Furnace, the Danbury Historic District, Hanging Rock State Park Bathhouse, and Stokes County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Mount Airy is a city in Surry County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 10,676. As of 2020, the city is the most populous municipality in Surry County. Mount Airy is located within the Piedmont Triad metropolitan region.

==History==
The region currently known as Mount Airy, North Carolina, was originally settled in the 1750s by predominantly English, Scotch-Irish, and German settlers. The native Cheraw people were known to inhabit the area prior to the arrival of these European settlers. As westward expansion progressed following the French and Indian War, Mount Airy started to develop, serving as a stagecoach stop on the road connecting Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Galax, Virginia. The city derived its name from a plantation in the vicinity.

Officially incorporated in 1885, Mount Airy quickly thrived due to the region&#x27;s abundant natural resources, specifically granite and tobacco. This led to the establishment of the North Carolina Granite Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest open-face granite quarry. The locally quarried granite has been used in famous structures, including the Wright Brothers National Memorial and the Arlington Memorial Bridge.

Mount Airy became a significant hub for the textile and furniture manufacturing industries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Companies such as Spencer&#x27;s Incorporated and Renfro Corporation established mills in the city. However, the latter half of the 20th century brought economic challenges due to increased global competition and industry automation.

In 1977, Mount Airy established its official seal, representing the industries vital to its local economy: furniture manufacturing, textiles, tobacco, and granite quarrying.

Gaining fame as the birthplace of actor Andy Griffith and the believed inspiration for the fictional town of Mayberry in the &quot;Andy Griffith Show,&quot; Mount Airy capitalized on its connection with the series. It established annual events like Mayberry Days and tourist attractions such as Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop and the Andy Griffith Museum.

In recognition of its vibrant community life and civic achievements, Mount Airy was named an All American City in 1994.

The W. F. Carter House, William Carter House, Edgar Harvey Hennis House, William Alfred Moore House, Mount Airy Historic District, North Carolina Granite Corporation Quarry Complex, Renfro Mill, and Trinity Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Mount Airy is located along the Ararat River, about south of the Virginia state line. The United States Census Bureau states the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Avesta Municipality (&quot;Avesta kommun&quot;) is one of 290 municipalities of Sweden. It is in Dalarna County, in the central part of the country, and its seat is in the town of Avesta.

The municipality in its present size was created in 1967 when the four surrounding municipalities were joined with the then &quot;City of Avesta&quot;. In 1971 it became a municipality of unitary type.

== Geography ==
Avesta borders to the municipalities of:
* Hedemora in Dalarna,
* Hofors and Sandviken in Gävleborg County,
* Norberg and Sala in Västmanland County

=== Localities ===
* Avesta (the seat)
* Krylbo (part of the seat Avesta.)
* Horndal
* Fors

== Sports ==
Speedway: The most successful sport team in Avesta is their speedway team Masarna, translating to &quot;the men of Dalecarlia&quot;, competing in the highest division in Sweden.

Football: Avesta AIK, Krylbo IF
Ladies&#x27; handball: Avesta Brovallen HF
Ice hockey: Avesta BK

== Notability ==

From 1644 to 1776, Avesta was the largest part of the Swedish Mint, manufacturing mainly copper plate money. The world&#x27;s largest – a &quot;10 daler&quot; plate – is exhibited in the Avesta Myntmuseum, and weighs .
In Stubbsveden, just west of the town Avesta, is a wildlife park for European bison (wisent). Guided tours are conducted around and in between the confinements in the summer season. Occasionally, individuals from this and other Swedish animal parks are relocated to the reserve herds in Poland and Romania to widen their DNA pool.
The city&#x27;s largest industry is its steel mill, today owned by the Finnish company Outokumpu Oyj. Iron production started here in the 16th century, was industrialized in the 17th, but was surpassed by the copper-plate-producing Swedish Mint factory from 1644. However, production was maintained during the centuries, and in 1823 a forge was added. In 1924, production of stainless, acid-proof, and fire-resistive steels was initiated. In the 1960s, these were still the main products, but twenty years later, the cold- and hot-rolled stainless qualities dominated. In 1991, British Steel Stainless merged with the Avesta firm, and in 2001 Outokumpu took over the majority of the ownership.
The largest Dalecarlian horse (&quot;Dalahäst&quot;) in the world is located in Avesta. It is tall and weighs 67 tons.

<text>Bryson City is a town in and the county seat of Swain County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,558 as of the 2020 census. Located in what was historically the land of the Cherokee, Bryson City was founded as Charleston to serve as the county seat of Swain County when it was formed from parts of surrounding counties. It grew into an important local rail hub. Today the city serves as a popular tourist destination, lying just to the west of the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, for outdoor activities in the Nantahala National Forest, and along the Nantahala River and Fontana Lake, and serves as the home of the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, a heritage railroad that provides tours of the Nantahala valley. The popular Nantahala Outdoor Center provides guide services for many of the outdoor activities in the area.

==History==
===Indigenous settlements===
Indigenous cultures of Native Americans have been living and hunting along the Tuckasegee River in the vicinity of what is now Bryson City for nearly 14,000 years. The village of Kituwa, which the Cherokee believed to be their oldest village and &quot;mother town&quot;, was located along the Tuckasegee River. The ancient mound and village site is now controlled again by the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and is preserved as a sacred site. (Bryson City developed downstream from this site.)

In 1567, an &quot;orata&quot; (minor chief) from Kituwa is believed to have met with Spanish explorer Juan Pardo in the French Broad Valley to the north. During the American Revolutionary War, many Cherokee allied with the British, hoping to expel European Americans from their territory. American soldiers burned and destroyed the town of Kituwa in 1776, but the Cherokee continued to hold annual ceremonial dances at the site throughout the 19th century.
Around 1818, a Cherokee chief known as Big Bear received a reservation of land immediately west of the confluence of Deep Creek and the Tuckasegee River. Big Bear sold part of his reservation to Darling Belk in 1819 and another part to John B. Love in 1824. Throughout the 1830s, Belk&#x27;s heirs and Love fought an extended legal battle over control of the former Big Bear land, with Love finally prevailing in 1840. The following year, Love sold part of the land to James and Diana Shuler. The Shulers, in turn, sold parts of their land to Colonel Thaddeus Bryson and merchant Alfred Cline. A small hamlet known as Bear Springs developed on what was once Big Bear&#x27;s reservation.

===Contemporary history===
With its population having increased, Swain County was formed from parts of Jackson and Macon counties in 1871, during the Reconstruction era. The new commissioners first met at Cline&#x27;s store at Bear Springs. Lucy Ann (Raby) Cline agreed to sell several lots of her land to form a county seat. Initially known as Charleston, the county seat was laid out in a T-shape, formed by what are now Main and Everett streets (the latter street was named for the county&#x27;s first sheriff, Epp Everett). The first Swain County Courthouse was completed in 1874. In 1872, shortly after completion of the new jail, a gang led by Harvey Cooper stormed the jail and freed Tom Colvert, whom they deemed unjustly imprisoned for killing a rival at a saloon in Robbinsville.

In 1889, the people of Charleston changed the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Bryson City&quot; to acknowledge the role of Thaddeus Bryson in its development, and to eliminate confusion from sharing a name with Charleston, South Carolina. The Western North Carolina Railroad laid tracks through Bryson City in 1884, greatly improving transportation to the previously isolated area. The Bryson City Bank opened in 1904. The current Swain County Courthouse was completed in 1908, replacing the former one.
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which was established in 1933 during the Great Depression, generates considerable revenue to for Swain County. Horace Kephart, an author and outdoors enthusiast who was based in Bryson City for several years, was a key early proponent for creation of the park. The Deep Creek section of the park, which is immediately north of Bryson City, has a large campground and multiple trailheads. The park&#x27;s main eastern entrance is located just a few miles east of Bryson City at Cherokee. Cherokee is the southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway. It is also the base of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribe in North Carolina. Many are descendants of Cherokee who avoided removal in the late 1830s.

The completion of Fontana Dam in 1944 created a reservoir, which inundated the only highway connecting Bryson City with the remote area of the Smokies known as the North Shore. The U.S. government began constructing a new highway in 1948, now known as Lakeview Drive, but it was slow. By 1972, only had been completed. Environmental and financial issues stalled the project, and the road became known to locals as &quot;The Road to Nowhere&quot;.

In 2007, the National Park Service deemed the road&#x27;s construction to be in violation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park&#x27;s general management plan, and began working with Swain County to find an alternative.

The increasing usage of the automobile led to a decline in railroad transportation, and Southern Railway (which had replaced the Western North Carolina Railroad) dropped passenger service in 1948. After Norfolk Southern ended freight traffic on the railroad in 1985, the state of North Carolina purchased the tracks. In 1988, the state established a scenic line, known as the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, with its depot and departure point in Bryson City.

In 2015, the city&#x27;s first FM station was launched. WTIJ-LP (100.7) broadcasts local and nationally syndicated ministers, and Christian music. The station is owned by Grace Christian Academy and broadcasts over the air and online 24/7.

==Geography==
Bryson City is located just west of the confluence of the Tuckasegee River, which flows westward from its source in the mountains to the east, and Deep Creek, which flows south from its source near Newfound Gap in the Great Smoky Mountains. After flowing around the Bryson City Island Park, and passing through Bryson City, the Tuckasegee flows southwestward for another before emptying into the Little Tennessee River. Fontana Lake, an impoundment of the Little Tennessee, covers the lower of the Tuckasegee.

The town is surrounded on all sides by mountains. The Great Smoky Mountains rise to the north, the Cowee Mountains rise to the south, and the Plott Balsams rise to the east. The boundary of the Nantahala National Forest passes just south of the city, and the boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park passes just to the north. The Qualla Boundary, which comprises the bulk of the reservation of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, dominates the area to the east.

Bryson City is centered around the junction of Everett Street and Main Street. Main Street is part of U.S. Route 19, which connects Bryson City to Cherokee to the northeast and Murphy to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (5.33%) is water.

It was also the name for nearby Eastatoe Gap and Eastatoe Falls. The Cherokee word for the Carolina parakeet was &quot;eastatoe.&quot;

<text>Columbia is a town in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 610 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Tyrrell County.

==Geography==
The Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula is located in northeastern North Carolina, inshore of Nags Head and the Outer Banks in the Inner Banks region. The peninsula is framed by Albemarle Sound to the north, Alligator River to the east, and the Scuppernong River to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Tyrrell County was Named for Sir John Tyrrell, one of the Lords Proprietors of the Carolina colony. Tyrrell County&#x27;s boundaries originally stretched westward from &quot;Roanoke Island&quot; to near present-day Tarboro. In 1870, the territory was divided and resulted in what is now known as Tyrrell, Martin, Washington, and Dare counties. Elizabethtown, later renamed Columbia, was established on the banks of the Scuppernong River in 1793, and became the Tyrrell County seat in 1799. 

Somerset Place State Historic Site, a representative antebellum plantation dating from 1785, is located near Columbia. Beginning in 1829, this was home to two generations of the Collins family-Josiah Collins III, his wife Mary, and their six sons. It was also home to more than 300 enslaved men, women, and children of African descent whose lives and work are interpreted here as well. Somerset Place offers an insightful view of plantation life during the antebellum period. 

The earliest newspaper in Columbia is known as the &quot;Eagle&quot; and last known issue: April 1, 1943.

In 1874, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad was built between the cities Charlotte and Monroe. The railroad, which runs through the town, brought prosperity to the area. Indian Trail was incorporated as a town in 1907, with established city limits based upon a one-half mile radius from the intersection of Indian Trail Road and the Seaboard Railroad. The historic rail depot at the intersection still stands, and is currently occupied by an auction business. The rail line is now operated by CSX Transportation.

The Village enacted a new land use plan in 2004, to establish its desire to preserve its open spaces firmly, and low-density character. Marvin is located near Ballantyne, South Charlotte.

In April 2022, the village opened a village hall near Marvin Elementary School.

== History ==
The area known as Marvin today was settled and inhabited by elements of the Waxhaw Indian tribe, who lived near the present day border between North Carolina and South Carolina. The Waxhaw gained their name from the type of waxy reed which grew near the swamps of the Waxhaw forests. 

On October 30, 1629, King Charles I of England granted the establishment of the Colony of Carolina under the governance of Sir Robert Heath. This sparked the development of the Carolina colonies which resulted in several explorations down the Great Trading Path which ran from Augusta through Charlotte and towards Petersburg, Virginia. 

In 1700, John Lawson, Surveyor-General of the Colony of North Carolina made first contact with the Waxhaw Indians, and the native land of Marvin. He noted that &quot;the land was being so fertile that no labor of man in one or two ages could make it poor.&quot; Lawsons thoughts about the land were confirmed 300 years later with numerous farms scattered around the Marvin area, giving its semi-rural suburban atmosphere. In 1741, an epidemic of smallpox was introduced into the community, and many of the Indians were killed or were forced to abandon the area. Settlers began to exploit the fertile land to grow craps such as soy and tobacco.

German, English, Welch, and Scottish families, some of whom were escaping turmoil in Europe such as the 7 years war and the Jacobite rising of 1745.

Until 1842, Marvin was an unincorporated section of Anson county, until the schism between Mecklenburg - Anson counties, which resulted in the creation of Union county, and thus the incorporation of Marvin. Most settlers of Marvin owned slaves and would pass inheritance to their children. It would not be until the end of the Civil War that slavery was ended in Marvin. Most local slaves were purchased in Charleston, SC. Old Steel Creek road was used as a transport of slaved cotton, which was destroyed by General Cornwallis during the American Revolutionary war, and currently is the site of Highway 521.

Although sources are scarce, it is believed that Henry Downs was one of the original signatories of the &quot;Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence&quot;, which was destroyed in a fire in 1800, and published just one month after the events at Lexington and Concord.

In 1777, North Carolina began issuing land grants to those who served in the American revolution. Around 640 acres of land were distributed through this land grant system. It is believed that the Crane road was where Francis Carter, one of the first settlers of the Marvin area, lived and managed the distribution of crown grants. A few of the oldest families in the Carolinas held kings’ grants from those distributed by Francis Carter, but most had come down the Great Trading Path from the North, such as the Polk family, and President James K. Polk, along with the Jackson family, and President Andrew Jackson, born near Marvin.

Maggie Ross, one of the richest women in Union County had a scandal regarding the distribution between her will and her family members. After her sister, Sallie Ross, died in 1909, her estate was bequeathed to Bob Ross, who were African American. This sparked one of the largest civil rights feuds in the county due to racial prejudice in the local Union county municipal courts. Later, this racial tension would culminate in the Kissing Case, taking place in Monroe.

Marvin was founded on July 1, 1994. According to Ruth B. Ezzell, the major Marvin principles for foundation were &quot;the hardships, the sacrifices made by our forefathers, their determination to lay principles as foundations for future generations, how they fought in wars for freedom and liberty, we may be inspired to a greater loyalty and appreciation of our community&quot;.

Marvin has experienced numerous demographic changes, such as an increase of Asian-Americans who have migrated to the town during the early 2000&#x27;s. Marvin is geographically located near Charlotte, and is incorporated as an official suburb of Charlotte, and the major shift in population can be attributed towards the large banking Industry of Charlotte, NC, which has grown due to the introduction of Bank of America which was finalized around 1992.

<doc id="128284" wikidata="Q81092" url="?curid=128284" title="All Souls College, Oxford">
<text>All Souls College (official name: The College of All Souls of the Faithful Departed, of Oxford) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Unique to All Souls, all of its members automatically become fellows (i.e., full members of the college&#x27;s governing body). It has no student members, but each year, recent graduates at Oxford are eligible to apply for a small number of examination fellowships through a competitive examination (once described as &quot;the hardest exam in the world&quot;) and, for those shortlisted after the examinations, an interview. 

The college entrance is on the north side of High Street, whilst it has a long frontage onto Radcliffe Square. To its east is The Queen&#x27;s College, whilst Hertford College is to the north of All Souls.

The current warden (head of the college) is Sir John Vickers, a graduate of Oriel College, Oxford.

==History==
The college was founded by Henry VI of England and Henry Chichele (fellow of New College and Archbishop of Canterbury), in 1438, to commemorate the victims of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The Statutes provided for a warden and 40 fellows; all to take Holy Orders: 24 to study arts and theology; and 16 to study civil or canon law. 

Today the college is primarily a research institution, with no student members. All Souls did formerly have students: Robert Hovenden (Warden of the college from 1571 to 1614) introduced undergraduates to provide the fellows with &quot;servientes&quot; (household servants), but this was abandoned by the end of the Commonwealth. Four Bible Clerks remained on the foundation until 1924.

For over five hundred years All Souls College admitted only men; women were first allowed to join the college as fellows in 1979, the same year as many other previously all-male colleges in the university. The American philosopher Susan Hurley became the first female fellow in 1981. Conservative fellows opposed this change. Once, upon encountering a woman fellow, the geneticist E. B. Ford swung his umbrella at her and shouted &quot;Out of my way, henbird!&quot;.

===All Souls College Library===
The All Souls College Library (formerly known as the Codrington Library) was founded through a 1710 bequest from Christopher Codrington (1668–1710), a fellow of the college and a wealthy slave and sugar plantation owner. Codrington was an undergraduate at Oxford and later became colonial governor of the Leeward Islands. Christopher Codrington was born in Barbados, and amassed a fortune from his sugar plantation in the West Indies. 

Under the terms of his will Codrington bequeathed books worth £6,000 to the college in addition to £10,000 in currency for the library to be rebuilt and endowed. The new library was completed in 1751 to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor and has been in continuous use since then. Today the library comprises some 185,000 items, about a third of which were published before 1800. The collections are particularly strong in law and history (especially military history).

Sir Christopher Wren was a fellow from 1653. The design of the sundial, produced in 1658 for the south wall of the Chapel, is attributed to Wren. The sundial was moved to the quadrangle (above the central entrance to the Library) in 1877.

In 2020, the College decided to cease referring to the Library as &#x27;The Codrington Library&#x27; as part of a set of &quot;steps to address the problematic nature of the Codrington legacy&quot;, which comes from wealth derived from slave plantations.

===Chapel===
Built between 1438 and 1442, the college chapel remained largely unchanged until the Commonwealth. Oxford, having been a largely Royalist stronghold, suffered under the Puritans&#x27; wrath. The 42 misericords date from the Chapel&#x27;s building, and show a resemblance to the misericords at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Higham Ferrers. Both may have been carved by Richard Tyllock. During the 1660s a screen was installed in the Chapel, which was based on a design by Wren. However, this screen needed to be rebuilt by 1713. By the mid-19th century the Chapel was in great need of renovation, and so the current structure is heavily influenced by Victorian design ideals. There have been a number of rearrangements and repairs of the stained glass windows, but much of the original medieval glass survives.

All services at the chapel are according to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;; the &quot;King James Bible&quot; is also used rather than more modern translations.

==Wealth==

All Souls is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford with a financial endowment of £486.7 million (2023). Approximately 95% of its annual income is derived from its endowment as the College does not receive any income from tuition fees.

==Fellowships==
===Examination fellowships===
In the three years following the award of their bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees, students graduating from Oxford and current Oxford postgraduate students having graduated elsewhere are eligible to apply for examination fellowships (sometimes informally referred to as &quot;prize fellowships&quot;) of seven years each. While tutors may advise their students to sit for the All Souls examination fellowship, the examination is open to anybody who fulfils the eligibility criteria and the college does not issue invitations to candidates to sit. Every year in early March, the college hosts an open evening for women, offering women interested in the examination fellowship an opportunity to find out more about the exam process and to meet members of the college.

Each year several dozen candidates typically sit the examination. Two examination fellows are usually elected each year, although the college has awarded a single place or three places in some years, and on rare occasions made no award.

The competition, offered since 1878 and open to women since 1979, is held over two days in late September, with two papers of three hours each per day. It has been described in the past as &quot;the hardest exam in the world&quot;.

Two papers (the &#x27;specialist papers&#x27;) are on a single subject of the candidate&#x27;s choice; the options are classics, English literature, economics, history, law, philosophy, and politics. Candidates may sit their two specialist papers in different specialist subjects, provided each paper is in one subject only (for example, a candidate might sit one paper in History and one paper in Politics). Candidates who choose Classics have an additional translation examination on a third day.

Two papers (the &#x27;general papers&#x27;) are on general subjects. For each general examination, candidates choose three questions from a list. Past questions have included:
* If a man could say nothing against a character but what he could prove, history could not be written&#x27; (Samuel Johnson). Discuss.&quot;
* &quot;Should the Orange Prize for Fiction be open to both men and women?&quot;
* &quot;Does the moral character of an orgy change when the participants wear Nazi uniforms?&quot;

Before 2010 candidates also faced another examination, a free-form &quot;Essay&quot; on a single, pre-selected word.

Four to six finalists are invited to a viva voce or oral examination. Previously, these candidates were then invited to dinner with about 75 members of the college. The dinner did not form part of the assessment, but was intended as a reward for those candidates who had reached the latter stages of the selection process. However, the dinner has been discontinued as the college felt candidates worried too often that it was part of the assessment process. 

About a dozen examination fellows are at the college at any one time. There are no compulsory teaching or requirements, although examination fellows must pursue a course of study or research at some point within their first two years of fellowship. They can study anything for free at Oxford with room and board. As &quot;Londoners&quot; they can pursue approved non-academic careers if desired, with a reduced stipend, as long as they pursue academia on a part-time basis and attend weekend dinners at the college during their first academic year. each examination fellow receives a stipend of £14,842 annually for the first two years; the stipend then varies depending on whether the fellow pursues an academic career.

====Notable candidates====
Until 1979, women were not permitted to put themselves forward for fellowships at All Souls.

* Official fellows (consisting of holders of college posts, such as the Domestic Bursar, Estates Bursar, Chaplain, and Fellow Librarian) 
* Distinguished fellows

There are also a number of professorial fellows who hold their fellowships by virtue of their University post.

===Chichele professorships===
Fellows of the college include the Chichele professors, who hold statutory professorships at the University of Oxford named in honour of Henry Chichele, a founder of the college. Fellowship of the college has accompanied the award of a Chichele chair since 1870.

Following the work of the 1850 Commission to examine the organisation of the university, the college suppressed ten of its fellowships to create the funds to establish the first two Chichele professorships: The Chichele Professor of International Law and Diplomacy, established in 1859 and first held by Mountague Bernard, and the Chichele Professor of Modern History, first held by Montagu Burrows.

There are currently Chichele Professorships in five different subjects:
* Chichele Professor of Economic History: Kevin O&#x27;Rourke;
* Chichele Professor of the History of War: Peter H. Wilson appointed 2015;
* Chichele Professor of Public International Law: Catherine Redgwell appointed 2012;
* Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory: Amia Srinivasan appointed 2019; and
* Chichele Professor of Medieval History: Julia M. H. Smith, appointed September 2016.

Probably the best known former Chichele Professor is Sir Isaiah Berlin. Perhaps the best known former Professor of the History of War was Cyril Falls.

===Chichele Lectures===
The Chichele Lectures are a prestigious series of lectures formally established in 1912 and sponsored by All Souls College. The lectures were initially restricted to foreign history, but have since been expanded to include law, political theory, economic theory, as well as foreign and British history. Traditionally the lectures were delivered by a single speaker, but it is now common for several speakers to deliver lectures on a common theme.

==Customs==
Every hundred years, and generally on 14 January, there is a commemorative feast after which the fellows parade around the college with flaming torches, singing the &quot;Mallard Song&quot; and led by a &quot;Lord Mallard&quot; who is carried in a chair, in search of a legendary mallard that supposedly flew out of the foundations of the college when it was being built. During the hunt the Lord Mallard is preceded by a man bearing a pole to which a mallard is tied – originally a live bird, latterly either dead (1901) or carved from wood (2001). The last mallard ceremony was in 2001 and the next is due in 2101. The precise origin of the custom is not known, but it dates from at least 1632. A benign parody of this custom has been portrayed as the Unseen University&#x27;s &quot;Megapode chase&quot; in Sir Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;.

==Queens Cup Steeplechase Races==
Brooklandwood is a large 260+ acre farm and estate within the Town of Mineral Springs and an adjoining 44+ acres outside of the town for a total of 305 acres. Brooklandwood is the site of the Queens Cup Steeplechase, one of steeplechase horse racing&#x27;s major annual events. The day consists of 5-6 jump races, and is held the last Saturday of every April. The schedule of events also features a Jack Russell Terrier judging contest. 12,000-18,000 people descend on Mineral Springs from all parts of the country but primarily within the seven county region of Charlotte, to take part in this day-long event of races and other activities.

On December 8, 2023 a press release was issued that read, – Earlier this year, Founders of the Queen’s Cup Steeplechase Races, produced by the non-profit Charlotte Steeplechase Foundation, announced plans to retire from their active roles both on the board of directors this past June as well as day-to-day operations of the Queen’s Cup immediately after the 2024 Race.
After the announcement, the Queen’s Cup Team consisting of the Charlotte Steeplechase Foundation (CSF) board and members of the non-profit Dream on 3 team came together with the shared goal of preserving this historic event and the Price Family’s legacy as founders of the Queens Cup.
After months of evaluation and planning, the very difficult decision was made by the Team and unanimously approved by the CSF Board, to cancel the 2024 race. Many factors were considered, however ultimately the complex logistical challenges associated with producing the event coupled with continued cost increases became the primary reasons for the decision. Though the 2024 race was cancelled, the CSF Board will continue to evaluate the viability and future of the event.
After coming to this conclusion, co-founder Carrington Price said, “We are indebted to the Queen’s Cup team, volunteers and all those who have worked tirelessly over the nearly three decades to help produce the Queen’s Cup and it is with heavy heart [that] the announcement is being made. We are most appreciative of the loyal support from our sponsors, PSL holders, patrons, vendors and board”. Price went on to say, “It has been a true honor to host Charlotte’s largest philanthropic outdoor cocktail party where the horses were invited, and in doing so, the Charlotte Steeplechase Foundation has been able to gift over one million dollars to local charities.”

<text>Monroe is a city in and the county seat of Union County, North Carolina, United States. The population increased from 32,797 in 2010 to 34,551 in 2020. It is within the rapidly growing Charlotte metropolitan area. Monroe has a council-manager form of government.

==History==
===Early history===

Monroe was founded as a planned settlement. In 1843, the first Board of County Commissioners, appointed by the General Assembly, selected an area in the center of the county as the county seat, and Monroe was incorporated that year. It was named for James Monroe, the country&#x27;s fifth president. It became a trading center for the agricultural areas of the Piedmont region, which cultivated tobacco.

===Civil rights struggle===
Racial segregation established by a white-dominated state legislature after the end of the Reconstruction era persisted for nearly a century into the 1960s. Following World War II, many local blacks and veterans, including Marine veteran Robert F. Williams, began to push to regain their constitutional rights after having served the United States military during the war. Williams and the burgeoning NAACP chapter would be met with fierce resistance during their push to integrate local public facilities. During a 1957 effort to integrate a local swimming pool, the city had an estimated population of 12,000; the press reported an estimated 7,500 members of the Ku Klux Klan gathering in the city, many of whom arrived from across the South Carolina border just 14 miles away.

Williams was elected as president of the local chapter of the NAACP in 1951. He began to work to integrate public facilities, starting with the library and the city&#x27;s swimming pool, which both excluded blacks. He noted that not only did blacks pay taxes as citizens that supported operations of such facilities, but they had been built with federal funds during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

In 1958 Williams hired Conrad Lynn, a civil rights attorney from New York City, to aid in defending two African-American boys, aged nine and seven. They had been convicted of &quot;molestation&quot; and sentenced to a reformatory until age 21 for kissing a white girl their age on the cheek. This became known as the Kissing Case. The former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, talked to the North Carolina governor to urge restraint, and the case became internationally embarrassing for the United States. After three months, the governor pardoned the boys.

During the civil rights movement years of the 1960s, there was rising in Ku Klux Klan white violence against the minority black community of Monroe. Williams began to advocate black armed self-defense. Groups known as the Deacons for Defense, were founded by other civil rights leaders in Louisiana and Mississippi.

The NAACP and the black community in Monroe provided a base for some of the Freedom Riders in 1961, who were trying to integrate interstate bus travel through southern states. They had illegally imposed segregation in such buses in the South, although interstate travel was protected under the federal constitution&#x27;s provisions regulating interstate commerce. Mobs attacked pickets marching for the Freedom Riders at the county courthouse. That year, Williams was accused of kidnapping an elderly white couple, when he sheltered them in his house during an explosive situation of high racial tensions.

Williams and his wife fled the United States to avoid prosecution for kidnapping. They went into exile for years in Cuba and in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1969 they finally returned to the United States, after Congress had passed important civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965. The trial of Williams was scheduled in 1975, but North Carolina finally reviewed its case and dropped the charges against him.

The Jesse Helms family was prominent among the white community during these years. Jesse Helms Sr. served as Police and Fire Chief of Monroe for many years. Jesse Helms, Jr. was born and grew up in the town, where whites were Democrats in his youth. He became a politician and was elected to five terms (1973–2003) as a U.S. Senator from North Carolina, switching to the Republican Party as it attracted conservative whites. He mustered support in the South, and played a key role in helping Ronald Reagan to be elected as President of the United States. Through that period, he was also a prominent (and often controversial) national leader of the Religious Right wing of the Republican Party. The Jesse Helms Center is in neighboring Wingate, North Carolina.

===Late 20th century to present===
Monroe was home to the Starlite Speedway in the 1960s to 1970s. On May 13, 1966, the 1/2-mile dirt track hosted NASCAR&#x27;s &#x27;Independent 250&#x27;. Darel Dieringer won the race.

Since 1984, Ludwig Drums and timpani have been manufactured in Monroe.

As part of the developing Charlotte metropolitan area, in the 21st century, Monroe has attracted new Hispanic residents. North Carolina has encouraged immigration to increase its labor pool.

==History==

Stallings was incorporated as a town in 1975, but its history dates back to the early 1900s when Matthew Thomas Stallings, a prominent farmer and merchant who lived near Harrisburg, moved to Union County and bought 200 acres of land on the Mecklenburg County line - northwest of Indian Trail. The late Mr. Jim Smith once described the land as “all in timber, the finest timber you&#x27;ve ever seen”. Mr. Stallings built a home and opened a country store near the Seaboard Railway track. Newspaper articles from that time note that Mr. Stallings &quot;began to improve his holdings with a view to building up an important settlement and encouraging enterprise and industry in his vicinity.&quot;

Mark Conder opened a sawmill, giving Stallings its first industry. Approximately a year later, M. T. Stallings&#x27; brother, Martin Stallings, also moved from Cabarrus County, bought another tract of land for farming; thus, the community became known as &quot;Stallings&quot;. Martin Stallings was the father of Carl &quot;Tip&quot; Stallings, who became the first mayor of the town after its incorporation. Many people were employed with the saw mill, the store and engaged in farming. The lumber was shipped by rail on to Charlotte and other destinations. An undated article by L. W. Harkey states: “&quot;Every year after crops were laid by, Mr. Stallings would have a regular picnic long about August. And have foot races, sack races, egg races, and all kinds of games. Lemonade and cold drinks were set out under the big oak tree back of the store.”&quot;

A 1912 newspaper article stated: &quot;there was a good school in operation with about 75 pupils enrolled and some twenty families settled on the original purchase. The Seaboard Air Line has a regular station there, named Stallings, and all prospects bid fair to make this locality of much future importance. Mr. Stallings will be glad to offer special inducements to manufacturers or others desiring sites for plants or permanent homes.&quot; A few years later, a new store was built across the road, and the old store building was used for a Methodist church and a schoolhouse. The one-room schoolhouse was located where a large industry, AEP, is now located. Stallings Methodist Church was started &quot;circa&quot; 1911, largely through the efforts of P. D. and Margaret Drye, with the first pastor being Rev. L. W. Self. A new Methodist Church was built in 1912, and the old building was torn down. In 1919, the church was struck by lightning and burned. A bucket brigade was formed, but the building could not be saved. The church was immediately rebuilt and that building remains today. The store business changed ownership at least four times over the next fifty years. It burned to the ground once and was rebuilt. It was always known as the Country Store, furnishing the community with groceries, feed, and notions during the day, and serving as a gathering place in the evenings. Mr. Jim Smith owned and operated the store from 1916 until 1948. &quot;Mr. Jim&quot; was also one of the largest farmers in the area, and his farm still exists today as Smith Brothers Farm. The store was finally torn down and a strip of small businesses built in its place.

From the turn of the century until the Great Depression of the 1930s, Indian Trail and Stallings were trading centers for cotton farmers as far away as Wesley Chapel to the south and Stewart&#x27;s Mill to the north.&quot; A community resident, Bob Noles, once wrote about Mr. Jim Smith&#x27;s store, stating it was &quot;nothing to have 50 bales of cotton on the store yard&quot;.

In 1910, the Seaboard Railway built a depot and furnished passenger service—as well as, freight service for several years. The depot gave the town&#x27;s residents and merchants easy access to suppliers. With the Depression, however, the trains stopped running and the depots in Stallings and Indian Trail were both closed. The depot in Stallings had closed earlier because the train could not get up steam fast enough to climb the grade into Matthews, if it stopped in Stallings.

&quot;Mr. Jim&quot; was quoted in a 1975 article saying, &quot;Years ago there wasn&#x27;t nothing to get money out of but cotton and watermelons.&quot; The giant Bradford watermelons grew well in the sandy soil and were sold in Charlotte by the truckloads or shipped to New York by rail. When the Depression came, blight killed the watermelons, boll weevils feasted on the cotton, and the Depression made peasants of everyone.

After the Depression, a new four-lane highway, U.S. 74, was built and passed through Stallings from Monroe to Charlotte. Growth and population grew quickly in the 1960s and early-1970s. The town was incorporated on June 24, 1975.

Stallings, then classified as a small town, had a population of 2,152 and more than 200 businesses. A new shopping center was built featuring a Winn-Dixie Supermarket and Kerr Drug, along with several other businesses. It appeared that Mr. M. T. Stallings&#x27; 1912 prediction that &quot;all prospects bid fair to make this locality of much future importance&quot; was accurate.

The Town of Stallings continued to grow—by 2003, there were over 8,500 residents and 400 businesses. A large annexation along Stevens Mill Road and Lawyers Road in 2001, doubled the population and size of the town almost overnight. Additional annexations included parcels of land in adjoining Mecklenburg County, making Stallings the first &quot;Union County&quot; town to lie in two counties. The 2001 annexation included land along the Goose Creek. Goose Creek begins along the northeastern boundary of current Mecklenburg County, and flows southeasterly to the Rocky River. Near the headwaters of this creek is an area of town referred to as the &quot;Stevens Mill area.&quot; It is located along Stevens Mill Road between Idlewild Road and Lawyers Road.

=== Stevens Mill ===

The history of the Stevens Mill area goes back to the establishment of a gristmill in the late 1700s. The mill was built and known as Blair&#x27;s Mill for many years before it became Stevens Mill. The site of the mill also contained a handsome old ante-bellum home of the Stevens family. The home was destroyed by fire in December 1894.

A history compiled by Houston V. Blair of Monroe, North Carolina states: “&quot;The &quot;mill site&quot; is known to have existed as early as December 1789 and was built as a grist mill by William Blair on approximately 1400 acres. When William Blair died Samuel Blair operated the mill along with his son James G. Blair until his death in 1836. The last mill at this site was constructed in 1826 on a massive stone foundation along Goose Creek, remnants of which still exist. Craftsmen who had just completed Philadelphia Presbyterian Church in Mint Hill, built Blair&#x27;s&#x27; Mill, as it was called then, as a four-story wooden structure. The water wheel that gave power to the mill was said to be some thirty feet in diameter. On February 3, 1849 James G. Blair sold Blair&#x27;s Mill and 610 acres of land on the waters of Goose Creek to Amos Stevens. Thus, beginning in 1849 and in future generations Blair&#x27;s Mill became known as Stevens Mill. The Stevens family operated the mill for almost 100 years thereafter.”&quot;

Rev. S. Hood wrote an article appearing in the Charlotte News in the early 1900s. It quoted Dr. Sam Stevens describing the four- story wooden structure as one of immense hewed logs mortised and keyed with pins and built in 1826. The mill contained equipment for both flour and meal and was kept in good condition. Rev. Hood continued in his article to describe the mill in its earlier days, “&quot;even in colonial days the scene, near the old stage coach line, must have been a community gathering place, or mustering ground for the local militia and perhaps was the scene of a large country store and water mill long before the present old building was erected&quot;.”

Newton Pyron, a local resident, recounts how he “&quot;attended the exhibition of John Robinson&#x27;s shows on the yard of this old mill soon after the Civil War and got a free ticket 50 years later when the show came back to Charlotte&quot;.” The John Robinson&#x27;s shows were later acquired by, and are now known as, the Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

The water-ground products from the mill were known far and wide in both Union and Mecklenburg counties. Rev. Hood stated that it “&quot;was preferred and demanded by discriminating housewives in Charlotte and Monroe. For many generations farmers from miles around found their way to the Steven&#x27;s water mill with their corn and wheat on men&#x27;s backs, on mules, on ox carts, sleds, and later by motor vehicle.&quot;”

Although the small piece of land that contains the ruins of the mill is now part of a neighboring town, most of the land that was once part of the mill property is now in the town of Stallings. Stevens Creek, which fed the mill, still runs through the Divide Golf Course and across Interstate 485 into Mecklenburg County. A major street, a neighborhood, and a shopping center have also been named for the mill that once contributed greatly to the area.

Stallings has grown from a small town with only one employee to a town of 16,112 residents and the third largest municipality in Union County. For many years, the town continued the tradition of Mr. Stallings&#x27; picnic &quot;long about August&quot; by hosting a family event in the park event on the first weekend of August, but more recently, the event has moved to September. Other events to bring the community together include an Easter egg hunt, Earth Day celebrations, a music festival, and a Christmas tree lighting.

== History ==

The town of Unionville was originally chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1911. Town officials met in the Union Institute building until the building was destroyed by fire. Local leaders, working with the general assembly succeeded in reactivating the town&#x27;s charter in 1998.

Union County was formed in 1842 from parts of Anson County and Mecklenburg County. The town of Unionville was created in the Goose Creek community on the former Mecklenburg / Anson county line which ran north to south along what is now Unionville Road.

=== Union Institute ===
Founded in 1886 by Professor Oliver C. Hamilton, the Union Institute was organized to serve the educational needs of the community. In 1885, local residents provided materials and labor for the construction of the school which served students of all ages from Union County as well as upstate South Carolina. Professor Hamilton left the school in 1898, but returned to the institute serving as head instructor in 1904. Originally constructed as a private school, the Union Institute was turned over to the county board of education in 1910. The two story structure was constructed next to the site of the current Unionville Community Center. In January 1917, a fire destroyed the building in its entirety. Students escaping from the building saved the school bell from the second story porch. The original Union Institute bell has served each successive Unionville School since; and today is displayed from the main entrance to Unionville Elementary School.

=== Town Hall ===
Unionville Town Hall is located at the intersection of Unionville Road and Unionville-Indian Trail Rd. Town Hall was originally constructed as the fellowship for the Unionville Presbyterian Church which was constructed in 1915. The sanctuary of the Unionville Presbyterian Church was destroyed by fire in July,1994. After meeting for the next five years in the former fellowship hall, the congregation of Unionville Presbyterian Church dedicated the building and grounds to the town of Unionville for municipal use. The first town meeting held in the current town hall occurred on February 17, 2000.

== Government ==
The Town of Unionville operates under the Mayor-Council form of government as provided by part 3 of Article 7 of Chapter 160A of North Carolina general statutes. Established in 1911, the original town charter provided for a Mayor, five Commissioners as well as a secretary, treasurer, and town Constable. In 1911, the town&#x27;s first Mayor was J.B. Little. Commissioners were C.D. Benton, T.L.A. Helms, J.T. Price, A.A. Secrest and Dr. A.D.N. Whitley.

After a fire destroyed many town records in 1917, town officials ceased meeting; resulting in a loss of the town&#x27;s charter.

In 1998, a majority of voters cast votes to revive the charter of the town.

Currently, the Mayor and Commissioners are elected to serve four year terms.

== Public Safety ==
Law enforcement in the town of Unionville is provided by the Union County Sheriff&#x27;s Office as well as the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.

<text>Waxhaw is an incorporated town in Union County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 20,534 according to the 2020 Census. The population grew 108.28% from 2010. The name is derived from the indigenous people who lived in the area, who were known as the Waxhaw people.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . Waxhaw&#x27;s northernmost municipal boundary is located four and one-half miles south of the Charlotte southernmost city limit. Waxhaw is part of Union County.
Waxhaw is located in the historic region called The Waxhaws and both the region and the town are named after the indigenous Native American tribe who lived there prior to colonial settlement. Europeans sometimes referred to their settlements in the area as, The Waxhaw Settlement.

The town of Waxhaw is in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, which is a wooded area with rolling hills. This region is where gold was first discovered in the United States. The Howie Gold Mine is not far from the city limits. By 1935, 50,000 ounces of gold had been mined from this location. The Howie Gold mine operated until World War II, when most mines were shut down due to workforce changes during the war effort.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the region were a Native American people group known alternately as either the Wysacky or the Waxhaws. The first European to record contacting the group was the Spanish conquistador Juan Pardo. In 1711, the Waxhaw aided the British colonists of North Carolina in their war against the Tuscarora, a decision that antagonized the Tuscaroras Iroquoian allies in New York, who subsequently began raiding the Waxhaw tribe. These raids continued until 1715, when the Waxhaw joined the Yamasee war effort against the British colony of South Carolina. The tribes involvement in the Yamasee War led to their destruction at the hands of South Carolina&#x27;s Catawba allies and the freeing of their land for European settlement.

The area was first settled by colonists in the mid-eighteenth century. Most settlers were of German and Scots-Irish origin. Settlers became subsistence farmers and were known for being independent. Andrew Jackson, who later would become the seventh President of the United States, was born nearby in 1767, prior to the American Revolution. There is some disagreement as to which of the Carolinas was his birthplace because of the proximity of the border between the two. However, there are historical marker signs around Waxhaw, North Carolina describing Andrew Jackson&#x27;s early connection to the area. His relationship to the area also is documented at the Museum of the Waxhaws. Andrew Jackson State Park is minutes from downtown Waxhaw, which has a memorial and other information about Andrew Jackson
The arrival of the railroad in 1888 created access to the markets of Atlanta and helped the town reach prosperity. The railroad tracks were laid through the center of town to show the importance of the railroad system to the community. The railroad remains in the center of town and now, is bordered by a broad landscaped area that divides the rows of stores on either side.

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the community began to develop cotton mill factories for manufacturing textiles. The railroad helped increase access for the products of this industry. Cotton manufacturing was important to the region through the 1940s. Postwar changes in the economy, with shifts of the textile industry to jobs in other areas of the country and out of the country, required the community to adapt to new conditions.

== Waxhaw Today ==
Waxhaw has evolved into an antique and fine dining center. Its Small Town Main Street committee is working on an integrated approach to developing and marketing the historic center of town. Waxhaw currently has dozens of specialty shops and dining restaurants. Restaurants located in town range from Mom-and-Pop restaurants to fine dining bistros.

The Waxhaw Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It includes retail businesses as well as architecturally significant houses near the center of town. Also listed is the Pleasant Grove Camp Meeting Ground.

Residents and town officials are working on additional improvement plans. In the downtown area, there is a town park and a skate park for youths. Near the skate park is a playground and a walking area connected to downtown. New housing has been built along NC 75 to the east and west of town, as well as NC 16 (Providence Road) to the north.

Near Waxhaw is Cane Creek Park, a park, featuring scenic areas and recreation activities. The facility, on Harkey Road south of Waxhaw, was a cooperative venture between Union County, the Union Conservation District, and the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Currently, Waxhaw is undergoing significant suburban development and has grown by 6.4% in 2019 alone. New developments include individual residential housing, apartments, townhouses, and commercial complexes.

Waxhaw&#x27;s downtown area is built to surround the train tracks that brought prosperity to the town. The tracks are abutted with green areas and parking. Guests can walk over a historic bridge to go over the train tracks, and there is a viewing area. Also a few minutes walk away, are a skateboard park and a playground. Although the train doesn&#x27;t follow a public schedule, viewers try to guess the times when the train will come for viewing. Sometimes a train employee will stand on the bridge.

== Government ==
Waxhaw has a town government that was incorporated in 1889. The government is council-manager in form and it is governed by a board of commissioners that consists of six members. All members are elected to four-year terms in non-partisan elections that take place in odd-numbered years. Three commission seats are up in one cycle, then two years later the other two commission seats come up for election at the same time as that of the mayor. The town is not divided into election districts and the top vote recipients win the seats of each election. Robert Murray is the current mayor of Waxhaw.

The village of Wesley Chapel&#x27;s existence can be traced back to the establishment of Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church, one of many United Methodist churches to be named after Methodism founder John Wesley&#x27;s chapel in London. The Wesley Chapel church was founded in 1832 on the remains of an abandoned campground outside nearby Mineral Springs known as McWhorter Campground. The community became first recognized in the early 20th century as residents of Monroe and Vance Township in the early 20th century declared themselves as part of the Wesley Chapel vicinity of Sandy Ridge Township, taking the name from the Methodist church.

The village was originally known as Price&#x27;s Mill, named after the family of Joseph Price and his son James Newton Price. The Price family began as farmers but acquired a significant portion of the land of Wesley Chapel and contributed to much of the village&#x27;s early development.

<text>Kittrell is a town in Vance County, North Carolina, United States.

==History==
Kittrell was chartered in 1885, with its first mayor David Outlaw, a merchant and bachelor. In 1860, one census district in Granville County the primary of the three parent counties (73% of the land area of Vance County was taken from Granville County) of Vance County, was called Kittrell&#x27;s Depot. Kittrell&#x27;s Depot was a railroad depot named for George Kittrell and his wife, Elizabeth Boswell Kittrell, who donated the land for a Raleigh and Gaston Railroad station. The first post office for the Kittrell area, with Elisha Overton as its first postmaster, was established in 1854, replacing one in neighboring Stanton in the Epping Forest area which lacked direct railroad access, this establishment occurring shortly after Kittrell&#x27;s Depot became operational. An 1868 state law required county governments to divide counties into smaller units of townships. Kittrell Township, including the depot station that is the likely basis for the choice of name, was one of Granville County&#x27;s creations. 

George Kittrell was a grandson of Captain Jonathan Kittrell, commander of a company of Granville County colonial militia during the 1760s and early 1770s, and was a large landholder in Granville County. His holdings included the land upon which the Kittrell Springs Hotel was located. His grandfather Captain Kittrell was also one of the justices (or magistrates) for this county, and was an early Granville pioneer, who immigrated as a young adult to that area, attracted by its cheap, abundant and readily available land, along with two younger brothers Samuel and Isaac, from northeastern North Carolina. Their elder brothers George and John remained in their home area on farms in what is now known as Bertie and Gates County.

Kittrell was the location of Kittrell College, the campus of which later became the Kittrell Job Corps Center.

Ashburn Hall, Thomas Capehart House, Josiah Crudup House, and St. James Episcopal Church and Rectory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Kittrell was also home to two famous luxury health hotels during North Carolina&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;Golden Age&quot; of spas, healing springs, and health resorts&#x27;, the Davis Hotel and Kittrell Springs Hotel.

Balliol College was founded in about 1263 by John I de Balliol under the guidance of Walter of Kirkham, the Bishop of Durham. According to legend, the founder had abducted the bishop as part of a land dispute and as a penance he was publicly beaten by the bishop and had to support a group of scholars at Oxford. After de Balliol&#x27;s death in 1268, his widow, Dervorguilla of Galloway (their son and grandson each became Kings of Scotland), made arrangements to ensure the permanence of the college in that she provided capital and in 1282 formulated the college statutes, documents that survive to the present.

Balliol lays claim to being the oldest Oxford college, though this is disputed by both University College and Merton. Balliol&#x27;s claim is that a house of scholars was established by the founder in Oxford in around 1263, in contrast to Merton, which was the first college to be granted an official statute in 1274, and University College, which, while provisionally founded by will in 1249, was only officially established around 1280. However, Balliol also acknowledges that the other two have legitimate claims on their respective bases, depending on what criteria are used to define the oldest.

===Academics and fellows===
As with all colleges, Balliol has a more or less permanent teaching staff, known as fellows. The college statutes provide for various categories of fellows and these include both tutorial fellows and professorial fellows. Professorial fellows are those professors and readers of the university who are allocated to the college by the university. One of these professorships is the Beit Professor of Commonwealth History, which is currently held by James Belich. The Professorship of Internet Studies is currently held by political scientist Philip N. Howard. Other professorships include the Boden Professor of Sanskrit and the Montague Burton Professor of International Relations. Official fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. There are also senior and junior research fellows. The college can also elect &quot;distinguished persons&quot; to honorary fellowships.

The fellows are supplemented by academics on short-term contracts. In addition, there are visiting international academics who come to Oxford for periods of up to a year, an example of this is the George Eastman Visiting Professorial Fellowship.

===Masters===
Balliol College is run by the master and fellows of the college. The master of the college must be &quot;the person who is, in their [the Fellows] judgement, most fit for the government of the College as a place of religion, learning, and education&quot;. The current master is Dame Helen Ghosh, former Director-General of the National Trust and Home Office Permanent Secretary, and an alumna of St Hugh&#x27;s and Hertford colleges.

Although the rules in no way suggest there is a preference for an alumnus or fellow of the college to be chosen, there have been few who were not. Only one in the twentieth century had no previous connection. A former student of the college, Baruch Blumberg, was the first American master and the first Nobel Laureate, receiving his prize in medicine for the identification of the hepatitis B virus. The former Master of Balliol, Sir Drummond Bone, was a post-graduate student there (Snell Exhibitioner from Glasgow University) and a scholar of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and held the post from October 2011 to April 2018, following his retirement as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool in 2008.

==Student life==
===Student profile===
Each year the college matriculates approximately 260 undergraduates and postgraduates combined according to the most recent data which is from the three-year period 2021-2023. The same source gives the socio-demographic profile of the students is as follows: male 54.5%; state educated 69.6%; white 73.4%. The proportion of male students decreased from 60.6% between the years of 2015 and 2017.

===Facilities===
The college provides its students with facilities including accommodation, the Hall (refectory), a library, two bars, and separate common rooms for the fellows, the graduates and undergraduates. The JCR provides many services from laundry facilities, one of the few entirely student-run bars left in Oxford (the Manager, Lord/Lady Lindsay, is elected each year by students in the JCR) to a student-run cafeteria known as Pantry. There is a garden quadrangle and a nearby sports ground (the Master&#x27;s Field) and boathouse. The sports ground is mainly used for cricket, tennis, hockey and football. Croquet may be played in the Master&#x27;s Field or, in the summer term, in the garden quadrangle.

The majority of undergraduates are housed within the main college or in the modern annexes (Jowett Walk buildings) around the sports ground. The graduates are housed mainly within Holywell Manor which has its own bar, gardens, common room, gym and computing facilities.
===Women at Balliol===
For over 700 years, Balliol College admitted men only. New College had in 1964 resolved to admit women, but had been prevented from doing so without the approval of the university, which argued that this would be detrimental to the existing women&#x27;s colleges. On 2 June 1971, a consilium at Balliol voted 26–2 to admit women, and at the next college meeting on 6 December 1971 it was resolved 30–8 to admit women &quot;as soon as the change in its Statutes permitting this was approved by the Privy Council&quot;. Permission was granted by the university on 8 March 1977. With the appointment of Carol Clark to a Tutorial Fellowship in Modern Languages in 1973, Balliol became the first ancient all-male college to appoint a female fellow.

Before the full admission of women as undergraduates, the college had decided to establish a co-educational graduate institution. The decision was made on 16 March 1964, and the senior tutor approached St Anne&#x27;s College shortly after this. The creation of the Balliol–St Anne&#x27;s Graduate Institution with St Anne&#x27;s in 1967 led to the coeducation of men and women on the Holywell Manor site. Following the arrival of women at Balliol and men at St Anne&#x27;s in 1979, the joint Graduate Institution was terminated in 1984 by the consent of both colleges. Holywell Manor is now solely a part of Balliol College.

In 1979, along with many other previously all-male colleges, Balliol accepted its first cohort of female students. One of the first woman undergraduates to live at Balliol was Elena Ceva-Valla, who arrived on 16 September 1979. Other female undergraduates who arrived that term were Cressida Dick, Katy Koralek and Penny Phillips. In 2010, the college unveiled a sundial in the Garden Quad commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the admission of women to the college, inscribed with the phrase &quot;About Time&quot;. The first portrait of a woman in hall since that of the co-founder, Dervorguilla of Galloway, was unveiled in 2012, depicting benefactor and Oxford Internet Institute founder Dame Stephanie Shirley. This portrait has since been joined by portraits of Carol Clark and the mathematician Dame Frances Kirwan.

In 2018, Dame Helen Ghosh succeeded Sir Drummond Bone to become the college&#x27;s first female master. In the same year, Dame Frances Kirwan became the twentieth Savilian Professor of Geometry and the first woman to hold that post.

In 2021, students sent an open letter to the college and protested regarding their welfare following an alleged incident of sexual assault on a female graduate student that was covered by Al Jazeera English.

==Buildings and grounds==
The college has been on its present site since its inception by Balliol&#x27;s scholars as their residence with a lease dating to 1263 to them being the traditional &quot;foundation&quot; date.

===Front quadrangle===
The oldest parts of the college are the north and west ranges of the front quadrangle, dated to 1431, respectively the medieval hall, west side, now the &quot;new library&quot; and the &quot;old library&quot; first floor north side. The ground floor is the Old Senior Common Room. Balliol&#x27;s second library pre-dates the publication of printed books in Europe. There is a possibility that the original Master&#x27;s Chamber, south west side, adorned with a fine oriel window, is earlier than these; it is now the Master&#x27;s Dining Room.

William Grey, Bishop of Ely, was a benefactor of the college in the 15th century. Grey devoted much care to the collection of manuscripts, and wherever he lived constantly employed scribes to make copies of books he could not otherwise obtain. Many of these he had adorned with costly miniatures and initial letters by the skill of an artist who worked for him at Florence. It was his desire to make his collection the nucleus of a library for Balliol College, to the building of which, as well as to that of the master&#x27;s lodgings and of the old buttery and hall, he contributed largely. The work was finished about 1477 by Robert Abdy, then master of the college, and enriched with some two hundred manuscripts, the bishop&#x27;s gift. Of these, many were destroyed in the reign of Edward VI and during the great rebellion, and by Wood&#x27;s time few of the miniatures in the remaining volumes had escaped mutilation. But by 1890, no less than 152 of Grey&#x27;s codices were still in the possession of the college, and form a large part of Roger Mynors&#x27;s 1963 catalogue of the college&#x27;s manuscripts. The bishop&#x27;s coat of arms (gules, a lion rampant, within a bordure engrailed argent) is displayed on two windows of the Old Library, and in the panels below the window of the Master&#x27;s dining room. The chapel is the third (perhaps fourth) on the site and was designed by William Butterfield in 1857.

Alfred Waterhouse designed the main Broad Street frontage of the college (1867–68), along with gateway and tower, known as the Brackenbury Buildings after philanthropist and donor Hannah Brackenbury, replacing earlier structures (Staircases I–VII). The first staircase next to the Chapel contains the Organ Scholar&#x27;s lodgings.

===New Inn Hall===
Under a statute of 1881, New Inn Hall, one of the remaining medieval halls, was merged into Balliol College in 1887. Balliol acquired New Inn Hall&#x27;s admissions and other records for 1831–1887 as well as the library of New Inn Hall, which largely contained 18th-century law books. The New Inn Hall site was later sold and is now part of St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford.

===Garden Quadrangle===
South-side is the front part of the Master&#x27;s Lodgings on Broad Street from the Waterhouse improvements of the 1860s of the front quad. The neighbour to this is the Fisher Building of 1759 (Stc X) The undistinguished looking Stc XI, south west side, is in fact the oldest structure in this quadrangle, 1720, originally intended as accommodation for scholars from Bristol, hence its name. Continuing the west-side Stc XII–XIV dates from 1826, by George Basevi, and marks the beginnings of the college&#x27;s academic renaissance being required for the increasing number of Commoners applying for places. Stc XV by Warren of 1912 filled in the last gap of the quadrangle; the ground floor and basement is the principal Junior Common Room. This unfortunately obscures the lines of the Salvin designed Stc XVI–XIX with Tower of 1853. As does the 1968 building by Beard Stc XX, replacing a Victorian structure. This completely hides a formal gateway similar to that at the Broad Street main entrance, this can be viewed outside from Little Magdalen Street, through the gap marked XIX one finds the small function room &quot;Massey Room&quot;. At north side, of Stc XX is the &quot;Back Gate&quot; which is part of the 1906 Warren building, west and north side, Stc XXI. 1 St Giles&#x27; is its neighbour which is part of the college and houses the Oxford Internet Institute. Beard&#x27;s Stc XXII replaces Victorian rooms, which were provided from the Vivian Bulkeley-Johnson benefaction. Beard&#x27;s Stc XX and XXII are connected by the Snell Bridge accommodation at third-floor level, which was provided from Glasgow University&#x27;s Snell Benefaction.

The college&#x27;s dining hall was built in 1877, replacing an older hall in the front quadrangle, which had become too small for the college&#x27;s population. Designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the hall is built in geometric style, using Bath stone and Tisbury stone, with roof and woodwork made of oak. The hall features a Willis organ, again instituted by Benjamin Jowett. The old hall became part of the library.

The ground floor contains the college bar and shop, known as &quot;The Buttery&quot; (west side) and the Senior Common Room lunch room (east side). The 1966 new Senior Common Room range (Stc XXIII) (northern and eastern sides) was a benefaction of the Bernard Sunley Foundation and contains some smaller rooms and the principal SCR lounge, replacing Victorian facilities. Below this is a Lecture Room (&quot;LR XXIII&quot;).

The east side of the quad is a neighbouring wall with Trinity College, at the southern end is the Master&#x27;s Garden, in front of the chapel, and the Fellows&#x27; Garden in front of the &quot;Old&quot; (Senior) Common Room. The Tower forming the corner between the &quot;Old Hall&quot; and &quot;Old Library&quot; is also by Salvin, of 1853 and balances that at Stc XVI–XIX.

Underneath part of the Garden Quad and extending into Trinity were the Balliol-Trinity Laboratories, the most prominent Oxford physical and chemical laboratories in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which physical chemist Henry Moseley (originator of the atomic number) and Nobel Laureate Cyril Hinshelwood worked. These are now disused, following the construction of the university Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory on South Parks Road.

===Holywell Manor, Manor Road and Jowett Walk===
The majority of research and post-graduate students are housed in the Holywell Manor complex, a Grade II listed building acquired by Balliol in 1932 under the direction of Kenneth Norman Bell. It hosts a collection of artworks by alumni of the college, including a mural by Gilbert Spencer depicting the college&#x27;s founding, and hosts a biennial Holywell Manor Festival, Garden Party, and Garden Play. Balliol hosts more graduate students than any other ancient college, and the Manor forms the centre of this community, providing facilities such as the Middle Common Room (MCR) itself, an extensive garden, TV and computer rooms, music practice rooms, a &#x27;Cockpit&#x27; leisure room, and the graduate-student-run &#x27;Megaron&#x27; bar. The Manor from 1967 until the full admission of women at Balliol in 1979 was host to the Balliol-St Anne&#x27;s Graduate Institution, including students from St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. Former residents include Bill Clinton and Masako, Empress of Japan.

The 20th century saw several further additions to the college&#x27;s accommodation, the Martin Building of 1966 (&#x27;Holywell &quot;Minor&quot;, a reference to Holywell Manor, across the road) and the Dellal Building (1986) for graduates on Manor Road.

Many undergraduates and some graduates live in buildings on Jowett Walk a phased development 1996–2004 (Phase 1 completed September 1996, Phase 2 completed July 2004), containing a small theatre facility, the Michael Pilch Studio, five minutes&#x27; walking distance from the main college site; these two developments are on the outskirts of the Master&#x27;s Field, the sports ground and pavilion facilities of the college. Jowett Walk has also provided accommodation for some non-Balliol undergraduates, as part of an arrangement with Wadham College, Oxford.

From 2010, St Cross Church, next to the Manor, has been the college&#x27;s Historic Collections Centre, an extension to the library&#x27;s services. The church dates from the 11th or 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. This is the third time an Oxford college has incorporated a redundant church as a Library (see Lincoln College and St. Edmund Hall).

In 2017, the college entered into a specialised financial arrangement which enabled it to project a new 200 plus &#x27;study-bedsits&#x27; accommodation range at the Master&#x27;s Field/ Jowett Walk/ St Cross Road site which would also replace the Eastman Professor&#x27;s House, Martin and Dellal buildings there. This would mean a net increase of approximately 140 rooms fulfilling the college&#x27;s long-term intention of providing accommodation to all its undergraduates for all their degree terms and also some rooms for dons.

The project includes ten new buildings and a new sports pavilion, including a space for dining, events, spectators and squash courts in the basement. The first building opened in spring 2019 and the completion and occupation of the rest is due by January 2021. In the first phase, work began on the south of the site, at the corner of Jowett Walk and St Cross Road, to provide the accommodation for undergraduates and the new pavilion.

==Oxford Internet Institute==
Balliol College, and its previous Master Andrew Graham, played a major role in 2000–01 in setting up the Oxford Internet Institute. This was the first multidisciplinary research and policy centre in a European university devoted to examining the impact of the Internet on society. It is a department within the Social Sciences Division of Oxford University, but is physically located within the grounds of Balliol, and its previous Director (William H. Dutton) was a Professorial Fellow of Balliol.

==Traditions and customs==

Along with many of the ancient colleges, Balliol has evolved its own traditions and customs over the centuries, many of which occupy a regular calendar slot.

The patron saint of the college is Saint Catherine of Alexandria. On her feast day (25 November), a formal dinner is held for all final year students within Balliol. This festival was well established by 1550. Another important feast is the Snell Dinner. This dinner is held in memory of John Snell, whose benefaction established exhibitions for students from the University of Glasgow to study at Balliol (the first exhibitioners were matriculated in 1699) one of whom was Adam Smith. The feast is attended by fellows of Balliol College, the current Snell Exhibitioners, and representatives from Glasgow University and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

The MCR has one black-tie dinner each term: the Christmas Dinner in Michaelmas, Burns Night in Hilary, and the May Dinner in Trinity Term.

By far the most eccentric event is The Nepotists carol-singing event organised by the college&#x27;s Arnold and Brackenbury Society. This event happens on the last Friday of Michaelmas term each year. On this occasion, Balliol students congregate in the college hall to enjoy mulled wine and the singing of carols. The evening historically ended with a rendition of &quot;The Gordouli&quot; (see Balliol–Trinity rivalry below) on Broad Street, outside the gates of Trinity College, although in recent years the song has been sung from within the college walls.

A college society which no longer survives is the Hysteron Proteron Club, which aimed to live one day of each term backwards.

===Tortoises===
Balliol also takes pride in its college tortoises. The original tortoise, who lived at the college for at least 43 years, was known as Rosa, named after the Marxist Rosa Luxemburg. Each June, pet tortoises from various Oxford colleges are brought to Corpus Christi College where they participate in a very slow race; Balliol&#x27;s own Rosa competed and won many times. Rosa disappeared in the Spring of 2004, and while numerous conspiracy theories abounded, none is officially recognised by the college. However, on 29 April 2007, Chris Skidmore, a graduate of Christ Church working at the House of Commons, donated a pair of tortoises - one to his own college, and one to Balliol, where he had attended an open day in 1999. The new tortoise, Matilda, died in April 2009. Taking care of the resident tortoise is one of the many tasks assigned to Balliol students each year. This position, known as &quot;Comrade Tortoise&quot;, has been filled by a student every year.

===Balliol–Trinity rivalry===
For many years, there has been a traditional and fierce rivalry shown between the students of Balliol and those of its immediate neighbour to the east, Trinity College. It has manifested itself on the sports field and the river; in the form of songs (of varying degrees of offensiveness) sung over the dividing walls; and in the form of &quot;raids&quot; on the other college. The rivalry reflects that which also exists between Trinity College, Cambridge and Balliol&#x27;s sister college, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In college folklore, the rivalry goes back to the late 17th century, when Ralph Bathurst, President of Trinity, was supposedly observed throwing stones at Balliol&#x27;s windows. In fact, in its modern form, the rivalry appears to date from the late 1890s, when the chant or song known as a &quot;Gordouli&quot; began to be sung from the Balliol side.

The traditional words run:
The shouting of chants over the wall is still known as &quot;a Gordouli&quot;, and the tradition continues as the students gather to sing following boat club dinners and other events. The traditional Gordouli is said to have been sung by Balliol and Trinity men in the trenches of Mesopotamia in the First World War.

Balliol became known for its radicalism and political activism in the 20th century, and saw an abortive coup in the 1960s in which students took over the college and declared it &quot;the People&#x27;s Republic of Balliol&quot;. The contrast between the radical tendencies of many Balliol students and the traditional conservatism and social exclusivity of Trinity gave the rivalry an extra edge. The fact that Balliol (in contrast to Trinity) had admitted a number of Indian and Asiatic students also gave many of the taunts from the Trinity side a distinctly racist tone: Balliol students, for example, were sometime referred to as &quot;Basutos&quot;.

In &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot; (1931), a Lord Peter Wimsey novel by Somerville alumna Dorothy L. Sayers, Lord Peter (a Balliol man) is asked whether he remembers a certain contemporary from Trinity. I never knew any Trinity men,&#x27; said Wimsey. &#x27;The Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Sayers also alludes to the rivalry in &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; (1933): Mr Ingleby, a Trinity man, comments, &quot;If there is one thing more repulsive than another it is Balliolity.&quot;

One of the wittier raids from Balliol, in 1962 or 1963, involved the turfing of the whole of Trinity JCR (complete with daffodils). The last incident suspected to relate to the feud was the vandalism of Trinity&#x27;s Senior Common Room pond, which led to the death of all but one of the fish.

==Literary repartee==
===Materialistic limerick===
The Garden Quad at Balliol is the scene of the well-known limerick that parodies the immaterialist philosophy of Bishop Berkeley:

&lt;poem&gt;
There was a young man who said, God
Must think it exceedingly odd
If he finds that this tree
Still continues to be
When there&#x27;s no one about in the Quad.
&lt;/poem&gt;

and also of the response, by the Balliol-educated Catholic theologian and Bible translator Ronald Knox, which more accurately reflects Berkeley&#x27;s own beliefs:

&lt;poem&gt;
Dear Sir, your astonishment&#x27;s odd:
I am &quot;always&quot; about in the Quad.
And that&#x27;s why the tree
Will continue to be,
Since observed by, Yours faithfully, GOD.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===&quot;The Masque of Balliol&quot;===
In 1880, seven mischievous Balliol undergraduates published &quot;The Masque of B-ll--l&quot;, a broadsheet of forty quatrains making light of their superiors – the master and selected fellows, scholars, and commoners – and themselves. The outraged authorities immediately suppressed the collection, and only a few copies survived, three of which found their way into the college library over the years, and one into the Bodleian Library. Verses of this form are now known as Balliol rhymes.

The best known of these rhymes is the one on Benjamin Jowett. This has been widely quoted and reprinted in virtually every book about Jowett and about Balliol ever since.
This and 18 others are attributed to Henry Charles Beeching. The other quatrains are much less well known.

William Tuckwell included 18 of these quatrains in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; in 1900, but they all came out only in 1939, thanks to Walter George Hiscock, an Oxford librarian, who issued them personally then and in a second edition in 1955.

==People associated with Balliol==
===Notable people===

A wide range of figures who have contributed deeply to public life were either educated or taught at Balliol. Balliol people were, for example, prominent in establishing the International Baccalaureate, the National Trust, the Workers Educational Association, the welfare state, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Amnesty International.

Nobel Prize winners

Five former Balliol students and seven fellows became Nobel Laureates, with Linus Pauling winning two Nobel Prizes.
Science

Balliol played an important role in early modern science:

* The early Newtonian David Gregory was &quot;the first to openly teach the doctrines of the &quot;Principia&quot;, in a public seminary&quot; and was elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy, due in large part to the influence of Isaac Newton
* John Keill, another important defender of Newton, who after being appointed as lecturer in experimental philosophy at Hart Hall, started performing experiments based on Newton&#x27;s findings
* The mathematician James Stirling, best remembered for Stirling&#x27;s approximation for factorials, was a Snell and Warner exhibitioner expelled in 1715 for his correspondence with Jacobites
* James Bradley, best known for his discovery of the aberration of light and the nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis, who was placed (after Hipparchus and Kepler) &quot;above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all countries&quot; by Delambre and was appointed Savilian Professor of Astronomy, eventually becoming the third Astronomer Royal in 1742
* Alex Jadad, creator of the Jadad scale, the most widely used tool to assess the quality of clinical trials in the world, and convener of the global conversation that resulted in the re-conceptualization of health as &#x27;the ability to adapt and manage&#x27; the physical, mental or social challenges faced by individuals or communities throughout life.

Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins was a Balliol student from 1959 to 1962.

The height of Baliol&#x27;s literary influence came in the Victorian era, when virtually all major poets had some connection with Balliol:

* Gerard Manley Hopkins, though publishing little while alive, has experienced posthumous fame that placed him among leading English poets with his prosody establishing him as an innovator, as did his praise of God through vivid use of imagery and nature; by 1930 Hopkins&#x27;s work was seen as one of the most original literary advances of his century

Philosophy

Notable Balliol philosophers include:

* Adam Smith, a pioneer in the thinking of political economy and key figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, regarded as &quot;The Father of Economics&quot; or &quot;The Father of Capitalism&quot;
* T. H. Green, whose teaching is considered the most potent philosophical influence in England during the last quarter of the 19th century, cited by many social liberal politicians, often Balliol alumni, such as Herbert Samuel and H. H. Asquith

Like most philosophy faculties in the Anglosphere, contemporary thought at Balliol is firmly grounded in the so-called analytic tradition:

<text>Apex () is a town in Wake County, North Carolina, United States. At its southern border, Apex encompasses the community of Friendship. In 1994, the downtown area was designated a historic district, and the Apex train depot, built in 1867, is designated a Wake County landmark. The depot location marks the highest point on the old Chatham Railroad, hence the town&#x27;s name. The town motto is &quot;The Peak of Good Living&quot;.

In the late 19th century, a small community developed around the railroad station. The forests were cleared for farmland, much of which was dedicated to tobacco farming. Since Apex was near the state capital, it became a trading center. The railroad shipped products such as lumber, tar, and tobacco. The town was officially incorporated in 1873. By 1900, the town had a population of 349. As of the 2020 census, its population was 58,780, making it the 17th-most populous municipality in North Carolina.

The population boom occurred primarily in the late 1990s. The Research Triangle Park, established in the 1960s, created strong demand for technology workers. This also drove population growth.

==History==
In 1869, the Chatham Railroad, connecting Chatham County with Raleigh, was completed. At the highest point of the line, which railroad workers dubbed the &quot;apex of the grade&quot;, existed a pond. Trains leaving out of Chatham would stop at the pond to replenish their water. A community began to grow around the stop, which the railroad workers called Apex. The town of Apex was incorporated in 1873. The pond was eventually drained by culverts and ceased to exist by 1900.

Apex grew slowly through the succeeding decades, despite several devastating fires, including a June 12, 1911, conflagration that destroyed most of the downtown business district. The town center was rebuilt and stands to this day, now one of the most intact railroad towns in the state. At the heart of town stands the Apex Union Depot, originally a passenger station for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and later home to the locally supported Apex Community Library. The depot now houses the Apex Chamber of Commerce.

Apex suffered mild setbacks during the Great Depression era, but growth began again in earnest in the 1950s. The town&#x27;s proximity to RTP spurred additional residential development, yet the town managed to preserve its small-town character. During the 1990s, the town&#x27;s population quadrupled to over 20,000, placing new demands upon Apex&#x27;s infrastructure.

Apex has continued to grow in recent years. A sizable shopping center was built at the intersection of Highway 55 and US 64, and several new neighborhoods have been built as the town grows toward the west.

In October 2006, a chemical explosion and fire in a waste-processing facility prompted the evacuation of over 16,000 residents. There were few serious injuries, and residents were soon able to return home. In 2009, a federal court approved a $7.85M settlement to compensate Apex residents affected by the disaster. Each household received $750. Businesses received $2,200.

In 2015, Apex was named the number-one place to live in America, according to &quot;Money&quot; magazine.

In addition to the Apex Union Depot, the Apex City Hall, Apex Historic District, Calvin Wray Lawrence House, and Utley-Council House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="128298" wikidata="Q2028768" url="?curid=128298" title="Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina">
<text>Fuquay-Varina ( ) is a town in southern Wake County, North Carolina, United States, lying south of Holly Springs and southwest of Garner. The population was 34,152 at the 2020 census, and estimated at 36,736 as of July 2021. The hyphenated name attests to the town&#x27;s history as two separate towns. Fuquay Springs and Varina merged in 1963 to create the modern town. Economically, the town initially grew due to tobacco trade and agriculture, but has seen recent population growth and real estate development due to its proximity to Research Triangle Park.

==History==
===Early history===

Frenchman William Fuquay first settled in the small farming town of Sippihaw, named for the original Native American tribe that inhabited the area. Although there is no history of a tribe called Sippihaw, there are historical accounts in the area of a tribe called Susippihaw. Around 1858, while plowing the fields of the family tobacco farm, Stephen Fuquay, son of William, discovered a spring. Originally the spring was used solely for drinking water. Stephen soon came to the conclusion that the mineral water flowing from the springs had healing properties. As word spread, locals began to help the springs establish this reputation, which brought residents from neighboring communities and counties to its waters. The springs were eventually walled in to better serve the tourists coming to the area by road or rail. In 1860, Fuquay sold the springs to a group of local investors who formed the Chalybeate Springs Company to market the attraction and its waters.

At that time another Sippihaw resident, J. D. &quot;Squire&quot; Ballentine, was returning home from the Civil War. Ballentine had been the town&#x27;s schoolmaster before going off to fight for the Confederate Army. During his tour of duty, he had received letters from one of many southern ladies who wrote to the troops to improve their morale. Originally signing her name &quot;Varina&quot;, perhaps an homage to the wife of Jefferson Davis, Virginia Avery would later meet and fall in love with Ballentine. He continued to call her Varina throughout their life together. When he became the first postmaster at the new post office in town in 1880, he named it &quot;Varina&quot; in her honor. A community grew just south of the springs, near the post office and the couple&#x27;s Varina Mercantile Company general store. In time, it adopted the same name. Ballentine&#x27;s business success allowed him to construct the Ballentine Spence House in 1910, the first house to have plumbing and electricity in the area. This house, a local historic landmark, still stands today.

===Growth around the start of the 20th century===

The Fuquay Mineral Spring&#x27;s popularity grew in the 1890s and around the start of the 20th century as local businessman John Mills developed the idea to offer &quot;Moonlight Excursions&quot; to the springs. He fitted flat rail cars with seats and offered nighttime train trips to southern Wake County from Raleigh. As more guests came to the springs to &quot;take the waters&quot;, a group of small hotels sprung up in town, along with restaurants, barbecue stands, and a dance pavilion with a player piano. The town became a tourist destination and was the site of special celebrations on Fourths of July and Easter Mondays. During these events, residents of Raleigh would take the train down to watch the accompanying baseball games and participate in the dances and celebrations. Hotels like the Ben Wiley Hotel (now called the Fuquay Mineral Spring Inn &amp; Garden) catered to the out-of-towners and became as much a center of town life as the springs. In 1902, Sippihaw was renamed &quot;Fuquay Springs&quot; in honor of its founding family and was officially incorporated in 1909.

When it was incorporated, the new Fuquay Springs town limits included the core of the neighboring town of Varina, consisting of its business district and the rail junction of the Cape Fear and Northern Railway and the Norfolk Southern Railway. But Varina reestablished itself the following year when the Varina Union Station was erected and a new post office was created, spurred by the lobbying of Ballentine. Four years later, the Bank of Varina was established, competing directly with the Bank of Fuquay (now Fidelity Bank). Several warehouses for the growing tobacco business were built in town over the next few years, capitalizing on the railroad connections. Another supply store and a knitting factory followed. As Varina came into its own as a hub for area agriculture, the Fuquay Springs Corporation was formed and began bottling and selling mineral water from the springs commercially. Area businesses continued to develop and, in 1927, U.S. Route 401 was paved through town, shortening travel times to Raleigh and nearby communities.

===Unification and the present===

By this time, Fuquay Springs and Varina had become major trading hubs for southern Wake County as well as neighboring Harnett and Johnston counties. Yet improvements to automobiles and area roads caused a decline in tourism at the springs. Rather than visiting the springs, residents in the region chose to visit the coast as travel times decreased. During this time, however, the tobacco industry continued to drive the area economy, with five warehouses, a cotton buyer, and fifteen stores established by the end of the 1920s. The shared emphasis on agricultural and industrial growth brought the towns to a shared vision, and as their residents worked, played, and attended church together, the towns merged into Fuquay-Varina in 1963.

While development in the area today includes numerous residential communities and commercial sites along the major roadways into town, many of the older structures from its past remain within the town limits. The Victorian, Craftsman, and Colonial Revival homes constructed in the late 19th century and early 20th century are contributing structures to the Fuquay Springs Historic District, while the downtown shops and businesses are part of the Varina Commercial Historic District. Area landmarks located in these districts include the Ben-Wiley Hotel, the Ballentine-Spence House, and the Dr. Wiley S. Cozart House, built across the street from the springs by the original owner and proprietor of the Ben Wiley. The springs are now contained in a small park developed on the site in 1945 which was handed over to the town in 1998 to maintain as a historic park. Lexie McLean owned and operated McLean&#x27;s Grocery on Academy Street for many years. McLean was a community leader and considered a major factor in the growth and development of the Fuquay-Varina area. Edward N. Farnell was the principal of the Fuquay Spring High School from 1952 through 1967. Farnell was an important community leader and educator; many of his students went on to become community and state leaders.

From 1970 to 2000, the population more than doubled, growing from 3,576 residents to 7,898. The population more than doubled again between 2000 and 2010, growing to 17,937 at the 2010 census. According to the NC State Data Center, Fuquay-Varina grew 23% from 2000 to 2003, making it the 26th fastest growing community in the state and the 11th fastest for those with populations over 5,000.

Fuquay-Varina is also the former hometown of Internet personalities Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, who moved their studio there in 2010, as well as Link who until then lived in Apex, North Carolina.

In addition to the Ben-Wiley Hotel, Fuquay Springs Historic District, and Varina Commercial Historic District, the Fuquay Mineral Spring, Fuquay Springs High School, Fuquay Springs Teacherage, Fuquay-Varina Woman&#x27;s Club Clubhouse, J. Beale Johnson House, Kemp B. Johnson House, Jones-Johnson-Ballentine Historic District, and Wayland H. and Mamie Burt Stevens House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Blackfriars Priory (formally the Priory of the Holy Spirit) is a Dominican religious community in Oxford, England. Its primary work is the administration of two educational institutions: Blackfriars Studium, a centre of theological studies in the Roman Catholic tradition; and Blackfriars Hall, a constituent permanent private hall of the University of Oxford. The current prior of Blackfriars is Dominic White. The name &quot;Blackfriars&quot; is commonly used in Britain to denote a house of Dominican friars, a reference to their black &quot;cappa&quot;, which forms part of their habit.

Blackfriars is located in central Oxford on St Giles&#x27;, between the Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies and St Cross College.

== History ==
The Dominicans arrived in Oxford on 15 August 1221, at the instruction of a General Chapter meeting headed by Saint Dominic himself, little more than a week after the friar&#x27;s death. As such, the hall is heir to the oldest tradition of teaching in Oxford, a tradition that precedes both the aularian houses of the next century and the collegiate houses of the rest of the University of Oxford&#x27;s history. In 1236 they established a new and extensive priory in the St. Ebbes district.

Like all the monastic houses in Oxford, Blackfriars came into rapid and repeated conflict with the university authorities. With the Reformation, all monastic houses, including Blackfriars, were suppressed. The Dominicans did not return to Oxford for some 400 years, until 1921 when Blackfriars was refounded by Bede Jarrett as a religious house. The original priory building was designed by Edward Doran Webb and completed in 1929. The Dominican studium at Blackfriars had a close relationship with the university, culminating in the establishment of Blackfriars as a permanent private hall in 1994.

== Blackfriars Studium ==
Blackfriars offers those preparing for the Catholic priesthood the Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology (STB) granted by the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome. It is also possible for lay men and women to begin the Angelicum&#x27;s STB programme by studying in the Blackfriars Studium and to conclude the programme with at least a year&#x27;s full-time study at the &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

== Notable Friars ==
* Malcolm McMahon, Archbishop of Liverpool, former Prior.
* Aidan Nichols, first John Paul II Memorial Visiting Lecturer at the University of Oxford
* Brian Davies - philosopher
* Richard Finn - theology and classics scholar
* Timothy Radcliffe - former Prior, Master Emeritus of the Order of Preachers, and Cardinal
* Fergus Kerr - former Prior.

<doc id="128300" wikidata="Q899030" url="?curid=128300" title="Brasenose College, Oxford">
<text>Brasenose College (BNC) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. It began as Brasenose Hall in the 13th century, before being founded as a college in 1509. The library and chapel were added in the mid-17th century and the new quadrangle in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

For 2020–21, Brasenose placed 4th in the Norrington Table (an unofficial measure of performance in undergraduate degree examinations). In a recent Oxford Barometer Survey, Brasenose&#x27;s undergraduates registered 98% overall satisfaction. In recent years, around 80% of the UK undergraduate intake have been from state schools.

Brasenose is home to one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, Brasenose College Boat Club.

==History==
===Foundation===
The history of Brasenose College, Oxford stretches back to 1509, when the college was founded on the site of Brasenose Hall, a medieval academic hall whose name is first mentioned in 1279. Its name is believed to derive from the name of a brass or bronze knocker that adorned the hall&#x27;s door.

The college was associated with Lancashire and Cheshire, the county origins of its two founders – Sir Richard Sutton and the Bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth – a link which was maintained strongly until the latter half of the twentieth century. The first principals navigated Brasenose, with its Catholic sympathisers, through the Reformation and continuing religious reforms.

Most of Brasenose favoured the Royalist side during the English Civil War, although it produced notable generals and clergy on both sides.

The library and chapel were completed in the mid-17th century, despite Brasenose suffering continuing financial problems.
===Nineteenth century===
After 1785 the college prospered under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and achieved considerable academic success. But the reconstruction of Brasenose was not completed until the end of the 19th century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose&#x27;s financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose&#x27;s academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focused on sport, where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing.

The mid-century Royal Commissions were navigated; although they were initially opposed, some recommendations were welcomed, including the election of fellows on merit rather than by their place of birth. The election of Charles Heberden as principal in 1889 led to a gradual improvement in Brasenose&#x27;s academic fortunes, although its sporting performance suffered. As the first lay principal, Heberden presided over an increasingly secular college, which opened up the library to undergraduates, instituted an entrance exam for the first time and accepted Rhodes scholars.

===Early twentieth century===
Brasenose lost 115 men in the First World War (including a quarter of the 1913 year), with its undergraduate numbers greatly reduced.

Lord Curzon&#x27;s post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen – cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass&#x27; authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however.

After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford&#x27;s largest colleges.

===Since 1970===
The 1970s saw considerable social change in Brasenose, with more post-graduate attendees and fewer domestic staff. In 1974 Brasenose became one of the first men&#x27;s colleges to admit women as full members, bringing an end to 470 years of the college as a men-only institution. The other previously all-male colleges to begin admitting women in 1974 were Jesus College, Hertford, St Catherine&#x27;s, and Wadham. The College&#x27;s first female Governing Body Fellow, lawyer Mary Stokes, was elected in May 1981 and took up her Fellowship in October 1982.

There was also considerable construction work to ensure that undergraduates could be housed for the entirety of their degree on the main site and on the Frewin site; this objective was finally achieved in 1997 with the opening of the St Cross annexe and Frewin extension. Brasenose&#x27;s finances were secured, and it thus entered the twenty-first century in a good position as regards financial, extracurricular and academic success.

As of 2022 the college admits undergraduates for most major courses in 17 subject groups across science, humanities, social science and arts.

==Location and buildings==


Brasenose faces the west side of Radcliffe Square opposite the Radcliffe Camera in the centre of Oxford. The north side is defined by Brasenose Lane, while the south side reaches the High Street. To the west is Lincoln College. At its south-east end, the college is separated from the University Church by St Mary&#x27;s Passage. The main entrance of the college can be found on Radcliffe Square. Although not located on Turl Street the college has informal links with the three Turl Street colleges (Lincoln, Jesus, and Exeter). The college is also physically linked to Lincoln College through a connecting door, through which Brasenose College members are permitted to enter Lincoln College on Ascension Day each year. The door is opened for five minutes and it is the only time during the year that this door is unlocked. Brasenose members are then served an ale by Lincoln College, which is traditionally flavoured with ground ivy.

The main college site comprises three quads, the original Old Quad, a small quad known as the Deer Park, and the large New Quad, as well as collection of smaller houses facing Radcliffe Square and the High Street. The original college buildings comprised a single two-storey quad, incorporating the original kitchen of Brasenose Hall on the south side. In the 17th century a third floor was added to the quad to form the current Old Quad. A separate chapel was also built to the south, connected to the quad by a library built over a cloister as shown in a 1670 print, thus enclosing the Deer Park. The cloister was for a time the college burial ground, and evidence suggests there were at least 59 people buried there, with the last recorded burial being in 1754. The cloister was filled in to make two or three chambers in around 1807, used as student bedrooms or administrative offices until 1971, when the space was converted into the graduate common room. More recently the graduate common room moved to the Old Quad, and the space, still known as the &quot;Old Cloisters&quot; has been used as a library overspill area, a teaching room and, in 2010–11, as the temporary Senior Common Room. In January 2015, archaeological investigations began as a prelude to a major building project that will restore the stone work and integrate the lower and upper reading rooms, greatly enhancing the college&#x27;s library provision. The nickname for the Chapel Quad is often thought to be a friendly jibe at Magdalen College which has a genuine deer park known as The Grove.

===Dining hall===
In the 16th century the dining hall was heated by an open fire in the centre of the room, supplemented by movable braziers. In the 1680s the hall was renovated, with a raised floor to accommodate a wine cellar below and a reconstructed roof. Another renovation phase in the mid-18th century included a new chimneypiece, a new ceiling to cover the original timber beams and two gilded chandeliers. The original brazen nose was placed above high table in 1890.

Building began on the current chapel in 1656, and it replaced an old chapel which was located in a space now occupied by the Senior Common Room. An inscription commemorates this above the door to Staircase IV. Building materials were taken from a disused chapel at the site of St Mary&#x27;s College (now Frewin Hall), transported piece by piece by horse-and-cart to Brasenose College. The chapel, a mix of Gothic and Baroque styles, features a hanging fan vault ceiling of wood and plaster, and was consecrated in 1666. The internal fittings are largely 18th and 19th century, and include chandeliers presented to the college in 1749. These were donated to a parish church and later converted to gas but then returned to Brasenose when the church switched to electric lights. The chandeliers were then converted back to their original state so that candles could be used in them once again.

Various alterations were made to the Chapel after completion. Although repairs were undertaken in the meantime, the interior of the Chapel was renovated (having fallen into a poor state) in 1819, and the exterior beginning in 1841. In 1892–3 a new organ was purchased and fitted, paid for by the then Principal Charles Buller Heberden; the current organ was installed in 1973, and rebuilt in 2001–2.

The current library was begun in 1658 and received its first books in 1664. It replaced a smaller library on Staircase IV, which is now used as a meeting room. The books in the current library were fixed by chains, which were only removed in the 1780s, over a hundred years later.

In May 2018 author Philip Pullman opened the extensively renovated Greenland Library following a £4 million project to provide a better working space for students (architects - Lee/Fitzgerald). The library works were funded by three college alumni, Duncan Greenland, James Del Favero and Gerald Smith. Two reading rooms are named in honour of Del Favero and Smith respectively with the overall library taking Greenland&#x27;s name The renovations won an RIBA regional RIBA Conservation award in 2019.

===New Quad===
New Quad was designed by TG Jackson and finished in 1911, replacing a number of existing buildings. The current site was completed in 1961 with new buildings, used largely for first year undergraduate accommodation, designed by the architects Powell and Moya.

In 2010 a project was begun to renovate the kitchens, servery, dining hall and some other areas of college. The project included the installation of under floor heating and a new timber floor in the dining hall, new kitchen equipment, a new servery area, additional dining and meeting places, and disabled access to the dining hall. During the project, the Old Quad housed a temporary dining hall and kitchen, while the New Quad was used to store building materials.

The dining hall refurbishment was completed by September 2010, whilst the remaining work was completed around Easter 2012. The new catering facilities were unveiled during a ceremony on 14 March 2012. During the ceremony, college members gathered in a restored 15th century building in the heart of college, originally the college kitchens and most recently used as the servery. This room, to be known as the Mediaeval Kitchen, will be used as a new dining space in addition to the main dining hall, which will remain the usual location for student meals. The temporary kitchen and builder&#x27;s yard were removed and the Quads restored to their normal state during the Easter 2012 vacation.

In recent years the Junior Common Room (JCR) and Bar have also been renovated.

===Annexes===
The college has a large undergraduate annexe situated on St Michael&#x27;s Street, developed from Frewin Hall in the 1940s. Frewin Hall had previously housed a number of tenants from outside the college, including King Edward VII.

Second, Third and Fourth year undergraduates typically choose to live in bedrooms at Frewin. A recent building project at Frewin, aimed to increase the undergraduate bedroom provision and improve facilities, has unearthed some significant archeological finds including a 4,000-year-old prehistoric burial mound, a limestone wall foundation, butchered animal bones, decorated floor tiles, a stone flagon, a bone comb and a medieval long cross silver penny

There is also a graduate annexe shared with St Cross College, which was completed in 1995. The St Cross annexe is laid out in clusters of five bed-sitting rooms, sharing two shower rooms and a kitchen. A second graduate annexe, Hollybush Row, was opened in September 2008 and is located close to the railway station and Said Business School. It consists of single rooms with en-suite bathrooms and shared kitchens.

==Traditions==

===Coat of arms===

Brasenose College&#x27;s coat of arms is quite complex, since it incorporates the personal arms of the founders and the arms of the See of Lincoln.
Its blazon (description in formal heraldic terms) is: &quot;Tierced in pale: (1) Argent, a chevron sable between three roses gules seeded or, barbed vert (for Smyth); (2) or, an escutcheon of the arms of the See of Lincoln (gules, two lions of England in pale or, on a chief azure Our Lady crowned seated on a tombstone issuant from the chief, in her dexter arm the Infant Jesus, in her sinister arm a sceptre, all or) ensigned with a mitre proper; (3) quarterly, first and fourth argent, a chevron between three bugle-horns stringed sable; second and third argent, a chevron between three crosses crosslet sable (for Sutton)&quot;.
A simpler form has occasionally been used where the central tierce contains the arms of the See of Lincoln, rather than displaying them on a mitred escutcheon. Because of the complexity of the arms they are not suitable for use on items such as the college crested tie, where the brazen nose is used instead.

===College prayer===
The college prayer is read by the principal or a fellow at evensong on Sundays during term and at gaudies.

Individual benefactors are commemorated in an annual pattern, with the founders being commemorated (as shown above) on the first Sunday of Michaelmas Term, and at all gaudies.

===Graces===
The following preprandial grace is read by the Bible Clerk at Formal Hall:
The grace after dinner is only read on special occasions, and the list of benefactors included in this grace is quite variable.
==Student life==
The JCR plays a central part in the life of the undergraduate community. Offering social, recreational and welfare support to the students, the elected committee addresses many aspects of student life and liaises with the governing body and graduate student representatives.

Unlike most Oxford colleges, the graduate common room is known as the Hulme Common Room (HCR), named after a past benefactor, rather than the Middle Common Room (MCR).

The college also organises an annual summer arts festival, one of the largest in the university. First staged in 1994, it features plays, pantomimes, comedy evenings, musical performances, and a keenly-contested bake-off. In 2016, the college held its 22nd summer arts festival, which featured six days of open-air plays, music concerts, a stage combat workshop, an outdoor film night, a poetry brunch as well as an outdoor summer bar, all organised by Brasenose students. In 2015 Brasenose also celebrated the 40th anniversary of the admission of women into the college through an exhibition, which modelled the portraits in the Dining Hall, by filling the JCR with a series of portraits of female alumnae &quot;40 Years of Brasenose Women&quot;. In 2017 the undergraduates held their first &quot;Frewchella&quot; festival, named after the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California and the college&#x27;s Frewin Annexe, featuring food, music and a bouncy castle. In 2018 special events included Chinese New Year, a St David&#x27;s Day dinner and an Egg Hunt.

===Music===
The college has a director of music, who directs the chapel choir with the assistance of up to three organ scholars. The director of music also facilitates a range of concerts, which usually happen on a weekly basis. These include the professional Platnauer Concerts, held in memory of Maurice Platnauer, principal of Brasenose (1956–1960). Other concerts are designed to highlight talented soloists or groups of performers in college. The college awards up to four music scholarships at any one time through auditions in the year prior to entry or at the beginning of the academic year.

Brasenose College has a non-auditioned choir, although up to eight choral scholarships are offered to members of Brasenose, again, through auditions in the year prior to entry or at the beginning of the academic year. Up to four choral exhibitions may also be given to members of Brasenose and other colleges. The choir sings Evensong every Sunday, and also sings for various special services and events, including two carol services, the annual joint service with Lincoln College and other occasions. Recently there has been the inauguration of a biennial Alumni and Music Reunion Dinner, with a Festal Evensong for all attendees preceding this. The choir regularly goes on tour, for instance to Paris in 2006, Lombardy in 2009, Rome in 2010 and Belgium in 2013, and sings at cathedrals near Oxford during term-time.

In 2010 and 2011 the college ran the Wondrous Machine event, where local primary school children were invited to Brasenose for interactive sessions to learn about the pipe organ and the science behind the musical instrument.
===Sport===

Brasenose students participate in a wide range of sports including football, netball, hockey, lacrosse, basketball, badminton, squash, pool, rugby, darts, boxing, dancesport and more. Student play at all levels and participation is completely optional and forms no part of the admissions process.

Brasenose College Boat Club (commonly abbreviated to BNCBC) is the rowing club of the college and is believed to be one of the oldest boat clubs in the world. The date of formation of the club is impossible to verify: a boat from the college took part in the earliest recorded race between rowing clubs anywhere in the world. This was a head race in Oxford in 1815, beating Jesus College Boat Club. A number of college members have rowed for the university against Cambridge University in the Boat Race and the Women&#x27;s Boat Race. Notably, Walter Woodgate, a Boat Race winner, eleven-time Henley champion and inventor of the coxless four, John (Con) Cherry who represented Great Britain at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and Andrew Lindsay who won a gold medal in rowing at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and participated in the Boat Race in 1998 and 1999.

The college boathouse, which is shared with Exeter College Boat Club, is in Christ Church Meadow, on the Isis (as the River Thames is called in Oxford). It replaced a moored barge used by club-member and spectators. Brasenose College Rugby Football Club (abbreviated to BNCRFC) can draw association with William Webb Ellis, who is often credited as the inventor of the game and studied at Brasenose.

<text>Botkyrka Municipality ( ) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden, not far from the capital Stockholm. Its seat is located in the town of Tumba.

In 1971 &quot;Grödinge&quot; was merged with Botkyrka and in 1974 &quot;Salem&quot; was added. The Salem part was split off again in 1983, and a new Salem Municipality was formed.

Botkyrka has an estimated population of 95,592.

==History==
The municipality is named after Saint Botvid, a Christian missionary during the 12th century. Saint Botvid is shown on the seal and coat of arms of Botkyrka Municipality, where he carries an axe and a fish. Another remnant of Botkyrka&#x27;s Christian medieval history is the Botkyrka church, made of stone.
Politically the municipality is primarily Social Democratic, that has governed Botkyrka for a long period except 3 years in the early 1990s. However, with fewer seats the party now governs together with The Green Party, and The Left Party. There have also been several local parties. For a long period a local party called Botkyrkapartiet (The Botkyrka Party) has held several seats. A party was also active from mid 1980s to mid 1990s with only one purpose - to prevent the exploitation of the small airfield, F18, in Tullinge to become a commercial airport in the 1980s. In the election 2010 a local party for the area of Tullinge got 6 seats on the agenda of separating Tullinge from Botkyrka as a separate municipality.

Botkyrka has two local, weekly, newspapers called &quot;Mitt i Botkyrka&quot; (Middle of Botkyrka) and &quot;Södra Sidan&quot; (South side). They are delivered free of charge to all households.

The Swedish hip hop group The Latin Kings raps about life in Botkyrka in several of their songs.

In its December 2015 report, Police in Sweden placed the Hallunda and Norsborg districts in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. In its 2017 report, Police in Sweden added the Alby and Fittja districts to the category.

=== Battle of Botkyrka ===

On 31 August 1568, a battle between John III, Duke Charles, and Eric XIV took place in Botkyrka. Despite his inferior forces, the battle resulted in a victory for Eric XIV&#x27;s army, and forced John and Charles to flee.

==Demographics==
The northern and eastern parts of the municipality are in the contiguous Stockholm urban area. Tumba forms a locality (&quot;tätort&quot;) of its own (which partly is in Salem Municipality). Vårsta is in the central part. The southern half of the municipality is mostly rural.

===2022 population by district===

<doc id="128302" wikidata="Q113679" url="?curid=128302" title="Danderyd Municipality">
<text>Danderyd Municipality (&quot;Danderyds kommun&quot;; ) is a municipality north of Stockholm in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. It is one of the smallest municipalities of Sweden, but the most affluent. Its seat is located in Djursholm and it is located within Stockholm urban area.

The &quot;old&quot; rural municipality Danderyd was split up during the early 20th century, when Djursholm and Stocksund broke away in 1901 and 1910 respectively. Since 1971 Danderyd Municipality is reunified in approximately the old boundaries. The population in 2019 was 32,857. The four districts making up Danderyd are: Danderyd, Djursholm, Stocksund and Enebyberg.

==Demographics==
===Income and education===
The population in Danderyd Municipality is among the most affluent in the country, having the highest median income per capita. One of the reasons for this is the high price on real estate, which in turn is partially due to a restrictive policy on new developments by the municipality council.

The high income of the population has enabled the municipality to maintain a relatively low rate of taxation, but a government redistribution scheme intended to transfer money from socioeconomically advantaged municipalities to those less well-off along with financial mismanagement has caused tax rises and expenditure reductions in recent years.

Danderyd Municipality also has the highest share (57.0%) of highly educated persons (Statistics Sweden definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer) in the country.

===2022 population by district===
This is a demographic table based on Danderyd Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 32,772 residents, including 24,246 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 28.8% voted for the left coalition and 70.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Residents with a foreign background ===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 6,402, or 19.47% of the population (32,888 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 4,512, or 15.16% (29,755 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 32,888 residents in Danderyd, of which 5,394 people (16.40%) were born in a country other than Sweden, divided by country in the table below. Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth grouped together by continent by Statistics Sweden.
==Roads==
The European route E18 stretches through the municipality, from the road bridge over the Stocksundet sea strait, north towards Norrtälje Municipality.

==Public transport==
Danderyd is served by the Stockholm public transport system through SL. There are two stations on the Stockholm metro red line: Danderyd Hospital (which is the location for a public hospital) and Mörby centrum. There are also several stops on the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan suburban railway as well as an extensive bus network including a large bus interchange at Danderyds sjukhus.

The King of Sweden resides in Ekerö Municipality, at Drottningholm Palace (see below).

Originally, when the first local government acts were implemented in Sweden in 1863, eight rural municipalities were created, each corresponding to an old parish. The municipal reform of 1952 grouped them in two new larger entities. The next reform in 1971 merged them into the present municipality.

==Geography==

Ekerö is the only municipality in the Lake Mälaren region composed exclusively of islands. Land elevation has reduced the number of islands and skerries to 140, the largest of which are Adelsö, Munsö, Ekerö, Färingsö, and Lovö. 2000 years ago, during the Roman Iron Age, Färingsön was more of an archipelago of twenty islands.
== Heritage ==
The municipality contains two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One is Birka, an old Viking Age village, and the other is Drottningholm Palace and its surroundings.

Drottningholm, located on the Lovö island, was originally a Renaissance palace built by King John III for Queen Catherine Jagellon. On December 30, 1661, the old palace burned down. Queen Dowager Hedvig Eleonora had a new palace erected out of the preserved walls and cellar vaults from King John III:s palace in the French Baroque style to the design of architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, a work later completed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, Carl Hårleman, and Jean Eric Rehn. Since 1981 it is the permanent residence of the royal family, but large parts of the park are accessible to the public. The palace features several uniquely preserved structures, including the Palace Theatre, inaugurated in 1766 and still delivering operas using the preserved original machinery; and the Chinese Pavilion, the Rococo design of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz filled with Chinese luxury delivered by the Swedish East India Company.

Birka on the Björkö island is the oldest urban structure in Sweden, founded in the mid eighth century. In the ninth century, Ansgar, Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, made two failed attempts to convert its inhabitants. The settlement was finally abandoned in the late tenth century for unknown reasons. The excavations of the approximately 1.100 graves in the area started in 1871 and have continued since. A museum was created in 1995, and in summers various boats carry large numbers of tourists to the island.

=== Other notable historical sites ===
Other historical sights of interest are several runestones and other Viking remains, eight medieval churches, and old towns.
On the Adelsö Island is Hovgården, together with Birka a world heritage site, featuring barrows, thick walls, and runestones. There is also Alsnö hus, the ruins of the summer residence of Magnus Barnlock were the Ordinance of Alsnö created the foundation of the Swedish nobility, and a Romanesque church from the 12th century.

Next to this Crown palace is the residential area Drottningholmsmalmen (&quot;Drottningholm Ridge/Esker&quot;) which draws its history back to the &quot;Torvesund&quot; manor built in 1579-80 and which served as a place of refuge for the Jesuits following the Reformation. During the 18th century, soldiers, carpenters and other craftsmen working at The Royal Palace settled in the area. Intentions were to develop it into a suburb to the palace like at the Versailles Palace, and this end the area was granted the status of a city to attract entrepreneurs and artists to the royal court. During the reign of King Gustav III had several buildings erected, including the &quot;Långa raden&quot; (the &quot;Long Row&quot;) to accommodate the royal life guard. By 1815 78 properties existed in the area. However, it failed to develop in the direction sketched-out by Gustav III, and instead evolved into a summer residence area inhabited by wealthy burghers, the large-scales villas in a wide range of styles have given the area its characteristics. In the middle of the 20th century, several buildings by well-known Swedish architects, including Nils Tesch, Ralph Erskine, Peter Celsing and Bengt Lindroos, were added.

Kanton is a group of twenty buildings next to the Chinese Pavilion built in the 1750s and 1760s, intended to be a mercantile prototype settlement. 70-80 people lived there for a few decades producing luxury items for the royal court and the nobility, including some of the interior of the China Pavillin. The buildings later inspired author Elsa Beskow to some of her fairy tales.

Kungshatt (&quot;King&#x27;s Hat&quot;) is a rocky island south of Lovön where, according to a legend, a king Erik Väderhatt (&quot;Eric Weather Hat&quot;), so named because of his fortune with the winds which he could foretell with his hat, escaped his enemies by jumping from the cliff with his horse. The location for this event was furnished with a copper hat, now substituted with an iron hat.
Svartsjö Palace was originally a Folkung mansion. The palace King Gustav I and his sons had built here was destroyed by fire in 1687. The rococo palace, built 1735–1739 to the design of Carl Hårleman and later expanded by Queen Louisa Ulrika, was neglected for centuries before being restored. Its Baroque and English gardens are preserved.

Hilleshög Church is a mostly Romanesque edifice, built in granite and brick, with some parts from the 17th and 18th centuries and later additions. Many of the paintings in the interior, dating back to the end of the 13th century and the early 15th century, were painted over in the 18th century but were restored in the 1920s and in 2002, together with some of the furniture.

Ekebyhov is a real estate created around 1630. Its main building, Ekebyhov Palace, is a wooden structure begun in 1674 and completed in 1704. It is the oldest preserved wooden palace in Europe. The gardens of the palace boasts several unique plants and features a café. It is since 1980 owned by the municipality.

Skytteholm is a seat farm. Its main building, Skytteholm Mansion, was one of the mansions of Johan Skytte, mentor of Gustavus Adolphus the Great, had built in the Lake Mälaren region. Founded in 1631, its present appearance is mostly from around 1920. It is today mostly used for conferences and as a hotel.
In the 1950s, ancient remains were found on the island of Helgö. The excavations that followed unveiled eight groups of buildings and objects from Ireland, Egypt, and India dating back to the eighth century offering a hint of the extent of the trade of the era. The settlement is, however, believed to be considerably older and have reached its peak around 500-600 CE. On Helgö is also the Kaggeholm Palace, with a history stretching back to 1370. The palace was built in the 1720s.

The Barrow of Björn Ironside on Munsö Island is part of the Iron Age grave field Munsö-Husby. On Munsö is also Munsö Church; one of three round churches in the Stockholm area. Probably built in 1187, it contains several medieval wooden sculptures.

==Nature==
There are several outdoor activities that can be enjoyed, such as fishing and bicycling, as the nature is always nearby. Each of the islands also offers distinctive experiences and sights.

==Demographics==
===Population development===
===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Ekerö Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 29,062 residents, including 20,320 Swedish citizens of voting age. 42.0% voted for the left coalition and 56.9% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Income and Education===
The population in Ekerö Municipality has the seventh highest median income per capita in Sweden, although the share of highly educated persons, according to Statistics Sweden&#x27;s definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer, is 31.3% and slightly over the national average, 27.0%.

===Residents with a foreign background ===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 5 825, or 20.99% of the population (27 753 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 2 358, or 10.28% of the population (22 936 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 27 753 residents in Ekerö, of which 3 345 people (12.05%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

The Ekerö&#x27;s politics has traditionally been dominated by the centre-right Moderate Party since 1979. The voter turnout is usually high and among the highest in the country.

=== National Election, Riksdag ===
Source:

These are the election results from the 1973 onwards in Ekerö Municipality. In the SCB reports from 1988 to 1994 the exact decimals of the Sweden Democrats were not reported since only parties near the 4% nationwide threshold were reported on. 1985, the Christian Democrats (KD) and Centre Party (C) were allied as &quot;The Centre&quot; so their shared votes are reported as those of C in that election.

==Transport==
===Public transport===
Ekerö is served by the Stockholm public transport system through SL. All bus routes have connection with the Stockholm metro at Brommaplan. More recently a ferry has started running regularly between Ekerö and Stockholm city.

===Roads===
The county road 261 offers connection to motorists from Brommaplan and other western suburbs of Stockholm. There is only one bridge, Nockebybron, connecting the municipality with the mainland, but there is also a car ferry taking motorists to Botkyrka Municipality south-west of Stockholm.

Haninge Municipality was formed in 1971 when &quot;Västerhaninge&quot; and &quot;Österhaninge&quot; were united.

The municipal coat of arms depicts a capercaillie from which the name Haninge is believed to have been derived (the German word &quot;hahn&quot; means capercaillie), while the anchor symbolizes the naval base in the municipality. The German word usage is supposedly from the old German Hansa traders who operated in the area.

== Geography ==

Haninge cherishes its nature, housing the southern parts of the scenic Stockholm archipelago. There are over 3,600 islands, islets and skerries belonging to the municipality, with the three largest islands being Utö, Ornö and Muskö. A car tunnel, the third longest in Sweden, connects Muskö to the mainland. The other two of the islands are reached with passenger and car ferries. Haninge is also an area with access to Tyresta National Park with a surrounding nature reserve. It has been protected to preserve its noted natural values, e.g. one of the largest sections of untouched forest in southern Sweden.

==History==
Huddinge is a locality believed to trace its origins back at least 1,000 years, preceding the Viking Age. In times of conflict, the inhabitants of Huddinge would ascend to elevated areas to light beacons as a warning signal against approaching hostile ships. This practice was common throughout the entirety of Lake Mälaren, where beacons were strategically placed. The coat of arms of Huddinge is derived from this tradition of beacon lighting. The name &quot;Huddinge&quot; is thought to be rooted in the term &quot;Uddung,&quot; referring to the area&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants. During the Iron Age, these individuals resided along the shores of Lake Mälaren.

===Split into two municipalities===
After years of protests from inhabitants and after much debate, it was decided in 2007 to hold a referendum in 2008 regarding a split to make the eastern part of Huddinge its own municipality, named in published documents as Huddinge östra (&quot;Huddinge East&quot;). However only the inhabitants of eastern Huddinge would be allowed to vote. This caused a major political split of opinions as the political opposition wanted to see a vote. At least 60% of the inhabitants of eastern Huddinge had to vote &quot;yes&quot; for the split for it to be approved.

The referendum ended with a clear &quot;no&quot; to the split, ending the discussion.

==Demography==
Huddinge has a total population of roughly 110,000, or 4.5% of the population of Stockholm County. The average age is 36.7 years, but one-third of the population is under 25 years of age. This means that Huddinge has a slightly younger population than both Stockholm County (38.9 years) and the whole country (40.6 years). The population density of the municipality is increasing significantly. Since the 1960s, the population has doubled in size and is currently among the 14 largest municipalities in Sweden. The population of Huddinge passed the one of Gävle in 2008, and the ones of Eskilstuna and Sundsvall as well in 2009.

===Population===
===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Huddinge Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 113,678 residents, including 76,114 Swedish citizens of voting age. 50.9% voted for the left coalition and 46.9% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Residents with a foreign background ===
On 31 December 2017, the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside Sweden or with two parents born abroad) was 43,699, or 39.73% of the population (110,003 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002, the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 24,319, or 28.13% of the population (86,457 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017, there were 110,003 residents in Huddinge, of which 32,190 people (29.26%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

== Schools ==
In 2012 there were 27 public schools and five independent schools. Huddinge also has five public high schools with about 3400 students combined, these are:

* Huddingegymnasiet
* Östra Gymnasiet
* Sjödalsgymnasiet
* Sågbäcksgymnasiet
* Widerströmska gymnasiet

==Public transport==

Huddinge is served by the Stockholm public transport system. There are two stations on the Stockholm Metro and five on the Stockholm commuter rail system as well as large bus network. Some main line trains call at Flemingsberg.

==2018 Election==
Elections to Swedish municipalities are held every fourth year on the second Sunday in September. The 2018 election to the 61-seat council resulted in the centre-right Alliance of four parties (M, L, KD and C) plus two local parties (HP and DP) staying in power without a majority. The Alliance and local parties gained a seat since the 2014 election and maintains power. The three Red-Green parties (S, MP and V) are in opposition and the far right Sweden Democrats (SD) holds the balance of power but normally votes with the Alliance.

==Culture==
The municipality contains six public libraries, Södertörn University College and one of the campuses for Karolinska Institutet.

Kungens Kurva is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest shopping areas. It hosts, among other things, the largest IKEA store in the world, the largest cinema in the country, and a large shopping centre. In total, it generates a turnover of 6 billion Swedish kronor and has 15 million visitors per year. Mikael Akerfeldt from Opeth and song writer and pop artist Orup both grew up in Huddinge.

==Sports==
The most known sports club in Huddinge is the ice hockey club Huddinge IK, which has fostered a long line of well-known Swedish ice hockey players, such as Michael Nylander, Mattias Norström and Kent Johansson, and used to be a regular runner up in the Swedish second division and the qualifications for the Elitserien. Peter Forsberg also happened to make his debut as a senior player with his original club Modo Hockey, facing Huddinge away.

<text>Thornbury is a market town and civil parish in the South Gloucestershire unitary authority area of England, about north of Bristol. It had a population of 12,063 at the 2011 census, rising to 14,496 in the 2021 census. Thornbury is a Britain in Bloom award-winning town, with its own competition: Thornbury in Bloom. The earliest documentary evidence of a village at &quot;Thornbyrig&quot; dates from the end of the 9th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 noted a manor of &quot;Turneberie&quot; belonging to William the Conqueror’s consort, Matilda of Flanders, with 104 residents.

==History==
There is evidence of human activity in the Thornbury area in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, but evidence of the Roman presence is confined to the Thornbury hoard of 11,460 Roman coins dating from 260 to 348 CE, found in 2004 during the digging of a fishpond. The earliest documentary evidence of a village at &quot;Thornbyrig&quot; dates from the end of the 9th century. Domesday Book noted a manor of &quot;Turneberie&quot; belonging to William the Conqueror&#x27;s consort, Matilda of Flanders, with 104 residents.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, begun in the 12th century with later additions, is the oldest surviving building. The town charter was granted in 1252 by Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester and lord of the manor of Thornbury. (The charter&#x27;s 750th anniversary in 2002 was celebrated with a &quot;750&quot; flowerbed planted in Grovesend Road.) The town grew around the site of its cattle market. Thornbury lost its status as a borough in 19th-century local-government reforms, but in 1974 the parish council exercised its new right to designate itself a town council.

The ancient parish covered an area extending to the River Severn, including the detached area of Rangeworthy until 1866, when this became a separate civil parish. In 1894 the western part of Thornbury was detached to form the civil parish of Oldbury-on-Severn and the eastern part to create that of Falfield.

Thornbury Township, Pennsylvania, founded in 1687, was named after Thornbury, Gloucestershire, by George Pearce, whose wife Ann came from there. In 1765 Dr John Fewster of Thornbury presented a paper to the Medical Society of London entitled &quot;Cow Pox and its Ability to Prevent Smallpox&quot;. Fewster influenced his friend and colleague Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination.

Thornbury was once the terminus of a Midland Railway (later LMS) branch line from Yate on the Bristol to Gloucester main line, with intermediate stations at Iron Acton and Tytherington. It lost its passenger services in June 1944 but continued as a goods route, also serving quarries at Tytherington. The site of Thornbury railway station and the line have been redeveloped into a supermarket, a housing estate, a bypass road and a long footpath. Further relics can be seen at Tytherington Quarry to the east of the town. There are plans to reopen the line to Yate via Tytherington and Iron Acton and possibly restore services to Gloucester and Bristol.

Thornbury held a market in the high street and the market hall. This closed in the late 1990s and was partly replaced by a smaller one in a car park near the United Reformed Church. The older site has been redeveloped as a community centre called &quot;Turnberrie&#x27;s&quot;; the older community centre, at the Chantry in Castle Street, remains in active use. The old market hall is now a restaurant.

Thornbury&#x27;s coat of arms combines the arms of four families important to its history: the Attwells – Howard, Clare and Stafford. John Attwells bequeathed £499.99 for the establishment of a free school that merged with the grammar school in 1879. Their arms were later adopted as the badge for the grammar school. The other three families held the manor at Thornbury over several centuries, with the Latin motto &quot;Decus Sabrinae Vallis&quot; (Jewel of the Severn Vale).

==Geography==
Thornbury lies in the lower Severn Valley in South Gloucestershire. It includes Morton, which is split into Upper and Lower Morton, as areas of farmland to the north-east of Thornbury. There is a large farm shop in Upper Morton, while Lower Morton has several cattle farms.

==Politics==
Thornbury has belonged successively to the parliamentary constituencies of Thornbury (1885–1950), Stroud and Thornbury (1950–1955), Gloucestershire South (1955–1983), Northavon (1983–2010) and Thornbury and Yate (since 2010). The current member is Claire Young of the Liberal Democrats. Thornbury Town Hall, which is the home of Thornbury Town Council, served as a police station and a magistrates&#x27; court before becoming a municipal building.

==Amenities==
Thornbury has a high street, a shopping centre (St Mary&#x27;s Centre), two supermarkets and smaller shops. Its seven places of worship are St Mary&#x27;s Church, Christ the King (Anglican), the Catholic Church, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church, St Paul&#x27;s Church, and the Hackett and Thornbury Baptist churches. On the outskirts at Lower Morton stands an independent evangelical church: Morton Baptist Church.

The many pubs include the &quot;White Lion&quot; in the High Street, which won the Thornbury in Bloom award in 2003 and the Britain in Bloom award for Best Pub Display in 1999. Restaurants include one at Thornbury Castle and Ronnie&#x27;s of Thornbury itself.

Thornbury has a radio station, Thornbury Radio, which broadcasts on 105.1 and 107.5 FM, and online from its studio at 12 The Plain.

Thornbury is one of a handful of UK towns to have a social group for adults with autism or Asperger syndrome. South Glos Aspies formed in 2017 and meets weekly.

Thornbury market garden grows vegetables by sustainable natural methods and supplies them to the local area.

==Musical and drama groups==
The largest music and drama venues are the Armstrong Hall near the town centre, seating 350, and the adjacent Cossham Hall, seating 140. Performances also take place in church halls and occasionally in the leisure centre. Some local amateur groups are:
*Thornbury Musical Theatre Group (TMTG), performing at the Armstrong Hall, normally with a musical in October, a pantomime in the February school half-term, and a concert-style production in June. Rehearsals are held at Tytherington Village Hall. TMTG Web Page
*North Avon Youth Theatre (NYTC) perform an annual show at the Armstrong Hall in April.
*Octopus Thornbury, a drama group which produces a show in June each year, a charity show in October and a pantomime in January. rehearses and performs in Christ the King Church Hall. 
*Thornbury Area Music Trust (TAMT), a charitable music trust, runs music groups for those aged 4–18. On Saturday mornings the Thornbury Area Music Centre and Junior Music Centre meet at Marlwood School. They perform regularly at other local venues.
*The South Cotswold Youth Orchestra (SCYO) is for musicians of Grade 5 standard and above. It performs at least one concert per term in the area.

==Employment==
One of the biggest firms on the industrial estate in the south of the town is Essilor, which produces spectacle lenses.

==Major roads and streets==
*The B4061 loops off the A38 at Alveston, passes through the centre of the town and rejoins the A38 at Whitfield, so forming the main routes into the town from the north and south.
*Gillingstool and Grovesend Road form an easterly link from the centre to the A38.
*The High Street is on the edge of the town to the west.
*The Plain is at the north end of the High Street, notable for the pump in the middle of the road.
*Castle Street heads north from the Plain to Thornbury Castle and St Mary&#x27;s Church; it passes several older buildings including The Chantry, which is now used by the community association (TDCA).
*Midland Way and Morton Way are modern additions forming a roughly semi-circular eastern boundary to the town. They allow HGVs headed for the industrial estate to avoid the centre.

==Tourist sights==

A tourist information centre operates on weekdays from the Town Hall in the High Street.

===Thornbury castle===

One of town&#x27;s notable features is its castle, a Tudor structure begun in 1511 as a home for Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham. The two intricate redbrick chimneys, built in 1514, resemble those found at Hampton Court Palace. Cardinal Wolsey had the Duke beheaded for treason in 1521, after which the castle was confiscated by King Henry VIII, who himself stayed there for ten days in 1535 with Anne Boleyn.

Thornbury Castle fell into disrepair after the English Civil War, but was renovated in 1824 by the Howard Family. It now serves as a 27-room hotel and restaurant.

===Parish church===

Construction of the Anglican Church of Saint Mary the Virgin started in 1340, with major additions in 1500, 1848 and 1988. It remains in use for regular worship, baptisms, confirmations, marriages, funerals and remembrance services. It also hosts the local primary school (St Mary&#x27;s CEVA Primary) for their seasonal celebrations, such as Harvest, Christmas and Easter. The church is the resting place, according to his will, of the entrails of Jasper Tudor, uncle and mentor to the young Henry Tudor, later Henry VII of England. The rest of his remains were buried in Keynsham Abbey, Somerset, which did not survive the dissolution of the monasteries under Jasper&#x27;s great-nephew Henry VIII of England. The church is a Grade I listed building.

===Town pump===

The town pump on a small island at the bottom of the High Street shows a hand pointing &quot;To Gloucester&quot;. The original pump was removed in 1924 as a road hazard by the council. The new one built in 1984 was temporarily painted gold to celebrate the Golden Jubilee in 2002. It is usually adorned with flowers and birthday greetings.

===Walks and scenery===
A footpath called Streamside Walk starts at Gillingstool Primary School, passes over several roads and bridges, continues past Thornbury Hospital and Manorbrook Primary School, and on to the north of Thornbury, where the stream leaves the town. Another stream runs through the north-east of Thornbury and emerges at an old mill.

Although the station building has been demolished, the old railway line serves as a footpath. It was laid out in the 1990s to support new housing and industrial developments, previously having been grassed over and neglected. Starting from the industrial estates it follows the route of the streets of Streamleaze and Avon Way, ending near a roundabout at the top of Avon Way.

Created by Thornbury and District Heritage Trust as a Millennium project, the &quot;heritage trail&quot; encompasses the town&#x27;s historic buildings. There are 40 way-markers indicating the route, which starts outside the town hall.

===Sports and leisure===
Mundy Playing Fields, donated by Mrs Violet Mundy in 1937, include a children&#x27;s play area and sports ground. Nearby are Thornbury Golf Club, Thornbury Leisure Centre, Thornbury Lawn Tennis Club and a skate park. South Thornbury has a children&#x27;s play area. There are green spaces around the town. Thornbury community garden was set up near Gillingstool School, but it has closed due to housing development. A replacement community garden is envisaged next to the new Community Centre.

Thornbury RFC plays in the South West 1 League. Though a Thornbury club, its ground lies in Rockhampton on the outskirts.

Thornbury Town FC is Thornbury&#x27;s main football club. The exact formation date is uncertain, but football was being played in the town in 1896 and there was a Thornbury Town Club in 1898. The youth section, providing for children from six years old and up, was formed in 1990 as a separate club (Thornbury Falcons). In 2010 the two clubs merged as a new Thornbury Town FC. The First Team plays in the Hellenic League Premier Division, which is in the ninth tier in the English football league. Home games are played at the Mundy Playing Fields, with their youth teams playing in various locations around Thornbury. In 2016, an area of land adjacent to the Mundy Playing Fields, known as Poulterbrook, was converted into two purpose-built youth football pitches, as well as allotments for the local community.

Real Thornbury FC plays in the Bristol Premier Combination Premier One, i.e. tier 13 in the English football league. It was set up in 2007 and became an FA-affiliated team in 2009 in the Bristol and District League. the club plays at Oaklands Park in Almondsbury, which has hosted several clubs, including Winterbourne United and Almondsbury Town, both of which have since dissolved.

===Other attractions===
These include Filnore Woods, Armstrong and Cossham Halls and Thornbury Museum. A heritage trail offers information signs about places of interest, starting from the town hall (once the police station and magistrates&#x27; court) and now home to the Town Council. The MacLaine Memorial Fountain recalls Lieutenant Hector MacLaine, a local man who helped to protect the British in India from the Russians and Afghans in 1880.

===Twinned===
Thornbury is twinned with Bockenem in Germany.

==Education==
The Castle School is Thornbury&#x27;s secondary school. The former Thornbury Grammar School buildings in Gloucester Road are now its sixth-form centre. Thornbury Grammar School moved to new buildings in neighbouring Alveston in 1972, when it received its first comprehensive school intake and was renamed Marlwood School.

Gillingstool Primary School dates from 1862 and is known for its school bell. The school was rebuilt in a project that began in spring 2009. Its Victorian buildings are being retained, as is its mission as a special school.

St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, founded in 1839, recently marked its 175th anniversary with events that included a Victorian Week, where children dressed up in period dress, and planted celebratory daffodils. Other schools include Crossways Infant and Junior schools, Christ the King Roman Catholic Primary School, Manorbrook Primary School, New Siblands Special School and the Sheiling School (an independent special school, part of the Camphill Movement). John Attwells&#x27;s Free School existed in the 19th century. A plaque about it can be seen on a shop in St Mary&#x27;s Shopping Centre.

== Transport ==
The T1 Bristol–Thornbury bus route offers regular services to Bristol.

==In popular culture==
The shop front of Wildings (formerly Worthington&#x27;s) clothing shop was used in the &quot;Two Ronnies&quot; serial sketch, &quot;The Worm That Turned&quot;. The nearby nuclear power station at Oldbury-on-Severn, Tytherington quarry and Stokefield Close were all used as locations for the 1976 four-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;. The Castle School, Thornbury was used for an episode of &quot;Casualty&quot; broadcast on 2 May 2009.

<doc id="128307" wikidata="Q301259" url="?curid=128307" title="Järfälla Municipality">
<text>Järfälla Municipality () is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden, and is considered a suburb of Stockholm. Its seat is located in Jakobsberg, part of the Stockholm urban area.

Järfälla has not been amalgamated with other municipalities in the two local government reforms carried out during the 20th century. The Stäket area in the north was, however, added in 1952.

It is located about 20 km north of Stockholm, with a part situated by the shore of Lake Mälaren. It takes about 20 minutes to reach downtown Stockholm by Stockholm commuter rail.

== History ==
Järfälla traces its history to the Stone Age and has some ruins from that time. After being Christianized in the 11th century, a church was built around the year 1200 that still stands today. Järfälla continued to be of some importance in the Middle Ages as several important roads went through it. Furthermore, the centre of the hundred was located within the boundaries of the municipality from 1675 to 1905

Its coat of arms, which depicts a golden lamb carrying an archbishop&#x27;s cross, can be traced from 1568, but was created in 1955. They may symbolize that Järfälla is situated on the road from the capital Stockholm to the seat of the archbishop in the nearby city of Uppsala.

The main population expansion came in the 1930s and 1940s, when many residential houses were built in the seat Jakobsberg for middle-class families commuting to Stockholm.

== Public transportation ==
The municipality is served by the Stockholm public transport system. There are three Stockholm commuter rail stations, Barkarby, Jakobsberg and Kallhäll, as well as a bus network. As part of a larger plan for the Stockholm region, Barkarby station and Barkarbystaden will get metro stations, scheduled to open in 2026. The representatives for the municipalities signed the deal in January 2014, and on 3 March 2014 Järfälla municipal council made the formal decision to fulfill their part of the deal.

==Demography==
===2022 by district===
This is a demographic table based on Järfälla Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

<doc id="128308" wikidata="Q3120654" url="?curid=128308" title="Lidingö Municipality">
<text>Lidingö Municipality (&quot;Lidingö kommun&quot; semi-officially named as &quot;Lidingö stad&quot;) is a municipality east of Stockholm in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located on the island of Lidingö. The municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm.

It is chiefly located on the island Lidingö, but also incorporates a few smaller islands in the surroundings, most notably the Fjäderholmarna islands within the Stockholm archipelago.

Being an island municipality it has not been amalgamated with any other entities. The small island of Tranholmen has, however, been transferred to Danderyd Municipality. The rural municipality was made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) in 1910, a city in 1926 and a unitary municipality in 1971.

The municipality always refers to itself as &quot;Lidingö stad&quot; (&quot;the City of Lidingö&quot;). This was a decision taken by the municipal assembly (kommunfullmäktige) in 1992.

Raoul Wallenberg, Righteous Among the Nations, was born in Lidingö on 4 August 1912.

== Geography ==

The island Lidingö is connected to the city of Stockholm by the two bridges of Lidingöbron. One is for cars and one for the Lidingöbanan suburban tramway and pedestrians. The bridges lead directly to Ropsten, a station on the Stockholm Metro.

Lidingö is for statistical purposes divided into three localities: Lidingö, Brevik and Sticklinge udde. Because of the strait Lilla Värtan separating the island Lidingö from central Stockholm, Lidingö statistically is not counted as a part of Stockholm.

== History ==
Lidingö traces its history to at least 600 BC, from when remains have been found. According to legend, Lidingö was a place where the Vikings would gather before setting sails to eastern areas, however no proof have been found to confirm that theory. When the city arms was to be chosen in 1928 a Viking ship became the motif, in the colors of the Swedish flag. Lidingö was first mentioned in writing in 1328, called &quot;Lydhingö&quot; when the entire island and the farms were owned by Bo Johnsson Grip. On a map from 1661 the island is called &quot;Lijdingeöö&quot;.

== Economy ==

The island itself hosts very few industries, a relatively well-known one being AGA AB, which started production on the island in 1912.

Much of the populated land area is built with one-family houses; a total of 36% of the population, or 17,020 people (2006), live in such houses and, to a large extent, commute to work in Stockholm or other municipalities of Greater Stockholm.

There are also quite a number of conference mansions in the northern parts of the island, providing a part of the industry of Lidingö.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===2022 population by district===
This is a demographic table based on Lidingö Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 35,877 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 36.8% voted for the left coalition and 62.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

===Income and Education===
Lidingö is one of the wealthiest municipalities in Sweden, with the fourth highest median income per capita. The share of highly educated persons, according to Statistics Sweden&#x27;s definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer, is 46.0% – also the fourth highest in the country.

===Residents with a foreign background ===
On 31 December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 10 065, or 21.33% of the population (47 185 on 31 December 2017). On 31 December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 6 422, or 15.59% of the population (41 192 on 31 December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 47 185 residents in Lidingö, of which 8 265 people (17.52%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

== Politics ==
The island&#x27;s politics has traditionally been dominated by the centre-right Moderate Party. They currently run the municipality in coalition with the Christian Democrats and with the Lidingö Party.

Chairman of the municipal executive board is Anna Rheyneuclaudes Kihlman from the Moderate Party.

=== Election results ===
==Major sporting events==
*Lidingöloppet, cross-country running, 30 km.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — sister cities===
In 1942, Lidingö created a committee to provide support for the people in Lohja (Swedish: Lojo) in the southern part of Finland who suffered badly during World War II. An orphanage was opened in Lidingö and money was collected and sent to Lohja. The orphanage was closed in 1943 as most of the children then had returned to Finland. The money that was left over was used to provide food for the children in Lohja. Lidingö and Lohja still maintain a close relationship.

Another sister city is Alameda, California. The initiative came from Alameda in 1959 and was part of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s people-to-people-movement. The purpose was to develop better understanding between people from different countries after World War II. Both Alameda and Lidingö are islands with a bridge connecting them to a big city.

As the Baltic countries were liberated from the Soviet Union in 1990-1991, Lidingö looked for a new sister city in the area. Saldus in Latvia was selected. During the years, a number of environmental, cultural and other projects have been accomplished.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lidingö made a sister city deal in 2023 with Slawuta in Ukraine.

<text>Nacka Municipality (&quot;Nacka kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east-central Sweden. Its seat is located at Nacka. The municipality is situated just east of the capital Stockholm and the western parts are considered a suburban part of the city of Stockholm.

The present municipality was created in 1971 when the &quot;City of Nacka&quot; (itself instituted in 1949) was amalgamated with &quot;Saltsjöbaden&quot; (itself detached from &quot;old&quot; Nacka in 1909) and &quot;Boo&quot;.

== Geography ==
The municipality is situated in two historical provinces (&quot;landskap&quot;), Uppland and Södermanland, but in one administrative county (&quot;län&quot;), Stockholm County.

The western densely built-up area of Nacka Municipality is a contiguous part of the city of Stockholm. About 50,000 of the municipality&#x27;s total population live there.

There are also some more localities in the municipality. The larger ones are: Boo, Fisksätra, Saltsjöbaden, Skuru and Älta.

== History ==

The area has been populated since the first mountaintops emerged as islands from the sea after the end of the last ice age, during the Mesolithic. During the Viking Age (800 – 1100 AD), the area has been estimated to have been populated by 100 people. They were living by farming and fishing.

A Danish sailing description from the end of the 13th century describes the area as a transportation region. The water roads were easier to use than the land roads and this was also the main road into the capital Stockholm. Due to these circumstances there were plenty of restaurants along the shores to cater to the travelers. An article by Gunnar Ahlberg describes 24 different outlets and their busy service. In the 18th century the restaurants closer to the city were transformed from shabby small places to more sophisticated establishments. Here came not only travelers but also the citizens of Stockholm for a summer excursion. Many of the artists of the times have documented these excursions in drawings as well as songs.

During the wintertime the waterways changes somewhat and instead of taking the sea way the travelers crossed the many lakes with sleighs in order to reach Stockholm.

The municipality&#x27;s name harks back to a 16th-century industrial operation established by the Crown at Nacka farmstead where conditions for water mills are good. That spot is now, however, not densely populated, and the municipal seat is on land that once belonged to Järla farmstead on the other side of Lake Järla.

One of many battles during the Great Northern War took place in the most eastern part of Nacka. In 1719, Russian forces burned and raided the eastern coast of Sweden. Several cities were attacked and almost all buildings in the archipelago of Stockholm were burned. On their way to Stockholm greatly outnumbered Swedish forces managed to fight off the attacking Russians at the battle of Stäket.

=== 20th century ===
The municipality has had a continuous population increase since the 1960s, almost doubling the population. Today it is the third most populous municipality in Stockholm County, after Stockholm Municipality and Huddinge Municipality - and the 20th in Sweden. Due to massive increase in housing supply the population is predicted to grow at an annual rate of more the 3% by the year 2020.

Nacka became the location of an experiment in psychiatry in the 1970s, initiated by psychiatrist Bengt Bengtsson. It allowed the inhabitants a local access to psychotherapeutic methods for preventive purposes. The role model was the Community Mental Health system developed in the U.S. The system has since been implemented in other municipalities.

The industry in Nacka is mainly of service nature. Nacka has an extensive commuting traffic to Stockholm City, and few major companies are located in Nacka itself.

== Nature ==
Nacka has (in 2015) 12 nature reserves, and two large recreational nature areas, all with a varied landscape of pine forests, swamps and lakes. The largest nature reserve is Nackareservatet with an area of approximately 730 hectare.

==Demographics==

<doc id="128310" wikidata="Q214048" url="?curid=128310" title="Norrtälje Municipality">
<text>Norrtälje Municipality (&quot;Norrtälje kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Norrtälje.

It is the largest and northernmost municipality of Stockholm County and was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of several former municipalities. There are 25 original local government units (as of 1863) combined in the present municipality. Since the municipality was formed in 1971, the population has grown almost every year. With the exception of the mandate period 2014–2018, Norrtälje has had a non-socialistic municipal government since 2010.

Many of the houses in Norrtälje municipality are summer cottages, only inhabited during summertime. This is due to its geographical location by the Stockholm archipelago, which makes it popular among Stockholmers and tourists. Norrtälje municipality has more than 13 000 islands.

===Riksdag===

This table lists the national results since the 1972 Swedish municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats from 1988 to 1998 were not published by the SCB at a municipal level due to the party&#x27;s small size nationally at the time.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Nykvarn Municipality (&quot;Nykvarns kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the town of Nykvarn.

Nykvarn is a young municipality, and is the result of the splitting of Södertälje Municipality in 1999. Nykvarn can be regarded as a totally new municipality, because there was never before an entity with that territory or that name.

The municipality has a significant population increase in the summer thanks to tourism.

Nykvarn is located between the two cities Södertälje and Strängnäs, and many citizens of Nykvarn work in either.

Archeological finds show the area to have been inhabited for about 5,000 years, similar to its neighbouring municipalities around Lake Mälaren.

Besides graves from the Stone Age, there is also an interesting runestone that can be visited that is listed in the Rundata catalog as Sö 338. It currently resides in the Turinge church, a church that has a history dating back to around the year 1100. This runestone has a very long inscription.

A newer sight is the Taxinge-Näsby Castle, which was begun sometime in or before the 14th century, by Bo Jonsson Grip. The castle has its current facade in the empire style from 1813. Many celebrities have during the centuries visited or stayed at the castle, including Carl Michael Bellman in the 18th century and August Strindberg in the 19th century.

<text>Sollentuna Municipality ( ) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east-central Sweden, north of Stockholm. Its seat of local government is located in Tureberg, which is a part of Sollentuna urban area. 

== Geography ==
Sollentuna borders the municipalities of Solna, Sundbyberg, Stockholm, Järfälla, Upplands Väsby, Täby and Danderyd in clockwise order starting to the south.

=== Localities and districts ===
Since 1995, the bulk of the built-up area of the municipality has been statistically included in the multimunicipal city of Stockholm. A few houses on the eastern border (with about 10 inhabitants) are in Täby urban area. Sjöberg constitutes a locality of its own.

The municipality is subdivided into the following districts according to population as of 31 December 2021:

*Tureberg, 19,127 inhabitants
*Rotebro, 8,824 inhabitants
*Helenelund, 12,678 inhabitants
*Edsberg, 12,338 inhabitants
*Viby, 5,748 inhabitants
*Sjöberg, 4,705 inhabitants
*Häggvik, 5,518 inhabitants
*Norrviken, 3,349 inhabitants
*Vaxmora, 2,635 inhabitants
*Järvafältet, 186 inhabitants
*Total: 75,108

===Lakes===

Central to the landscape of Sollentuna are the rather big lakes Norrviken and Edsviken—the latter a bay of the Baltic Sea.

Edsviken and Norrviken are popular lakes for ice tour skating during the winter. The municipality plows a 15 km long skating track on Norrviken. Note that Norrviken is also the name of a district at the western shore of the Norrviken lake.

Other lakes: 
*Fjäturen
*Ravalen
*Rösjön
*Väsjön
*Översjön
*Snuggan
* Djupan

==History==
Sollentuna municipality was founded in conjunction with the reform of local government in Sweden in 1863. However, its boundaries are almost equivalent to those of Sollentuna Parish, which dates back to the 12th century. Well into the 20th century, Sollentuna was a predominantly rural area.

Modern Sollentuna evolved around the railway between Uppsala and Stockholm, inaugurated in 1866. Five of the eight districts that make up the municipality today correspond to railway stations, now operated by Stockholm commuter rail system. From south to north: Helenelund, Tureberg (railway station is Sollentuna Station), Häggvik, Norrviken and Rotebro. Viby is an extension of Norrviken and the two remaining districts— Edsberg and Sjöberg—are found along the road to Danderyd. Other roads into Sollentuna includes the road from Kallhäll to Rotebro and the E 4 motorway that approximates the same route as the railway.

Sollentuna received the title of a merchant town (&quot;köping&quot;) in 1944. Köping status was made obsolete by the municipal reform of 1971.

<text>Sundbyberg Municipality ( or &quot;Sundbybergs stad&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden, just north of the capital Stockholm. Sundbyberg is wholly within the Stockholm urban area and has a 100% urban population.

Sundbyberg was detached from Bromma (which since 1916 is in Stockholm Municipality) in 1888 as a market town (&quot;köping&quot;). It got the title of a city in 1927. In 1949 parts of Solna Municipality and Spånga Municipality (when the rest of Spånga was amalgamated into Stockholm) were added. A proposed merger with Solna in 1971 was never implemented, making Sundbyberg, with an area of , the smallest municipality in Sweden, but also the most densely populated. The municipality prefers to call itself a &quot;city&quot;, which, however, has no legal significance.

==History==
Sundbyberg was for a long time only an area of small agriculture value and most of all used as a place to spend summer for rich families in the city. In 1863 almost the entire area was bought by Anders Petter Löfström, including Duvbo Estate, who began building houses there. In 1870 the first industrial plot was sold and from there the town did expand with railroad, houses, industries and community services of all kind. A. P. Löfström also donated to the municipality, all land for roads, streets, parks, school, church and other public areas.
In 1888 Sundbyberg municipality was formed with 1,133 inhabitants, splitting off from Bromma. At the time the municipality only constituted Central Sundbyberg and the undeveloped Storskogen. Sundbyberg was known in its early years for its beer, its spirited political discourses, its muddy streets, and the danger of the streets at night (nowadays the crime-hit areas are Hallonbergen and Rissne instead). Sales of land was aimed at workers and industry, and the relative lack of public services caused a strong cooperative spirit to form. Suburbs bordering Sundbyberg were also built – Lilla Alby and Mariehäll in the 1880s and Duvbo around 1900. While trains stopped in Sundbyberg, they did so at a low frequency, and most commuters used the steam boat. In 1910 a tram line was built from Stockholm and Råsunda to the municipal border, and then into Sundbyberg in 1928, running until 1959.

A new city plan was established in 1941, prescribing the construction of &quot;lamellhus&quot;, rectangular multi-residential buildings with typically four floors, leading to the demolishment of most of the wooden houses in Sundbyberg in the 1940s, while brick or concrete buildings were kept. Many industrial buildings were converted to residential use at the same time. Rising housing prices led to a more densely built suburb than envisioned in the city plan, as well as cause Sundbyberg to rapidly lose its industrial character.

In 1946 Sundbyberg municipality, which by then had 15,000 inhabitants, bought Storskogen, with the first homes going up there in 1952. In 1949 Spånga municipality was split between neighbouring municipalities, giving Duvbo, Ursvik and some other land to Sundbyberg. Lilla Alby was transferred from Solna municipality to Sundbyberg at the same time. Since the 1950s when Storskogen was built, Sundbyberg has expanded one district each decade, with Ör built in the 1960s, Hallonbergen and its metro line (which also serves Storskogen and Ör) in the 1970s, Rissne and its metro line (which also serves Central Sundbyberg and Lilla Alby) in the 1980s, Brotorp and Stora Ursvik in the 2000s.

==Economy==
The roughly 50,000 inhabitants live in about 20,000 households. The industrial policy of the municipality is to provide one job opportunity for every household, with there being around 23,000 jobs in the municipality (in 2015). So unlike other municipalities in Metropolitan Stockholm, Sundbyberg is not a bedroom suburb wherefrom people commute to Stockholm, but also a place commuted to from outside. In total, 19,000 commuters travel in each direction to or from Sundbyberg every day (in 2014). The unemployment rate in Sundbyberg closely tracks the average for Stockholm County and is generally lower than the Swedish average.

In the first half of its existence, Sundbyberg saw a strong expansion of industrial activity, and most residents were industrial workers, but in the 1940s the industry almost entirely disappeared from Sundbyberg. By the 1970s warehouses and IT businesses had established themselves instead, and an attempt to establish industry in Hallonbergen had failed due to high rental costs. Today the service sector dominates, with Sundbyberg having become a place with office workers, as a result of Sundbyberg becoming more central as Stockholm has expanded and public transport has been strengthened. The most common professions for people working in Sundbyberg are (in order from most employed): IT developer, banker, human relations, secretary, business seller/purchaser, accountant, retail clerk, truck/bus driver, teacher, tax collector. There are office districts in Central Sundbyberg (Sundbyberg centrum and Allén), Rissne (Ursviks Entré) and Hallonbergen (Sundby Park). In 2015 Sundbyberg centrum offices had rents (2,100 kr/m2/year) similar to Kista, Alvik and the adjacent Solna Business Park, while in Allén they a bit lower and similar to Lidingö Centrum and the nearby Solna Strand, and Ursviks Entré and Sundby Park both have further lower office rents similar to Farsta and Tyresö Centrum. 

Unusually for Stockholm suburbs, Sundbyberg has a proper town centre, with plenty of nice shops in the Central Sundbyberg area, which makes the little city a bit independent. There are also smaller concentrations of stores elsewhere in the municipality, such as by the Rissne and Hallonbergen metro stations. The proximity of the shopping centres Bromma Blocks (1 km away) and Mall of Scandinavia (2 km away) has hindered establishment of a shopping centre in Central Sundbyberg. Businesses in Hallonbergen suffer from getting few customers from elsewhere due to the area&#x27;s poor reputation, whereas the area&#x27;s locals don&#x27;t mind going elsewhere, e.g. to cafés in Central Sundbyberg.

===By district===
==Public transport==

Sundbyberg is well served by the Stockholm public transport system. There are several metro stations as well as one train station and plenty of bus routes. Even some main line trains call at Sundbyberg. The Tvärbanan light rail service was extended from Sickla Udde via Alvik to Solna centrum in October 2013. The line runs through Central Sundbyberg with tracks laid in the street and has two stops within the municipality. Construction of a northern light railway branch from Ulvsunda to Kista that will pass through Rissne and Stora Ursvik started in 2018.

<text>Södertälje Municipality (&quot;Södertälje kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Södertälje.

It borders to Lake Mälaren in the north and the Baltic Sea in the south, and within the Stockholm County to Nykvarn Municipality and Salem Municipality and also border Södermanland County and its municipals Gnesta and Trosa.

The municipality was created 1967–1971 through the amalgamation of the former &quot;City of Södertälje&quot; with large rural and suburban areas surrounding it. In 1999, it was split when a new entity, Nykvarn Municipality, was detached from Södertälje Municipality.

==Economy==
Two big industries dominate Södertälje. Scania AB is a world leading manufacturer of trucks and busses and employed over 9,000 people. AstraZeneca is an international manufacturer of drugs (medicine) employing over 3,000 people. The municipal Södertälje itself employs over 5,600 people including teachers and people working with elderly people.

Södertälje has a canal, Södertälje Canal, that is very important for the ships who want to reach the big lake Mälaren from the Baltic Sea.

==Demography==
Södertälje has the fifth largest number of Finnish-speaking Sweden Finns in Sweden: 11,000, or around 13 per cent of the city population. Thus, taken together, Finns and an estimated 120,000 Assyrians in Sweden and account for 40 per cent of the inhabitants of the city.

===2022 population by district===
This is a demographic table based on Södertälje Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 67,079 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 44.9% voted for the left coalition and 53.4% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the local results of the Riksdag elections since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

==Notable people==
* Björn Borg, former tennis player
* Johan Edlund, singer and leader of the bands Tiamat and Lucyfire
* Tom Wandell, NHL Player

<text>Tyresö Municipality (&quot;Tyresö kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden on the coast of the Baltic Sea.

Most of Tyresö Municipality lies within the Stockholm urban area.

==History==
The first humans arrived in what today is Tyresö Municipality somewhere around the 3rd millennium BC. It would not be until about the 7th century that permanent settlements would start appearing though. There are some graves and other remnants left from this prehistoric time.

The Tyresö estate has its origins in the 14th century. During the 17th century the estate was at its largest, covering nearly the entire current area of the municipality. The Tyresö Palace and Tyresö Church were built during this century, with the palace completed in 1636 and the church in 1640.

Tyresö was an important industrial centre in the Stockholm region between the 16th and 19th centuries, thanks to the watermills that could be built on the streams between the lakes. The waterwheels in the municipal arms represent the three hydropower facilities at Nyfors, Uddby and Follbrinksströmmen. The industries included rolling mills, gristmills, forges, paper mills, sawmills, and a brickworks. None of the watermills are left today. The Uddby mill burned down in 1895, and a hydroelectric power plant was built in its place, which still stands today and is the only such plant in the Stockholm area.

During the early 20th century, the large land area of the Tyresö estate began to be divided into lots, and summer cottages began to be built. Some quite luxurious ones were built in the Brevik area. The rate of construction increased rapidly in the early decades of the century. From the 1950s onwards, the summer cottages began to be converted into year-round dwellings at a rapid pace.

From the 1950s onwards, Bollmora experienced a huge expansion rate, especially after the legislation Lex Bollmora in 1959 which allowed municipal real estate companies to operate in other municipalities than their own. A municipal centre formed in Bollmora, &quot;Bollmora Centrum&quot;, which was inaugurated in 1965. The Million Programme put its distinctive print on Tyresö as well, especially Bollmora: many of the apartment building areas come from that programme.

During the expansive phase from the 1950s onwards, the population of Tyresö has grown from about 5,000 to just over 44,000 at present.

The Bollmora Centrum was rebuilt in the early 1990s to be an enclosed shopping centre, and renamed Tyresö Centrum.

In August 1999 a large wildfire destroyed about 10% of the Tyresta National Park.

==Subdivisions==
There are no administrative subdivisions of Tyresö Municipality, but there are some other formal and less formal subdivisions.

===Districts===
There are three main districts in Tyresö. This is a kind of everyday reference subdivision to refer to the different main parts of the municipality.
*Bollmora in the northwest – consisting of apartment buildings of about 2–8 stories high, terraced houses and detached houses and some industrial areas. The municipal centre, Tyresö centre, is located here.
