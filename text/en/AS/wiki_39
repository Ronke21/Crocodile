An AT&amp;T microwave radio relay tower (now abandoned) once provided several jobs for area residents. It remains standing (with the ear-shaped antennas now removed) a mile east of the village along U.S. Route 36. Ohio Bell operated the facility prior to the divestiture of the AT&amp;T-owned Bell System in the 1980s. AT&amp;T continued to operate the tower until the advent of fiber-optic cables and satellites which led to the replacement for the underground coaxial cable network and the use of the 318-foot steel structure now sitting vacant within the eastern Miami County farm fields.

<text>Piqua ( ) is a city in Miami County, Ohio, United States, along the Great Miami River. The population was 20,354 at the 2020 census. Located north of Dayton, it is part of the Dayton metropolitan area.

==History==
===Etymology===
The word &#x27;Piqua&#x27; is believed to be derived from a Shawnee language phrase: &quot;Othath-He-Waugh-Pe-Qua,&quot; translated as &quot;He has risen from the ashes,&quot; related to a legend of the people. It became associated with the &quot;Pekowi&quot;, one of the five divisions of the Shawnee people, who were eventually known as the Piqua.

===Early settlements===

In 1749, Fort Pickawillany was constructed by the British to protect their trading post at a Miami village of the same name. It was located at the confluence of Loramie Creek and the Great Miami River.

In 1752, Charles de Langlade, an Odawa war chief of partial French Canadian descent, attacked the fort. He led more than 240 Odawa and Ojibwe warriors allied with French forces against the British and the Miami village in the Battle of Pickawillany. The Miami chief and a British trader were killed in the conflict.

After the battle, the British and Miami abandoned this site. The Miami rebuilt Pickawillany, and Piqua later developed near their village. The British soon took over the area after defeating the French in the French and Indian War.

Until 1780, Piqua had been the capital town of the Shawnee located on the Mad River about 23 miles southeast of the modern town (near Springfield). That year, an expedition by Gen. George Rogers Clark culminated in the Battle of Piqua, after which the town and surrounding fields were burned. The Shawnee relocated north and west to the Great Miami River. Piqua was settled as two separate Shawnee villages late in 1780, known as Upper Piqua and Lower Piqua.

In 1790, General Harmar found the site on the Great Miami River abandoned and in ruins, as did General Wayne in 1794.

As Gen. Anthony Wayne&#x27;s Legion was returning to Greenville via Loramie&#x27;s trading post and Piqua at the termination of their Indian Country campaign in fall 1794, Wayne wrote a letter to Henry Knox dated October 17, 1794, in which he recommended that forts be built at those two locations as waystations along the Miami River. A detachment of Wayne&#x27;s forces from Greenville built or repaired a small fort and supply depot named Fort Piqua in Upper Piqua on the same site as the (later) farm of Col. John Johnston in winter 1794–95. Capt. J.N. Visher was made commander of the garrison. The fort was garrisoned through 1794 and 1795, and abandoned after the signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.

By 1795, most of Ohio&#x27;s Shawnee had moved to Missouri and those that remained migrated north to the Auglaize - the southwestern Indian towns were no more. Piqua itself was well below the Greenville Treaty line and would remain abandoned until white settlers arrived.

===Modern settlement and incorporation===

The first European settlers arrived in 1798, after the signing of the Treaty of Greenville ending the Northwest Indian War and opening much of Ohio to settlement. In 1807 the village, consisting of seven houses, was surveyed by Armstrong Brandon, a soldier under Gen. Anthony Wayne, and named Washington. It was about a mile southwest of the old Indian villages of Piqua.

By 1816, the Shawnee village of Piqua had been long abandoned; the state legislature, acting on citizen petition, changed the name of Washington village to Piqua. Piqua was incorporated as a town by the Ohio General Assembly in 1823.

During the War of 1812, Piqua was a waystation for men and supplies moving north. In 1819, a land office was established in Piqua which facilitated its growth.

Piqua developed along with construction of the Miami and Erie Canal between 1825 and 1845.

===Rossville===
Rossville, Ohio was the first free-black enclave in the region. Virginia planter John Randolph of Roanoke, who served as a U.S. representative and senator, arranged for the emancipation of his nearly 400 slaves in his will of 1833. He also provided money for his executor to relocate the freedmen to the free state of Ohio, and to buy land and supplies to help them establish a settlement. The will was challenged but in 1846, his 383 slaves gained their freedom. Most of these freedmen settled in Rumley, Ohio. Some eventually founded Rossville and an associated cemetery, known as the African Jackson Cemetery. These are located on the northeast side of the Great Miami River; they may be accessed by nearby North County Road 25-A. The community has since been incorporated into Piqua.

===1913 flood===

Piqua was one of the cities that suffered severe flooding during the Great Dayton Flood of 1913. Piqua is nestled in a sweeping &quot;S&quot; bend of the Great Miami River and experienced regular flooding before the Great Flood of 1913.

On March 22, 1913, a moderate storm moved down the St. Lawrence River basin into the Ohio River basin, with enough rain to moisten the soil upriver from the Miami River and its tributaries. The soil in that upper region is predominantly clayey glacial till, transitioning to mostly Loamy glacial till. Starting on March 23, 1913, rain began to fall for five days. The heaviest rainfall occurred on March 25 with anywhere from 2” in the southeast corner of Ohio to 5” in the area between Piqua and Troy. All together, the total amount of precipitation for this five day period was recorded from 5” in the southeast of Ohio to 11” in the swatch between Piqua and Troy.
The flood waters came with such speed and force as to move homes off their foundations, depositing untold amounts of mud in others and claiming forty-nine lives in Piqua and neighboring Rossville alone. In places, streets were damaged or washed out to varying degrees of severity. Public utilities (gas, sewer and water) were hampered to provide services, due to mud clogging up the pipes. The estimated property damage/loss in Piqua reached $1,000,000 ($26.2M in present-day dollars), excluding public utilities and farm losses. The Ohio and Erie Canal, which for 81 years had served as an important connection point from Ohio to the East Coast, was permanently closed to commercial traffic because of extensive flood damage.

===Atomic City===
Piqua was home to the first municipally operated nuclear power plant, the Piqua Nuclear Generating Station. The facility was built and operated between 1963 and 1966 as a demonstration project by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The Atomic Energy Commission bought out the contract with the City of Piqua in order to terminate the operations early, citing higher-priority needs for manpower and funding, lack of programmatic interest, and technical problems.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Great Miami River runs through Piqua. The area at the south end of town on the east side of the river is known as Shawnee.

==Economy==

The city of Piqua is the home of Hartzell Propeller, a producer of small aircraft propellers. Evenflo (formerly Questor Juvenile Furniture) is the leading manufacturer of infant and toddler car seats, and has become one of Piqua&#x27;s leading employers and industries.

In the late 1890s, Southwest Ohio was the heart of the US flaxseed growing area. There were some 13 linseed oil mills in Piqua, where the flaxseed was &quot;crushed&quot; to extract the vegetable oil, named linseed oil. The flax fiber was used to make both cloth and paper. The oil had a variety of industrial uses. &quot;Linoleum&quot; is a manufactured flooring product for which linseed oil is the binder. One of the vegetable oil mills in Piqua burned down in the 1890s, a common fate for wooden buildings soaked with vegetable oil. Its owner, American Linseed Oil Company, dispatched Alfred Willard French, their Chief Engineer, from Brooklyn, New York, to organize and supervise the rebuilding of the oil mill.

During the rebuilding of the mill, French included a machine he had invented and patented in 1898, a &quot;cake trimmer&quot;, and purchased the most modern equipment then available. He met the leading citizens of Piqua. They were impressed with French, who had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in three years, and had entrepreneurial spirit. They decided to invest in a new company he wanted to start. The French Oil Mill Machinery Company was founded May 25, 1900, with French as president, to make &quot;improved oil mill machinery&quot;. By 1905 the company was exporting its patented and rugged vegetable oil mill extraction machinery all around the world. Today, the company has customers in over 80 countries, still serving the vegetable oil extraction market (to press such seeds as soybeans, cottonseed, rapeseed, canola, and many others). In addition, the company is a world leader in synthetic rubber dewatering and drying machinery, and in hydraulic molding presses for rubber, thermoplastic and composite materials.

During the late 19th century and much of the 20th century, Piqua was a major center of underwear production. A yearly Outdoor Underwear Festival was held downtown from 1988 until shortly after the demise and demolition of the factory owned by Medalist-Allen A, a direct descendant of the Atlas Underwear Company. Originally the festival had a serious historical focus. In later years it attracted adventurous types from surrounding towns, and Piqua residents discouraged their children from attending. Heritage Green Park now occupies the former Medalist factory site.

The Meteor Motor Car Company had a brief run as an independent record label and phonograph manufacturer in the 1920s. Acquired by Wayne Corporation of Richmond, Indiana, which manufactured school buses, it operated as the Miller-Meteor division. Miller-Meteor produced ambulances and hearses before closing down in 1979.

The Piqua Coca-Cola Bottling Company, owned by the Lange family, was located on the downtown square at the northeast corner of Main and High streets. It produced its signature product along with Sprite, Tab and Fresca in glass bottles for the Upper Miami Valley; metal canned products were shipped in from a plant in Speedway, Indiana. In the mid-1970s, the plant was bought by the Dayton Coca-Cola Bottling Company. The increased demand for Coke products in two-liter plastic bottles and cans made the aging local plant obsolete; it was closed down and razed by the end of the decade. A newer bottling plant was constructed in Huber Heights. A statue of pilot Don Gentile was erected at the site of the defunct plant.

The Val Decker Packing Company, which operated until 1981, was a local producer of hams, hot dogs, and other meats and lard under the tagline &quot;Piquality.&quot; The large red steel cans, which contained the lard product, are now sought-after as collectors&#x27; items. The building which housed the meat packing plant was renovated in 1987 for office use by the Piqua Board of Education and several small businesses.

Piqua&#x27;s industrial past produced a prosperity reflected in residential areas near downtown, which contain numerous large mansions and homes. Most notable is the Leo Flesh Mansion, built in the Chateauesque style. It looms over many of the surrounding buildings in the neighborhood. A &quot;sister&quot; house in Dayton, Ohio, was designed by the same architect.

Piqua&#x27;s shopping mall, Miami Valley Centre Mall, opened in 1988 and was renovated in the mid-1990s. Miami Valley Crossing (formerly Piqua East Mall, opened in 1970) was redesigned and updated in the late 1990s as a plaza with several anchor stores.

===Top employers===
According to Piqua&#x27;s &quot;2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,&quot; the top employers in the city are:

==Arts and culture==

Fort Piqua Plaza began as the &quot;Orr-Statler Block&quot; building at the corner of Main and High Streets was erected in 1891 and long dominated downtown. For many years its core tenant was a hotel of more than 100 rooms, first known as the &quot;Plaza,&quot; later as the &quot;Favorite,&quot; and finally as the &quot;Fort Piqua.&quot; The hotel closed in the 1980s.

The building&#x27;s street-level commercial spaces were occupied by a variety of businesses over the years, including a barbershop, grocer, bank, the local telephone company business office, Western Union, a combination bus station and taxi office with a very popular soda fountain and lunch counter, and others. Just prior to the start of the Prohibition era, the hotel&#x27;s bar was moved to the basement level. It is rumored to have closed only its outside entrance during those years, operating as a speakeasy.

The building suffered disrepair and neglect for a period, and renewal plans seemed unable to secure funding. In a public-private redevelopment, the building was fully renovated during a two-year project. Since 2008, its major tenant has been the city&#x27;s public library. In addition, the building is the location of The Scottish Thistle, a full-scale restaurant and bar, complete with a patio for live entertainment. The building is now known as Fort Piqua Plaza.

Beginning in 1886, there were 14 companies in Piqua set up that sold underwear. There were underwear manufacturers in the city until 1993.

The Underwear Festival, in which participants wore underwear publicly and which had entertainment events, was established in 1988. Each instance was for two days. In 1990, the Associated Press stated: &quot;Organizers cautioned that the parade is a family affair.&quot; A lack of volunteers led to the disestablishment of the festival in 1998.

==Education==

The Piqua City School District, which covers the entire city, operates two elementary schools, one intermediate school, one middle school, a junior high school, and Piqua High School. Piqua is also home to the Upper Valley Career Center. Piqua is also home to several private schools, including Piqua Catholic School, the Piqua Seventh Day Adventist School, and the Nicholas School.

Piqua is home to Edison State Community College, established as Ohio&#x27;s first general and technical college in 1973.

==Media==
The &quot;Piqua Daily Call&quot; was published daily from 1884 to 2019 before being consolidated with the &quot;Troy Daily News&quot; to form &quot;Miami Valley Today&quot;, which is published Tuesday through Friday in Troy. 

Piqua is home to the radio stations WPTW 1570 AM and 98.1 FM, as well as WPLC 95.1 low-power FM as a repeater of Three Angels Broadcasting Network.

==Transportation==

Piqua has two Main Streets, one being north and southbound along Miami County Road 25-A (the former U.S. Route 25, also known as the Dixie Highway); the other running east through Shawnee. U.S. 36 also runs through much of the city, cutting the town almost directly in half. Main and Ash streets (U.S. 36) converge in Piqua&#x27;s downtown. Also running through downtown is the east–west Conrail corridor; originally built as the Pennsylvania Railroad two-track throughway, this track was abandoned in 1985 during restructuring of the railroad industry. A section of it was renovated as a bike trail in the summer of 2001, and it is now known as Linear Park. The remaining rail line serving Piqua is the north and southbound Baltimore and Ohio line, now operated by CSX Transportation (CSXT).

<text>Tipp City is a city in southern Miami County, Ohio, United States, just 15 miles north of Dayton. The population was 10,274 at the 2020 census. Originally known as Tippecanoe, and then Tippecanoe City, it was renamed to Tipp City in 1938 because another town in Ohio was likewise named Tippecanoe. The city lies in the Miami Valley and sits along Interstate 75 near the Interstate 70 interchange. Tipp City is part of the Dayton metropolitan area.

== History ==

Tippecanoe City was founded in 1840 along the developing Miami and Erie Canal. Its name derives from Presidential candidate William Henry Harrison&#x27;s nickname, Tippecanoe, which, in turn, was derived from his heroism at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811.

The early city was a popular stopping-off point for boatmen traveling along the Miami and Erie Canal. The original downtown purportedly included a large number of bars and a red light district. The now dry canal locks can be seen just east of downtown. Development of the railroads in the 1850s and 1860s put the canals out of business and slowed the city&#x27;s initially rapid growth. Ruins of a repair shop (yard barn) for the old Inter-Urban rail system can still be seen on the outskirts of town. As Tippecanoe City grew, it merged with Hyattsville, a contiguous village, located on present-day Hyatt Street. The Hyattsville post office served the entire city in 1862. Near the end of the American Civil War, on 28 January 1865, the Hyattsville post office transitioned to officially become the Tippecanoe City post office.

Three decades before ZIP Codes alleviated most misdelivieries nationwide, in the 1930s the U.S. Postal Service abbreviated the post office&#x27;s name to Tipp City to resolve delivery errors with Tippecanoe, Ohio. Around 1938 the name Tipp City appears on postal maps.

Tippecanoe High School retains the former full name of the city. The development of U.S. Route 25 (County Road 25-A) and subsequently Interstate 75 brought construction and vibrance back to the town throughout the 20th century.

On June 8, 2022, a tornado struck Tipp City, causing heavy damage to a Meijer distribution center in the area. The tornado strengthened just before hitting the city. This tornado traveled 13.9 miles before ending near Casstown, Ohio. This and 5 other tornadoes were part of a tornado outbreak in Ohio, which had 6 tornadoes strike the state.

Starting at the Shelby county line, it will run through the south end of Piqua, Troy and Tipp City before meeting up with the Miami County Municipal Jail just south of Tipp City. The Tipp City portion of the trail will consist of three sections:
* The first stage, which was completed in July 2005, runs from Main Street at the Canal Lock Park, north past the new Aquatic Center, west of the baseball fields, then meanders along the river before ending at the Nature Center on North Third Street.
* A second segment will run north from the Nature Center to the southern end of the Troy Trail, which currently ends about 1/2 mile north of Tipp-Cowlesville Road. This portion of the trail is funded and construction is set to begin in 2007. Monroe Township is the sponsor for this trail section, and the lead agency is Five Rivers Metroparks. The part of uncompleted trail wrapped up construction in the Autumn of 2008 with the Trail partnership with Miami County Park District. The 1/2 mile connector to the Troy Trail was dedicated on October 30, 2008, by local sub political jurisdictions attending the ceremonial ribbon-cutting. Media: KIT-channel 5, Tipp City Independent Voice
* A third segment, due to begin construction in 2007–2008, will run south from Main Street, connect with the existing bike trail in Kyle Park, and run south along the eastern side of Canal Road before connecting with the Montgomery County trail at Ross Road. There is currently a parking lot here that allows access and convenient parking to the Montgomery Trail, which runs through Huber Heights, under I-70, and south to Needmore Road.

<text>Beallsville ( ) is a village in Monroe County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 355. The village gained national attention by losing more than 1% of its population killed in action in the Vietnam War, the worst per-capita loss of life experienced by any place in the country.

Two former coal mines owned by Murray Energy, Powhatan No. 6 mine and Century Mine, are located near Beallsville.

==History==
During the period of active American participation in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Beallsville gained brief notoriety for the loss of five of its citizens in the conflict — a traumatic rate of loss for the village of fewer than 500 residents that was estimated at 75 times the national average. The plight of the community drew wire service coverage and was the subject of a lengthy illustrated spread in the glossy left-wing magazine &quot;Ramparts.&quot; Moved by the magnitude of the loss, Congressman Clarence Miller made a formal request to Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and President Richard Nixon to withdraw the village&#x27;s other six servicemen from combat, which was denied.

A sixth of the village&#x27;s sons fell in combat on March 9, 1969, cementing the community&#x27;s tragic distinction of having the highest percentage rate of loss in the Vietnam War of any town in America.

<text>Clarington is a village in Monroe County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 280 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Clarington was described in 1833 as having two stores, one tavern, one physician and ten residential houses.

During the mid-1800s, Clarington grew considerably and soon was a booming river port town with nearly 1,500 residents. The village boasted a cigar factory, blacksmith shop, restaurants, lodgings, and employed many residents at the local boat yard. Mozena Brothers Boat Yard designed and built many western river steam &quot;packet-boats&quot; on site in Clarington near the mouth of Sunfish Creek. Most famous of these boats was the 1912 built Liberty. A mural of the boat by artist Ruston Baker can be seen in town. By the late 1920s, boat building was on the decline and Mozena Brothers sold out to Cook Brothers &amp; Thomas Boat Yard. Barges, small gas powered ferries, and other craft continued to be built in Clarington up to 1941. Geographically, Clarington was the last port on the Ohio River before crossing the Mason–Dixon line just a few miles south of the village. Noted author, river historian, and educator J. Mack Gamble was a lifelong resident of the town.

The non-profit Ohio Valley River Museum in Clarington serves to preserve and promote the history of Clarington&#x27;s past, western river steamboats, the impact of river industries, and the role it plays in future development. The current museum president is Taylor Abbott. Barbara Rush serves as director. The museum is operated by a nine-member board of directors.

In recent years, Clarington has become an epicenter of oil and gas activity after drilling discoveries of Utica and Marcellus gas formations. As of late 2014, Appalachian Resins had signed a letter of intent to lease 50 acres in Clarington. The Houston-based company plans to construct a $1 billion plant on the site that will use ethane, a component of natural gas, from the nearby Utica and Marcellus formations and break it down into ethylene. The project is considered a major development and boost to the economy of Monroe County following the closure of the Ormet aluminum plant.

==History==

In 1796, American explorer Benjamin Robbins founded Centerville, Ohio, naming it after his hometown of Centreville, New Jersey, due to its location between two rivers and its proximity to several other communities. Robbins and two of his brothers chose land in Centerville, with Robbins selecting 160 acres northwest of the town center because of the abundance of springs. During settlement, settlers discovered limestone in Centerville, leading to the replacement of many log cabins with more durable limestone structures. On April 6, 1797, Robbins&#x27;s family arrived in Centerville from Dry Ridge, Kentucky after ten days of constructing a wagon road, and began assembling houses. Robbins established a log cabin for his family, but during occupancy, the roof was blown away during a storm. Robbins&#x27;s son, Sam, became the city&#x27;s first mayor. By 1820, Robbins added a second floor to the house and replaced the base with limestone. In 1803, one-room schoolhouses were established in Centerville, offering education from grades 1 to 6. Benjamin Robbins died on June 3, 1837, and was buried at the Sugar Creek Baptist Cemetery. 

In 1900, the U.S. Post Office changed the spelling of the town’s name from Centreville to Centerville. On December 2, 1968, Centerville became a city. In 1973, Centerville High School was established.

<text>Englewood is a city in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. The population was 13,463 at the 2020 census. A northern suburb of Dayton, it is part of the Dayton metropolitan area.

==History==
Although Englewood was not actually founded until 1841, many early settlers began to come to the area known as Randolph Township around 1800. Earliest settlers were the families of David Hoover, David Mast, Daniel Hoover, Robert Ewing, John and Abraham McClintock, John Rench, Martin Sheets, Jacob Smith, Daniel and Peter Fetters. Also among the early settlers were the families of the Ellers, Fouts, Frantzs, Wertzs and the Brumbaughs.

The early settlers made their living basically from agriculture. They shipped grain and bacon down the Stillwater River on flat bottom boats to Dayton and as far south as New Orleans. There was also a considerable amount of industry, including saw mills, gun smithing, wine distilling and pottery manufacturing.

There were many Native Americans in the area in the early days that traded with the settlers. There was also an abundance of wildlife which afforded good hunting for the settlers’ food requirements.

Following primarily the path traced through this area by the Stillwater River, a group of settlers founded what is now the City of Englewood on May 6, 1841. These pioneers included Mathias Gish, Daniel Rasor and Samuel Herr. Some of these settlers came from the area around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and thus named the community Harrisburg. Other residents came from Randolph County, North Carolina, and named this township accordingly.

Harrisburg&#x27;s first post office was opened on February 8, 1870, and discontinued on February 6, 1871. The post office was re-established on May 8, 1874, and the first postmaster was Harvey Iams. The town was then renamed Iamton. However, at that time the capital letters I and J were the same in the alphabet and the town became known as Jamton.

In 1898, the local businessmen conducted a contest to choose a new name for the town. The name Englewood was chosen as the winner of that contest and the town of Jamton was renamed Englewood. The Village of Englewood was incorporated on May 15, 1914, and Jacob Hoover was the first mayor. The population had risen to 415 by 1930 and over 600 by 1940. Englewood became a city in 1971.

Natural gas was made available to the area in 1934, the first water works was built in 1936 and the original sewer system was completed in 1940.

==Geography==
The city is situated along the Stillwater River, bordering the cities of Clayton, Union, and Butler Township. Interstate 70 and the National Road (U.S. Route 40) intersect Ohio State Route 48 within Englewood&#x27;s boundaries.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<doc id="129644" wikidata="Q202326" url="?curid=129644" title="The Godfather Part III">
<text>The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Andy García, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton and Sofia Coppola. It is the third and final installment in &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy. A sequel to &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), it concludes the fictional story of Michael Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire. The film also includes fictionalized accounts of two real-life events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–1982, both linked to Michael Corleone&#x27;s business affairs.

Although Coppola initially refused to return for a third film, he eventually signed to direct and write &quot;Part III&quot;. In his audio commentary for &quot;Part II&quot;, Coppola stated that only a dire financial situation, caused by the failure of his 1982 musical fantasy &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, compelled him to take up Paramount&#x27;s long-standing offer to make a third installment. Coppola and Puzo wanted the title to be &quot;The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, for they felt that the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga, so &quot;Part III&quot; would serve as the epilogue, but Paramount Pictures thought that that title was unacceptable.

Winona Ryder was initially cast in the role of Michael Corleone&#x27;s daughter Mary, but eventually left production due to other commitments and nervous exhaustion. The role was ultimately given to Coppola&#x27;s daughter Sofia, a decision that garnered much criticism and accusations of nepotism. Principal photography took place from late 1989 to early 1990, with filming locations in both Italy and the United States.

&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; premiered in Beverly Hills on December 20, 1990, and was widely released in the United States on Christmas Day. The film received generally positive reviews, although it was considered inferior to the previous films by most audiences. Critics praised Pacino&#x27;s and Garcia&#x27;s performances, cinematography, editing, production design and Coppola&#x27;s direction, but criticized the plot, the casting and the performance of Sofia Coppola. It grossed $136.8 million worldwide, and garnered seven nominations at the 63rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor (Garcia). It also received seven nominations at the 48th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Pacino).

In December 2020, a recut version of the film, titled The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, was released to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original version.

==Plot==

In 1978, Michael Corleone is approaching 60 years of age. Wracked with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, especially for having ordered his brother Fredo Corleone&#x27;s murder, he donates millions to charitable causes. Michael and Kay are divorced; their children Anthony and Mary live with Kay. At a reception in Michael&#x27;s honor at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral that follows a papal order induction ceremony, Anthony tells his father that he is leaving law school to become an opera singer.

Kay supports Anthony&#x27;s decision, while Michael eventually agrees to let him go his own way. Kay reveals to Michael that she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo&#x27;s death. Vincent Mancini, the out-of-wedlock son of Michael&#x27;s long-dead brother Sonny, arrives at the reception. Michael&#x27;s sister Connie arranges for Vincent to settle a dispute with his rival Joey Zasa, but Zasa calls Vincent a bastard, and Vincent bites Zasa&#x27;s ear. Michael, troubled by Vincent&#x27;s temper yet impressed by his loyalty, agrees to include Vincent in the family business.

The head of the Vatican Bank, Archbishop Gilday, has accumulated a massive deficit of $765M, and Michael offers $600M in exchange for shares in Internazionale Immobiliare, an international real estate company, which would make him its largest single shareholder. He makes a tender offer to buy the Vatican&#x27;s 25% share in the company, which will give him controlling interest. Immobiliare&#x27;s board approves the offer, pending ratification by Pope Paul VI.

Don Altobello, a New York Mafia boss and Connie&#x27;s godfather, tells Michael that his partners on The Commission want to be involved with the Immobiliare deal. However, wanting to finally become legitimate, Michael pays them to sell his Las Vegas holdings instead. Zasa receives nothing and, declaring Michael to be his enemy, storms out. Don Altobello, assuring Michael that he can diplomatically resolve the matter, leaves to speak to Zasa. Moments later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and opens fire.

Most bosses are killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael&#x27;s bodyguard Al Neri, escape. Michael realizes that Altobello is the traitor, and suffers a diabetic stroke. As Michael recuperates, Vincent and Mary begin a romance, while Neri and Connie permit Vincent to retaliate against Zasa. During a street festival, Vincent kills Zasa. Michael berates Vincent for his actions and insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary because it is dangerous and they are first cousins.

The family goes to Sicily for Anthony&#x27;s operatic debut in Palermo at the Teatro Massimo. Michael tells Vincent to pretend to defect from the Corleone family to spy on Altobello. Altobello introduces Vincent to Licio Lucchesi, Immobiliare&#x27;s chairman. Michael visits Cardinal Lamberto, anticipated to become the next pope, to discuss the deal. Lamberto persuades Michael to make his first confession in 30 years, during which Michael tearfully confesses that he ordered Fredo&#x27;s murder. Lamberto says that Michael deserves to suffer for his sins, but can be redeemed. He gives him sacramental absolution, permanently forgiving all his past sins in the eyes of God. Michael discovers that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle, arranged by Lucchesi, Gilday and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig.

Vincent tells Michael that Altobello has hired Mosca, a veteran hitman, to assassinate Michael. Mosca, disguised as a priest, kills Corleone family friend Don Tommasino as he returns to his villa. While Michael and Kay tour Sicily, Michael asks for Kay&#x27;s forgiveness, and they admit that they still love each other. At Tommasino&#x27;s funeral, Michael vows to sin no more. Following the pope&#x27;s death, Cardinal Lamberto is elected to succeed him, choosing as his name Pope John Paul I. Subsequently, the Immobiliare deal is ratified.

Gilday kills the new pope with poisoned tea. Michael names Vincent the new Don of the Corleone family, in return for ending his romance with Mary. The family sees Anthony&#x27;s performance in &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; in Palermo while Vincent exacts his revenge. Keinszig is killed, and his murder is staged as a suicide; Connie poisons Altobello via a birthday cannoli and watches him die from the opera box; Calò, Tommasino&#x27;s former bodyguard, kills Lucchesi; and Neri travels to the Vatican, where he shoots and kills Gilday.

At the opera house during Anthony&#x27;s performance, three of Vincent&#x27;s men search for Mosca, but he overcomes them. After the show, on the opera house steps as they leave, Mosca shoots at Michael, wounding him; a second bullet hits Mary, killing her. Vincent shoots and kills Mosca. Michael cradles Mary&#x27;s body and screams in agony.

Years later, an elderly Michael, sitting alone in the courtyard of Don Tommasino&#x27;s villa, slumps over, falls to the ground, and dies.

===Writing===
Francis Ford Coppola felt that &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) had told the complete Michael Corleone saga, and did not want to make another installment in &quot;The Godfather&quot; film series. Paramount Pictures nevertheless spent years trying to make another sequel set in the 1970s with another director. Studio president Michael Eisner wrote a treatment in which the Central Intelligence Agency would team up with the Mafia to assassinate a Costa Rican dictator, while Alexander Jacobs wrote a screenplay in which Michael Corleone&#x27;s son Anthony would inherit his father&#x27;s crime family.

In 1978, the studio hired Mario Puzo to write a story treatment for $250,000. This was expanded into a 1979 screenplay by Dean Riesner would have combined the two concepts by having Anthony Corleone as a CIA agent responsible for assassinating the dictator and then taking over the Corleone crime family. Gulf + Western CEO Charles Bluhdorn offered Richard Brooks the chance to direct the film, but he declined.

First, John Travolta and Eric Roberts were hired as Anthony Corleone. Production on this story did not move forward, and in 1982, Vincent Patrick wrote a new screenplay in which Michael Corleone and Tom Hagen would have been killed in the opening scene, and would have focused on the first film&#x27;s protagonists&#x27; child. It was not produced after director Dan Curtis quit. In 1985, Nick Marino and Thomas Lee Wright submitted a screenplay called &quot;The Godfather: The Family Continues&quot; featuring a gang war between the Corleones and the Irish Mafia in Atlantic City, but it was rejected by the studio&#x27;s new president Frank Mancuso Sr. because he believed that it did not portray the Corleones sympathetically enough. Marino and Wright later sought Writers&#x27; Guild of America arbitration to receive a story credit on the final film, but were declined.

In 1985, development of &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; stalled because the cast of the first two films demanded more money to reprise their roles and because Paramount Pictures decided that a third film could not be made without Coppola&#x27;s involvement. The studio had previously considered Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese, Warren Beatty and Michael Cimino, and motion picture head Ned Tanen favored Andrei Konchalovsky. That year, Coppola began considering returning to the franchise because of a dire financial situation, initially caused by the failures of &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984).

The latter film&#x27;s producer Robert Evans, who also collaborated with Coppola on the first film, tried unsuccessfully producing another &quot;Godfather&quot; film without Coppola&#x27;s involvement. In 1988, after Puzo and Nicholas Gage wrote another draft, Talia Shire convinced Coppola to sign a deal to direct and write &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; for $6 million and a share of the film&#x27;s profits.

Coppola and Puzo completed their final draft of the screenplay on May 10, 1989, and it would include almost none of the elements in the scripts proposed over the previous 12 years, except for a home-invasion scene from the original Reisner script that survived in almost its original form.

Coppola intended &quot;Part III&quot; to be an epilogue to the first two films, and was also inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. Coppola and Puzo preferred the title &quot;The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, but Paramount Pictures found it to be unacceptable.

===Casting===
Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire reprised their roles from the first two films, with Pacino accepting an $8 million salary. According to Coppola&#x27;s audio commentary in the film in &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot;, Robert Duvall refused to take part unless he was paid a salary comparable to the $6 million earned by Pacino in the previous film. In 2004, on the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Duvall said, &quot;If they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that&#x27;s fine, but not three or four times, which is what they did.&quot; When Duvall dropped out, Coppola rewrote the screenplay to portray Tom Hagen as having died before the story begins, and created the character B. J. Harrison, played by George Hamilton, to replace the Hagen character and portray a role smaller than Michael Corleone’s attorney in the story. Coppola stated that, to him, the movie feels incomplete &quot;without [Robert] Duvall&#x27;s participation&quot;. According to Coppola, had Duvall agreed to take part in the film, the Hagen character would have been heavily involved in running the Corleone charities. Duvall confirmed in a 2010 interview that he never regretted the decision of turning down the role.

Julia Roberts was originally cast as Mary, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Madonna wanted to play the role, but Coppola felt that she was too old for the part. Rebecca Schaeffer was set to audition, but was murdered by an obsessed fan. Winona Ryder was cast in the role and started filming her part, but dropped out after a few weeks into production due to commitments with &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990) and nervous exhaustion.

Coppola considered replacing Ryder with either Madonna, Annabella Sciorra or Laura San Giacomo. Ultimately, Sofia Coppola, the director&#x27;s daughter, was given the role of Michael Corleone&#x27;s daughter. Her much-criticized performance resulted in her father being accused of nepotism, a charge that Coppola denies in the commentary track, asserting that, in his opinion, critics, &quot;beginning with an article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;,&quot; were &quot;using [my] daughter to attack me,&quot; something that he finds ironic in light of the film&#x27;s denouement, in which Mary pays the ultimate price for her father&#x27;s sins. Andy Garcia was cast as Vincent over Alec Baldwin.

As an infant, Sofia Coppola had played Michael Corleone&#x27;s infant nephew in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, during the climactic baptism/murder montage at the end of that film (Sofia Coppola also appears in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; as a small immigrant child, in which nine-year-old Vito Corleone arrives by steamer at Ellis Island). The character of Michael&#x27;s sister Connie is played by Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s sister, Talia Shire. Other Coppola relatives with cameos in the film include Coppola&#x27;s mother, father (who wrote and conducted much of the music in the film), uncle and granddaughter Gia.

===Filming===
Principal photography was set to begin on November 15, 1989, with six weeks of filming at Cinecittà Studios in Italy, but the start date was pushed back to November 27. This period also included location shoots throughout Rome and Caprarola at landmarks such as the Palace of Justice, the Vatican Bank, Castello di Lunghezza and Santa Maria della Quercia.

However, production was delayed for three weeks due to the physical collapse of Ryder until a replacement could be found, which was complicated after Coppola was forced to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to his debts. Filming resumed in the early spring of 1990 in Sicily, with scenes shot in Palermo, Taormina, and Forza d&#x27;Agrò. Additionally filming took place in the United States in New York City and Atlantic City at locations such as the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Little Italy, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, and Trump Castle. Coppola delayed the production in Italy even further by constantly rewriting and &quot;tinkering&quot; with the film, and reportedly did not come up with an ending for the film until two months before it was due to be released.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Score. The film&#x27;s love theme, &quot;Promise Me You&#x27;ll Remember&quot; (subtitled &quot;Love Theme from &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;&quot;), sung by Harry Connick, Jr., received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Song.

Al Martino, who portrayed Johnny Fontane in &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, sings &quot;To Each His Own&quot;.

==Release==
The film, distributed by Paramount Pictures, premiered in Beverly Hills on December 20, 1990, and was widely released in the United States on December 25.

==Alternate versions==
===&quot;The Godfather Part III: Final Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; (1991)===
For the film&#x27;s 1991 home-video release, Coppola edited it and added nine minutes of deleted footage, for a running time of 170 minutes. This cut was initially released on VHS and LaserDisc, and was advertised as the &quot;Final Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. It is the only version of the film available on home video until 2020. The original theatrical cut was released in 2022, exclusively as a part of &quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot; 4K UHD Boxset.

===&quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; (2020)===
For the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a recut titled &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; received a limited theatrical release on December 4, 2020, followed by digital and home releases on December 8. This version includes changes to the beginning and the ending, and some edited scenes and musical cues. It has a runtime of 158 minutes.

Coppola has said that the 2020 recut is the one that he and Puzo originally envisioned, and that it &quot;vindicates&quot; its status in &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy, as well as his daughter Sofia&#x27;s performance. Both Pacino and Keaton gave their approval to the new cut, noting that it is an improvement over the original theatrical release.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
&quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; grossed $66.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $70.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $136.8 million, against a production budget of $54 million.

The film opened in 1,901 theaters, and grossed $19.6 million in its opening weekend, finishing second behind &quot;Home Alone&quot;. It went on to generate a total of $6 million on Christmas Day, which was the highest at the time. For seven years, the film held that record until 1997, when it was surpassed by &quot;Titanic&quot;. In its second weekend, it made $8.3 million, finishing third.

On the release of the recut version, &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, in December 2020, it made $52,000 from 179 theaters. In total, the film made $95,000 domestically, and $71,000 in four international markets.

===Critical response===
====Original film (1990)====

Common criticisms of &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; focused on Sofia Coppola&#x27;s acting, the convoluted plot, and the film&#x27;s inadequacy as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; story. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 66% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The final installment of &quot;The Godfather&quot; saga recalls its predecessors&#x27; power when it&#x27;s strictly business, but underwhelming performances and confused tonality brings less closure to the Corleone story.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 19 critics, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Opening day audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

In his review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated that it is &quot;not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two&quot;. Nonetheless, Ebert wrote an enthusiastic review, awarding the film three-and-a-half, a better rating than he originally gave &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (in his 2008 re-rating, he gave &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; four stars and included it in his list of Great Movies). He also defended the casting of Sofia Coppola, who he felt was not miscast, stating, &quot;There is no way to predict what kind of performance Francis Ford Coppola might have obtained from Winona Ryder, the experienced and talented young actress, who was originally set to play this role. But I think Sofia Coppola brings a quality of her own to Mary Corleone. A certain up-front vulnerability and simplicity that I think are appropriate and right for the role.&quot;

Ebert&#x27;s colleague, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film high praise and placed it tenth in his list of the ten best films of 1990. Siskel admitted that the ending was the film&#x27;s weakest part, citing Al Pacino&#x27;s makeup as very poor. He also said, &quot;[Another] problem is the casting of Sofia Coppola, who is out of her acting league here. She&#x27;s supposed to be Andy Garcia&#x27;s love interest but no sparks fly. He&#x27;s more like her babysitter.&quot; In response to Ebert&#x27;s defense of Coppola, Siskel said, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re saying about her being sort of natural and not the polished bombshell, and that would&#x27;ve been wrong. There is one, a photographer in the picture, who takes care of that role, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s explained why [Vincent] really comes onto her, unless this guy is the most venal, craven guy, but look who he&#x27;s playing around with. He&#x27;s playing around with the Godfather&#x27;s daughter.&quot;

Leonard Maltin, giving the film three out of four, stated that it is &quot;masterfully told&quot;, but that casting Sofia Coppola was an &quot;almost-fatal flaw&quot;. James Berardinelli gave the film a positive review, awarding it three-and-a-half stars out of four. John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; described the film as &quot;a tedious effort to flog an old hippopotamus into action&quot;.

====Recut version (2020)====
On Rotten Tomatoes, the recut version, &quot;The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot;, holds an approval rating of 86% based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone&quot; pulls the audience back into Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s epic gangster saga with a freshly — albeit slightly — edited version of its final installment.&quot; On Metacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five stars and stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure how much, if anything, Coppola&#x27;s re-edit does for the film, but it&#x27;s worth a watch.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;Here&#x27;s the news and the ever-so-slight scandal: It&#x27;s the same damn movie. [...] The one impactful change is the new opening scene&quot; and that the film &quot;gathers force as it goes along. It&#x27;s a movie that can sweep you up if you let it [...] I salute Coppola&#x27;s decision to put the movie back out there. I hope that a lot of people revisit it (or discover it for the first time), using that word &#x27;coda&#x27; as a key — for, of course, &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; always was an extended coda to what is arguably the greatest epic saga in the history of American cinema.&quot;

Writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, David Ehrlich said, &quot;But when it was announced that [Coppola] had inevitably assembled a new cut of his most famous cause célèbre and re-christened it with the title he&#x27;d always wanted for the film... he wasn&#x27;t trying to make it &#x27;better&#x27; so much as he was trying to shift its place in history and reframe the picture as less the third part of a flawed trilogy than the postscript of a legendary dyad.&quot;

==Accolades==
Although the film was not nearly as acclaimed as the previous two installments, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Andy García), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design (Dean Tavoularis, Gary Fettis), and Best Original Song (Carmine Coppola and John Bettis for &quot;Promise Me You&#x27;ll Remember&quot;). It is the only film in the series not to have Al Pacino nominated for an Academy Award (he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Godfather&quot; and for Best Actor for &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;). It is the only film in the trilogy not to win for Best Picture, or any other Academy Award for that matter, as well as the only film in the trilogy not selected for preservation by the U.S. National Film Registry as of 2022. Along with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot; shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated for Best Picture.

The film was also nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards, but did not win. Sofia Coppola won two Golden Raspberry Awards for both Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Michael Corleone: &quot;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.&quot; – Nominated

==Historical background==

Parts of the film are very loosely based on real historical events concerning the ending of the papacy of Pope Paul VI, the very short tenure of Pope John Paul I in 1978, and the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982. Like the character Cardinal Lamberto, who becomes John Paul I, the historical John Paul I, Albino Luciani, reigned for only a very short time before being found dead in his bed.

Journalist David Yallop argues that Luciani was planning a reform of Vatican finances and that he died by poisoning; these claims are reflected in the film. Yallop also names as a suspect Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, who was the head of the Vatican bank, like the character Archbishop Gilday in the film. However, while Marcinkus was noted for his muscular physique and Chicago origins, Gilday is a mild Irishman. The character has also drawn comparisons to Cardinal Giuseppe Caprio, as he was in charge of the Vatican finances during the approximate period in which the movie was based.

The character of Frederick Keinszig, the Swiss banker who is murdered and left hanging under a bridge, mirrors the fate (and physical appearance) of Roberto Calvi, the Italian head of the Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982 (though it was initially unclear whether it was suicide or murder, in 2002 courts in London ruled the latter). The name &quot;Keinszig&quot; is taken from Manuela Kleinszig, the girlfriend of Flavio Carbone, who was indicted as one of Calvi&#x27;s murderers in 2005.

Don Lucchesi is widely seen as partly inspired by seven-time Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti, who wore similar thick-rimmed glasses. The line spoken to Lucchesi by Calò immediately before stabbing him, &quot;Il potere logora chi non ce l&#x27;ha&quot; (&quot;Power wears out those who don&#x27;t have it&quot;), is a quote attributed to Andreotti in response to the claim that he and his party had become worn out from years of being in power.

==Canceled sequel==
Following the reaction to the third installment, Coppola stated that the idea of a fourth film was discussed but Mario Puzo died before they were able to write it. A potential script, told in a similar narrative to &quot;Part II&quot;, would have included De Niro reprising his role as a younger Vito Corleone in the 1930s; Leonardo DiCaprio was slated to portray a young Sonny Corleone gaining the Corleone family&#x27;s political power; García as Vincent Corleone during the 1980s running the family business through ten years of destructive war, haunted by the death of his cousin Mary, and eventually losing the family&#x27;s respect and power. García has since claimed the film&#x27;s script was nearly produced.

Puzo&#x27;s portion of the potential sequel, dealing with the Corleone family in the early 1930s, was eventually expanded into a novel by Edward Falco and published in 2012 as &quot;The Family Corleone&quot;. Paramount sued the Puzo estate to prevent publication of the novel, prompting a counter-suit on the part of the estate, claiming breach of contract. The studio and the estate subsequently settled the suits, allowing publication of the book, but with the studio retaining rights to possible future films.

The Gunckel Town Plan, maintaining many of its original 19th and early 20th century buildings, has been recognized as a Historic District and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Germantown underwent many economic changes as distilleries, and the cigar industry, both came and went. In 1847 the Mudlick Distillery was established and, with an output of 30 barrels of whiskey a day, was considered the largest in the country for many years. At one time the Municipality housed up to 12 cigar warehouses and five factories, with the tobacco industry employing many residents up until the 1970s.

==Geography==
Germantown is situated within German Township, in the south-western part of Montgomery County, Ohio. The town is in an area known as the Twin Valley, due to the Little Twin Creek on its east side, and Big Twin on its west and south sides, being in the forks of these streams.

<text>Miamisburg ( ) is a city in southern Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. The population was 19,923 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Dayton, it is part of the Dayton metropolitan area. Named after the Miami people, Miamisburg is known for its industrial history, particularly its nuclear operations during World War II, and retail factors such as the Dayton Mall and surrounding commercial business area.

==History==
European-Americans started calling their first community &quot;Hole&#x27;s Station&quot; &quot;circa&quot; 1797, when Zechariah Hole settled there with his family from Virginia and built a stockade on the west bank of the Miami River opposite the mouth of Bear Creek. The stockade attracted squatters, surveying parties, and other settlers who had taken grants to live in the local cabins until they could build their own; hence the little community became known as &quot;Hole&#x27;s Station&quot;. Settlers came west primarily from Pennsylvania. Miamisburg was incorporated in 1832 as a village; it achieved city status in the 1920s.

By 1827, the Miami and Erie Canal was under construction through the community, which improved transportation of people and goods through the region. The formal opening took place in January 1829, when the &quot;Governor Brown&quot; was the first packet boat to go through the settlement. Also that year the first boats from Cincinnati had arrived and passed through Miamisburg to get to Dayton. By 1834 the canal had been extended to Piqua, and many businesses along the river grew. The 1840s and the 1850s were brought the best of times to the canals.
George Kinder, a local resident, shipped bags of food to Ireland during its Great Famine; these also contained his address, with ads saying that he was hiring immigrant workers. Some Irish immigrants did come to Miamisburg and surrounding cities in search of work.

Miamisburg was the site of one of the first post-war U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) facilities, beginning in 1947. The Dayton area had supported numerous secret operations for the War Department during World War II. As the war ended, the majority of these operations were moved to the Miamisburg Mound Laboratory, which was operated by the Monsanto Chemical Company. The Mound Labs were to monitor all aspects of the US nuclear defense stockpile.

The Mound Plant, built in 1947, was situated on a site in the city south of Dayton. The workers, who numbered more than 2,000 at the height of the production, made plutonium detonators for nuclear weapons. Their work was very classified. The plant had a small army of security guards and was ringed by chain-link fencing and razor wire. When the Cold War ended, the plant discontinued the detonator work, but it continued to make nuclear power generators for space probes.

In May 1993 U.S. Department of Energy decided to end all production at the Mound. This move affected 2,100 employees in the local area. By 1996 cleanup of radioactive and hazardous waste was the main activity at the Plant. The Mound Development Corporation spearheaded the creation of the Mound Advanced Technology Center in the redevelopment of the plant, with the Montgomery County Regional Dispatch Center joining 14 other tenants in March 2009. In December 2010, the Dayton Police Department became the 17th law enforcement agency, along with 11 fire departments, to be dispatched from the regional center.

&lt;section begin=rail accidents /&gt;On September 10, 1978, 15 cars of a Conrail freight train derailed as the result of a hot box, caused by uneven distribution of steel ingots in a gondola loaded at Buffalo, New York by Republic Steel. They demolished a house at the Pearl Street crossing and killed three of its five occupants. As a result of a cooperative investigation by the Miamisburg Police Department and the National Transportation Safety Board, the deaths were ruled homicides by the Montgomery County Coroner.

Eight years later the city was the site of the July 8, 1986 derailment of 15 cars of a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train, resulting in explosions of tank cars, emitted gas and clouds from phosphorus, on two successive days. The resulting thick white cloud engulfed communities as far north as Yellow Springs, Pitchin, and South Vienna. Rolling in like a massive desert dust storm across the horizon, the chemical cloud hugged the ground and blotted out the sun for several minutes before dissipating, according to the National Transportation Safety Board’s report. The explosions led to the evacuation of an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 residents from Miamisburg and surrounding southern Montgomery County municipalities, at the time this was the largest evacuation in U.S. history resulting from a train accident, according to William E. Loftus, executive director of the Federal Railroad Administration. This was also the largest evacuation in Ohio history.

<text>Moraine is a city in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. Situated on the banks of the Great Miami River, Moraine is an inner suburb of Dayton, Ohio and a part of the Dayton metropolitan area. The population was 6,393 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
What is now the city of Moraine was once a part of Van Buren Township followed by a brief period as a part of Kettering. Much of Kettering&#x27;s portion seceded in 1953 and formed the new Moraine Township. The township incorporated as a village in 1957. After annexing portions of Miami Township, Moraine incorporated as a city in 1965. Moraine later annexed parts of Jefferson Township.

===Manufacturing===

Moraine is known for its manufacturing history. From 1917 to 1923 the Dayton Wright Airplane company operated an aircraft manufacturing plant on the current site of the Moraine Assembly. During its years of operation over 4000 aircraft were built including the DeHavilland observer/bomber plane (a First World War British design).

Dayton-Wright was sold to General Motors in 1919 and GM exited the aircraft business in 1923. In 1926, General Motors enlarged and upgraded the plant and used it to build refrigerators. Frigidaire continued to manufacture appliances on the site until 1979 when GM sold Frigidaire.

However, General Motors decided to keep the plant and retool it to produce vehicles. In 1981 the plant reopened and manufactured the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy. In the 1990s a paint shop, and the DMAX engine plant was added to the site as a joint venture with Isuzu. The plant continued to manufacture SUVs from the General Motors product line (Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Buick) until 2008 when the plant closed. The DMAX engine plant still remains open as a separate facility, and has received a $60 million upgrade in 2014. Through 2008, the total history of the plant included 86 years of manufacturing.

In 2014, GM Moraine Assembly was purchased from IRG by China-based Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co. Ltd. Fuyao manufactures automotive glass for GM and other automakers. They began operations in late 2015, with plans to employ 800 people at the plant. The operations were the subject of the documentary &quot;American Factory&quot;.

<doc id="129652" wikidata="Q2735558" url="?curid=129652" title="Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio">
<text>Oakwood is a city in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. The population was 9,572 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Dayton, Oakwood is part of the Dayton metropolitan area. It was incorporated in 1908. John Henry Patterson, industrialist and founder of the National Cash Register Corporation, is considered the &quot;Father of Oakwood.&quot;

Oakwood is completely land-locked by the surrounding municipalities of Dayton and Kettering. Its small, compact geographic area facilitates the response of its single, unified (consolidated) Department of Public Safety, in which all personnel are certified as police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services (EMS) officers.

==History==
At the turn of the twentieth century, Oakwood was primarily farmland situated on a hill directly south of the City of Dayton. In 1913, when a disastrous flood devastated downtown Dayton (the Great Dayton Flood), advertising began to tout Oakwood property as &quot;275 feet higher than the intersection of Third and Main Streets.&quot;

In light of this real estate advantage and its location adjacent to the City of Dayton, Oakwood&#x27;s largest period of growth began and by 1930, the population numbered over 6,000. Oakwood incorporated as a city in 1908 and in 1932 adopted the Council/Manager form of government that is still in place.

One of the city&#x27;s early residents was Orville Wright, whose home, Hawthorn Hill, still stands at the corner of Harman and Park Avenues. John H. Patterson, founder of the National Cash Register Company (NCR) also called Oakwood home. The city is known as a suburban residential area with mostly tree-lined streets.

During World War II, the Runnymede Playhouse in Oakwood hosted Unit IV of the Dayton Project. The Dayton Project was a little-known part of the Manhattan Project involved in creating industrial quantities of polonium for use in the neutron generating triggers of the first atomic weapon.

==Geography==
It is within the Miami Valley region of southwestern Ohio, and borders on Dayton to its north and east and Kettering, Ohio to its south and west. The campus of the University of Dayton is directly adjacent to Oakwood on the northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city is unofficially divided into two parts, east and west, by the city&#x27;s major road, State Route 48, also termed Far Hills Avenue. SR 48 runs north–south and connects the city of Dayton with Oakwood and, further south, with Kettering and other suburbs. The geography of the eastern and western sections differ to a significant extent, with the western side covered in prominent hills, while most of the eastern section is predominantly level or gently sloping.

===Cityscape===

Oakwood contains a rich collection of architecture. Because of the city&#x27;s age, many of the houses were constructed before World War II and are older in design. Houses in Oakwood, which vary greatly in size, have styles which include Tudor, Swiss chalets, Colonial Revival, White Clapboard Colonial, and Gothic Revival. The western end of the city features many large properties and historic houses, such as Hawthorn Hill, home of Orville Wright. The houses in this area tend to lie on well secluded plots of land, surrounded by many trees.

Because of Oakwood&#x27;s affluence, there is a general societal push for beautification. Run-down houses and unkempt lawns are generally frowned upon by the community; most lawns are well maintained. The city itself gives &quot;Beautification Awards&quot; to the judged most beautiful houses in order to maintain this high level of aesthetic awareness. The city has relatively strict zoning laws that restrict major changes to houses and require city approval for any planned structural additions. The city prohibits chain-link fences that can be seen from the street, and requires all external utility units (such as air conditioning units) to be obstructed from the view from the street.

Public architecture is a general source of pride for the Oakwood community. The city buildings were designed to incorporate the rich variation of traditional architectural styles found in the city&#x27;s houses. Oakwood High School displays an elaborate external design. The elementary schools, Edwin D. Smith Elementary School and Harman Elementary School, echo this elaborate style. Smith Elementary is built in the Tudor style like the High School while Harman Elementary is Colonial revival. The newest addition to the school system, the Julian and Marjorie Lange School, features Spanish revival architecture. The Oakwood Board of Education occupies a gray stucco manse with red tile roof in the northernmost area of Oakwood on Rubicon Road. Wright Memorial Library offers similar aesthetics, and the police and fire department is reminiscent of a French château.

Oakwood High School graduated its first senior class in 1924 and began the practice of the Baccalaureate ceremony at Westminster Presbyterian Church in downtown Dayton. The end of an Oakwood student&#x27;s experience is the Senior Awards, Baccalaureate, and Commencement ceremonies. Oakwood High School&#x27;s yearbook is &quot;The Acorn&quot;, and its newspaper is &quot;The Dome.&quot;

Oakwood&#x27;s educational system places a strong emphasis on post-secondary education. Oakwood High School is a national school of excellence. During the 2016–17 school year, Oakwood High School earned the highest performance index on state tests of any high school in the state. OHS’ index score was 92.0 on a 100-point scale, with no other high school in Ohio above 90. Oakwood High School&#x27;s English, mathematics, natural science, and foreign language courses are matched by many performing arts opportunities for its students. It is not uncommon for Oakwood&#x27;s top academic graduates to gain acceptance to some of the most selective universities and colleges in the United States and the world. Most graduates, however, attend schools within a 300-mile radius, with a large percentage remaining in Ohio. Oakwood High School is consistently ranked as one of the top 10 academic institutes in Ohio as well as one of the top 400 in the United States.

== Infrastructure ==
Oakwood is noteworthy for having traditionally hosted route 5 of Dayton&#x27;s historic trolleybus network, which is the second oldest of only four trolleybus networks still operating in the US, along with those of San Francisco, Seattle, and Philadelphia. In 2023, Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (GDRTA) deemed their trolley system obsolete, citing maintenance costs and investment in alternative technology. The trolley lines along Far Hills Avenue through Oakwood and Kettering had not been in use since 2016 despite being along major GDRTA routes service the southern suburbs of Dayton. In 2024, GDRTA, the City of Oakwood, and the city of Kettering partnered to remove the trolley infrastructure along Far Hills Avenue by 2025.

<doc id="129657" wikidata="Q476669" url="?curid=129657" title="Vandalia, Ohio">
<text>Vandalia is a city in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States, and a suburb of Dayton. Its population was 15,209 during the 2020 census. In addition to being the city closest to Dayton International Airport, Vandalia lies at the crossroads of I-75 and I-70.

==History==
On August 17, 1838, Benjamin Wilhelm, a settler from Pennsylvania, settled near what is now the intersection of U.S. Route 40 and US Route 25-A. He built his home and a small general store as a stop and resting place for travelers heading west. The small town began to attract travelers and businessmen, and on February 7, 1848, the town was incorporated as &quot;The Village of Vandalia&quot; with Benjamin Wilhelm as its first mayor. The village was laid out in 38 lots including a church, hotels, blacksmiths shops, a steam sawmill, meat markets, and a carriage shop. It was named after Vandalia, Illinois.

By 1959, Vandalia was outgrowing its &quot;village&quot; status, and its citizens voted to make it a council-manager form of government, effectively making the village into a municipal corporation. On January 2, 1960, Vandalia became a Charter City of the State of Ohio.

The Delphi Automotive manufacturing plant in Vandalia, which opened in the 1930s, cut back operations in 2003. It continued to operate &quot;through Delphi’s time in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, from October 2005 to October 2009,&quot; and was purchased by Mahle Behr in 2015.

Until 2005, Vandalia was home to the Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA), which moved to Sparta, Illinois after an expansion of the Dayton International Airport.

===Name===
Some records indicate that Benjamin Wilhelm, the town&#x27;s founder, settled in Vandalia on his way to Vandalia, Illinois. Instead, he stopped here and named his new town after his original destination. Others claim that the town was named Vandalia because the National Road was intended to extend to Vandalia, Illinois, but, for a time, it looked as though it would not do so. This doubt resulted in the name being used for a town along the Road in Ohio.

==Geography==
Vandalia is about north of Dayton on Dixie Drive (former U.S. Highway 25). It is between the Great Miami River and the Stillwater River. The city has been called the &quot;Crossroads of America&quot; due to its location on the National Road and the Dixie Highway. These correspond to U.S. Route 40 and former U.S. Route 25, which in turn, have been supplanted by two major expressways: east-west Interstate 70 and north–south Interstate 75.

West Carrollton was originally called Carrollton, and under the latter name was laid out in 1830. This change was said to have occurred in response to the amount of mail erroneously received for the second city of Carrollton, OH. Before its current city symbol, the symbol of West Carrollton was a simple pentagon. This resembled the city&#x27;s rich transportation history, as the small town at one point had five forms of transport running through it: train, canal, riverboats, trolleys and cars.

<doc id="129666" wikidata="Q311169" url="?curid=129666" title="Graham Greene (actor)">
<text>Graham Greene (born June 22, 1952) is a Canadian First Nations (Oneida) actor who has worked on stage and in film and television productions in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. He has achieved international fame for appearing in Kevin Costner&#x27;s &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), which earned him an Academy Award nomination. Other notable films include &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; (1995), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), &quot;Skins&quot; (2002), &quot;Transamerica&quot; (2005), &quot;Casino Jack&quot; (2010), &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2014), &quot;The Shack&quot; (2017), &quot;Wind River&quot; (2017) and &quot;Shadow Wolves&quot; (2019).

==Early life and career==
Greene is an Oneida born in Ohsweken, on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, the son of John, a paramedic and maintenance man, and Lillian Greene. He lived in Hamilton, Ontario, as a young man. Before moving into acting, he worked as a draftsman, steelworker and welder.

He worked as an audio technician for rock bands based in Newfoundland and Labrador, and later related that musician Kelly Jay repeatedly encouraged him to try out for a play.

A common misconception is that he graduated from the Toronto-based Centre for Indigenous Theatre&#x27;s Native Theatre School program. As he noted in a 2012 interview, he &quot;helped run it, as executive director of a school-supporting local arts organization&quot;. By the 1970s he began performing in professional theatre in Toronto and England and in 1976 he participated in the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s touring workshop performance of James Reaney&#x27;s &quot;Wacousta.&quot;

His television debut was in an episode of &quot;The Great Detective&quot; in 1979, and his film debut was in 1983 in &quot;Running Brave&quot;. On viewing his first television role, Greene stated that it was &quot;awful&quot;, and that it prompted him to start learning to act as a profession.

==Career==
=== Theatre ===
Greene frequently worked at the Native Earth Performing Arts, and is well known for his performance in &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot; as the affable drunk Pierre St. Pierre. He has also performed in &quot;The Crackwalker&quot; and &quot;History of the Village of the Small Huts.&quot;

In 2007, he appeared as Shylock in the Stratford Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; as well as &quot;Breakfast with Scot&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 1984 and 1986, Greene appeared in the First Nations&#x27; CBC TV series &quot;Spirit Bay&quot; as Pete &quot;Baba&quot; Green. The show was one of the first to show aboriginal life and the interactions between the native and white cultures.

In the early 1990s he found guest-star work in several television series. As Leonard Quinhagak on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; he portrayed a shaman that helped care for the residents. As a practitioner of shamanism, his character came into direct conflict with the show&#x27;s other doctor, a traditionally trained professional that (initially) had little use for unorthodox ways.

He was cast as Edgar &quot;K.B.&quot; Montrose, an explosives enthusiast, on &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. His character was asked what he thought of the movie &quot;Dances with Wolves,&quot; replying &quot;...the native guy (himself as &#x27;Kicking Bird&#x27;) was OK. Should have gotten the Oscar. But the rest of it was a yawn!&quot; Greene would portray this character periodically throughout most of the series run, from 1994 through 2006.

In 1992, Greene played the role of Ishi, the last Yahi, in the HBO drama &quot;The Last of His Tribe,&quot; and in 1994, he began appearing as Mr. Crabby Tree in the children&#x27;s series &quot;The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon.&quot;

Greene guested on the sketch comedy show &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; in 1994. Between 1997 and 2001 he hosted the reality crime documentary show &quot;Exhibit A: Secrets of Forensic Science&quot;.

He starred in the short-lived television series &quot;Wolf Lake&quot; in 2001 as Sherman Blackstone along with Lou Diamond Phillips. In 2002 and 2004, he co-starred in two made-for-TV films that were an attempt at launching a revival of the long-running Canadian series &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;. He also guest starred in five episodes of &quot;Being Erica&quot; as Dr. Arthur in 2010-11.

He appeared as himself in a parody of the famous Lakota-brand pain reliever commercials, on CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;.

In 2006, Greene presented the documentary series &quot;The War that Made America&quot;, about the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War) of the mid–18th century in North America.

He was a guest star in an episode of the TV series &quot;Numb3rs&quot; as a First Nations chief.

At the urging of actor Lou Diamond Phillips, Greene was cast as a recurring guest star on &quot;Longmire&quot;, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017 on A&amp;E and Netflix. As Malachi Strand, Greene was able to enjoy playing a villain, with the actor stating &quot;Playing villains is fun. Being nice all the time; it&#x27;s boring.&quot;.

In 2023, Greene guest-starred as &quot;Maximus&quot; in the &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot; episode of the same name, as well as episodes 8 and 10. He also guest-starred in episode 6 of &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

In 2024, Mr. Greene guest starred in a series, &quot;Tulsa King&quot; S2Ep9,&quot;Triad&quot; where he appeared as a medicine man by the name, &quot;Old Smoke&quot;.

=== Movies ===

==== &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; ====
Greene&#x27;s Academy Award–nominated role as Kicking Bird (Lakota: &quot;Ziŋtká Nagwáka&quot;) in the 1990 film &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; showcased his talents to audiences beyond his native Canada. In an interview with CineMovie, Greene recounts a story of being tossed from a horse during production. When director Costner asked if he wanted a break, the actor retorted that he was more interested in finding the horse for payback. He stated that it was difficult for him to learn how to speak the Lakota language properly. Having not grown up speaking a native language, he said &quot;...I couldn&#x27;t figure out how they ordered their language. Its structure is totally foreign to English or French.&quot;

He appeared in the contemporary action-mystery film, &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992), playing Walter Crow Horse, a gruff, savvy local cop living on an Indian reservation. He was quick to sign up for the movie, stating &quot;I love the Badlands. My agent said, &#x27;I got a film for you. It&#x27;s in South Dakota. And you have to ride a motorcycle.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m in.&#x27; &#x27;Want to read it?&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t have to.&#x27;&quot;

In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Maverick,&quot; Greene elicited good reviews as the sidekick to Mel Gibson. At a screening of the movie the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Greene, &quot;[as a] thoroughly modern Native American who exploits his position as a tourist attraction for Russian adventurers&quot;, got the most laughs.

Greene also acted alongside Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in the 1995 film &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, where he played Detective Joe Lambert.

==== &quot;The Green Mile&quot; ====
Greene was featured as Arlen Bitterbuck who was convicted of murder, awaiting execution on death row in the Oscar-nominated &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999). The character was an elder of the Washita Tribe and a member of a Cherokee Council, his nickname was &quot;The Chief&quot;. The character&#x27;s execution is the first witnessed in the movie, and is depicted from start to finish. As it is the first depiction of an execution in the movie, Greene&#x27;s death is noted as being a fairly accurate portrayal of the procedure.

Greene co-starred as Slick Nakai with Adam Beach and Wes Studi in the film &quot;A Thief of Time&quot; (2004) and &quot;Coyote Waits&quot;, both adapted from Tony Hillerman novels of the same names and produced by Robert Redford.

==== &quot;Transamerica&quot; ====

In 2005, he played the potential love interest of the female lead in &quot;Transamerica&quot;. A review of the movie praises Greene&#x27;s performance as having &quot;charming earthiness&quot; but also notes that his character is allowed to find the transgender character attractive as &quot;he&#x27;s allowed to be open-minded because he&#x27;s a Navajo -- in other words, a spiritually open-minded outsider, as opposed to your typical Middle American.&quot;

Greene worked with Aaron Sorkin on &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; in 2017. In his role as a judge, the actor recalled &quot;Aaron, the director, was looking at me sitting behind the bench. I had a puzzled look on my face. He said, &#x27;Are you all right?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yeah. I&#x27;ve just never seen the bench from this side before.&#x27;&quot;

Greene was cast in the Marvel Cinematic Universe miniseries &quot;Echo&quot; in 2022.

=== Other work ===
Greene provided the pre-recorded narration for &quot;Tecumseh!&quot;, the highly acclaimed outdoor show held in Ohio, based upon the life of the illustrious Shawnee chief of that name. He portrayed Sitting Bull in a short &quot;Historica&quot; vignette.

In 2018, Greene acted as the beleaguered Native-American elder Chief Rains Fall in the western-themed video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Greene and his wife Hilary Blackmore live outside of Toronto with a &quot;small army of cats&quot;. They were married in 1990, and have four children together. He enjoys writing, building boats and playing golf, noting &quot;I just want to go and play, I don&#x27;t care who&#x27;s looking. It&#x27;s a game where you get to play against yourself.&quot; He has stated that he has no interest in migrating south to California for roles. &quot;There&#x27;s no reason to live there. A working actor can live anywhere as long as you have a phone, a fax, and know where the airport is.&quot; Regarding his time playing Mr. Crabby Tree (and the follow-up role in the pre-teen show &quot;Eric&#x27;s World)&quot; he noted &quot;I spent a year paying penance doing kids&#x27; shows.&quot;

When discussing roles of native people, Greene noted that he would like to see depictions of &quot;his people&quot; as more than stoic: &quot;My people are very funny.&quot;

In 1997, Greene suffered a major depressive episode, and had to be hospitalized after a police encounter. He recovered after help from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.

In June 2008, he was awarded an honorary doctor of law degree from the Brantford campus of Wilfrid Laurier University.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada (CM) in the 2015 Canadian honours.

<text>Mount Gilead is a village and the county seat of Morrow County, Ohio, United States. It is located northeast of Columbus. The population was 3,503 at the 2020 census. It is the center of population of Ohio. The village was established in 1832, eight years after white settlers arrived in the region. Before their arrival, the forest was a hunting area for the Shawnee tribe.

Located in the center of the village is Morrow County&#x27;s historic World War I Victory Memorial Shaft, unique in the United States, and Mount Gilead State Park is nearby on State Route 95. Other areas drawing tourism include the Amish farms, shops and stores east of Mount Gilead, near Chesterville and Johnsville. Mount Gilead is also home to the Morrow County Hospital.

==History==
===Settlement===
The first settler to make Mount Gilead (Mt. Gilead) home was Lewis Hardenbrook, in 1817, though it was then called Whetstone and was located in Marion County. In 1824, Judge Jacob Young drew out the village; the plan consisted of 80 lots and also included a public square. Several years later, in 1832, Henry Ustick added 70 lots to the village as well as an additional public square. The original public square was then referred to as the south square and the newer square, the north square. Many years later, in 1919, the north public square would become home to the Victory Shaft World War I Monument. This monument was given to the county for having the highest per capita war bond sales during a two-year period. Charles Webster built the first cabin in the village in December 1824. He served as the first Postmaster and operated the Post Office from the cabin, as well. In 1832, a measure was proposed to change the name of the town. Residents were asked to vote between the names Warsaw and Mt. Gilead. Mt. Gilead was chosen by a significant margin and the village was incorporated by state legislature several years later in 1839.

In 1848, Mt. Gilead was almost unanimously chosen to be the county seat for the newly formed Morrow County, Ohio. Morrow County was formed from parts of surrounding Marion, Knox, Richland, and Delaware counties. Given the village&#x27;s elevated status as the county seat, village leaders enhanced many areas of the town&#x27;s appearance by creating streets clearing them and performing other improvements.

===Railroad===
Soon after being named county seat, there was talk of building a rail line that would pass through Mt. Gilead between Cleveland and Columbus. Officials opened stock purchases and began preparations for the build. Tensions between villagers and railroad officials broke down the negotiations and the rail station was re-located to Cardington, several miles south of Mt. Gilead, and opened for business in 1851. The railroad would pass Mt. Gilead two miles to the west, in what is now known as Edison. Nearly 30 years later, Mt. Gilead did get a rail spur through the village, named . The Short Line opened in 1880.

===Industry===
From its beginnings, industry has been a main support for Mt. Gilead. Various mills were an early staple in the village history, followed by a tile factory and with technological advances, eventually the still well known Hydraulic Press Manufacturing Company or HPM. HPM maintained some level of operations in Mt. Gilead until 2001.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Mount Gilead is considered to be a part of &quot;Mid Ohio.&quot;

<text>Dresden is a village in Muskingum County, Ohio, United States, along the Muskingum River at the mouth of Wakatomika Creek. The population was 1,650 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Zanesville micropolitan area. It was incorporated on March 9, 1835.

==History==
===18th century===
Dresden is located on or near the site of a Shawnee (Native American) village known as Wakatomika, which gave its name to Wakatomika Creek, the creek that empties into the Muskingum River near the northern edge of the village. These were the easternmost of the Shawnee villages, and the home of the most hostile of that tribe. David Zeisberger, the Moravian missionary, preached there in 1773 in an effort to convert them; but the wrongs done to Chief Logan and other Ohio Native Americans were discussed at this place with much rancor, and war parties had been going out from here against the white settlers in spite of attempts by the Delaware (tribe) to intercede. On August 7, 1774, Colonel Angus McDonald brought 400 men from Fort Pittsburg in the Wakatomica Campaign of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War to fight the Shawnee. The settlement of Wakatomika, as well as four other villages, was burned to the ground and three chiefs were taken prisoner.

In 1799, Jonathan Cass became one of the first settlers in the area, claiming 4000 acres of land. His family joined him in 1801. In 1875, the remains of Major Jonathan Cass were removed to the Dresden cemetery, by Dr. Edward Cass, and over the remains of the family in their final resting place has been erected a magnificent monument by the Cass family. Beneath the name of Jonathan Cass is this inscription: &quot;He was a soldier at the battle of Bunker Hill; an officer of the Revolution, and of the army, which, under General Wayne, gave peace to the frontier. From New England, he emigrated to this part of the wilds of the Northwestern Territory. On the military land he purchased, he lived a peaceful and quiet life thirty years, until death claimed him for a victim.

Seth Adams of Boston also settled the area in 1799 and is said to have cultivated the first tomatoes in the county from seed he got from New Orleans. He was also one of the first to plant apple trees and helped to introduce full blooded Merino sheep to the United States. He also built one of the first houses in Dresden.

===19th century===

In the 19th century Dresden was an important trading town on the Ohio and Erie Canal. A side cut canal linked the Ohio and Erie Canal with the Muskingum River. Mordecai Ogle settled on a farm about half a mile northeast of Dresden in 1802. In 1804, Seth Adams had a &quot;corn-cracker&quot; mill on Wakatomika Creek.

An election was held in April 1805 to elect officers for Jefferson Township in the home of Henry Northrup. Seth Carhart, Valentine Johnson and Isaac Cordray were elected as trustees. John Wamsley and James Sprague were elected &quot;Overseers of the poor&quot;. James Wilcox and William Elben were elected as township fence viewers. Peter Reasoner and Jacob Jackson were elected &quot;listers and appraisers&quot;. Henry Northrup and James Tanner were elected &quot;supervisors of highways&quot;. At this same time, John Cain was township clerk. Since he wasn&#x27;t elected in this election, it is reasonable to assume there was at least one election held prior to this one in 1805.

Wyllys Silliman, the son-in-law of Major Jonathan Cass, operated a saw mill and grist mill on Wakatomika Creek in 1806. The dam for this mill washed away in 1832 and was never rebuilt. He also manufactured salt near his mills. On February 15, 1806, Isaac Cordray was elected Justice of the Peace, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Seth Carhart. On April 1, 1809, Joseph Scott was elected to the office without opposition.

In 1812, Seth Adams, who is thought to have been a partner or an agent of David Humphreys, was credited with planting the first tomatoes in the area with seeds he obtained from New Orleans. In 1812 Otho Miller and Jacob Houser were the first blacksmiths and Judge Stillwell was operating a ferry. In 1815, Joseph F. Monroe operated a distillery on his farm about four miles above Dresden on the Muskingum. He was among the first to plant peach and apple trees. He discontinued his distillery after the Ohio canal was finished.

The town of Dresden was laid out in 1817. This was also the year that the first merchant, Laban Lemert, opened for business out of a log house. In 1818, John Cordray began running a tavern out of a log cabin, on the site later occupied by the Akeroyd House. A few years later Abraham Smith took over the running of this establishment. Smith was to later teach school. At this time Peter D. Reasoner was also running a tannery, and a weaver from Maryland, Morgan Morgan, had set up shop as well.

Around 1819 the first physician, Benjamin Webb, came to the township. His son Nathan later succeeded him in the business. In 1821 Drs. Nathan Webb, senior and junior, established the first castor oil mill west of the Allegheny Mountains in Dresden, but they did not stay in the area long. In 1822 Laban Lemert expanded into the distillery business. By 1833 Henry and Benjamin Roop of Buffalo, New York decided to compete with Laban Lemert with their own distillery and became extensive distillers. 1822 also saw the beginning of the construction of the main line of the Ohio Canal in Jefferson Township, which was completed in 1829. The Dresden side-cut was ready for use in 1831.

In 1825, the first Presbyterian services were held in Dresden, occasionally in private houses, but usually in a log schoolhouse on the site of the Union school building. On May 14, 1836, Laban Lemert, G. W. Cass, William W. Bice, T. M. Barrow and Dr. A. H. Brown were appointed to a building committee to build the Presbyterian church. The building was actually started in the latter part of the year and finished in the spring of 1838. The building cost $1,500. In May 1852 the church got their first pipe organ. The building that currently houses the church on Chestnut Street was dedicated on February 29, 1880. In 1835 a brick building was erected on Main Street to house the Methodist Episcopal church. In 1852 it was replaced by a larger building at a cost of $3000.00. In 1839 the congregation of the Zion Protestant Episcopal Church was formed, with Rev. Cushman, rector; William Evans, senior warden and Benjamin Adams, junior warden. The first meetings of the Baptist church were held in 1840 in the old Market house until the frame church was built 1845–6. Starting in 1843, Father Gallinger held monthly services for the Roman Catholic Church in the home of G. A. Peffer. A frame church was built in 1847 and a brick one in 1890. 1852 also saw a small congregation of 24 people organized for the German Methodist Episcopal church. Services were held, first in the Market house and, later, in 1858, a frame church was built.

March 8, 1835, was the date of Dresden&#x27;s incorporation.

On July 30, 1838, A. Deffenbaugh published the first issue of the town newspaper, &quot;Dresden Chronicle&quot;. The newspaper was published under that name until 1842 when its name was changed to &quot;Journal&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot; ceased publication in 1844. In 1848, John W. Wallace published a single edition of a newspaper called the &quot;Visitor&quot;. There wouldn&#x27;t be another newspaper in Dresden until Wallace and Agnew produced the &quot;Advocate&quot; in 1850, which had a run of about two years. At that time a man by name of Mr. Sygford took over the paper and changed the name to &quot;The Intelligencer&quot;. In 1855 Bently took over ownership of &quot;The Intelligencer&quot;, who in turn sold the paper to M.B. Lovett, who suspended publication around 1877. In 1868, T. W. Peacock and son started a second newspaper in the town called the &quot;Dresden Monitor&quot;, which they sold to J. A. Jackson a year later. Ownership of the &quot;Dresden Monitor&quot; then passed through the hands of L. M. Murphy, W. H. Conklin and J. T. Shryock successively. Shryock ran the paper successfully for two years before selling the paper to John W. Martin, who changed its name to &quot;Herald&quot; and continued publishing it for another six months. In 1874 James W. Wheeling established a newspaper called &quot;Dresden Doings&quot; which he published bi-weekly. In September 1878 he sold his paper to W.E. Smith. Smith began publishing the paper weekly and continued publishing the &quot;Doings&quot; until 1879 when it became &quot;The Dresden Transcript&quot;. The &quot;Transcript&quot; was still being published weekly as of January 2013.

1848 also was the year a telegraph line from Zanesville to Wooster passed through Dresden and a telegraph office was opened. The office closed several years before Western Union opened its office in 1868.

In 1852, together with several other prominent citizens, George Willison Adams formed a stock company to build the third suspension bridge in the United States across the Muskingum river near Dresden. When the other members of the company became fearful that the plan was not feasible and that they would lose their money, Adams built the bridge at his own expense, his nephew, George Copeland, was the bridge&#x27;s engineer. It was 1000 feet in length, cost $30,000.00 and was made from materials manufactured in Dresden. The bridge was run as a toll bridge for several years before Adams eventually sold the bridge to the county commissioners for one-third of the original building cost of the bridge. The bridge was eventually destroyed in the Great Flood of 1913.

Also in 1852, L. J. Lemert opened the first bank in Dresden. In 1866 G. Eaton established the second bank in Dresden.

===20th century to present===
The early spring of 1901 saw the beginning of construction of the Dresden telephone exchange. The first subscribers were connected by November 1901.

Dresden is the birthplace of the Longaberger Company, famous for handmade maple splint baskets. Started in 1919 by the J.W. Longaberger family, the company employed nearly 2,000 people as the largest manufacturer of handmade baskets in the United States. The company liquidated in 2018. It is the home of &quot;The World&#x27;s Largest Basket&quot;, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

The Dresden Plant, a natural gas power plant, was built south of Dresden. It began commercial generation in 2012.

Frazeysburg is located in the Tri-Valley Local School District, with children attending school in Frazeysburg for grade school and schools in Dresden for intermediate and high school.

The original Frazeysburg High School building was built in the early 1900s, with the sports teams known as the Red Raiders (thus the reason state route 16 in northwest Muskingum County is named Raiders Road). The school was renamed Frazeysburg-Nashport High School after the closure of Nashport High School due to the creation of Dillon Lake. In 1966, Frazeysburg-Nashport High School merged with Jefferson High School and Adamsville High School to form Tri-Valley High School, which was constructed in Dresden. The old high school building in Frazeysburg then served many years as a junior high school for students from Nashport, Frazeysburg, and Dresden. It then served as an Intermediate School, containing fifth and sixth graders. The old high school was torn down in August 2008, with a time capsule being discovered in the building.

<text>Zanesville is a city in and the county seat of Muskingum County, Ohio, United States. Located at the confluence of the Licking and Muskingum rivers, the city is approximately east of Columbus and had a population of 24,765 as of the 2020 census, down from 25,487 as of the 2010 census. Historically the state capital of Ohio from 1810 to 1812, Zanesville anchors the Zanesville micropolitan area (population 86,183) and is part of the greater Columbus-Marion-Zanesville combined statistical area.

== History ==

Zanesville was named after Ebenezer Zane (1747–1811), who had blazed Zane&#x27;s Trace, a pioneer trail from Wheeling, West Virginia, to Maysville, Kentucky, through present-day Ohio. In 1797, he remitted land as payment to his son-in-law, John McIntire (1759–1815), at the point where Zane&#x27;s Trace met the Muskingum River. With the assistance of Zane, McIntire platted the town and opened an inn and ferry by 1799. In 1801, Zanesville was officially renamed, formerly Westbourne, the chosen name for the settlement by Zane.

From 1810 to 1812, the city was the second state capital of Ohio. The National Road courses through Zanesville as U.S. Route 40. The city grew quickly in the 1820s through 1850s. Zanesville and Putnam (eastern side of Muskingum River), from the 1840s until the American Civil War broke out, was part of the Underground Railroad. In excess of 5,000 Union soldiers, along with hundreds of townsfolk, were stationed in the Zanesville area to protect the city in 1863 during Morgan&#x27;s Raid. Novelist Zane Grey, a descendant of the Zane family, was born in the city.

After the Civil War, the city grew in size and gained prominence in the State for manufacturing and textiles. The city was also notoriously known for its bootlegging activities in the Prohibition era. From the 1820s until the 1970s, downtown Zanesville was the premiere economic center of the city with various factories, offices, small to large stores, many hotels, over a dozen stages and movie theaters, nearly twenty churches, and nearby neighborhoods (inhabited mainly by persons of Irish or German ethnicity).

In 1872, Zanesville annexed the adjacent community of Putnam. It is now the Putnam Historic District of Zanesville.

The city was historically known as a center for pottery manufacturing; in the first half of the 20th century, more than a dozen potteries operated in the city and the surrounding areas. Bolstered by ample local clay deposits and rivers, the area produced both art pottery and functional, utilitarian pottery. Notable pottery manufacturers that operated in the area included Weller Pottery, J. B. Owens Pottery Company, Roseville Pottery, American Encaustic Tiling Company, and the Mosaic Tile Company. The city peaked economically in the 1950s, and like many cities experienced a post-industrial decline. In the 21st century, it has a relatively high level of chronic poverty and unemployment and a relatively low level of labor force participation and educational attainment.

== Geography ==
Zanesville is located along the Muskingum River at its confluence with the Licking River. It is located west of Cambridge and east of Columbus. The National (Cumberland) Road and its successors U.S. Route 40 and Interstate 70 cross the Muskingum at Zanesville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The area has important deposits of clay which were exploited by a number of pottery companies in the first half of the twentieth century, including Roseville Pottery, Weller Pottery, the J. B. Owens Pottery Company, the Zanesville Stoneware Company, the Mosaic Tile Company, the American Encaustic Tiling Company, and the T.B. Townsend Brick Yard under the ownership of T.B. Townsend.

== Demographics ==
In the 1950s, Zanesville was known for its population of light-skinned Blacks who could &quot;pass&quot; (be admitted to whites-only places). This characteristic was due to a history of racial intermixing dating back to the role of Zanesville as a stop on the Underground Railroad.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Lorena&quot; was a campfire song during the American Civil War. The song was based on an ill-advised love affair that took place in Zanesville in the late 1850s. The song has been sung in many Westerns and Civil War movies, and John Ford used the song as background in some movies.

<text>Clay Center is a village in Ottawa County, Ohio, United States. The population was 262 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Clay Center derives its name from originally being the center of a larger Clay Township. When Ottawa County was founded in 1840, Allen Township did not exist, but was the northern half of a larger Clay Township. When the Townships split in 1888, Clay Center became a part of Allen Township.

The town was founded by William Clark, a land speculator who believed a town in the center of the large township would be more likely to grow than the southern population center, Genoa. In 1883 Clay Township and Genoa discussed building a new Town Hall, and it was decided that Clay Township would help construct the building in downtown Genoa, instead of the geographic center in Clay Center. Local tradition states that this was the reason for Clay Township splitting in two a few years later.

<text>Genoa is a village in Ottawa County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,232 at the 2020 census. Originally settled as Stony Ridge, it took its present name in 1856 and was incorporated as a village on September 7, 1868.

==History==

In 1835, Timothy and Cinderella Sherman, with their two-year-old son Phillip, became the first people of European descent to settle in what is now Clay Township. Other settlers sprinkled into the Great Black Swamp and the area became known as Stony Ridge, likely due to the limestone bedrock sticking out of the ground and swamp.

Ultimately the town owes its existence to a cost-saving decision by the executives of the Toledo, Norwalk, and Cleveland Railroad. In an effort to eliminate eleven miles from the planned railroad line that was to connect Toledo and Cleveland, the railroad opted not to connect Woodville and Perrysburg on the line but instead to proceed in a straight line from Fremont to Toledo. The farmers around Stony Ridge happened to fall on this line. In 1851 work began on the line running through Stony Ridge. During the fall of 1852, iron imported from England was laid down and on December 22, 1852, the first passenger train rolled through a swampy wilderness. Stony Ridge began to develop immediately; within two years there was a saw mill, post office, hotel, and other businesses. Settlers from the East Coast and Europe began to arrive immediately, and churches were founded. Genoa quickly became a prominent source of limestone and with its position on a railroad the area quarries began distributing &quot;Genoa White Lime&quot; across the region.

Stony Ridge was renamed Genoa in the spring of 1856, likely to settle confusion with another Stony Ridge, Ohio, just seven miles away. That year the first Genoa school was built, which still exists as Heritage Hall.

With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 the nation-wide call for troop mobilization went out and Genoa, having a railroad station and thus a connection to the outside world, saw more than one hundred commit themselves to various regiments. The Toledo Blade remarked in 1862 that &quot;few towns have done as well as Genoa in furnishing troops for the Union Army.&quot;

After the Civil War the community grew more rapidly, in 1868 members of the community petitioned the Ottawa County Commissioners for incorporation and on December 10, 1868, Genoa was incorporated as a village. In 1869 the village purchased the aforementioned school house and it became the village&#x27;s town hall.

From 1883 to 1884 the village and Clay Township jointly constructed a new two-story town hall and opera house. After falling into disrepair by the 1970s, the town hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and was restored with a $755,000 grant from the federal Economic Development Administration in 1978-1979. The Town Hall continues to house the village council chambers, mayor&#x27;s office, and Genoa Civic Theater.

<text>Marblehead is a village in Ottawa County, Ohio, United States. The population was 865 at the 2020 census. It sits at the tip of the Marblehead Peninsula, which divides Lake Erie proper from Sandusky Bay. Marblehead is part of the area that is referred to regionally as Vacationland (which includes nearby Sandusky and the Lake Erie Islands) due to the large number of tourists who flock to the area in the summer months. It remains a popular vacation destination due to its lake frontage, ferry service to the Lake Erie Islands, quality sport fishery, the nearby Lakeside Chautauqua, and the Cedar Point amusement park. Marblehead is also home to the Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve, home to the only natural U.S. population of the Lakeside Daisy, an endangered species.

Marblehead is home to the Marblehead Lighthouse, the oldest continuously-operating lighthouse on the American side of the Great Lakes. The lighthouse is a part of the Marblehead Lighthouse State Park located within the village. Marblehead is also home to a United States Coast Guard station. Nearby, in Sandusky Bay, is Johnson&#x27;s Island, a former Confederate officer prisoner of war camp during the Civil War.

Marblehead is also commercially important as a major limestone producer. The limestone is mined in nearby quarries and transported by conveyor belt to the Marblehead loading dock, where it is loaded on commercial lake freighters. The blocks of stone used to construct the Stannard Rock Light on Lake Superior were cut at Marblehead and hauled to the site from 1877 to 1881.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Marblehead, as with much of the Great Lakes region, has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), characterized by four distinct seasons. Lake Erie moderates the climate, especially in late spring and fall, when air and water temperature differences are maximal. Fall temperatures tend to be warmer than the inland areas, while spring temperatures tend to be cooler than inland areas. However, this effect is lessened in the winter because Lake Erie (unlike the other Great Lakes) usually freezes over, coupled with prevailing winds that are often westerly.

The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). January has the lowest average temperature of the year of 24.6 °F (-4.1 °C).

<text>Put-in-Bay is a resort village located on South Bass Island in Put-in-Bay Township, Ottawa County, Ohio, United States, west of Cleveland and east of Toledo. The population was 154 at the 2020 census.

The village is a popular summer resort and recreational destination. Ferry and airline services connect the community with Catawba Island, Kelleys Island, Port Clinton, and Sandusky, Ohio.

The bay played a significant role in the War of 1812 as the location of the squadron of U.S. naval commander Oliver Hazard Perry, who sailed from the port on September 10, 1813, to engage a British squadron just north of the island in the Battle of Lake Erie.

==Location and area==
Put-in-Bay is located northwest of Sandusky.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

== History ==
The first known people to use the island were various groups of Native American tribes, including the Ottawas, Miamis, Shawnee, Senecas, Iroquois, and the Eries. The island provided shelter during crossings of Lake Erie. Some remains were discovered when a section of the island was plowed.

In 1679, Robert LaSalle and thirty-two of his men were the first to sail a large vessel in the Great Lakes: the &quot;Griffon&quot;. They would transport fur and pelts from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Queensland, Ontario. Stopping at Middle Bass Island, they found unique undiscovered flowers. They named the island Isle des Fleurs because of the flowers; this name was used for the next 200 years.

During the War of 1812, Put-in-Bay was an important base of operations for the US Navy fleet commanded by Oliver Hazard Perry. Perry and his fleet arrived at the island on August 16, 1813. They used the island to train and to spy on the British, who were located at Fort Malden, Ontario, Canada. At that point, the war had been going on for 32 months and developments had favored the British: Detroit had surrendered to them, and all American invasions of Canada had been repulsed. On September 10, 1813, Captain Robert H. Barclay, the commander of the British ships, was seen by a lookout on Perry&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Lawrence&quot;. Perry and his fleet hid behind the Bass Islands and waited for the British to unknowingly cross their path. The battle began at 11:45 in the morning about eight miles away from Put-in-Bay, with the British fleet caught by surprise. By around 3:00 of that day Perry and his fleet had defeated the British, who lost control of Lake Erie along with their entire fleet of six ships. This event was a major turning point in the war.

Two iconic American Navy slogans originated from these events: &quot;Dont Give Up The Ship&quot; and &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours.&quot;.

Between 1820 and 1830 the island was under the jurisdiction of Huron County, Ohio, but it was later joined to Ottawa County, Ohio. Put-in-Bay Township was established after 1830. The island was only sparsely inhabited and there was no actual village prior to the creation of the township. The first known white resident of the island was Alexander Ewen, who had about 1,000 hogs roaming the island in 1810.

The abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s son John Jr. lived in Put-In-Bay, &quot;growing grapes for the Chicago market&quot;, from 1862 until his death in 1895. His brother Owen also lived there before moving to Pasadena, California.

== Memorial ==
Put-in-Bay is the site of Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial commemorating Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s September 10, 1813, naval victory over British ships in the War of 1812. Construction of the monument began in 1912 and it opened to the public on June 13, 1915. It is tall and made up of 78 layers of pink granite, topped with an eleven ton (10 metric ton) bronze urn. Its height makes it the highest open-air observatory operated by the U.S. National Park Service. The remains of six naval officers, three Britons and three Americans, were interred beneath the floor of the monument&#x27;s rotunda.

==Transportation==
===Ohio state routes===

===Airports===

* Put-in-Bay Airport offers a single, unlit, paved 2870-foot runway in addition to a helipad.
* North Bass Island Airport located on North Bass Island, offers a (549.9 m) paved airstrip.

==Tourism==
For most of its history, the island&#x27;s primary industry has been tourism and continues to be today. The tourist season runs roughly between April and October. The most common methods of transportation to and from the island are via ferry boat, propeller-driven aircraft and private boat.

One of the world&#x27;s largest hotels, the Hotel Victory, opened its 625 rooms to the public in 1892. The four-story hotel featured a one-thousand-seat dining room. However, on August 14, 1919, the giant hotel burned to the ground. Today only parts of the foundations can be seen at the state campground.

Other historical sites include:

* Stonehenge Estate – An estate with 19th-century buildings that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* Perry&#x27;s Cave – Cave discovered by Native Americans. Perry sent men here during the War of 1812 (Battle of Lake Erie). Has an underground lake from which Perry&#x27;s men obtained drinking water, after previously drinking from the bacteria filled Lake Erie water and getting sick. The water in the cave was clean and thus by drinking it, his men returned to health in order to win the battle.
* Heineman&#x27;s winery and Crystal Cave – the world&#x27;s largest geode.
* Lake Erie Islands Historical Society – 6,000 square foot (560 m2) museum that houses artifacts, memorabilia and genealogical data pertinent to the Lake Erie Islands.

There are under 150 full-time South Bass Island residents, most of whom remain on the island over the winter. Supplies and perishables are flown to the island during the winter months along with the mail, parcels, and bank employees who staff the island&#x27;s only bank (for one day a week) until the spring. The island has a single school that is used for grades kindergarten through 12 and serves the educational requirements of Middle Bass and North Bass islands as well. These students arrive by plane, boat, or ATV across the frozen lake, depending on the season and weather.

Put-in-Bay has one grocery store, one hardware store, one school—which houses the one lending library branch—one fuel station, a post office, one bank, and two cemeteries. It has one seasonal franchise restaurant, Subway. There is no cinema. The island does not have a hospital, but does have an Emergency Medical Service that can use a Life Flight helicopter to transport critically ill patients to mainland medical facilities.

In 1952–1959, as well as 1963, the island held road races around a course. In 2011, the Put-in-Bay Road Races Reunion returned to the island. The temporary road course set up at the Put-in-Bay Airport during the event was a key step in pointing the way to the return of real vintage sports car racing to the island for 2012.

The Boy Scouts of America hold an annual camporee at the base of Perry&#x27;s Monument.

<text>Antwerp is a village in Paulding County, Ohio, United States, along the Maumee River. The population was 1,676 at the 2020 census.

Antwerp is the nearest village to the Six Mile Reservoir, the site of the Reservoir War in 1887. Antwerp is the birthplace of Asa Long, the checkers player. The place is named after the Belgian city of Antwerp.

==History==
Antwerp is located in the former wetland region known until the 19th century as the Great Black Swamp. Antwerp was founded in 1841 on the Wabash and Erie canal and the center of town moved to its present location when the railroad was extended to that point. The village was named after Antwerp, in Belgium.

In the late 19th century, Antwerp was the largest village in Paulding County; its economy was driven by lucrative local logging and tile mill industries. Accordingly, when the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway decided to erect a train station in the village, it was built larger than stations in most other communities in the region. After the train station closed in 1976, it was purchased by the local historical society; today, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Antwerp Norfolk and Western Depot.

<text>Paulding is a village in and the county seat of Paulding County, Ohio, United States. It is located predominantly in Paulding Township about southwest of Toledo. The population was 3,555 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Paulding was a planned community, founded in 1848 at the center of the county, and named after the county by speculators who expected to profit by moving the county seat. In 1851, the county seat was moved from Charloe, which had been the county seat for a decade; prior to that, court was held at New Rochester.

The town square is devoted to the courthouse, an orange brick structure surrounded by trees upon a spacious lawn. In the centennial year of 1876, the county commissioners determined to build a new courthouse, and visited many courthouses, finally deciding to erect a duplicate of the courthouse in Adrian, Michigan at a cost of $40,000. The courthouse was finished in 1886.

Built in the 1910s, the Paulding County Carnegie Library was the first Carnegie library to serve an entire county instead of a single city.

==Economy==
Paulding is largely a bedroom community.

At one point, Paulding had a factory processing sugar from beets, and another processing ketchup from tomatoes, but both factories have ceased production and neighboring farms no longer produce those crops. At one point, Paulding boasted of three local elevators - Equity Exchange, Paulding Grain and Seed, and the Farm Bureau - but the loss of rail service, most grain is trucked elsewhere. Paulding was once home to Betty Zane popcorn, but that disappeared in the early 20th century.

Many manufacturing facilities have come and gone, producing such products as glass mailboxes, ink wells, and brake linings. A number of small factories exist, but the largest single employer in the Village is the government, with Paulding Exempted Village Schools being the largest organization. Many residents commute to industrial jobs, often in neighboring counties.

==Education==
Paulding High School sports participate in the Green Meadows Conference, an athletic body sanctioned by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA).

The school on Water Street is one of the largest schools in the state providing elementary education. In many districts, elementary schools are kept small so students can walk to school. The graduating class of 1970 included the last Paulding students who experienced a one-room schoolhouse, as they had attended the first grade at Emerald. That was a fairly pleasant transition, unlike 1971, when many county residents were outraged to learn Dr. Martin Essex of the Ohio State Board of Education had revoked the charters of 4 of the 6 Paulding County schools, asserting that they were too small to offer a good education. Auglaize-Brown asked to join the Paulding Exempted Village School district, while the Grover Hill, Blue Creek, and Payne Local School Districts merged into the new Wayne Trace school district.

==Media==
The dominant daily newspaper is the Defiance Crescent-News with some readers choosing the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, Toledo Blade, and Lima News, in that order. The local weekly is the Paulding County Progress. Paulding residents are part of the Fort Wayne, Indiana television market. The local radio station is WMYW-FM broadcasts at 102.7 FM. WPAU is an online streaming radio station offering a commercial-free format of oldies and Paulding County high school sports. Also licensed to Paulding is WKSD 99.7 FM, a commercial oldies and sports radio station based in Van Wert.

==Transportation==
Paulding is at the intersection of US Highway 127 and State Route 111 and the terminus of State Route 500. It was formerly on the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, but the tracks were removed in the 1980s.

<text>Corning is a village in Perry County, Ohio, United States. The population was 488 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally named Ferrara, the town was focused on farming along the Sunday Creek Valley. That would change when the Atlantic and Lake Erie Railway completed the Moxahala tunnel in 1879. By 1880, Joseph Rodgers sold over 8,000 acres along Sunday Creek to the Ohio Central Coal Company. With New York capitalists investing heavily in the coal camp, the town was soon renamed Corning. A post office has been in operation at Corning since 1880.

Known as one of the most lawless towns in the state, Corning can only be compared to violent mining towns such as Tombstone, Arizona, or Deadwood, South Dakota. In addition to shootouts and murders, Corning saw several violent events that made it famous. On September 19, 1880, the Ohio National Guard battled white coal miners trying to force out newly arrived African American miners. The Battle of Corning, or the Corning War, was the first time the Ohio National Guard shed blood in defense of the state.

In 1884, the town witnessed an Irish Catholic Feud between local parish Priest Father Bernard O’Boylan and saloon owner Andy McDevitt. Known as the Corning Church War, the feud gained national attention and grew Corning’s reputation. After several mine strikes during the early 1890s, Corning served as the unofficial site of “insurgency” against the leadership of the newly formed United Mine Workers of America.

At a meeting between Ohio and West Virginia miners at the Mercer Hotel, Richard L. Davis, an African American miner and labor organizer from Rendville, was denied service at the restaurant. In 1895, the Mercer Hotel became the first Ohio business punished under the state’s anti-discrimination laws. The incident at the Mercer Hotel represented the “High Water Mark of the Color Line in Ohio,” establishing a boundary between acceptable and unacceptable segregation of African Americans across the state.

==Geography==
Corning is located along Sunday Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<text>Crooksville is a village in Perry County, Ohio, United States, along Moxahala Creek. The population was 2,418 at the 2020 census. It was the home of Hull pottery, one of the best known Ohio potteries.

==History==
Crooksville was founded around 1874 by the U.S. Postal Service at the request of founders Jacob Reed and his partner Joseph Crooks, Crooksville has continued to thrive for the past 126 years. Located off State Rt. 93 in Perry County, the Village has worked diligently over the years to keep the environment friendly for families and business. Sometime earlier between 1820 and 1825, Jacob Reed, a young and prosperous man from the East struck out looking for a company in which to invest his money and double his fortune. On the way he met his bride, Lydia, and eventually the two of them found the heavily timbered land that is now Crooksville.

Reed negotiated with the federal government for a parcel of land along the Moxahala Creek and received a warranty deed signed by President James Monroe. He started his empire with a lumber mill and farm, the sales from which enabled him to purchase more land until he had acquired upward of 300 or 400 acres.

In 1856 the railroad passed through the Reed farm on its way between Zanesville and New Lexington. Due to concessions Jacob Reed made to the railroad, a spur was built onto his property for the benefit of the community over which he built a warehouse for his grain and named Reed Station. The local freight train also carried a passenger car and stopped by flag to discharge and receive passengers.

During this period, more farms had also cropped up around the Reed properties, most of which had a small kiln for making functional pottery. Because these kilns and the clay for making pottery were normally kept in small, unheated buildings, production could only happen from spring through fall, which spurred the nickname “bluebird potteries”. Firing up in spring when the bluebirds returned from their winter migration, and ending when they’d headed south again.

The area grew and gained in population creating the need for building materials, dry goods, churches, schools and a host of other creature comforts. In addition to being rich farmland, the area produced deep veins of clay and coal, creating a thriving pottery and coal mining industry.

In 1870 Joseph Crooks purchased a small strip of land near the railroad and set up a general store. At this time, the nearest post offices were at McCluney and Roseville, there was no mail route passing through. Some person would usually visit the post office once a week and bring back the neighbors’ mail along with theirs. Because of this Joseph Crooks circulated the necessary petition to submit to the Federal Government in hopes of having a post office established to be known as “Reeds Post Office”. At the same time, he made application for the appointment of the office of Postmaster. The Post Office Department in Washington reported back favorably to the establishment of a post office and Crooks appointment as postmaster, but advised that due to the fact that there was already a “Reeds Post Office” in Ohio, it would have to be given some other name. They suggested that the office be known as “Crooksville”. According to the book History of Crooksville by Guy E. Crooks, son of Joseph: “This suggestion was pleasing to my father.”

In 1894 the population of Crooksville had grown to approximately 800 and the residents took the necessary steps to have the Village incorporated.

<text>Somerset is a village in Perry County, Ohio, United States. The population as of the 2020 census was 1,481. It is located 9.5 miles north of the county seat New Lexington and has a dedicated historical district. Saint Joseph Church, the oldest Catholic church in Ohio, is located just outside Somerset on State Route 383.

==History==
The village of Somerset was established in 1807 by settlers from Somerset, Pennsylvania at the spot on Zane&#x27;s Trace located midway between Lancaster and Zanesville. Seven years later, parts of Fairfield, Muskingum, and Washington counties were merged to create Perry County, and the house of a Somerset resident was named the first temporary courthouse. In 1819, the county government arranged for the erection of a purpose-built courthouse in Somerset; while most of the building was used for a jail, it also included a courtroom and space for some county offices. Ten years later, a permanent courthouse was constructed on the village&#x27;s public square.

As the village of New Lexington grew in importance, its residents began to agitate for the county seat to be moved to their community. From 1851 to 1859, the state legislature passed three separate laws to permit the county seat to be moved; contentious elections and a decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio saw the county seat move to New Lexington, back to Somerset, and finally back to New Lexington. After it ceased to be used as a courthouse, the building was leased to Somerset for use as its village hall.

<text>Ashville is a village in Pickaway County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,621 at the 2020 census. Ashville is located 17 miles south of Columbus and 8 miles north of Circleville.

==History==
Long before the American settlement of Ohio, Hopewell Native Americans inhabited the lands that became Ashville. The Snake Den Mounds were constructed a few miles outside of the present day village and were believed to have been built prior to C.E. 500. The site was examined in the late 1890s by Warren K. Moorehead, where he found artifacts of the ancient civilization and skeletal remains.

Centuries later the primary inhabitants were the Pekowi band of the Shawnee. This band of natives was the name sake for Pickaway County. The Pekowi people lived in the area for much of the 18th Century, but eventually left as America pushed westward.

=== Early American settlement ===
Ashville sits on land that had been acquired by Great Britain in 1763, following the defeat of France in the French and Indian War, but was prohibited to be settled by white settlers. When the United States claimed the region following the American Revolutionary War, the area became part of the Congress Lands East of Scioto River and was first surveyed in 1799 as part of the Scioto River Base Surveys.

Richard Staige (or Stage) Sr., born in Edinburgh, first settled the land that would become Ashville in 1808, after migrating from Virginia. Following his death in 1811, his sons Richard Jr. and William would each build a distillery on the family&#x27;s land, opening them the following year. Richard Jr. bought the 77.57 acres they inhabited from the Chillicothe Land Office on July 6, 1816. 
In 1837, Richard Jr. sold his distillery to Mahlon Ashbrook. By 1845, Ashbrook had also built a gristmill on Walnut Creek and owned a large store that was run by his sister Iva &quot;Ivy&quot; and her husband Daniel Kellerman, who went on to be the first postmaster of the town, which was named Ashbrook at the time. That same year, Ashbrook helped lay out the town with the building of 25 new houses.

In 1853, Ashbrook, was voted to the Railroad Committee for the speedy construction for rails to cover Ross, Pickaway, and Franklin Counties. The route of the railroad (like the canals before it) had a great effect on the success of the development of the area. Ashbrook manufactured barrels for the mill and distillery, and also had some outside trade in that line.

The Ashbrook businesses failed in 1855, following his endorsement of a promissory note for a friend. When the friend failed to pay, Ashbrook was in debt for tens of thousands of dollars and lost much of his wealth to his creditors. Ashbrook migrated west, leaving part of his family behind.

Like most of America, the town suffered a setback due to the Panic of 1857. The growth of the town was further hampered by the onset of the American Civil War.

===Railroad boom===

The construction of the Scioto Valley Railroad through Ashville, under the supervision of lead engineer Isham Randolph, began in 1874. This caused a new flurry of both population and economic growth, including the building of two new grain elevators. Railroad employees, most notably bridge builders, settled in the northern reaches of Ashville in what has become Little Chicago. A year later, in 1875, the post office was reestablished after it had been closed following the shuttering of the Ashbrook businesses and a train station was opened in 1876. Finally, after nearly 70 years following the original settlement, the village was incorporate as Ashville in the Spring of 1882.

In 1890, the population of Ashville reached 430 citizens and the area&#x27;s first volunteer fire department was created, as well as cisterns were built throughout the village. That same year, Norfolk and Western Railway acquired the Scioto Valley Railroad following its demise.
Over the next ten years, the village population grew at a rate of more than 50%. This was aided by the establishment of major businesses, which included the Scioto Valley Canning Factory that was built in 1899. The factory, which canned sweet corn, at its peak, employed 540 employees who were able to produce upwards of 200,000 cans of corn per day. Dozens of other businesses sprang up as well to accommodate the growth, including blacksmiths, a lumber yard, a hotel, and even an opera house.

In 1904, Scioto Valley Traction Company opened a railway in town that powered their engines by electricity using a third rail. This line sent passenger and freight traffic from Columbus to Chillicothe. The line operated until September 1930. The depot remains on West Main Street.

Around 1910, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (which later became CSX) was built on the western edge of town. With the construction several gandy dancers settled in Little Chicago. The workers were primarily of Greek and Bulgarian descent according to Census records. The population of the town had ballooned to over 970 by that time.

Following Ashville&#x27;s quick growth, it became the second most populated area in Pickaway County.

=== Small town status ===

Though the rail lines remained operational, the population growth of the village slowed. Over the next three decades the population grew by only 129 citizens. Additionally, the reduction of growth was compounded by the effects of the Great Depression.

A population spike happened again in the 1950s and 1960s as Ashville became a residential town when new homes started popping up west of Long Street. Though many businesses had fizzled out, new large employers began to target Ashville including Columbus Industries which opened their plant in 1970. During this time Ashville also became the hub of a newly formed school district when Teays Valley Local School District built their high school in 1963 and housed their district offices within the village.

The next major growth step happened in 1994 when home builders, such as M/I Homes, built the first modern subdivisions in Ashville. The two major subdivisions were Ashton Village and Ashton Woods, which are located on the northside of town. Both sites together brought in nearly 100 new homes.

=== Continued growth ===
Since 1990, Ashville remains one of the fastest growing areas in Pickaway County. Several new housing developments, apartments, and condominiums have been built and the expansion of Rickenbacker International Airport Global Logistics Park and the Norfolk Southern Railway Intermodal Terminal, that was built in 2008, have created thousands of jobs for the area.

==Geography==
Ashville is located in the Scioto River Valley and has an elevation of 715 feet (218 m) above sea level. The village is located in the till plain-area of Western Ohio and borders the Appalachian Plateau. The area is generally viewed to be a fertile region with gently rolling hills created by moraines.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

=== Glacial activity ===
The area on which present-day Ashville sits was effected by three glacial periods. Those periods were Pre-Illinoian Glaciation, Illinoian Glaciation, and Wisconsin glaciation.

* Pre-Illinoian Glaciation - The first impact of glaciers in Ashville occurred about 780,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch. The glacier, which stopped right at Ashville&#x27;s location, dammed the pre-glacial Teays River just south of the village, which created Lake Tight. The former Teays River would go on to become a significant aquifer for the area.
* Illinoian Glaciation - Approximately 190,000 to 130,000 years ago, a glacier once again covered the area. Much of the effects of this glacier were covered by the subsequent Wisconsin glaciation that started 100,000 years later.
* Wisconsin Glaciation - The last ice to be in the area began 35,000 years ago and ended approximately 12,000 years ago. The Laurentide Ice Sheet stretched into Ohio with the Lake Huron lobe being the most prominent major lobe. The Scioto minor lobe, which helped create the Scioto River, stretched over the area and created the modern day terrain.

=== Rivers, creeks, and brooks ===
The Village is part of the Walnut Creek watershed. Walnut Creek is a tributary of the Scioto River that forms the southern border of Ashville and runs into the river approximately 2.5 miles southwest of the village. The Walnut Creek is intersected by the Little Walnut Creek approximately .25 miles southeast of the village and by Mud Run, a brook that runs through the western fringes of the village, 1.7 miles southwest.

==Education==

=== Schools ===

==== Teays Valley Local Schools ====

Prior to 1963, Harrison Township and the village had operated Ashville Harrison School which graduated its last class in 1962, and had 44 students. The district combined with two neighboring districts in the Fall of 1962 to form Teays Valley. The district currently operates three schools within the village&#x27;s boundaries, which include Teays Valley High School, East Middle School, and Ashville Elementary.

==== Brooks-Yates School ====
Brooks-Yates was a school operated by Pickaway County Board of Developmental Disabilities that provided services to Pickaway County students with developmental disabilities. The school was moved to Teays Valley&#x27;s main campus in Ashville from Circleville in 2016. The school ultimately closed in 2021, following a decline in enrollment.

==== CSCC – Pickaway County Center ====

A regional campus of Columbus State Community College was once located at Teays Valley High School. As of 2022, the campus is no longer active.

=== Library ===

Ashville has a public library, located on Long Street. The Floyd E. Younkin Branch is part of the Pickaway County Library system and was opened in 1999 after local business owners, the Younkin family, donated funds to open the location.

==Arts and culture==

=== Churches ===

Five Christian churches operate within the village limits. The churches that are currently operating are Ashville Church of Christ in Christian Union, Heritage Church of Christ, First English Lutheran Church, Village Chapel Church, and Zion United Methodist Church. First English Lutheran was the founding member of the Ashville Food Pantry which is located on Long Street at the village&#x27;s center.

=== Community Park ===

Ashville has one public park which is called the Ashville Community Park. The 10-acre park was deeded to the community on April 4, 1921, with the stipulation that the village used it for athletic and park purposes, by a community club that had purchased the tract a year earlier for $3,000. The club also built an indoor shelter house before donating the land. Shortly after the acquisition, the village built a baseball field with concrete bleachers and a quarter-mile cinder track for community and school use. Ashville went on to install a playground, an outdoor shelter house, pickleball courts, basketball courts, restrooms and a gazebo. The park is host location of the annual Fourth of July Celebration and Viking Festival.

==== Fourth of July Celebration ====
Ashville&#x27;s Fourth of July Celebration has taken place since 1929, and annually brings thousands of people to the community. Hosted by the Ashville Community Men&#x27;s Club, the five-day event includes concessions, rides, a queen contest, a daily fish fry, musical entertainment, parades, and a community church service. The carnival is held at Ashville Community Park, at the village&#x27;s center. Fireworks cap the celebration on Independence Day night and are fired from the Teays Valley High School property.

==== Viking Festival ====
The Spring festival, which started in the mid-2000s, is a two-day festival that pays homage to ancient Scandinavian culture. Hundreds of people gather at the Ashville Community Park where reenactors take up the lifestyle of the Vikings and enjoy music, food, and handcrafted goods of the time period. A Viking ship replica is located at the center of the camp along with jousting and swordsmanship exhibitions. The festival was on a temporary hiatus in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the festival returned with the addition of a beer garden.

=== Museums ===

==== Ashville Depot ====
The Ashville Depot is a former, and the only remaining, train station for the Scioto Valley Railway. Built in 1876 and closed in 1976, this weatherboard building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is located at the intersection of Madison and Cromley Streets. The building acts as a meeting place and railroad museum. It is currently owned and operated by the Ashville Community Men&#x27;s Club.

==== Ohio&#x27;s Small Town Museum ====

In 1978, the Ashville Area Heritage Society opened what became Ohio&#x27;s Small Town Museum in a former silent film theater, known by locals as the Rocky Dreamland Theatre. The project was spearheaded by longtime village leader Charlie Morrison and researcher Bob Hines. The museum is home to local memorabilia including a 17-star United States flag, a buoy from the sunken battleship, USS &quot;Maine&quot;, and the still-working traffic light that was invented by resident Teddy Boor in 1932. The museum claims that the traffic light is the world&#x27;s oldest traffic light, a claim that the village itself supports. This claim was again supported by Guinness World Records by naming it the Oldest Functioning Traffic Light.

==== Old Town Jail Museum ====
The Old Town Jail Museum is located at the corner of Cherry and Long Streets. Built in 1886, the building served as police headquarters until 1988. In 2021, the village established a museum that pays tribute to the village&#x27;s criminal justice history.

<text>Circleville is a city in and the county seat of Pickaway County, Ohio, United States. The city is situated along the Scioto River, 25 miles (40 km) south of Columbus. The population was recorded to be 13,927 in the 2020 census.

Circleville is named after its original layout created in 1810, which was based upon the circular Hopewell tradition earthwork within which the city was built. This earthwork measured in diameter, and was constructed in the early centuries of the Common Era. The county courthouse was built in the center of the innermost circle.

In the late 1830s, for various reasons, residents requested authorisation from the state legislature to change Circleville&#x27;s layout to a standard grid format. This was accomplished by the mid-1850s. All traces of the Hopewell earthwork were destroyed, although hundreds of other monuments of its kind still remain in the Ohio Valley.

==History==
===Early history===

By the mid-18th century, the Lenape (Delaware Indians) were pushed west from Pennsylvania by European settlers flowing into the colony. The Lenape were given permission by the Wyandot people to settle in the Ohio country. One of their settlements was Maguck, a small village built before 1750 on the banks of the Scioto River. Modern Circleville was built to the north of this site.

Frontier explorer Christopher Gist was the first recorded European explorer of the Circleville area. On January 20, 1751, Gist visited Maguck, which had a small population of about 10 families. He wrote in his journal that he had stayed in the town for four days. Between the time of the establishment of the United States and of the city&#x27;s settlement, the land was owned by the US federal government (As opposed to other land in the county, which was part of the Virginia Military District).
Circleville was founded by European-American settlers in 1810, as people relocated westward after the American Revolutionary War.
One such settler was George Hitler Sr., who migrated to Circleville in 1799 with his wife and 4 children, with seven more being born in Circleville after they resettled. One of these children, Dr. Gay Hitler, used to be a dentist. Numerous features of the town are named after this family, these being two &#x27;Hitler&#x27; roads, Hubert Hitler Road, Hitler Pond, Hitler-Park, and Hitler-Ludvig cemetery. There is no connection between the family and Adolf Hitler, whose surname was defined much later.

===Establishment===
On January 12, 1810, Pickaway County was established by order of the Ohio General Assembly. On February 19 of that year, the assembly appointed David Bradford, George Jackson, and John Pollock to choose the location for the county seat. The men ventured across the county and inspected numerous sites. The Hopewell fortifications were still intact at this time, and were selected as the site for Circleville&#x27;s construction. A history of the county published in 1880 suggests that the men thought the site location would spur the preservation and maintenance of the Hopewell mounds. The group was subsequently assigned appointed director Daniel Dreisbach to oversee them on July 25. Dreisbach was to purchase the land, determine lots, and distribute them. At the time, the land was owned by Jacob Zeiger, Zeiger Jr., and Samuel Watt; Dreisbach purchased 200 acres for a sum of $800 to $900.

The first sale of property in the new town was followed with a celebration: a barbecue, and the manufacture of a several-hundred-pound wheel of cheese, which was transported to the barbecue on a sled. A competition for the honor of constructing the first house also took place. By 1827, the town had a population of 725 people, 102 individual houses, a courthouse, jail, government office building, a private and public school, one church, nine stores, three pharmacies, three groceries, and a market house. All buildings were made with brick, except the jail, which was made out of stone.

The settlement was formally incorporated as the town of Circleville in 1814, and it was made a city on March 25, 1853.
===Squaring the circle===
Over time, residents grew dissatisfied with Circleville&#x27;s unusual layout. Some believed the design was kept only due to &quot;childish sentimentalism&quot;, while others complained that the lots were irregular and inconvenient, and that a circular plan wasted space that could otherwise be used to generate revenue. Additionally, the space around the central courthouse had become unpresentable. People from the countryside would hitch their horses around the courthouse, which would draw hogs and domestic animals to the area and surrounding city.

In March 1837, at the request of the town, the Ohio General Assembly authorized the requested alterations given the consent of all property owners in the circle. In March 1838, after no activity, the assembly authorized alterations to any quadrant given consent from property owners in the quarter. The &quot;Circleville Squaring Company&quot; was created to convert the town plan into a squared grid, as was the typical style of platted towns. The southeast corner was the first to be altered later in March, followed by the northwest quarter in September. The northeast corner was only squared in 1849, and the southwest was reformed in 1856. This process required intense construction work, such as destroying, moving, or constructing buildings and grading and repaving roads. Due to these changes, no traces of the original earthworks remain aside from a section of elevated ground at the corner of Pickaway and Franklin streets.
A history of the county makes note that the citizens of Circleville regret the rare circular layout of the town was ever changed.

The only drawings of Circleville before its squaring were made by G. F. Wittich. He made sketches of the courthouse, the circle, and the other buildings in 1836. Wittich used these drawings along with information from residents to create a map around 1860, of which he produced a watercolour rendition in 1870.

===20th century===

During April 1967, Bingman&#x27;s Drug Store and several neighboring buildings on West Main Street in downtown Circleville were destroyed. Lee Holbrook, the husband of a drug store employee, brought a wooden box containing bundled dynamite into the store, wherein it detonated during a struggle with the store&#x27;s staff. Holbrook and four employees died in the blast and ensuing fire, and nearly thirty others were injured.

On October 13, 1999, an F-3 tornado hit the city, set off by a squall line moving through the region. The tornado touched down on the north side of town, dealing considerable damage to a barber&#x27;s shop and a masonry building. A furniture store also received a hole in its roof, and it was reported that items from inside the store were sucked out. Damage to nearby buildings occurred as the tornado moved east across the north-central part of town. The tornado moved into a residential area in the Northwood Park neighborhood, destroying several homes and damaging trees and vehicles.

=== Circleville letters mystery ===

Starting in 1977, residents began receiving mysterious letters from an unknown source identified only as &quot;Writer&quot;. The letters contained threats of violence and supposed blackmail, often as means of coercing the receiver to comply with the Writer&#x27;s will (e.g., voting for the Writer&#x27;s preferred candidate in the county election). On January 27, 1983, the Writer hung up a sign visible from the bus route of Circleville School, containing obscenities regarding the 13-year-old daughter of bus driver Mary Gillispie. Upon observation of the sign, Gillispie discovered a booby-trapped box containing a loaded gun, which was rigged to fire upon attempted removal of the sign. Gillispie and her husband Ronald had previously received letters from the Writer accusing her of engaging in an extramarital affair with school superintendent Gordon Massie. Ronald had been killed under mysterious circumstances 6 years prior, in August 1977.

While the Gillispies&#x27; brother-in-law Paul Freshour was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the boobytrap incident in 1984, letters continued to circulate during his imprisonment. It was only after Freshour&#x27;s release in 1994 that the Writer ceased threatening the residents of Circleville.

As of August 2024, the identity of the Writer remains unknown.

<text>Piketon is a village in Pike County in the U.S. state of Ohio, along the Scioto River. The village is best known for the uranium enrichment plant located there, which is one of only three such plants in the United States. The population was 2,111 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==

Originally called Jefferson, Piketon was the county seat of Pike County from 1815 to 1845, when James Emmitt, a wealthy local entrepreneur, influenced the transfer of the county seat to Waverly, due to its closer proximity to the then-new Ohio &amp; Erie Canal. Piketon is the location of the Pike County Fairgrounds and is served by the Scioto Valley School District.

Perhaps the best-known historic resident of Piketon was Robert Lucas, the twelfth governor of Ohio and first territorial governor of Iowa. Around 1824, Lucas built a large brick house two miles east of Piketon, named Friendly Grove, which became a center of local political activity.

Piketon is served by the Western and Piketon branches of the Garnet A. Wilson Public Library.

==Geography==

== Economy ==
The initial operation of the lead cascade of the American Centrifuge Demonstration Facility in Piketon, Ohio, in 2005 by Centrus Energy Corp. comprised the first publicly visible component of next-generation uranium enrichment technology in the United States that employed a gas centrifuge process rather than gaseous diffusion to produce enriched uranium. Piketon was expected to exhibit a growth economy during the early 21st century with the establishment of a full-size commercial uranium enrichment plant by 2012. However, in September 2015, the Department of Energy halted the project. Ohio Senator Rob Portman said, &quot;This news is a major blow to the Piketon community and southeast Ohio&quot;.

<text>Waverly is a village in, and the county seat of, Pike County, Ohio, United States, located about south of Chillicothe. The population was 4,165 at the 2020 census. The town was formed in 1829, as the construction of the Ohio and Erie Canal along the west bank of the Scioto River brought new growth to the area. In 1861, the county seat was moved here from Piketon.

Waverly is served by the Garnet A. Wilson Public Library.

==History==
===First inhabitants and native cultures===
Historians believe that Waverly and the surrounding areas were inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC. The first historical evidence that can be tied to a particular culture dates back to sometime between the years 1000 and 800 BC, to the culture known as the Adena. The area around Waverly is particularly rich in Adena heritage, including a number of mounds throughout the area. The Adena were given their from Thomas Worthington&#x27;s Adena Estate near Chillicothe, where evidence of their culture was found in the early 1900s.

There is evidence pointing to the emergence of the Hopewell culture in the Waverly area beginning about 300 BC. The namesake for the Hopewell is Captain M. C. Hopewell, the owner of the Ross County farmstead where artifacts leading to the discovery of the Hopewell&#x27;s separate cultural identity were found. Both the Adena and the Hopewell are well known for their mounds, many of which still exist around southern Ohio, including several in Pike County, and just north of Waverly in Chillicothe, Ohio, where the Adena Mound is a registered historic structure. There is evidence of Hopewell in the area until about 600 AD. The cause of the demise of the Hopewell is unknown, and there is not much information available about the people immediately following them. Sometime after 1000 AD, the Fort Ancient people began to occupy southern Ohio, only to disappear in the 17th century, likely decimated by infectious diseases spread in epidemics from early European contact. Some scholars believe that the Fort Ancient people &quot;were ancestors of the historic Shawnee people, or that, at the very least, the historic Shawnees absorbed remnants of these older peoples.&quot;

There is a historical gap between evidence of the end of the Fort Ancient presence in the Waverly area and the beginning of the presence of the Shawnee Native American tribe. It is not known whether the Shawnee were descendants of the Fort Ancient, but there are a number of similarities between the two cultures that have led some to speculate that this is the case. There is also evidence to suggest that Siouan nations such as the Mosopelea may be descendants of the Fort Ancient culture. As European settlements began to push into Ohio country, the Shawnee were driven further and further west, and there is an extensive record of the Shawnee&#x27;s clashes with settlers, including Tecumseh&#x27;s War and various battles of the War of 1812.

One of the most well-known leaders of the Shawnee tribe, Tecumseh, was born somewhere very close to Waverly, perhaps just north of the city&#x27;s site, in 1768. As early as the age of 15, after the American Revolutionary War ended in 1783, Tecumseh was fighting alongside other Shawnee to stop the white invasion of their lands by attacking settlers&#x27; flatboats traveling down the Ohio River from Pennsylvania. In time, Tecumseh came to lead his own band of warriors and his bravery and leadership have caused him to become an American folk hero and his legend still lives large in Waverly and the surrounding areas.

=== European settlement ===
Although Europeans had been in the area hunting, trapping and surveying for some time prior, not until approximately 1796 did the first Europeans began to settle in the area around Waverly, in what is now Pike County, Ohio. Pike County was named for General Zebulon Montgomery Pike, who was killed at the storming of York in Upper Canada in the war of 1812–15. He died during the war, on April 25, 1813, aged 35, and is considered a war hero, many landmarks and geographic areas being named after him.

Waverly was platted in about 1829 by a M. Downing, and it had 306 inhabitants by 1840. It was originally known as Uniontown; Francis Cleveland suggested changing the name to Waverly. He is believed to have done this because he was an admirer of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels.

=== The Ohio and Erie Canal ===
The Ohio and Erie Canal, which was completed to Waverly in the early 1830s, transformed the landscape of southern Ohio in many ways, and played a major part in the development of Waverly and its surrounding areas. The initial plan for the Canal&#x27;s route was likely not through Waverly, and it is believed that several noteworthy interested parties, including Robert Lucas and James Emmitt, had a hand in redirecting the route of the Canal to pass through or near their land, thereby benefiting them personally. Robert Lucas plotted the Canal right through his land near Jasper, while Emmitt had many interests in Waverly on the canal route, and owned the first canalboat to pass through the Canal, the &quot;Governor Worthington&quot;.

=== The battle for the county seat ===
After several years of political battle, the county seat of Pike County was moved from Piketon to Waverly in 1861, and Waverly remains the county seat to this day. In 1859, James Emmitt led a group of supporters to petition to remove the county seat to Waverly, which met with strong resistance from those with an interest in keeping the seat in Piketon which had been the county seat for over 45 years. To finally push the removal across the line, those in favor of moving the county seat to Waverly promised to provide a new courthouse as a gift to the people of Pike County in Waverly. This courthouse still stands on Second Street in Waverly.

Additionally, a number of parties including James Emmitt created a bridge across the Scioto River in Waverly, which up until that point had required chartering a ferry boat to cross – this was no doubt another incentive to move the seat to Waverly. In the end, despite a number of reported irregularities in the special election, the Waverly supporters were victorious, and on November 11, 1861, the county commissioners ordered the removal of the county offices to Waverly pending the completion of suitable rooms to accommodate the move, which happened shortly thereafter.

=== James Emmitt and The Historic Emmitt House ===
James Emmitt was one of Waverly&#x27;s most prominent inhabitants in the nineteenth century and was one of the wealthiest and most influential southern Ohioans of the time. Emmitt was involved in a number of successful ventures, including distilleries, mills, canal boat ventures and various manufacturing businesses. Perhaps the most well-known of Emmitt&#x27;s ventures is the Emmitt House, the restaurant and tavern that bore his name; it burned down in January 2014, having stood since 1861.

Carpenter Madison Hemings was involved in the building of the Emmitt House. Hemings is rumored to be the son of President Thomas Jefferson, whom Jefferson fathered with Sally Hemings, a slave owned by Jefferson. There has been some evidence linking Madison Hemings to Jefferson, but historians continue to debate the issue.

=== The Civil War through the atomic era ===
During the Civil War years of 1861-1865, Waverly was impacted by the conflict; more than 100 Pike County residents died. Morgan&#x27;s Raiders passed through Waverly in 1863.

Many Pike County residents represented the area through service in both World War I and World War II. The need for workers in war industries during World War II gave area residents alternatives to working on the farm or saw mill.

After World War II large farming operations began to consolidate their holdings by buying up smaller family farms. Pike County had 1,700 farms in 1940 but a short 30 years later the number had dropped to 450.

In 1953, the Federal Government chose Pike County as the location for the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, designed to enrich uranium. The time around the construction of the facility is still referred to as the &quot;Boom&quot;, as literally hundreds of new people flooded the county to construct, and later work, at the facility. During this time, government housing projects were undertaken, school facilities were expanded and improved, and many new businesses were started in Pike County. The plant covered nearly 4,000 acres and provided employment for over 2,000 workers at its height of operation.

===Racial segregation in Waverly===
Throughout the 19th century, Waverly was a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to live. In an 1884 history of the area, an anonymous author wrote that &quot;Waverly&#x27;s not having a single colored resident is a rare mark of distinction for a town of its size&quot; and that Waverly had never had &quot;a Negro or mulatto resident&quot;. Historian James W. Loewen cites Waverly as a rare example of a town that barred blacks as early as the Civil War, and asserts that the community was one of a number of Midwestern cities created for the purpose of excluding all races but whites. The Ku Klux Klan had a presence in Waverly dating back to a record of a Ku Klux Klan raid in 1885.

The area known as East Jackson, Ohio, about 7 miles east of Waverly on Ohio State Route 335, developed an interesting racial history and culture because its residents were excluded from Waverly as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;negro&quot;. After several generations many East Jackson residents identified as &quot;negro&quot; but appeared to be &quot;white&quot;. Many residents self-identify as being of Native American descent.

<doc id="129732" wikidata="Q777153" url="?curid=129732" title="Aurora, Ohio">
<text>Aurora is a city in northwestern Portage County, Ohio, United States. A suburb in between Akron and Cleveland, the population was 17,239 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

Some say Aurora was the name of the daughter of Major Amos Spafford, while others believe the village was named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn. The city is co-extensive with, and formed from, the former township of Aurora, which was formed from the Connecticut Western Reserve. Aurora was designated a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

== History ==

In 1799, Ebenezer Sheldon, a former Revolutionary War soldier, settled in Aurora and built a cabin on east pioneer trail. Shortly after, he brought his family from Connecticut to live in the new settlement. In 1807 alone, 72 settlers came to Aurora, and two years later, the first frame house was built. Most people in Aurora at the time lived along the three main roads; The Cleveland–Warren road, the Chillicothe Turnpike, and the Old Mill road. At the intersection of the three roads, inns and stores were built for settlers and travelers in Aurora. By the mid-1800s, the Chillicothe road was lined with shops, hotels, taverns, and a school. In 1862, one of the first cheese factories, the Silver Creek Cheese Factory, was built by Frank and Elisha Hurd. Ten years later, in 1872, the Aurora Station was constructed, and it became a major commercial area for the town. By the end of the 1800s, seven schools had been built, and the existing church in Aurora was also created.

In 1904, four million pounds of cheese was produced in Aurora cheese factories, making it the biggest cheese producer in the United States. One year later, Aurora&#x27;s stone sidewalk was completed, stretching from Aurora Station to Town Center. In 1913, a flood destroyed the Silver Creek Factory. One of its creators, Frank Hurd, stayed in the cheese industry until 1921. The Aurora cheese industry would be on decline from then on.

In 1929, Aurora became a village, with its first mayor being Lee Gould. Later, the remaining areas of the Aurora Township were annexed into the village. By 1970, Aurora had reached a population of almost 6,500 residents, and its population would grow by about 2,000 in the next decade. Aurora became a city in 1971.

Parts of central Aurora have been designated the Aurora Center Historic District. The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The city has several private country clubs, including Club Walden and Barrington Golf Club. In addition, it was home to the historic Aurora Golf and Country Club. In 1924, Bert Way designed the championship golf course. The course wound through 220 acres of spectacularly crafted landscape, with the Chagrin River flowing through a majority of the holes. It was constructed in natural rolling terrain, with the Aurora branch of the Chagrin River being a significant feature. In 1967, 1969, and 1970, the club hosted the Cleveland Open. Arnold Palmer once battled the course while competing in this PGA event; Arnold Palmer, along with Bruce Devlin, Charlie Coody, Gary Trivisonno, and Tom Laubacher, held the course record of 64. After 88 years, in 2012, Aurora Golf and Country Club shuttered its doors. The former course has now been converted into the Paddock River Preserve.

In 2008, the Aurora High School Greenmen, won the Division III State Championship in football. In 2016, Aurora Robotics Team TBD won the FIRST Tech Challenge FIRST Championship in St. Louis.

Various recreational facilities operated around Geauga Lake continuously since before 1887, which straddles Aurora&#x27;s northern boundary with Bainbridge Township. An amusement park, later also called Geauga Lake, developed mainly on the Bainbridge side of the lake. It included the Big Dipper roller coaster, originally known as The Clipper, which opened in 1925 and operated for 82 years at the site. In 1970, SeaWorld Ohio opened mainly on the Aurora side of the lake and operated until 2001, when the site was purchased by Six Flags and combined with the amusement park to create Six Flags Worlds of Adventure. Later, the combined park was sold to Cedar Fair and reverted to the Geauga Lake name and a new water park was built on the site of the former SeaWorld Ohio. The Geauga Lake amusement park permanently closed in 2007, but the Wildwater Kingdom waterpark attached to the site continued to operate until 2016.

<text>Brady Lake is an unincorporated census-designated place and former village in Portage County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,222 at the 2020 census. Incorporated in 1927, it originally developed as an amusement park and summer resort that opened in 1891. It was formed from a small portion of Franklin Township and became fully independent of the township in 1993. The village was named after the lake it borders, Brady Lake, which in turn was named for Captain Samuel Brady, who hid in the lake around 1780 while being pursued by a band of local Native Americans. 

Residents voted to dissolve the village on May 2, 2017, and the area was again made part of Franklin Township. In 2019, the United States Census Bureau created the Brady Lake census-designated place (CDP), an area that includes the entire former village as well as the immediate surrounding area. The CDP is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

* Streetsboro and Sugar Bush Knolls to the north

===Transportation===
Ohio State Route 59 skirts the southern edge of Brady Lake for a short distance just east of the Kent city limits. It, along with Brady Lake Road along the north side of the community, are the main roads connecting the area with Kent and Ravenna. For public transportation, it is served by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA).

===ZIP and area codes===

==Education==

Brady Lake is part of the Kent City School District, which it has been a part of since 1959. Prior to that time Brady Lake operated its own school district, the Brady Lake Local School District, with all students attending a small schoolhouse. The school later served as an early &quot;model school&quot; for teachers in training at the new Kent State Normal School from 1913 through the 1920s. A new building opened in 1923, named for Emma Williard, who donated for the building&#x27;s construction. Williard School initially served students in grades 1–11, but later in the 1920s, high school students were sent to Theodore Roosevelt High School. After merging with the Kent City Schools in 1959, Williard School functioned as an elementary school for grades 1–6 until it was closed in 1978.

==Culture==
Prior to 2007, the town celebrated a festival called Captain Brady Day each summer. It was first held in 1972 as a way to bring all residents around the lake, both in the village and in Franklin Township, together. It was canceled in 2007 due to lack of volunteers. The Lake Brady Association disbanded in 2008, which was the main organizer. For the last several years, the village had organized a festival, car show, and flea market get-together called the Muskrat Jamboree. It was held annually in the summer at the baseball fields by Brady Lake Road.

==Dissolution==
In a special election held on May 2, 2017, residents of Brady Lake voted 106–88 to dissolve the village. The vote came after years of controversy surrounding the village&#x27;s government, including high taxes and its inability to maintain infrastructure. Following the vote, all village operations ceased immediately. At the time of the vote, local officials were uncertain about the community&#x27;s future and believed that it would again become part of Franklin Township, which it did. The dissolution became official after the vote totals were certified on May 23 and signed off by Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted in July. Portage County formally dissolved Brady Lake Township, a paper township created in 1993, in July 2017, which officially returned the area to Franklin Township jurisdiction. There was also some confusion regarding the ownership of the lake, which had previously been owned by the village. By early 2018, Franklin Township assumed full ownership of the lake.
