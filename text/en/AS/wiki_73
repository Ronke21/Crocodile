==History==

Before Europeans settled the land that is present-day Schuylkill Haven, the area was occupied by the Lenape Indian tribe, who were known as the Delaware Indians by the British.

The earliest European settlers arrived in the area of present-day Schuylkill Haven in the 1730s. They traveled north of Blue Mountain at the present-day Berks-Schuylkill County line at that time.

The first settler in Schuylkill Haven was John Fincher, a Quaker from Chester County, Pennsylvania, who received a land grant of on March 5, 1750, the day Schuylkill Haven considers its unofficial founding. Fincher constructed a house and barn near the Schuylkill River, and called his small settlement &quot;Fincher&#x27;s Ford.&quot;

The second known settler of Schuylkill Haven was Martin Dreibelbis, a German who arrived in the Spring of 1775. Martin Dreibelbis constructed a house, saw mill, distillery, and a grist mill on the eastern bank of the Schuylkill River. He later built a log house near present-day Main Street, giving Dreibelbis the title as Schuylkill Haven&#x27;s &quot;first resident&quot;. Dreibelbis willed his original plot of the town to his son, Jacob. Another son, Daniel, received an area east of the original plot, and a third son, George, received an area known as &quot;Seven Stars&quot;, located north of Schuylkill Haven on the Schuylkill River.

The original plot of Schuylkill Haven shows that the borough stretched from the Schuylkill River on the west to present-day Main Street on the north, then known as Front Street, to Saint Peter Street on the east, then known as Jacob Street, and Liberty Street on the south. Present-day Columbia Street was initially the main residential district.

The Schuylkill Canal, created by the Schuylkill Navigation Company, was incorporated into Schuylkill Haven&#x27;s transportation system in 1825. The canal was built on the Schuylkill River as a means to transport anthracite coal and traveled from Philadelphia to Port Carbon. The canal turned Reading, Norristown, and Pottsville into manufacturing centers.

In 1841, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was founded. By 1845, it was transporting nearly three times as much coal than the Schuylkill Canal. The Schuylkill Navigation Company expanded their canals to accommodate for larger boats. But in 1869, the canals were damaged from flooding, and their use began declining. The railroads ultimately surpassed canals as the primary transportation for coal. In 1979, the canals were filled by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

<text>Shenandoah is a borough in Schuylkill County in the Coal Region of Pennsylvania. It is distinct from Shenandoah Heights, which is part of West Mahanoy Township immediately to the north. As of 2021, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,247.

Shenandoah is located approximately northwest of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and miles west of New York City.

==History==
The area that ultimately became Shenandoah was first settled by a farmer named Peter Kehley in 1835. Kehley cleared a patch of land at the center of the valley and built a log cabin and maintained his farm for about 20 years in total isolation. He sold his claim to the Philadelphia Land Company, which in anticipation of the opening of coal mines in the area, laid out the town in 1862.

Booming growth occurred during the Civil War years caused by the development and opening of several anthracite coal mines. The area was incorporated as a borough in 1866 and was a famous hotbed of activity during the era of the Molly Maguires in the 1870s.

After the original influx of English, Welsh, Irish, and German immigrants a large influx of people from central, eastern and southern European countries such as Poland, Lithuania, and Italy occurred in the decades before and after the turn of the 20th century. 

The Lehigh Valley Railroad Station served as the main passenger terminal in Shenandoah, but because of the coal industry, it was not the only railroad to service Shenandoah. The town was also served by the Pennsylvania Railroad and Reading Railroad, making Shenandoah the only borough in Pennsylvania to be served by three railroad companies.

In Schuylkill County Court, in January 1902, those interested filed their petition for retail, wholesale, bottling or brewing licenses at the Office of the Clerk of the Court. Shenandoah was represented with bars and breweries. This coal town offered more bars per thousand people than any other location in the world.

During the Great Coal Strike of 1902 the Pennsylvania National Guard was called into Shenandoah to keep the peace and curb rioting by angry miners. The strike would only be resolved after President Theodore Roosevelt intervened. 

By 1920, the town had a population of nearly 30,000 residents.

The community was hard hit by the decline of the anthracite coal industry after World War II and heavy emigration by coal miners occurred in order to find work elsewhere.

Shenandoah, the rise and fall of the coal industry, and the dismantling of the Molly Maguires was one of the subjects examined by George Leighton in his 1939 book &quot;Five Cities: The Story of Their Youth and Old Age&quot;.

Shenandoah Valley was featured in the documentary 2012 film &quot;Shenandoah, Pennsylvania&quot; exploring the hate crime murder of Luis Ramirez and the local police attempting to cover it up.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name Shenandoah is much debated. One theory holds that Shenandoah received its name from an Indian word meaning &#x27;sprucy stream&#x27; or &#x27;river flowing alongside high hills and mountains&#x27;. Another origin theory is that the town was named after the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The Virginia valley in turn took its name from an Iroquoian word meaning &#x27;deer&#x27;.

<doc id="133720" wikidata="Q1180973" url="?curid=133720" title="Tamaqua, Pennsylvania">
<text>Tamaqua (, ) is a borough in eastern Schuylkill County in the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, United States. It had a population of 6,934 as of the 2020 U.S. census.

Tamaqua was established from territory from West Penn and Schuylkill Townships. The borough is part of the micropolitan statistical area of Pottsville. 

Tamaqua is located northwest of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

== History ==

===18th century===
Tamaqua was settled in 1799 by Burkhardt Moser, his son Jacob (born 1790), and John Kershner, who built shelters and a sawmill at the confluence of the Little Schuylkill River and Panther Creek, which is downtown Tamaqua today. 

According to property records, Moser had a partner named Houser, and together they owned 2,000 acres which Moser homesteaded. Moser built a log house at the base of Dutch Hill in 1801 for Mrs. Catherine Moser, who was the first adult to die and receive burial there on February 15, 1822 followed later in April that year by John Kershner.

===19th century===

The borough was originally to be named Tuscarora, but the name Tamaqua was chosen after it was realized that there already was a community named Tuscarora about four miles (6 km) to the west. The editor of &quot;The History of Schuylkill County&quot; wrote in 1881:


The editor writes the following about Tamaqua&#x27;s founding:

Roughly half of Moser&#x27;s original log cabin is still intact and visible behind a house on the north side of East Broad Street. The discovery of anthracite coal in the region in the early 19th century led to Tamaqua&#x27;s rise as a coal-producing community. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1832. The first coal breaker, called &quot;The Greenwood&quot; was built as noted in the quotation, at the site of the first mine at the lower end of the Panther Creek Valley. However, details about construction and development in Rahn Township and Coaldale on the county-line with sister-town Lansford from the same source history illustrate it was definitely not the first breaker in the valley. Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, with 10,000 acres located between Mauch Chunk in present-day Jim Thorpe and Tamaqua, was known to have mine tailings in their lands in Coaldale. The Greenwood breaker in 1874, as noted in the above quote, was burned by the Molly Maguires in the labor troubles of that era. 
Irish, Welsh, and German immigrants came to the borough in the 1840s and 1850s followed by a large influx of Italians, Lithuanians, Russians, Ukrainians, Slovaks, and Poles in the 1890s and early 20th century. During the 1860s and 1870s, Tamaqua also was the geographic center hub for the Molly Maguires. One murder commonly attributed to the Mollies was that of town policeman Benjamin Yost, who was shot to death early one morning while extinguishing a gas lamp at the corner of West Broad and Lehigh Streets.

The Tamaqua Railroad station was constructed in 1874. It stood idle from the mid 1980s through the late 1990s after passenger railroad service to the town was discontinued. Initially planned to be demolished in the late 1980s, the non-profit group Save Our Station (S.O.S.) eventually managed to raise enough money to have it refurbished at a cost of $1.5 million. The station reopened in August 2004 and is now home to a full-service restaurant and gift shop. Rail excursions leave from there during the Tamaqua Historical Society&#x27;s annual Heritage Festival on the second Sunday in October.

==== Hotels ====
The first tavern in Tamaqua was opened around 1807 in Berkhard Moser&#x27;s house by the widow of John Kershner and her son-in-law, Isaac Bennett. In 1827, the Little Schuylkill Company, aspiring to draw the center of population to Dutch Hill, built the first stone building and hotel in Tamaqua. The house was converted into a dwelling thirty years afterward.

In 1832, James Taggart, one of the pioneers in Panther Creek Valley, came to Tamaqua and opened a hotel. Michael Beard took possession in 1846. Between 1845 and 1847, the United States Hotel was built by the Little Schuylkill Company and was first kept by Joseph Haughawout. In 1850, the Washington House, on Pine Street, was built, and the American and Mansion on Centre Street at a later period.

==== Literary societies and lyceums ====
In 1853, Tamaqua had a public library and debating clubs discussed current events in the first town hall or schoolhouse as early as 1845. In 1856, the Tamaqua Lyceum was organized; it held weekly sessions in the south ward school building. Matthew Newkirk of Philadelphia contributed 1,500 books to it, which passed into the hands of the Perseverance Fire Company when the society later disbanded. No records of the first organization remain. The principal citizens were members.

On November 26, 1876, a group of men formed the Presbyterian Social and Literary Institute.

==== Cemeteries ====
The first graveyard was laid out in 1831 on Dutch Hill. The Catholic and Methodist burying grounds were laid out about 1837. The 30-acre Odd Fellows&#x27; cemetery, which opened in 1865 and is overseen by Harmony Lodge of Odd Fellows, is located at the western end of Broad Street. It is one of only two elaborate Victorian garden cemeteries in Schuylkill County. Zion&#x27;s cemetery was opened in 1876.

===20th century===
Tamaqua remained a thriving community throughout the heyday of coal production in the United States through the early 20th century. Certain sections of the borough, such as Dutch Hill and the South Ward, had a reputation for &quot;toughness.&quot; Those sections were also densely populated by immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. However, in the 1950s, as coal mining began tapering off, Tamaqua and other Coal Region communities built on anthracite began declining. 

In 1955. Hurricane Diane caused tremendous damage to Tamaqua&#x27;s railroad yards, and they never fully recovered. In 1971, the borough annexed neighboring Rahn Township and its Owl Creek section, home to the world&#x27;s first fish hatchery.

In 1945, John E. Morgan established a knitwear manufacturing industry in Hometown, two miles north of Tamaqua. The company, Morgan Knitting Mills, Inc., grew into the second-largest employer in the area behind Atlas Powder Company. 

In the mid 1950s, Morgan, working from a design developed by his wife, Anna Hoban Morgan, patented the widely known thermal underwear product lines. Since Morgan&#x27;s death in 2000, the Morgan Trust has donated money to various causes in the Tamaqua area and established the John &amp; Dorothy Morgan Cancer Center at Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest in Allentown.

Dial telephone service arrived in Tamaqua on August 6, 1961. The borough uses area codes 570 and 272. Operators who worked the 12-position switchboard on the top floor of the Tamaqua National Bank at West Broad and Berwick Streets were transferred to Bell Telephone toll centers in either Hazleton or Pottsville. 

The 55-block Tamaqua Historic District, Anthracite Bank Building, George Ormrod House, and Tamaqua station have each been named to the National Register of Historic Places.

===21st century===
In 2007, the borough of Tamaqua passed an unprecedented law giving ecosystems legal rights. The ordinance establishes that the municipal government or any Tamaqua resident can file a lawsuit on behalf of the local ecosystem. Other townships, such as Rush, followed suit and passed their own laws.

==Geography==
Tamaqua is located in a valley basin at (40.798600, −75.966498) in Pennsylvania&#x27;s southern Coal Region section of the Appalachian Mountains in the Schuylkill River drainage basin. Tamaqua&#x27;s valley is located at the western end of the Pocono Mountains on the edge of the neighboring Lehigh River watershed. Tamaqua&#x27;s terrain is typical of many mid-size Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians with low lands and flat towns with business, rail transport, and industries in its lower valley locations and residential dwellings on the higher elevated slopes above.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (1.31%) is water. Three streams pass through Tamaqua: The Little Schuylkill River runs through Tamaqua from the north through the gap separating the folds of Sharp Mountain on the west and Nesquehoning Mountain. Panther Creek flows southwest from Lansford, five miles away, and joins the Little Schuylkill River in Tamaqua. Wabash Creek joins the Little Schuylkill from the west.

In the Tamaqua area, coal mining was a vital economic activity throughout the 20th century, but more recent diminished use of coal as a power plant fuel and the demise of steam powered traction, coal has since experienced a decline. Tamaqua also gained recognition as a railroad center. In 1885, the Edison Illuminating Company in Tamaqua furnished the town with the nation&#x27;s second incandescent municipal lighting system, a feat accomplished by the innovation of Thomas Edison.

The nearest city to Tamaqua is Hazleton, which is 12.5 miles north. Tamaqua is east of Pottsville, southwest of Jim Thorpe, approximately south of Scranton, approximately northwest of Philadelphia, and approximately southwest of New York City.

Tamaqua&#x27;s average elevation is above sea level, but elevations can reach up to above sea level.

The borough has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and the hardiness zone is 6a. Average monthly temperatures range from 26.0 °F in January to 71.0 °F in July.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
The main highway in Tamaqua is Pennsylvania Route 309, which connects it with Allentown and Philadelphia to its south and Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre to its north, where it continues as PA Route 29 to the New York state line. Route 309 serves as a truck bypass for Interstate 476 since many placarded trucks are not allowed in the Lehigh Tunnel and as a route of choice for access to the region&#x27;s operating coal mines and industrial parks. A second highway in the borough, U.S. Route 209, runs along Panther Creek and intersects with Route 309 in the borough. Route 209 runs for approximately 212 miles from Millersburg in Dauphin County to Ulster in Ulster County, New York. U.S. 209 also connects Tamaqua to nearby municipalities, including the Schuylkill County seat at Pottsville in the west and both Jim Thorpe and Lehighton to the east.

Other highways near Tamaqua include Pennsylvania Route 54, Pennsylvania Route 443, Pennsylvania Route 895, and Pennsylvania Route 902, most of which connect the Tamaqua area to the Poconos, the Lehigh Valley, and South Central Pennsylvania. In addition, Interstates 81, 80, 476, and 78 are near the town. Bus service is provided by Schuylkill Transportation System, Route 45 (Pottsville-McAdoo), and Fullington Trailways (intercity).

===Railroads===

Until the late 1960s, Tamaqua was a hub for two major railroads, the Reading Railroad (RDG) and Lehigh and New England Railroad (LNE). A large rail yard existed in the southern part of town that extended through downtown with, at one point, eight tracks passing by the passenger station. An engine house, turntable, and car shop were located across the street from the passenger station in what is now the St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center parking lot. The collapse of the anthracite coal industry in the early 1960s, the Penn Central merger, and Hurricane Agnes in 1972 all led to the railroad&#x27;s demise. Today, all that remains is a single track line through town operated by the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad.
Tamaqua has a small rail yard, but its switching and geography makes it an important junction with tracks along both the Little Schuylkill River and others penetrating near the west-flowing Panther Creek and north into Hazleton. The town once hosted trackage of the Reading Railroad and the Lehigh Valley and New England Railroads.

<text>The Remains of the Day is a 1989 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British author Kazuo Ishiguro. The protagonist, Stevens, is a butler with a long record of service at Darlington Hall, a fictitious stately home near Oxford, England. In 1956, he takes a road trip to visit a former colleague, and reminisces about events at Darlington Hall in the 1920s and 1930s.

The work received the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1989. A film adaptation of the novel, made in 1993 and starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, was nominated for eight Academy Awards. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot summary==
The novel tells, in first-person narration, the story of Stevens, an English butler who has dedicated his life to the loyal service of Lord Darlington (who is recently deceased, and whom Stevens describes in increasing detail in flashbacks). As the work progresses, two central themes are revealed: Lord Darlington was a Nazi sympathizer; and Stevens is in love with Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall, Lord Darlington&#x27;s estate.

The novel begins in 1956, with Stevens receiving a letter from a former colleague, the housekeeper Miss Kenton, describing her married life, which Stevens believes hints at an unhappy marriage. Furthermore, Darlington Hall is short-staffed and could greatly use a skilled housekeeper like Miss Kenton. Stevens starts to consider paying Miss Kenton a visit. His new employer, a wealthy American named Mr. Farraday, encourages Stevens to borrow his car to take a well-earned vacation—a &quot;motoring trip&quot;. Stevens accepts, and sets out for Little Compton, Cornwall, where Miss Kenton (now Mrs. Benn) lives.

During his journey, Stevens reflects on his unshakable loyalty to Lord Darlington, who had hosted lavish meetings between German sympathizers and English aristocrats in an effort to influence international affairs in the years leading up to the Second World War; on the meaning of the term &quot;dignity&quot; and what constitutes a great butler; and on his relationship with his late father, another &quot;no-nonsense&quot; man who dedicated his life to service. Ultimately, Stevens is forced to ponder Lord Darlington&#x27;s character and reputation, as well as the true nature of his relationship with Miss Kenton. As the book progresses, evidence mounts of Miss Kenton&#x27;s and Stevens&#x27; past mutual attraction and affection.

While they worked together during the 1930s, Stevens and Miss Kenton failed to admit their true feelings toward each other. Their conversations as recollected by Stevens show a professional friendship which at times came close to blossoming into romance, but this was evidently a line that neither dared cross. Stevens in particular never yielded, even when Miss Kenton tried to draw closer to him.

When they finally meet again, Mrs. Benn, having been married now for more than twenty years, admits to wondering if she made a mistake in marrying, but says she has come to love her husband and is looking forward to the birth of their first grandchild. Stevens later muses over lost opportunities, both with Miss Kenton and regarding his decades of selfless service to Lord Darlington, who may not have been worthy of his unquestioning fealty. Stevens even expresses some of these sentiments in casual conversation with a friendly stranger of a similar age and background whom he happens upon near the end of his travels. 

This man suggests that it is better to enjoy the present time in one&#x27;s life than to dwell on the past, as &quot;the evening&quot; is, after all, the best part of the day. At the end of the novel, Stevens appears to have taken this to heart as he focuses on the titular &quot;remains of the day&quot;, referring to his future service with Mr. Farraday and what is left of his own life.

==Characters==
*Mr. Stevens, the narrator, an English butler who serves at Darlington Hall. A man devoted to performing his job to the highest standards, and who is particularly concerned with dignity (exemplified by the fact that the reader never learns his first name).
*Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall, later married as Mrs Benn. A capable and opinionated woman who works closely with Mr Stevens as the two most senior serving staff. Her relationship with Mr Stevens is unstable; they frequently argue, yet it is evident to the reader (but not to Stevens) that she is in love with him.
*Lord Darlington, the owner of Darlington Hall, characterised as well-meaning but naïve. His support for appeasement with Nazi Germany results in public disgrace after WWII.
*William Stevens (Mr. Stevens senior), the 75-year-old father of Mr Stevens, serving as under-butler; Stevens senior suffers a severe stroke during the conference at Darlington Hall. His relationship with his son is portrayed as strained.
*Senator Lewis, an American senator who criticises Lord Darlington as being an &quot;amateur&quot; in politics. He symbolises the declining power and relevance of the European aristocracy in the face of America&#x27;s ascendance as a global superpower, and the increasing role of non-aristocratic &quot;experts&quot; in politics.
*Young Mr Cardinal, the son of one of Lord Darlington&#x27;s closest friends and a journalist; he is killed in Belgium during the Second World War.
*M. Dupont, a high-ranking French politician who attends Lord Darlington&#x27;s conference.

On his motoring trip, Stevens briefly comes into contact with several other characters, most of them working class. They serve to challenge Stevens&#x27; ideals and values, particularly in the changing post-war social context, and contribute towards his epiphany at the end of the novel. For example, Harry Smith, an outspoken left-wing man he meets while the guest of some local villagers, argues that dignity is actually about democracy and standing up for one&#x27;s beliefs, in contrast to Stevens&#x27; conception of it as being about suppressing one&#x27;s own feelings in pursuit of professionalism.

== Release and publication history ==
&quot;Remains&quot; was first published in the United Kingdom by Faber and Faber in May 1989, and in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf on 4 October 1989.

==Influence from Tom Waits==
Kazuo Ishiguro recalled how Tom Waits influenced &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;: I thought I’d finished &quot;Remains&quot;, but then one evening heard Tom Waits singing his song &quot;Ruby’s Arms&quot;. It’s a ballad about a soldier leaving his lover sleeping in the early hours to go away on a train. Nothing unusual in that. But the song is sung in the voice of a rough American hobo type utterly unaccustomed to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And there comes a moment, when the singer declares his heart is breaking, that’s almost unbearably moving because of the tension between the sentiment itself and the huge resistance that’s obviously been overcome to utter it. Waits sings the line with cathartic magnificence, and you feel a lifetime of tough-guy stoicism crumbling in the face of overwhelming sadness. I heard this and reversed a decision I’d made, that Stevens would remain emotionally buttoned up right to the bitter end. I decided that at just one point – which I’d have to choose very carefully – his rigid defence would crack, and a hitherto concealed tragic romanticism would be glimpsed.

==Reception==
&quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; is one of the most highly regarded post-war British novels. In 1989, the novel won the Booker Prize. It ranks 146th in a composite list, compiled by Brian Kunde of Stanford University, of the best 20th-century English-language fiction.

In 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; asked 150 literary writers and critics to vote for the best British, Irish or Commonwealth novel from 1980 to 2005; &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; placed joint-eighth. In 2007, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; was included in a &quot;Guardian&quot; list of &quot;Books you can&#x27;t live without&quot; and also in a 2009 &quot;1000 novels everyone must read&quot; list. &quot;The Economist&quot; has described the novel as Ishiguro&#x27;s &quot;most famous book&quot;. On 5 November 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

In a retrospective review published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012, Salman Rushdie argues that &quot;the real story … is that of a man destroyed by the ideas upon which he has built his life&quot;. In Rushdie&#x27;s view, Stevens&#x27;s obsession with dignified restraint has cost him loving relationships with his father and with Miss Kenton.

Kathleen Wall argues that &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; &quot;may be seen to be &quot;about&quot; Stevens&#x27;s attempts to grapple with his unreliable memories and interpretations and the havoc that his dishonesty has played on his life&quot; (emphasis in original). In particular, she suggests that &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; challenges scholarly accounts of the unreliable narrator. Wall notes that the ironic effect of Mr Stevens&#x27;s narration depends on the reader&#x27;s assuming that he describes &quot;events&quot; reliably, while &quot;interpreting&quot; those events in self-serving or peculiar ways.

According to Steven Connor, &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; thematises the idea of English national identity. In Mr Stevens&#x27;s view, the qualities of the best butlers, which involve restraining personal emotions in favour of keeping up appearances, are &quot;identified as essentially English&quot;. Connor argues that early critics of &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, who saw it as a novel about Japanese national identity, were mistaken: &quot;there seems to be no doubt that it is Englishness that is at stake or under analysis in this novel&quot;.

==Adaptations==
*The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993. Directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant, Mike Nichols and John Calley (i.e., Merchant Ivory Productions), the film starred Anthony Hopkins as Stevens, Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton. The supporting cast included Christopher Reeve as Congressman Lewis, James Fox as Lord Darlington, Hugh Grant as Reginald Cardinal and Peter Vaughan as Mr Stevens, Sr. The film adaptation was nominated for eight Academy Awards. In the film, the man who has bought Darlington Hall is Congressman Lewis after he has retired from politics.
*A radio play adaptation in two-hour-long episodes starring Ian McDiarmid was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 8 and 15 August 2003.
*A musical adaptation of the novel by Alex Loveless was staged in 2010 in London&#x27;s Union Theatre, and received positive reviews.

==History==

===Founding===

Tower City was founded by and named for Charlemagne Tower, a New York–born lawyer who had come to Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in 1846 to work with the legal issues regarding land claims to large coal and mineral deposits in that area. His first Pennsylvania practice was located in Orwigsburg, and then relocated to Pottsville in 1850 when it was made the Schyulkill County seat.

Not long after Tower came to Pottsville, he began furiously purchasing and clearing liens to lands containing large anthracite deposits in and around Schuylkill County. This was part of an elaborate land grab scheme devised by Tower and his partner, Alfred Munson of Utica, NY.

The plan called for Tower to use his legal acumen to clear all the liens and opposing claims to the Munson-Williams claim, and to all the land around it. In short, the partners hoped to create a single landed estate, which would have measured 65 miles by 4½ miles (105 km by 7 km) at its widest point in southwest Schuylkill County. In return, Tower was to receive ownership and title to one half of all the land acquired once all the cost to Munson had been settled, or until Tower paid him half the value of the total land purchase.

At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a hotly contested property, with constant conflicts over titles and rights. Had any of their competitors become aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they well may have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices for it. Or worse, refuse to sell it at all. Thus, they chose to operate in secret. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the actual ownership of the land.

By 1858 Tower and Munson were owners of eleven thousand acres (45 km2). By now, Munson and Tower&#x27;s plan was well out of the bag, and anyone who had even a partial claim to any of the lands began to litigate. Only Tower&#x27;s considerable skill as a lawyer kept the whole enterprise from falling apart.

In 1867, Tower decided to start selling the lands, wanting to realize his interest in them. Unfortunately, he could not find a buyer at the time due to the title issues. Deciding instead to establish collieries on the land, in March 1868 he leased (6 km2) to two independent coal companies. It was a 15-year term, with a rental of $.30 for each ton of coal mined. The companies placed two collieries on the land, the Tower (Later known as East Brookside) and the Brookside. Near the collieries, Tower began to develop a small town, which was named Tower City when first surveyed. Tower laid out the town, and rented lots to settlers. The town was up and running by mid-1872, and immediately suffered a housing shortage. After these initial growing pains, the town grew steadily due to the collieries, and was officially incorporated on December 19, 1892 as a borough of Porter Township, Schuylkill County.
===The coal industry===

The Brookside was established in 1868, and administered by Williams, Jones, Savage, and W.B. Kaufman. This group held the colliery until 1872, and then sold it to Repplier &amp; Company, which held it until 1873.

During the early 1870s, Franklin Gowen, President of the Reading Railroad, had begun purchasing coal lands along the Railroad&#x27;s right-of-way for the express purpose of building an anthracite coal monopoly. By 1875, Gowen had accumulated (283 km2), and Tower accepted his offer of purchase for his lands. Tower asked for and received $3 million from Gowen, for which Tower realized a profit of $1.5 million as per the original contract with the Munson family. (Alfred Munson died in May 1854.) Later that year, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company (a company set up by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad to administer their anthracite properties) came into possession of the Brookside through its purchase of the Munson and Williams lands. When closed in 1938, the colliery had produced a total of 19,011,169 tons of coal over its lifetime.

The original owners of the Tower colliery were E.D. and James Savage, Evans, and Althouse. They operated the colliery from 1868 to 1873, when it was purchased by Repplier, Gordon &amp; Company. The colliery was in service until 1874, then abandoned. The total production of the Tower colliery to 1874 was 101,550 tons of coal. The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company reopened the colliery in 1892 and renamed it the East Brookside. It was jointly operated with the Brookside, now known as the West Brookside.

====Rail service====

Tower City&#x27;s emerging coal industry was initially serviced by the Good Spring Railroad, which built an extension from Donaldson to the Brookside in 1867. The Good Spring was initially controlled by the Reading Railroad, but transferred to the property of the Swatara Railroad in 1863. The Good Spring was then consolidated along with several other area railroads to form the Lebanon and Tremont Railroad in March 1871, and was reacquired by and merged into the Reading about a month later. In this new arrangement, the former Good Spring line was retitled as the Brookside Branch, and ran from the Brookside Colliery to Tremont, where it met the Lebanon and Tremont Branch. The Williams Valley Railroad began operations in 1892, which extended further from the Brookside branch into the Williams Valley west of Tower City. It came under Reading control itself within a few years. The Brookside branch was cut back to Keffer&#x27;s Station in 1971, ending Tower City&#x27;s connection with the then-Reading Company.

====Notable mine disasters====

=====The Brookside explosion=====

On August 2, 1913, a double explosion occurred at the East Brookside Colliery, claiming the lives of eighteen men and seriously injuring two more.

After the colliery had ceased production on Thursday night, Charles Portland, a contractor for the Reading, kept some of the men at work. The work force consisted of &quot;Muckers&quot;, who are to clean out debris from blasting (work always done in the evening), a mucker boss, a blacksmith, and his assistant. The next day, Mine Boss John Farrell and Superintendent John Lorenz entered the mine to inspect some new work. At about noon, men on the surface reported a rumbling sound, which was followed by clouds of dust from the main entrance and fan-house. A rescue party of six men was mustered and lowered into the slope. The second explosion occurred shortly thereafter, roughly 20 minutes after the first.

The work crew carried of dynamite into the mine the night before the explosion. It has been speculated that, during the course of work, one of the mucker&#x27;s shovels may have struck the dynamite, detonating it. The second explosion is felt to have been caused by mine gases released by the first explosion.

=====The Porter Tunnel inundation=====
On Tuesday, March 1, 1977, workers in the Porter Tunnel mine, while working in a new area, broke into a flooded area of the abandoned Bush Old Bootleg Slope Mine, causing the Porter Tunnel to flood. Nine miners were killed, three were injured, and one was trapped, but eventually rescued.

Subsequent investigation determined that the map of the area used by management of the Porter Tunnel was inaccurate. It did not show the locations of all known bootleg mine works in the area, including most significantly, the Bush Old Bootleg. Management had suspected that the tunnel was nearby, and had instituted a program of drilling test holes in the work areas to probe for water. Workers had testified that this program was discontinued prior to the flood.

<text>Tremont is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. Situated in the eastern section of Tremont Township, it was incorporated as a borough in 1866, around the same time that a water system was erected in the community.

The population was one thousand six hundred and seventy-two at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
According to historian Samuel T. Wiley, no major buildings had been erected, by 1844, on the land that would eventually become the borough of Tremont, while historians Adolf Schalck and David Henning stated that a concerted settlement effort began here sometime that year, &quot;stimulated by the extensive coal developments in the vicinity.&quot;

Within four years, the Tremont Iron Works had been established by Umholtz &amp; Lentz (1847) and a new post office had been established there (1848) with John B. Zeibach serving as its first postmaster. The first National Bank of Tremont subsequently opened its doors in 1865.

Incorporated as a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in 1866, Tremont was home to a water works system that was built by Isaac P. Bechtel around the same time as the community&#x27;s legal formation. The initial cost of construction was $20,000.

Four years later, Bechtel established the Tremont Water and Gas Company. Construction on Bechtel&#x27;s water works system was then completed in December 1874.

The community also supported two newspapers: the &quot;Tremont News&quot; and the &quot;West Schuylkill Press&quot;, the latter of which was established and operated by S. C. Kirk until 1884, when he transferred editorial control to John A. Bechtel.

==History==
Tuscarora derives its name from the movement of the Tuscarora people from their homelands in the Carolinas to New York during the aftermath of the Tuscarora War in the early 18th century. A part of the transitory Tuscarora settled at a point approximately two miles west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, where they planted apple trees and lived for a number of years. It is probable that it was these Tuscarora who were later moved to Oquaga.

Tuscarora lies within Schuylkill Township, which was one of the original townships of the county, organized in 1811. On May 20, 1830, a US post-office was established in Tuscarora. By 1846 Tuscarora was the terminus of the Schuylkill Valley Railroad. Tuscarora now had seventeen houses, two taverns, one store, and a population of 139. By 1852 the place flourished because of the coal collieries (including those in nearby Mary D such as Silver Creek), local operators, were working the mines on the so-called &quot;Kentucky banks&quot;. These mines were worked up to 1875, when they passed to the proprietorship of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and were eventually abandoned in the late 19th century. There were, subsequently, small operations, such as Slattery&#x27;s Tuscarora Colliery, in the area into the early 20th century.

Several residents of Tuscarora were involved in the Molly Maguires, trials of the late 1870s, including Martin Bergen, hanged at Pottsville on January 16, 1879, for the murder of Patrick Burns in Silver Creek; John Campbell, convicted of the second-degree murder of F.W. Langdon and sentenced to five years in prison; John &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; Donahue, convicted in several conspiracy cases, hanged at Mauch Chunk for his role in the murder of Morgan Powell on June 21, 1877; Neil Dougherty, convicted of the second-degree murder of F.W. Langdon and sentenced to nine years in prison; James &quot;Powder Keg&quot; Kerrigan, self-confessed participant in the assassinations of Benjamin Yost and John P. Jones, who appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the trials of James Carroll et al., Alexander Campbell, John Kehoe et al., John &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; Donahue, James McDonnell, and Charles Sharp, but was never tried for his own part in the killings of Yost and Jones; James &quot;Hairy Man&quot; McDonnell, hanged at Mauch Chunk on January 14, 1879, for the murder of George K. Smith in 1863, testified for the prosecution in the 1878 trial of Martin Bergen for the murder of Patrick Burns, and missed a temporary reprieve of his sentence when it arrived too late on the day of his hanging; and John J. Slattery, informant, convicted in the conspiracy cases but turned informant during the trial, so his sentence was postponed, testified for the prosecution in the trial of &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; Donahue for the killing of Morgan Powell, implicated John Kehoe in extensive political corruption, and also testified against Martin Bergen in 1878, when Bergen stood trial for the murder of Patrick Burns.

In the 1971 film &quot;Klute&quot;, Tuscarora is the hometown of the title character, John Klute.

In the year 1867, when it was certain that the Middlecreek Valley Railroad would be located practically through the center of the Stuck Farm, George Stuck staked out a section of his farm, laid out a few lots and named the place “STUCKTON.” Thus a town was born, but without houses, except an old rotted log hut.

<doc id="133752" wikidata="Q1185016" url="?curid=133752" title="Middleburg, Pennsylvania">
<text>Middleburg is a borough in Snyder County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located in Central Pennsylvania&#x27;s Susquehanna River Valley, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,325 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Snyder County. Middleburg is part of the Selinsgrove, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Native Americans had lived in the region for centuries. White settlers are recorded living in the area in 1755. Middleburg was originally named Swinefordstown (Swinefordstettle in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect) after John Albright Swineford who ran a tavern here in 1787. He was also the owner of land located on the north bank of the Middle Creek on which engineer Frederick Evans laid out the town in 1800. This town became known as Middleburgh circa 1825, and was incorporated as a borough in 1864.

A portion of the site that Middleburg occupies was the location of the Stump&#x27;s Run Massacre in January 1768. Stump&#x27;s Run is located to the west of the Glendale Cemetery and is also near the Snyder County Historical Society. In this incident, two colonists named Frederick Stump and John Ironcutter were found to be responsible for the deaths of four Native American men, three Native American women, and three children over a two-day period. Four of the men and two of the women were killed at Stump&#x27;s cabin, which was located at the mouth of the Middle Creek near Selinsgrove. After Stump and Ironcutter shoved the bodies through a hole in the ice, they traveled up the creek to Stump&#x27;s Run to kill the remaining woman and the children. These bodies were thrown into the native cabins, and the cabins burned. Although the men claimed self-defense, it is suspected that this could have been provoked by a drunken brawl, or that the natives were killed by Stump in retaliation for the deaths of his wife and children at the hands of Native American raiders. The two men were arrested and taken to the Cumberland County jail at Carlisle for trial, but were freed at the hands of a sympathetic mob. The men were never recaptured.

The section of the borough located on the southern bank of the Middle Creek was developed in a manner entirely different from that of the settlement on the northern bank. This portion of the town began with a few pioneer homes and a grist mill; later a successor on this site would be known as the Franklin Roller Mills. When the Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad was constructed, more lots for homes were laid out, and the southern section of the town was first known as Franklin, and later, Swineford. In January 1917, the property owners in Swineford petitioned the Middleburgh borough for annexation, and this wish was granted in February of the same year.

Despite the fact that the two towns were united under one government in 1917, two separate and distinct post offices operated in the borough until March 1955, when the Swineford post office was closed. The Swineford name is still used by the Swineford National Bank, which was founded in Swineford in 1903 and is listed as a part of the Fulton Financial Family in 2013.

A major employer in the town following the Second World War was the Middleburg Tannery. This facility was located in the Swineford section of Middleburg on the south bank of the Middle Creek. It employed nearly sixty men and women that tanned high grade sole leather. Most of the raw material used at the plant came from South America, and many of the finished products were used in the manufacture of Florsheim Shoes. The tannery complex was leveled by a devastating fire in June 1967 and it was never rebuilt.

Middleburg is also home to the main processing plant of Ira Middleswarth and Son, Inc., the manufacturer of Middleswarth Potato Chips.

==History==

The village of Paxtonville lies on Middle Creek and is connected to Middleburg, Koonhunter and Beavertown by the Paxtonville Road. Before the road existed connecting the main street, Paxton Street, to Route 522, in use today, the main route ran along the north side of Middle Creek to Royer&#x27;s Bridge. Settled in the late 18th century, it was first known as Kern&#x27;s Mill and was renamed after Robert Paxton. Just after the Civil War, an iron furnace was built there, but fell into disuse after a relatively short period of time when richer ores were found in the Great Lakes region. In the early years of the 20th century, brick-making was a major industry; this ended in the summer of 1963 when fire destroyed the Paxton Brick Company. A water-powered sawmill and cider press were in operation &quot;circa&quot; 1900. At various times businesses included a creamery, a restaurant, a cigar factory, a shirt factory, one or two general stores, a movie house, a barbershop, a grist mill and a gunsmith. As of December 2007, the town boasted a church and a feed mill, as well as a community center. The building housing the community center was previously a two-room school house in which instruction was provided for grades 1 through 8. Its last use for this purpose was in the Spring of 1955; after this time pupils were bussed to Middleburg. Around 1890 a school building stood on the north-east corner of Mill Street and the Paxtonville Road.

The soil underlying the village is principally glacial till, but approximately 150 feet west and 50 feet south of the juncture of the Paxtonville Road and Paxton Street, sedimentary rock lies just beneath the soil surface. Stone American Indian artifacts, chiefly arrow and spear points, are to be found at the north edge of town near the bank of Middle Creek. The completion of the Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad in the 1870s connected Paxtonville with these two cities, and for many years a number of daily passenger trains stopped at the Paxtonville station, which was located near the creek. Passenger service ended in the late 1920s, although freight service to Paxtonville area continued into the 1960s. For a short period of time, toward the end of the 19th century, Paxtonville was shown on railroad maps as &quot;Benfer.&quot; A number of the oldest houses are log, but this construction is not evident because they have frame or shingle siding; they date from the early 19th century. there stands on the south side of Maple Avenue, approximately 100 feet west of the intersection with Paxton Street, a house of unusual construction. Built by Gabriel Gill in about 1885, it lacks a frame, but the exterior walls serve this purpose, being constructed of three layers of one inch planks, with the middle layer running at a 90-degree angle to the other two which is one form of vertical plank wall construction.

Over the years most residents have been of Pennsylvania-Dutch ancestry, as witnessed by family names such as Gill, Gift, Graybill, Hassinger, Kerstetter, Oldt, Olmstead/Umstead, Musser, Shaffer, Straub, Walter, and Wenrich. &quot;Circa&quot; 1900, the cemetery was moved from its position behind the church on the east edge of the village to its modern location on the southwestern edge. Coffins and their contents were carried on horse-drawn wagons. Immediately after World War I, donations from townspeople allowed the construction of the Memorial Hall on the west side of Paxton Street. It served a number of functions, including showing movies. During the era of silent films, these were accompanied by the Paxtonville Orchestra.

==Economics==
Efforts of local business leaders to promote development were rewarded in 2005, with a $2.4 million grant and low-interest loan package to develop Pawling Station Business Park. It is a site along Route 522 in Penn Township, that will feature three to lots with storm water drainage. An 18-member volunteer task force will oversee the construction of Pawling Park. The task force includes Pennsylvania Senator John Gordner and Rep Russ Fairchild, community leaders with a wide range of economic development experience and skills including an accountant, lawyer, land developer, engineer, surveyor, and two bankers – along with chairmen of the Snyder County Board of Commissioners, Penn Township Board of Supervisors, and Township Municipal Authority.

Major employers in the region include a significant number of housing related manufacturers, state facilities, as well as local government entities like the school district. With the decline in housing manufacturing in 2007 several local factories have closed displacing about 250 workers. Additionally there is a rising vacancy rate for commercial retail property along the routes 11 &amp; 15 highway.

A thirty-year effort to develop a bypass of the rte 11&amp; 15 commercial area, called the Central Susquehanna Thruway, has been delayed until 2009 due to minimal funding from the state or federal government.

Wilhelm Weirick (1731–1807), a veteran of the American Revolution, and grandson of German immigrant Johann Georg Weyrich (1702–1751). The village was originally called Weirickstown. Weirick served as county commissioner in 1824, justice of the peace in 1813, and as a member of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania (1832–1833). He is buried in the Salem Church Cemetery in Snyder County. The village name was later changed to Centreville, and then changed again due to a conflict with another village of the same name in Crawford County. The nearby creek&#x27;s name was adopted sometime after 1842. The village was originally part of Northumberland County, then Union. On March 2, 1855, Penns Creek became part of Snyder County. Snyder County was named for Governor Simon Snyder of Selinsgrove. Buried in the old Sharon Lutheran Churchyard in Selinsgrove, Snyder was very popular and was the only governor of Pennsylvania to serve three terms.

==History==
The name of the town comes from its days as a coal port on the Pennsylvania Canal. Coal from the mines of the Zerbe Valley, near Trevorton was shipped to the town via the Trevorton and Susquehanna Railroad, which was completed in 1855, crossing the Susquehanna River on a long bridge from Herndon to Port Trevorton. A canal basin was built for coal loading from the railcars. However, a new route was built to the coal mines via Shamokin, and the bridge was removed in 1870. As the fortunes of the canal declined, so too did those of the town.

<text>Selinsgrove is the largest borough in Snyder County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population is estimated to be 5,761 for the 2020 Census.

Selinsgrove is geographically located in the middle of the Susquehanna River Valley in Central Pennsylvania, along U.S. Routes 11 and 15, 45 miles north of Harrisburg and southwest of Sunbury. It is the home of Susquehanna University.

==History==
Selinsgrove was founded in 1787 by Captain Anthony Selin, who fought in the American Revolution.

The Penns Creek Massacre on October 16, 1755 was the first of a series of deadly raids on Pennsylvania settlements by Native Americans allied with the French in the French and Indian War. A marker on the bank of Penns Creek north of Selinsgrove commemorates the massacre of 14 settlers and the capture of 11 more. In response to this and other Indian actions that day, Fort Augusta, Sunbury, Pennsylvania, the largest of Pennsylvania&#x27;s frontier forts, was built in 1756 as a result of this conflict.

Selinsgrove Hall and Seibert Hall at Susquehanna University and Gov. Simon Snyder Mansion on Market Street are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of . Selinsgrove borders the Susquehanna River. The portion of the borough that is located between Penns Creek and the Susquehanna River is known locally as the &quot;Isle of Que&quot; (pronounced &quot;queue&quot;).

===Climate===
==Demographics==

Selinsgrove is the principal city in the Selinsgrove, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area&quot;,&quot; and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area.

As of the census of 2010, there were 5,654 people, 1,812 households, and 930 families residing in the borough. The population density was . There were 1,934 housing units, of which 122 were vacant. The racial makeup of the borough was 91.7% White, 3.4% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 1.8% from &quot;some other race,&quot; and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.0% of the population. A majority of the Hispanic or Latino population was Mexican.

The presence of Susquehanna University strongly impacts the borough&#x27;s demographics: 31.1% of the population lives in group quarters - largely dormitories - rather than in households. The student population is also visible in the disproportionate share of 18- to 24-year-olds.

Of the 1,812 households, 930 were families, 449 of which included related children under age 18. Among the families, 632 were husband-wife families, of which 231 had children at home. Only 92 households included 5 or more people.

Among the 882 non-family households, 404 were women living alone and 255 were men living alone. There were 1,760 people living in group quarters, of whom 153 were institutionalized. Among the non-institutionalized 1,607 living in group quarters - i.e. university students - 54% were female.

The borough&#x27;s median age was 22.9 years. Due to the college, 39% of residents were age 18-24. Another 14% were under 18, 17% were 25-44, 16% were 45-64, and 14% were 65 and older.

Women make up the borough&#x27;s majority, 53.6% of the population, implying that there are 86 men for every 100 women in Selinsgrove. Among those age 65 and older, 65% are women. The share of women is 52 or 53% for ages 18–24, 25-44, and 45-64. Among children, girls are 49% of the population.

According to the 2013-2017 American Community Survey, median income for a household in the borough was $47,500, and the median income for a family was $54,190. The unemployment rate for residents age 25-64 was 1.8% and the labor force participation rate was 84.1%. About 11% of families and 10% of the population (excluding students) were below the poverty line. However, income and poverty statistics for a community this small are reported with large margins of error and do not cover the student population.

==Economy==
The largest local employers are housing-related manufacturers and educational institutions including the public schools and Susquehanna University. Educational services and health care/social assistance combined are projected to be about 90.7% of all job growth by 2014 in the central region. Manufacturing of both non-durable and durable goods are expected to lose over 4,000 jobs (a change of about -9.1% in employment) in the same time period. Construction is the only goods-producing sector projecting job growth, where employment may increase by about 210 jobs (or about 2.1%).

Outside of the community local region employment includes: service jobs in local businesses, area hospitals which include UPMC Susquehanna Sunbury in Sunbury and Evangelical Hospital in Lewisburg.

==Government==
The borough is governed by an elected council of seven residents. There is an elected mayor, a borough manager and a chief of police.

<doc id="133762" wikidata="Q1180828" url="?curid=133762" title="Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania">
<text>Shamokin Dam is a borough in Snyder County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,647 at the 2020 census.

&quot;Shamokin&quot; , or &quot;Shahëmokink&quot; in the Delaware language, and Schahamokink in another Algonquian language, means &quot;place of eels.&quot; The borough name is also derived from a dam that was built across the Susquehanna River in the 19th century. The dam supported steamboat ferries run by Ira T. Clement, which transported goods and people between Shamokin Dam and the city of Sunbury on the Northumberland County side of the river. These ferries operated from 1772 until the Bainbridge Street Bridge was built in 1907. The dam also provided water to the Susquehanna Division of the Pennsylvania Canal System, which was constructed on the western bank of the river. The dam was destroyed by ice in March 1904. Shamokin Dam is distinct from the city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located about 14 miles to the east in Northumberland County.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (2.66%) is water.

Shamokin Dam sits on the western bank of the Susquehanna River, just south of the confluence of the river&#x27;s west and north
branches. The borough is also bordered by the community of Hummels Wharf, Monroe Township, and U.S. Route 15.

The Norfolk Southern Railway (formerly Conrail/Penn Central/Pennsylvania Railroad) passes through the borough between the Old Trail Road and the Susquehanna River.

There are several small, unnamed creeks that cross the borough, eventually draining into the Susquehanna River. Seasonal flooding occurs in the lowlands between the rail line and the river where the canal once passed. Some areas of the borough lie in the 100 year flood plain.

For many years, addresses in Shamokin Dam were listed under the same ZIP code as Selinsgrove, which was 17870. This led to confusion by delivery companies, emergency services and visitors to the region. Additionally, tax funding that should have gone to Shamokin Dam was lost. The implementation of the GIS readdressing program required that several local communities rename streets so that there were no redundancies within the Selinsgrove ZIP code. This prompted Shamokin Dam officials to appeal to the United States Postal Service for a unique ZIP code, which was awarded. Shamokin Dam addresses then became 17876.

==History==
Pennsylvania was, for centuries, the home of many Native American tribes. During the 17th century the region was dominated by the Haudenosaunee Iroquois Confederacy, which at that time included the Mohawks, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, the Senecas and the Oneidas. Under the Confederacy the area was hunting grounds for the Delaware, Shawnee, Conoy, Monsey, Mohican and Nanticoke peoples. Allumapees was a Delaware chief who lived in Shamokin (now called Sunbury).

A large population of Delaware Indians was forcibly resettled in the area in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was an area that included both present-day Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Shamokin Dam.

From 1727 to 1756, the village of Shamokin was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania. In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island, as well. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.

In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, &quot;to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance.&quot; According to Weslager, &quot;the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut.&quot;

The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions. However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhütten massacre in 1755. Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 1756 at Shamokin. Read more about early history of Shamokin in Shamokin (village).

Shikellamy, of the Oneida people, came to the region. He negotiated with the white settlers on behalf of the native residents. In 1754, Chief Shikellamy negotiated with Conrad Weiser to set the Blue Mountains as the upper limit settlement in the native people&#x27;s home lands. Weiser told the area&#x27;s settlers they could not remain. The Six Nations Treaty of 1754 permitted settlements to move west of the Susquehanna River into lands that eventually became Snyder County. Many natives argued they had been cheated by the treaty. Conflicts between the settlers and the native peoples resulted in deaths on both sides. Eventually, the native peoples were pushed out by the white settlers after the French and Indian War.

Germans were among the first European settlers in the region. Their influence continues today in the presence of the Amish and Mennonite sects.

Shamokin Dam was founded by George Keen in 1745. At the time it was named Keensville. Most of the residents were canal workers, raftsmen, shad fishermen and eel fishermen. Restaurants and hotels provided support for the workers and travelers. A lock for the Pennsylvania Canal was located on the riverbank. Most of the local commerce revolved around transportation and supporting the canal.

In 1907 a toll bridge was completed that connected Shamokin Dam to Sunbury the county seat of Northumberland County. The cost for construction was $150,000. A full-time toll collector lived in the house that straddled the bridge. A gate closed the bridge at night. A bell was posted to summon the toll worker during the night. The bridge was used by pedestrians, buggies and motor cars. The toll was 3 cents for walkers, 4 cents for bicyclists, with 15 cents for horses, buggies and motor cars.

==Economics==
The coal fired Sunbury power plant was commissioned by the PPL Corporation company in 1949. It went into operation in 1953. Sunbury Generation Station is located along the Susquehanna River in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania. The plant was purchased by WPS Power Development in November 1999 from PP&amp;L Resources. The plant is part of the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/Maryland (PJM) market area. Power from the plant is sold into Pennsylvania&#x27;s deregulated electric market. In May 2005, the facility&#x27;s emission allowances for both sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) were sold and a seasonal operation plan was announced. Then in July 2006 the plant was sold to Corona Power, LLC. The gross proceeds received by WPS for the 421.7 megawatt power plant were about $34.6 million, and were subject to certain working capital and other post-closing adjustments. In 2006, Corona Power, LLC sought and won a substantial reduction in the tax assessment of the property. The assessment was cut by more than two thirds. Additionally, there is a freeze on the assessment for several years regardless of improvements made on the property.

U.S. Routes 11 and 15 pass through the borough. The highway is a major travel artery through the region.

<text>Berlin is a borough located approximately 75 miles southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,004 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The town&#x27;s major celebration each fall concerns the Whiskey Rebellion in the 1790s, although in recent years residents also commemorate the termination of Flight 93 in nearby Shanksville in 2001. The Berlin Fife and Drum Corps is one of the oldest such bands in North America. Snyder of Berlin potato chips are made in town, which also hosts Center Rock, Inc., a drilling-equipment manufacturer. Farming and coal mining have long been important in the area.

It is not located near East Berlin in Adams County, or New Berlin in Union County. East Berlin was previously called Berlin but had to have the &quot;East&quot; added to avoid confusion with this Berlin.

==History==

Immigrants (especially those from Germany) began settling the area before the American Revolutionary War, and the surrounding Brothersvalley Township was incorporated in 1771. Further settlement occurred by Revolutionary War veterans, so the borough was laid out in 1784 and formally incorporated on February 7, 1833.

In June 1794, a riot occurred at the Berlin Schoolhouse during the Whiskey Rebellion. By September, Irish immigrant Robert Philson raised a liberty pole at his log store on the square and advised citizens to oppose U.S. laws. Federal troops arrived in October, and the rebellion evaporated, with Philson and itinerant preacher Herman Husband being taken to Philadelphia for trial (where they were acquitted). Governor Thomas Mifflin made his headquarters in Dr. Christian Boerstler&#x27;s house.

Local attorney Jeremiah S. Black rose to become Justice of Pennsylvania (1851-1857, serving as Chief Justice from 1851 to 1853). After election of fellow Pennsylvanian James Buchanan as President of the United States, he began litigating fraudulent land claims in California as United States Attorney General and later served as Secretary of State.

== History ==
Boswell was settled in 1901 and incorporated as a borough on February 22, 1904. The community&#x27;s founder was Thomas Taylor Boswell, the first president and supervisor of the Merchants Coal Company. Mr. Boswell&#x27;s company purchased of mineral rights under local farmland and laid out 1,600 lots for coal company houses to house the miners for its new deep coal mine just to the north. Merchants Coal, and the related Orenda Coal, were subsidiaries of Hillman Coal and Coke Company of Pittsburgh, the same firm that built the neighboring town of Jerome, Pennsylvania.

Merchants Coal attempted to build Boswell to be a notch above surrounding coal company towns in that plans included a central business district, a high school, and homes constructed from brick, as opposed to the wood used elsewhere. This also helped to prevent the spread of fire, in the event that one would break out. Many of the original brick homes are still standing, with much of their original integrity. A branch of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad served Boswell and its coal mine. At its economic peak shortly after World War II, Boswell boasted two movie theatres, three department stores, a bank, several jewelry stores, a druggist, two funeral homes, three grocery stores, nearly a dozen restaurants and taverns, a lumber yard, and a weekly newspaper. Earlier, pre-Prohibition, Boswell also housed its own brewery.

Boswell&#x27;s streets generally run perpendicular to its avenues, in a grid. Many of the avenues in Boswell are named after coal company officials. For example:
* Hower Avenue, after Charles E. Hower, a Surveyor from Johnstown.
* Morris Avenue, after W.H. Morris, a known builder from Johnstown
* Atkinson Way, after W.G. Atkinson, the Vice President of Merchants Coal Company.
At the same time, the borough&#x27;s street names can provide a geography lesson, following the flow of water from Boswell to the seas, with two exceptions made for streets in the central business district. Street names from north to south are: Quemahoning, Stonycreek, Center (in place of &quot;Conemaugh&quot; for the Conemaugh River), Main (in place of &quot;Kiskiminetas&quot; for the Kiskiminetas River), Allegheny, Ohio, Mississippi, Mexico (for the Gulf of Mexico), Atlantic and Pacific.

The mine, Orenda Mine #1, extracted high quality, semi-bituminous coal. A steam engine hoisted the coal to the surface. The hoist pulled the coal cars up a coal tipple that was long, high, and wide. In 1920, this was the largest coal tipple in the world. At its prime, 900 men were employed and over 3,000 tons of coal were mined daily. The company was eventually renamed to the United Coal Company and in 1918 it became the Davis Coal Company.

For most of its history, the mine at Boswell operated without union representation. An early attempt to unionize workers led to an armed riot on January 17, 1904. Seven were wounded and 20 arrested in the melee. A prolonged struggle for unionization, which began at Jerome and Windber in northern Somerset County in early April, 1922, extended to Boswell on April 17. By April 24, 1922, miners at Acosta, Gray, Ralphton, Randolph and Jenners also joined the strike, which was to last sixteen months. (For a more detailed discussion of the strike, see the wiki for Jerome, Pennsylvania.)

==Mining disasters==

There have been two noteworthy disasters at the Boswell mines. A methane gas explosion killed five miners in 1909 and another explosion in 1915 killed 22 miners.

Mining at Boswell was a problem-plagued effort, according to discussions with local residents from the era. While much archival research remains to be done to corroborate these details, it seems apparent that Merchants Coal, and its parent which was eventually known as Hillman Coal &amp; Coke, miscalculated in the siting of Boswell and its mine. Given the size of Merchant&#x27;s capital outlay—including construction in Boswell of the world&#x27;s largest tipple, a central business district and a high school—the company planned big things for Boswell. The town of Jerome appears to have been built as a satellite town, soon to be linked with Boswell, both underground in coal production and on the surface in social and cultural life (the right-of-way for a street car line was acquired between Jerome and Boswell, for instance). However, local miners tell of the &quot;Stone Wall,&quot; an unexpected and virtually insurmountable underground geological fault hit midway between Jerome and Boswell that prevented the linking of the two mines at a reasonable cost. Evidence of this fault can be seen on the land surface near Route 601 about two miles (3 km) south of Jerome. (Indeed, when mechanized deep-mining resumed in this area for a time in the late 20th century, the entry shaft was sunk adjacent to this fault, presumably so access could be had to the entire field.) It can be speculated that Hillman had planned to use Boswell as its primary processing facility after the link-up, thus the huge tipple. Hillman also likely planned to make Boswell the center of operations and community life (of evidence, the high school). But the two mines never came together; in fact, Boswell&#x27;s mine proved to be significantly less productive than Jerome&#x27;s, as shown by documented production figures from 1927, for example. In that year, Boswell produced 204,592 tons of coal, while Jerome produced 816,568 tons, four times as much.

The Boswell mine closed on March 29, 1939, due to the excessive cost of transporting coal to the surface (the Jerome mine worked until 1954). The Boswell tipple was dismantled in 1940, though some of the tipple&#x27;s abutments still stand today. After the mine closed a slow economic decline set in. However, many businesses survived well into the 1960s and early 1970s. Railroad freight service to Boswell stopped in the early 1970s. Boswell today is primarily a bedroom community.

In 1970, the high school was rechristened as North Star High School. It is the successor from the earlier Boswell, Jenner Boswell, Jenner-Boswell-Jennerstown, and Forbes High Schools. The high school is approaching its centenary and currently serves the two surrounding townships (Jenner and Quemahoning) and three boroughs (Jennerstown, Stoystown and Hooversville) in addition to Boswell residents.

Orenda Park, a community forest and picnic area, has been established at the site of the former coal tipple. The park is maintained by the Boswell Area Historical Society. The Boswell Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

==Environmental impact of mining==
Drainage from the Boswell mine was a primary source of pollution into Quemahoning Creek, which flows just north of Boswell. A remediation project was completed in 2005, spearheaded by SCRIP (Stonycreek-Conemaugh River Improvement Project), a non-governmental organization, in collaboration with OSM, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy, Somerset County Conservation District and Reliant Energy. In addition, the Jenner Rod &amp; Gun Club, a local sportsmen&#x27;s club, provided significant funds to purchase property for the remediation site.

The discovery of the purple fringeless orchid, an endangered species, within the remediation site complicated the project. The plants were relocated successfully to unimpacted wetlands immediately adjacent to the remediation site in 2004.

The most recent information showed the system is treating between 1,600 and 2,000 gallons of water per minute, removing approximately 80 tons of iron a day from the water. About 3,000 trout were stocked successfully into a four-mile (6 km) section of the Creek downstream from Boswell in 2005, the first time the creek supported a fishery along this stretch in almost 100 years.

The objective was to build a railroad into the large coal field known to exist in this region. The projected railroad, under a preliminary survey made in 1894, would have extended the road southeastward along Dark Shade Creek and Shingle Run valleys, across the mountain by way of Frazier&#x27;s Gap, into Bedford County and eastward to the Atlantic seaboard; however, the project failed to develop. In 1913, an extension to the town was laid out by the Cook and Neasley Realty Company on lands then owned by John Wechtenhiser and Obadiah Lohr. The town was incorporated into the borough of Central City in 1918.

Initially, there were major plans for the town of Central City. In 1921, Central City became a charter bank (Charter # 11967) to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

The Central City Volunteer Fire Company provides fire protection for both the borough and the surrounding area. The Central City post office was established in 1919, with Joseph Lohr as the first postmaster. A new post office building was erected in 1962. Free mail service was established in the borough in 1955. Free public recreation facilities are owned by the borough, such as a tennis court, baseball field, and a well-maintained park.

<text>Garrett is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 416 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Garrett was first settled in 1869 and was incorporated in 1900. Garrett is named for the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad John Work Garrett. John W. Garrett served as president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1858–1884 and was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 31, 1820. He was the second son of Elizabeth Stouffer and Robert Garrett. He married Rachel Ann Harrison, the daughter of Thomas Harrison, a Baltimore merchant. They had one daughter, Mary and two sons, Robert and Thomas Harrison Garrett.

During the height of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, Garrett served as the junction of its Pittsburgh Division with its Berlin branch. The Berlin Branch Railroad was originally built by the Buffalo Valley Railroad Company in 1871. This 8.5 mile branch line connected Berlin to the main B&amp;O line (also known as the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad) as it passed through Garrett, and it was taken over by the B&amp;O itself in 1880. There were seven stations located along the Berlin branch as it ran northeast along the Buffalo Creek valley: Garrett, Burkholder, Buchle, Bitner, Pine Hill, Hanger&#x27;s, and Berlin. A view of Garrett appeared in a collection of photographs from along the B&amp;O&#x27;s lines that was published in book form in 1872 and digitized by the DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University.

The Western Maryland Railroad ran in an East to West direction on the Brooklyn side of Garrett. It is the current site of the Great Allegheny Passage. A 150-mile system of biking and hiking trails connecting Cumberland, Maryland and Pittsburgh that was constructed on the former Western Maryland railroad bed. The Connellsville Extension of the Western Maryland Railroad was built west from Cumberland, Maryland, to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, beginning around 1906 and was completed in 1912.

In 1964, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) jointly filed for permission to acquire control of the Western Maryland Railway with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In 1973, as part of the Chessie System, the Western Maryland ownership went to C&amp;O and it was operated by the B&amp;O. In 1987, it was merged into the C&amp;O which itself became part of CSX Transportation.

==History==
Initial hunters and settlers in the territory that includes present-day Jenner Township were Mingo, also known as the Seneca, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois. The land was ceded by the Iroquois Six Nations officially by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 to Penn family as proprietors of Pennsylvania province. Early European traders crossed Jenner Township as early as 1750, when Christopher Gist documented his brief time there in his travel diary. Gist is said to have named Quemahoning Creek, which drains much of Jenner Township. The Northern Trail, an established Indian trail, crossed the territory from east to west, intersecting Quemahoning Creek at Kickenapaulin&#x27;s Town, a rather substantial Indian settlement, the site of which now lies under the waters of the Quemahoning Reservoir, just outside the township. In August 1758, the Northern Trail was improved, initially for the British military use, and renamed the Forbes Trail, later known as the Pennsylvania Road, the Lincoln Highway, and now U.S. Route 30.

With the building of the Forbes Road to Fort Ligonier and, later, onward to Fort Pitt, present-day Pittsburgh, European settlement began in earnest. Jenner Township was formed out of the western part of Quemahoning Township in 1811. The township was named in honor of Dr. Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Early Jenner Township settlers were primarily German and English speakers engaged in agriculture. Pennsylvania Dutch was still spoken in rural parts of the township until the 1960s.

Some of the first settlers were Robert &amp; Rhoda Smiley in the 1780s. Jenner Crossroads, the township&#x27;s first substantial European settlement, grew near a grist mill and tavern stop established about 1800 along the Pennsylvania Road. Samuel Steel built a sawmill at Jenner Crossroads in 1817; John Shopwood opened a hotel in 1825, and Samuel Elder opened the first store in 1836. Other early industry in the township included a sawmill on Quemahoning Creek built about 1813 by Moses Fream and a small woolen mill, built in 1817 by William Dalley, enlarged by Owen and William Morgan later into a small settlement known as Morgantown. A Lutheran church was built in the township in 1814, a Methodist Episcopal church in 1827, a Reformed church in 1841, and a United Brethren church in 1849.

Jenners, Ralphton, Acosta and Gray were each built shortly after 1900 as company towns by Consolidation Coal, a Rockefeller interest, for its newly opened deep coal mines. Immigrants from Poland, Italy, Russia, Ruthenia, Wales, and Ireland filled the coal towns. The Somerset Coal Strike of 1922–1923 centered in these towns, and nearby Boswell, Jerome and Windber. The strike, which ultimately failed in its goal to unionize miners, drew significant nationwide attention for the hardships suffered by local miners. By the 1960s, the deep mines had closed. The town of Randolph was also a very small coal mining community in Jenner Township, any trace of which is now virtually gone, having been destroyed by highway construction in 1970.

Surface mining and some deep mining of coal continues in the immediate area. Farming, timber harvest and tourism are also mainstays of the local economy. Jenner Township also serves as a bedroom community for the nearby Somerset and Johnstown areas.

The Bridge in Jenner Township and Matthew Hair Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Jennerstown was first settled in the late 18th century as a stage coach stop on the Forbes Road, one of the first roads constructed by English-speaking settlers over the Allegheny Mountains. The town, originally named Laurel Hill, was later renamed Jennerville in honor of Dr. Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Later, Jennerville became Jennerstown. The town and vicinity boast several buildings about 200 years old, which is not common in the surrounding area.

Throughout its history, Jennerstown has served primarily as a wayside for travelers and as a farming community. Its post office was established in 1832, initially under the name of Laurel Hill. The village contained seven or eight houses, a store and a tavern at that time. Jennerstown incorporated as a borough in 1874. Jennerstown has never been a large town, and its current population represents a peak.

Jennerstown is home to the Mountain Playhouse, one of the oldest venues for summer stock theatre in the United States. The Mountain Playhouse has maintained a full schedule of live theatre productions nightly from May through October each year for the last seventy-seven years. Jennerstown Speedway is a popular summer destination for stock car racing.

== History ==

Jerome was built in 1904 as a company town for what became the Hillman Coal and Coke Company Company of Pittsburgh, and named for Jerome Coulson, the son of a coal company official. The town filled mostly with immigrants from Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Russia and Italy—particularly Italians from the Alpine province of Trentino and the town of San Lorenzo in Banale (part of the Dolomiti di Brenta area)—in addition to local Scots-Irish, Welsh and German stock. Jerome was the largest single coal mine in the Cambria-Somerset district.

Jerome&#x27;s wood frame houses were primarily of two designs—two-story semi-detached houses and smaller single-family cottages. Most of these initial dwellings still stand today. These houses, especially in the period before 1970, typically were surrounded by large vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and grape arbors. Homemade wine was a local specialty.

At its economic peak, Jerome boasted a 300-seat movie theatre, a bank, a hotel, an auto dealership, several dry goods and grocery stores, several taverns, an electrical appliance store, a YMCA, and a bowling alley. A local tavern maintained a popular bocce court. The mine employed over 1000 men. Residents from that period claim Jerome&#x27;s population stood at about 3,000 at its peak, although this information is yet to be documented. However, Jerome&#x27;s population certainly was sufficient to justify the capital investment to tie the town into the interurban transit system. Electric streetcar service from Jerome to the nearby city of Johnstown was proposed as early as 1908. In 1921, the project was financed through a public bond offering, construction was completed and service began. The streetcar tram left from the Jerome terminus every two hours for the 60-minute trip that ended on downtown Johnstown&#x27;s Main Street.

Property right-of-way was obtained to extend this tram service to the south to Boswell, Jenners, Somerset, and Rockwood, although track construction never commenced. Service to Johnstown ended in 1933. Separately, a branch line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) served Jerome and its coal mine, connecting to the B&amp;O trunk line in present-day Benson.

An underground explosion killed two miners instantly and two later from burns received at the Jerome mine on July 29, 1932, The single largest accident in the mine&#x27;s history uncovered in research to date. The coal mine closed in the 1954. Jerome rapidly became a bedroom community. The town retained much of its close-knit ethnic character and its spirit well into the 1990s, however. As an example, the Jerome Volunteer Fire Department was founded in 1952 with Steve Gironda as its first president. The Volunteer Fire Department remains today as an anchor of community activity. In 1955, the Dorfman and Hoffman Company established a garment factory in the former Hillman company store building, bringing 200 needed jobs to Jerome. The factory continued operation until 1964. A lumber mill operated out of former mining operations buildings in the 1970s. A wind-whipped fire destroyed the lumber mill in 1975, and the remaining mining buildings were demolished subsequently.

National Football League quarterback Jeff Hostetler (career 1985-1997) grew up on a farm just outside Jerome. Hostetler led the New York Giants to their 20-19 win over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV (see 1990 New York Giants season). Jerome native Brian Ferrari qualified for the 1992 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials. Ferrari also holds two NCAA Division II championships in 10,000 meters and one national cross-country championship. In 1998, Jerome natives Dick Trachok and Tommy Kalmanir each were inducted into the University of Nevada, Reno&#x27;s football Team of Century. Kalminer played in Nevada&#x27;s backfield, 1946–48, and later played for the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts. Trachock was a top running back at Nevada and later served as Nevada&#x27;s head football coach (1959–1968) and athletic director (1970–1986). Jerome&#x27;s Tony Venzon (1915–1971) was a baseball umpire for the National League 1957-1971, including 1959, 1962 and 1969 All-Star Games and 1963 and 1965 World Series. Jazz clarinetist, band leader and composer Ted Lach (1914–1968) was a native of Jerome.

==The miners&#x27; strike of 1922-1923==
Jerome was the scene of several unionization efforts by the United Mine Workers Union. An important and the longest of these efforts was the strike that began on Good Friday morning, April 14, 1922, led by local miner George Gregory, with the assistance of outside union supporters.

Rumors of strikes at non-union mines, such as Jerome at that time, had been circulating for several weeks. Indeed, the General Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers Union issued a call on March 24 for the nation&#x27;s 200,000 non-union miners to join a planned nationwide strike on April 1, to coincide with the expiration of the current union contract. Organizers slid past armed company police to circulate pamphlets and leaflets, as seen here and here, to encourage the miners&#x27; walk out.

===Hillman Coal&#x27;s viewpoint===
For its part, Hillman Coal and Coke believed it provided a willful benevolence within Jerome and Boswell, its two coal towns in Somerset County, although miners under Hillman tutelage disagreed, as the strike would show. To be sure, Hillman ran these towns with an iron fist; simply entering Jerome by car required inspection by a gauntlet of armed private police, for instance. But Hillman also built Boswell with a number of extra amenities, such as a high school, central business district, and brick construction for its patch housing. And in Jerome, the Company built a community center including a YMCA, pool hall, bowling alley, butchery, greengrocer, theater, and post office, in addition to the Hillman Supply Company store. In October 1921 Hillman established the First National Bank of Jerome for its workers. It allowed for the construction of a streetcar line from Johnstown in 1921 (as noted above), which made travel easier and more frequent than could be provided by the railroad. Hillman even engaged in a significant capital re-investment at Jerome, rebuilding a brick new community center after the initial structure was destroyed in a spectacular, wind-driven fire on April 2, 1922.

However, demand for coal nationwide dropped precipitously and continually for several years after World War I. In response, Hillman closed its mines at Ella and Patterson, Allegheny County, and at Naomi, Fayette County, but maintained production at Boswell and Jerome. By mid-1921, the Company told its shareholders in its annual report, “…the demand [for coal] became so small and the competition from non-union fields so severe that it was evident that the non-union mines of your Company could not continue to operate unless wages were readjusted. As a result of this condition, wages were reduced…at your Jerome Mines on July 16, 1921.” Hillman continued that the reduction allowed the Jerome mine to operate “on a competitive basis” and “with regularity,” with the result being that “earnings of the men at your non-union mines for the year 1921 are far in excess of those received by men at union mines….”, who, Hillman implied, suffered frequent short-term furloughs as the result of slack demand. Hillman told its shareholders that, prior to the pay cut, “men working by day were being paid $7.50 for eight hours work, and men working by the ton were able to earn $10.00 to $14.00 per day.” (Note that these wages reported by Hillman to its stockholders were flatly contradicted by other reportage, for instance, Blankenhorn maintained that union gross wages in 1922 more typically ranged from $14.60 to $17.50 per &quot;week&quot;, and after deductions for goods purchased through company stores, a typical miner&#x27;s weekly net take-home pay often was less than $1.00.) On all its coal operations, including Jerome and Boswell, Hillman Coal and Coke reported an operating profit of approximately $925,000, on revenues of $8.225 million in 1919, and an operating profit of approximately $336,000, on revenues of $4.475 million in 1921.

But Jerome was seething. Hillman Coal &amp; Coke cut miners&#x27; wages a second time during the deflation of 1921 and working conditions remained hard and strict, to miners&#x27; perception. Additionally, mine owners had recently ceased payment and expected miners to do for no pay &quot;dead work&quot;, which was the removal of non-bituminous soils, slate, and rubbish from the mines. Gregory and local miners held several secret pre-strike rallies at the &quot;Sokolniapolskawjerom&quot;, the Jerome Polish Falcons Hall, although one wonders how secret they were, given over 600 men attended one meeting. Sensing trouble, Hillman suddenly increased its armed guard patrolling the town at the end of March 1922. Hillman police also were stopping all autos before entering Jerome. Scattered walkouts began at smaller non-union mines—in St. Michael, Cambria County, a partial strike began on April 1 and gained momentum through April 5, and at Mine 36, near Windber, Somerset County, a walk-out on April 6.

===Powers Hapgood and his work===
On April 11, John Brophy, president of United Mine Workers Union District 2, asked Powers Hapgood, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate, who had given up his silver spoon to live and work as a miner, if he would volunteer to help organize Somerset County non-union mines. Hapgood began at Jerome and Boswell.

The gentle-looking Hapgood, nephew of the U.S.’s ambassador to Denmark, at first evoked much derision among some Union officials, although apparently not among miners, with whom he worked shoulder-to-shoulder deep in the mines. Four decades later, Brophy wrote of Hapgood, &quot;He was sincere, friendly, and courageous to the point of foolhardiness. By that, I mean that he would sometimes drive ahead in a situation without considering sufficiently what he was up against. As a result, he got some pretty hard knocks at times.&quot; In Jerome, Hapgood linked up with Gregory. While more acquainted with the rough-and-tumble than was Hapgood initially, Gregory himself—who went by the nickname &quot;Praying George,&quot; because of his frequent and vocal prayers during workers&#x27; rallies—was a strict teetotaler, who had been deputized by the local sheriff for a Prohibition squad. In idealism and social vision, Gregory and Hapgood were kindred spirits. The two became lifelong friends.

In addition to direct work as a miner, Hapgood relied on three approaches to organize the Somerset coalfields – civil disobedience, litigation, and publicity. First, in pioneering methods evocative later of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Hapgood depended heavily on peaceful, civil disobedience. Coal towns were the wholly-owned, private property of corporations at the time, and so, in the eyes of these companies, simply walking the street uninvited was deemed to be trespassing. Hapgood in Somerset County was arrested more than a dozen times on the picket line and at the head of marches, as the strike unfolded. (Hapgood, Gregory, and others also took picketing directly to various corporate headquarters on Wall Street, where they did not invite arrest but achieved considerable positive publicity and access.)

Hapgood’s arrests then gave him a venue to the judicial system, where Hapgood insisted on his – and the miners’ – procedural and Constitutional rights. Indeed, an important part of the Somerset County coal strike played out in the courtroom of Somerset County Judge John Berkey, where mine owners sometimes, but not always, prevailed under Judge Berkey’s often even-handed rulings.

Hapgood, as the strike continued, then made sure that the plight of Somerset County miners remained front-page news across the United States. From the strike&#x27;s beginning, Hapgood, Brophy, Gregory, and other union leaders understood the powerful role public opinion could play; The men engaged in what, even by today’s best practices, would be seen as a sophisticated public relations program. In New York City, the program sparked sympathetic press coverage, generally effective public affairs, the intervention by the mayor of New York on the miners&#x27; side, direct public appeals in the subways, and even the support of mine owners, such as John D. Rockefeller Jr., whose family owned strike-bound Somerset County coal mines in Gray, Jenners, Acosta, Ralphton and Randolph. Gregory and other miners later traveled to Washington to meet with President Warren G. Harding.

===The strike at Jerome begins===
On April 14, Jerome miners dressed for work and gathered at the shaft head, but refused to enter the mine. Blankenhorn, in his history of the strike, wrote, &quot;The super began a conciliatory speech of promises of good treatment, &#x27;What&#x27;s the good of that? We&#x27;ve heard that bull for ten years,&#x27; cried Gregory...&#x27;If you don&#x27;t go to work, I&#x27;ll shut down this mine till the grass grows over the drift mouth,&#x27; [the super responded]...A boy miner, DiGiancomo, shouted back, &#x27;I&#x27;ll eat that grass before I&#x27;ll scab.&quot; And the strike was on. The men marched through Jerome, with an accordion player in the lead, to a mass rally that was still going strong when union organizers arrived around noontime. The mine owners were thunderstruck; never before had they been hit by a successful universal rebellion against their rule. The Jerome action lit the fuse; the strike spread to non-union mines in Hiyasota, Kelso, Boswell, Jenners, Listie, Acosta, Gray, and elsewhere the next days; within one week a regional non-union coal work stoppage was in full force. The Jerome strike was significant in that it was among the first and the largest non-union site in the region to join in the nationwide strike called by the United Mine Workers Union, thus providing tipping-point momentum for the strike, or as Blankenhorn expressed it in his book&#x27;s table of contents, &quot;Jerome&#x27;s Explosion.&quot; The 1922 strike became the largest action in United Mine Workers Union history; at its peak, more than 500,000 union and non-union miners, in the bituminous and anthracite fields, had walked off their jobs.

Jerome was turned into an occupied camp by a strike that lasted sixteen months. By mid-May 1922, for instance, 29 Somerset County sheriff&#x27;s deputies patrolled Jerome, alongside a much larger contingent of company police and a unit of the Pennsylvania State police. The State Militia arrived a few months later. During this period, Hillman Coal systematically began to evict miner families from company-owned housing. According to Hillman records, quoted by Blankenhorn, 192 families in Jerome were set out into the street, about one-third of Hillman&#x27;s employment at the mine at the time. A &#x27;tent city&#x27; was established for homeless strikers and their families on the nearby lands of sympathetic farmers. These evictions here and elsewhere in Somerset County sparked an unusual swell of public sympathy. A commission appointed by the mayor of New York City, which got its coal to run subways from various Somerset County coal mines, found &quot;hundreds of strikers evicted and suffering from the cold&quot;, &quot;saw in tents, hen-houses, stables and other improvised homes women and children whose feet were bare and bleeding&quot; and declared that living and working conditions &quot;were worse than the conditions of slaves prior to the Civil War.&quot; John D. Rockefeller Jr., whose family owned several Somerset County coal mines, but not Jerome&#x27;s, wrote, &quot;I believe that the underlying grievances of the miners in this district are well founded, and I have urged with all the sincerity and vigor at my command that the present labor policy of the operators, which seems to me to be both unwise and unjust, be radically altered.&quot;

The strike held together, despite its length and brutality; the Company said later that, of the approximately 750 miners on strike at its beginning, only about 100 broke ranks and returned to work early. In the last days of the strike in 1923, a number of buildings, railroad bridges, and other property were destroyed by dynamite in acts of sabotage. A gunpowder or dynamite blast destroyed a shelter for homeless striking families. Dynamite destroyed a 200-foot steel railroad bridge spanning the Stonycreek River near Jerome on July 19, 1923. Somerset County Sheriff J.W.Griffith told writer Blankenhorn that both strikers and company employees held responsibility for explosions. &quot;There are guards who want to keep their jobs going and strikers who have been making threats,&quot; Sheriff Griffith said.

===Results of the strike at Jerome===
While the strike caused significant hardship, and even decayed into violence frequently from both sides, not all was grim. Blankenhorn, who was a writer for the magazine &quot;The Nation&quot;, relayed the adventure of one young student and union organizer from Pittsburgh, named Viscosky, who convinced Hillman to hire him as a guard just prior to the strike. Blackenhorn wrote, Viscosky &quot;used his very special opportunity to line them [the miners] up for a strike. The only man whom he reported to the company was one who refused to have anything to do with the &#x27;union,&#x27; the company faithfully discharged that one.&quot; Later, when Viscosky thought it prudent to disappear from Jerome before Hillman caught on, he convinced police officials to give him free conduct pass through checkpoints, &quot;so he could visit his sister in Jenners.&quot;

In August 1922, union miners agreed to a new contract that did not include non-union miners. The miners at Jerome and other Somerset County mines, left out of the contract, continued on for another twelve months, agreeing on August 14, 1923, to return to work finally having been exhausted by a process that, for them, produced little economic benefit immediately. At Jerome, Hillman Coal offered a general amnesty to most miners, if each returned to work as an individual and not as part of a local union. Nevertheless, the solid front displayed by Jerome miners laid the groundwork for the mine&#x27;s eventual unionization in the 1930s. Further, as Hapgood, Blankenhorn, Beik, and others point out, the miners themselves felt the 1922-23 strike to be a victory. Prior to the strike, miners felt atomized, helpless, and hopeless; the coal towns of Somerset County were &quot;visibly split&quot; by ethnic divisions &quot;admittedly...fostered by the coal companies&quot; as a means of social control. &quot;[C]oal mining families...[lived] within a social, economic and political system of profound autocracy thinly veiled by shallow, pragmatic paternalism.&quot; After the strike, Jerome emerged with the beginnings of an increasingly strong, tolerant social fabric, which remained tight-knit for several generations and still provides important unifying elements today.

==Environmental impact of coal mining activities at Jerome==
The semi-bituminous coal bed at Jerome, part of the Upper Kittanning formation, was approximately six feet thick, capped by shale and limestone, with a smooth, hard sandstone floor. In 1911, the mine had a capacity of 1,700 tons a day, with an average daily output of 1,020 tons. The tipple had four loading tracks with a capacity of 80 cars. Within the tipple, coal was cleaned first by machine through shaker screens, then by hand, along a conveyor, and at loading. Refuse coal and rock was dumped in a hillside to the south of the tipple.

For the first 70-some years of its history, Jerome&#x27;s landscape was dominated by this black, man-made mountain of coal mining wastes. The &quot;bony pile,&quot; as it was called, loomed from the hillside south of Penn Avenue and east of Cross and Fifth Avenues. Only a few plant species were hardy enough to survive the hot, dry, nutrient-deficient conditions on the pile. Heavy metals, including arsenic and mercury, leached from the pile into the immediately adjacent area. The pile was removed in the 1970s when local electric generating stations found cost-effective ways to render additional coal out of the pile. A much smaller scar remains on the hillside.

Most water runoff from the Jerome mine emptied into the South Fork of Bens Creek at Thomas Mills. Bens Creek used to be a robust trout habitat. Mine effluent contained high concentrations of iron, which rendered downstream sections of Bens Creek effectively sterile from about 1900 to 1994. A remediation project (construction 1992-1994, re-engineered 2002) coordinated by the Stonycreek-Conemaugh River Improvement Project (SCRIP), a local non-governmental organization, restored Bens Creek by precipitating iron toxins from the effluent. The Bens Creek project, also known as the Rock Tunnel Project is home to SCRIP&#x27;s first mine drainage effort (see facts sheet on Bens Creek). SCRIP later restored other creeks and rivers in Somerset and Cambria Counties. Supplemental to the efforts of SCRIP, the Mountain Laurel Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a non-governmental organization, completed a substantial habitat improvement project aimed at increasing the number of fish that Bens Creek can hold. Bens Creek today again contains brook, brown and rainbow trout. Some of these fish are stocked while wild species can be found in headwaters.

<doc id="133798" wikidata="Q6489373" url="?curid=133798" title="Larimer Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Larimer Township is a township in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 543 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Larimer Township was named for General William Larimer, Jr., president of the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad.

==History==

Brigadier General John Forbes&#x27;s Expedition of 1758 passed through the area that became Larimer Township, near Will&#x27;s Creek, as they hacked Forbes Road out of the western Pennsylvania wilderness. (The reference that it was Major General Edward Braddock&#x27;s Expedition of 1755 that passed through this area seems to have mixed up these two expeditions, since Braddock&#x27;s Road passes through the extreme southwest corner of Somerset County.) Jonathan Long arrived in the area as early as 1783, and Richard Geiger was another early settler, possibly around the same time as Long. Daniel Lepley moved into Larimer Township in 1849 and built a gristmill here in 1850. The township was officially organized in 1854.

A portion of the township&#x27;s land was used to incorporate the borough of Callimont in 1972 to build a ski resort. The resort was never completed and the borough used a lot of the township&#x27;s resources during its history, including the use of the township&#x27;s municipal building to hold the borough council meetings. In 2024, voters of Callimont and Larimer Township approved a referendum to merge Callimont back into Larimer Township effective January 1, 2026.

==Geography==
It is located approximately at 39.8015 by -78.9488. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land. Larimer Township is bordered by Northampton Township to the northeast, Southampton Township to the southeast, Greenville Township to the southwest, and Summit &amp; Brothersvalley Townships to the northwest. Pennsylvania Route 160 passes through Larimer Township, heading northwest from Wellersburg &amp; Southampton Township on its way to Northampton Township &amp; Brothersvalley Township.

The Eastern Continental Divide passes through Larimer Township, along the mountain summit above Sand Patch Tunnel. Wills Creek begins in the township and flows into Northampton Township, passing through Glencoe and Fairhope on its course eastward.

==History==
Turkeyfoot Township was formed from part of Brothersvalley Township in 1773, when both were still part of a larger Bedford County; Somerset County was not formed from the western portion of Bedford County until 1795. Just as new counties were split off from earlier counties, new townships were split off from earlier townships, and the townships of Upper Turkeyfoot &amp; Lower Turkeyfoot took their current shapes in 1848. White settlers arrived in the Turkeyfoot area by the late 1760s, and a group of about 15-20 Baptist families came to the area from New Jersey around 1774.

Milford Township was formed from part of Turkeyfoot Township about 1780, when both were still part of a larger Bedford County; Somerset County was not formed from the western portion of Bedford County until April 17, 1795. Neither the exact time nor its original boundaries are known. The original Milford Township included those parts of Somerset and Jefferson townships that lie south of the old Glades road, or the pike, until 1796, and also Middlecreek Township which was separated in 1853 and Black Township which was separated in 1886, whence Milford Township took its current outlines.

The township surrounds the borough of New Centerville. Milford Township is bordered by Jefferson Township to the northwest, Somerset Township to the northeast, Black Township to the southeast, Upper Turkeyfoot Township to the southwest, and Middlecreek Township to the west.

Pennsylvania Route 281 passes through Milford Township, generally running northeast from New Lexington in Middlecreek Township, passing through New Centerville and bisecting Milford Township, and continuing through the southwestern part of Somerset Township on its way to the borough of Somerset.

Rockwood sits at the confluence of Coxes Creek and the Casselman River, between Milford Township to the northwest and Black Township to the southeast. Black Township had been part of Milford Township until it was split off in 1886.

<text>New Baltimore is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 137 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The first settler was Michael Riddlemoser, who built a house here in 1820, and laid out the street plan in 1829. The community was initially known as Mosersburg, and was later renamed New Baltimore, after Riddlemoser&#x27;s hometown. The borough was incorporated in 1874.

In the 1880s, a major railroad yard and maintenance facility were planned for New Baltimore to serve the South Pennsylvania Railroad. In the end, construction on the railroad stopped and the tracks were never laid, and New Baltimore lost its chance to become a significant railroading center.

The New Baltimore Bridge, built in 1879, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Transportation==
New Baltimore is just north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstates 70 and Interstate 76) but it has no interchange, it is also accessed via U.S. 30 (Lincoln Highway).

===Church of the Turnpike===

New Baltimore is perhaps best known for being home to the St. John the Baptist Church, a Carmelite church located on the southern end of town. The church is unique in that it had two sets of steps along the Pennsylvania Turnpike at milepost 129, one set of each side of the highway. (The church itself is located on the eastbound side of the highway.) The steps dated from when the Turnpike first opened, as part of an informal, unwritten pact between the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) and the church after St. John&#x27;s Church was separated from the rest of New Baltimore due to the Turnpike passing through. In addition, Carmelite priests were buried on the right-of-way of the Turnpike, and their graves had to be moved. The steps were long a novelty of the Turnpike and to curious travelers who have stopped along the Turnpike just to stop at the church.

In 2007, the PTC announced that it would eventually remove the steps that lead to St. John&#x27;s Church. The steps were primarily being removed due to a widening project for the Turnpike. While a written pact has not been found by either the church or the PTC, even if a written pact were to be found, the Turnpike was forbidden by federal regulations to replace the steps in any case due to safety concerns. Despite the announcement, the PTC didn&#x27;t start removing the steps until November 2022 when demolition work on the eastbound side of the steps began. The removal was completed by August 2023.

<text>A convent is an enclosed community of monks, nuns, friars or religious sisters. Alternatively, &quot;convent&quot; means the building used by the community. 

The term is particularly used in the Catholic Church, Lutheran churches, and the Anglican Communion.

==Etymology and usage==
The term &quot;convent&quot; derives via Old French from Latin &quot;conventus&quot;, perfect participle of the verb &quot;convenio&quot;, meaning &quot;to convene, to come together&quot;. It was first used in this sense when the eremitical life began to be combined with the cenobitical. The original reference was to the gathering of mendicants who spent much of their time travelling. Technically, a monastery is a secluded community of monastics, whereas a friary or convent is a community of mendicants (which, by contrast, might be located in a city), and a canonry is a community of canons regular. The terms abbey and priory can be applied to both monasteries and canonries; an abbey is headed by an abbot, and a priory is a lesser dependent house headed by a prior. In the Middle Ages, convents often provided to women a way to excel, as they were considered inferior to men. In convents, women were educated and were able to write books and publish works on gardening or musicology. or on religion and philosophy. The abbess of a convent was often also involved in decisions of secular life and interacted with politicians and businessmen. Unlike an abbey, a convent is not placed under the responsibility of an abbot or an abbess, but of a superior or prior. 

In modern English usage, since about the 19th century, the term &quot;convent&quot; almost invariably refers to a community of women, while monastery and friary are used for communities of men. In historical usage they are often interchangeable, with &quot;convent&quot; especially likely to be used for a friary. When applied to religious houses in Eastern Orthodoxy and Buddhism, English refers to all houses of male religious as monasteries and of female religious as convents.

== History ==
The mendicant orders appeared at the beginning of the 13th century with the growth of cities; they include in particular the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites, and the Augustinians. While the Benedictine monks and their various variants devoted themselves to their agricultural properties, the mendicant friars settled from the start in the cities, or in the suburbs thereof, preferably in the poorer and more densely populated districts. They therefore had to adapt their buildings to these new constraints.

At that time, it included the northern portion of present-day Somerset County and part of what is now Cambria County. Its size was later reduced through the formation of new townships. When Somerset County was established in 1795 Quemahoning was one of the six original townships. The name is a Native American name meaning &quot;pine tree lick,&quot; with &quot;cuuni&quot; indicating a pine grove and &quot;mahoni&quot; meaning water from a lick.

The Trostletown Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

It is bordered on the west by Jenner Township, on the north by Conemaugh Township and Paint Township, on the east by Shade Township, and on the south by Stonycreek Township and Somerset Township. Quemahoning Township&#x27;s eastern border is formed by the Stonycreek River and the north-western border by Quemahoning Creek, from which the township got its name; &quot;Quemahoning&quot; is an Indian word meaning &quot;water issuing from a lick.&quot; Quemahoning Township surrounds the borough of Stoystown, and the borough of Hooversville sits on the eastern edge of Quemahoning Township, along its border with Shade Township.

<text>Adolph Green (December 2, 1914 – October 23, 2002) was an American lyricist and playwright who, with long-time collaborator Betty Comden, penned the screenplays and songs for musicals on Broadway and in Hollywood. Although they were not a romantic couple, they shared a unique comic genius and sophisticated wit that enabled them to forge a six-decade-long partnership. They received numerous accolades including four Tony Awards and nominations for two Academy Awards and a Grammy Award. Green was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981. Comden and Green received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1991.

They started their career alongside Leonard Bernstein on stage where they received the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle for Best Musical for &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953). On Broadway they wrote the music and lyrics to musicals such as &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944), &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot; (1951), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1954), &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1956), and &quot;Applause&quot; (1970). They won four Tony Awards as composer and lyricist for &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; (1967), &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot; (1991). As performers they starred in &quot;A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green&quot; (1958).

They gained notoriety in film collaborating with Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli as part of Arthur Freed&#x27;s production unit at Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Perhaps their greatest collaboration was for the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), although they received two Academy Award nominations for screenplays for the musicals &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955). They also wrote the scripts for the classic movie musicals &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; (1958), and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1960).

== Early life and education ==
Green was born in the Bronx to Hungarian Jewish immigrants Helen (née Weiss) and Daniel Green. He was the youngest of three sons and had two older brothers, Louis (circa 1907-?) and William (circa 1910-?). After high school, he worked as a runner on Wall Street while he tried to make it as an actor.

== Career ==
=== 1938–1947 ===

He met Comden through mutual friends in 1938 while she was studying drama at New York University. They formed a troupe called the Revuers, which performed at the Village Vanguard, a club in Greenwich Village. Among the members of the company was a young comedian named Judy Tuvim, who later changed her name to Judy Holliday, and Green&#x27;s good friend, a young musician named Leonard Bernstein, whom he had met in 1937 at Camp Onota (a summer camp in Pittsfield MA where Bernstein was the music counselor), frequently accompanied them on the piano. 
Together, Comden and Green&#x27;s act earned success and a movie offer. The Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding fame in &quot;Greenwich Village&quot;, a 1944 movie starring Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche, but their roles were so small they barely were noticed, and they quickly returned to New York. Their first Broadway effort teamed them with Bernstein for &quot;On the Town&quot;, a musical romp about three sailors on leave in New York City that was an expansion of a ballet entitled &quot;Fancy Free&quot; on which Bernstein had been working with choreographer Jerome Robbins. Comden and Green wrote the lyrics and book, which included sizeable parts for themselves. Their next two musicals, &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; (1945) and &quot;Bonanza Bound&quot; (1947) were not successful, and once again they headed to California, where they immediately found work at MGM.

=== 1948–1969 ===

They wrote the screenplay for &quot;Good News&quot; (1947), starring June Allyson and Peter Lawford, &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; for Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and then adapted &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949) for Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, scrapping much of Bernstein&#x27;s music at the request of Arthur Freed, who did not care for the Bernstein score. They reunited with Kelly for their most successful project, the classic &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), about Hollywood in the final days of the silent film era. The film was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and starred Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O&#x27;Connor. Together Comden and Green received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Musical. Considered by many film historians to be the best movie musical of all time, it ranked No. 10 on the list of the 100 best American movies of the 20th century compiled by the American Film Institute in 1998. 
They followed this with another hit, and another musical &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), in which the characters of Lester and Lily, a husband-and-wife team that writes the play for the show-within-a-show, were patterned after themselves. The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli and starred Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant. They reunited with Donen and Kelly with another musical &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955). They were Oscar-nominated twice, for their screenplays for &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;, both of which earned them a Screen Writers Guild Award, as did &quot;On the Town&quot;. Their stage work during the next few years included the revue &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot; (1951), starring Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray, &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), an adaptation of the comedy hit &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, with Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the Big Apple, and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1956), which reunited them with Judy Holliday as an operator at a telephone answering service. The score, including the standards &quot;Just in Time&quot;, &quot;Long Before I Knew You,&quot; and &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; proved to be one of their richest.

Comden and Green returned to films with Morton DaCosta&#x27;s &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; (1958) starring Rosalind Russell and Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1961) starring Judy Holliday and Dean Martin. In 1958, they appeared on Broadway in &quot;A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green&quot;, a revue that included some of their early sketches. It was a critical and commercial success, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977. In 1964 they wrote the screenplay for the black comedy &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; starring Shirley MacLaine, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Dean Martin, Gene Kelly, and Dick Van Dyke. The film was a commercial success but received mixed reviews.

=== 1970–2002 ===
Among their other credits are the Mary Martin version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; for both Broadway and television, a streamlined &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera, and stage musicals for Carol Burnett, Leslie Uggams, and Lauren Bacall, among others. Their many collaborators included Garson Kanin, Cy Coleman, Jule Styne, and André Previn. The team was not without its failures. In 1982, &quot;A Doll&#x27;s Life&quot;, an exploration of what Nora did after she abandoned her husband in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, ran for only five performances, although they received Tony Award nominations for its book and score. In 1980, Green was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. And, in 1981, he was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. The following year Green appeared in the comedy &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982) starring Peter O&#x27;Toole. The next year they wrote the book for the musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; for the West End in London in 1983 and then for Broadway in 1985. The production earned two Tony Award nominations including for Best Book of a Musical for Comden and Green.

In 1989, he appeared as Dr. Pangloss in Bernstein&#x27;s Candide. Comden and Green received Kennedy Center Honors in 1991. Also in 1991 they returned to Broadway in with the musical &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot;. The musical focuses on the life and career of famed humorist and performer Will Rogers, using as a backdrop the Ziegfeld Follies. The production earned six Tony Awards including the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Tony Award for Best Original Score for Comden and Green.

==Personal life==
Green was married to actress Allyn Ann McLerie from 1945 to 1953.

Green&#x27;s third wife was actress Phyllis Newman, who had understudied Holliday in &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;. They married in 1960, and remained so until Green&#x27;s death in 2002. The couple had two children, Adam and Amanda, both of whom are songwriters.

His Broadway memorial, with Lauren Bacall, Kevin Kline, Joel Grey, Kristin Chenoweth, Arthur Laurents, Peter Stone, and Betty Comden in attendance was held at the Shubert Theater on December 4, 2002.

<doc id="133815" wikidata="Q1181442" url="?curid=133815" title="Rockwood, Pennsylvania">
<text>Rockwood is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 850 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area, and located due north of Pennsylvania&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Davis, which significantly constricts land travel routing south of the municipality.

==History==
Rockwood was initially known as Shaff&#x27;s Bridge and then Mineral Point. Philip Wolfersberger built a house in what is now Rockwood in 1856, and he laid out the town in 1857 with Martin Meyers serving as the primary surveyor. John Poister built a hotel in 1860. 1868 saw the development of a post office, Henry Werner built a tannery in 1869, and a railroad depot was built in 1871. J.D. Miller and E.D. Miller opened a mercantile, Miller &amp; Bro., and in 1874 they expanded the business to take in Samuel A. Haines as a partner, forming Miller Bros. &amp; Haines.

Philip Stauffer Wolfersberger, a son of the above Philip Wolfersberger, was a ticket agent of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) and was instrumental in getting the current name of Rockwood to take hold. A view of Mineral Point / Rockwood appeared in a collection of photographs from along the B&amp;O&#x27;s lines that was published in book form in 1872 and digitized by the DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University.

A collision between two trains on the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad, occurring about three miles east of Rockwood, claimed six lives in November 1894. Eleven individuals were injured when two trains collided on the P&amp;C line just outside of Rockwood on Dec. 29, 1898. Another collision between two trains near Rockwood injured 24 people on February 16, 1912.

The B&amp;O Railroad was a major east-west transportation artery in the region, with many people using it to pass over the Appalachian Mountains. One exciting event occurred in 1907, when President Theodore Roosevelt made a brief stop in Rockwood during his trip to Ohio to attend the funeral of Ida McKinley, the wife of former U.S. President William McKinley. As the Rockwood community grew and prospered, the bustling town became the home of numerous Christian congregations. As of 1914, at least five denominations had churches in Rockwood and the immediate vicinity: Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed, United Brethren, and United Evangelical.

The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad passes through Rockwood as it bends northerly in a long bow about the roots of Mount Davis, and it is now owned and operated by CSX, with daily Amtrak express trains between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, MD passing through the town and the nearby Cumberland Narrows. It is situated near and below the West slope-side summit-point of both the Nemacolin Trail and Braddock&#x27;s Road, as well as the railway as each ascended past the crest up through the Cumberland Narrows pass from the forks of the Potomac at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. The town was thus an important stop over point in the post-American Revolution westward migration into the Ohio Country and via the river boats built in Brownsville. The Penrose Wolf Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

===Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad / Somerset &amp; Cambria Branch / Rockwood &amp; Johnstown Line===

The Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad connected the town of Somerset with the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad (owned by the B&amp;O) as it passed through Mineral Point / Rockwood. (The Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad is labelled as the Rockwood &amp; Johnstown Line on the accompanying section of Benedict &amp; Strum&#x27;s 1915 Somerset County public road map). Both the Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad and the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad were completed in 1871; the final section of the line between Pittsburgh &amp; Cumberland was completed on the afternoon of April 10, 1871, with the final rail being laid near Forge Bridge, about 3 miles to the west of Mineral Point. There were eight stations located along the Somerset &amp; Mineral Point line as it ran northeast along Coxes Creek: Mineral Point, Sames, Baker&#x27;s, Milford, Mud Pike Crossing, Roberts, Cantner, and Somerset. Two individuals who were involved in the founding of Ursina, which had its own small branch railroad further south in Somerset County, were officers of the Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad in 1873: William J. Baer was President and H.L. Baer was Secretary. The B&amp;O bought the 10-mile Somerset &amp; Mineral Point Railroad in 1879 for $60,000, knowing that an extension of the line to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in Cambria County, was quite possible; this extension had already received legislative approval with session law no. 321 on Aug. 12, 1873. The Johnstown &amp; Somerset Railroad followed the Stonycreek valley north-by-northeast from Somerset through Stoystown to Johnstown; it was built in 1881. The result was a rail line known as the Somerset &amp; Cambria Branch Railroad stretching between the Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville Railroad at Rockwood and the Pennsylvania Railroad at Johnstown. The Somerset &amp; Cambria Branch later became known as the S&amp;C Subdivision.

===Company Branch Railroad Lines===
In 1891 the Somerset Stone Company built a branch line from the Somerset &amp; Cambria railroad&#x27;s station at Milford east to its operation at Bare Rocks, and the Bare Rock Rail Road Company was incorporated by John Murdock, J.M. Murdock, W.F. Murdock, J.C. Duncan, Samuel Fox, Josiah Woy, E.B. McColly, and S.F. Gill in 1892. This connecting Milford Station was also known as Woy Station, where Harry Neff was the telegraph operator and Jacob Neff was the engineer of the Bare Rock line in 1893. A tragic accident occurred along this company line on the evening of April 25, 1893, killing several people. In 1900 the Wilson Creek Coal Company constructed another branch railroad off of the Somerset &amp; Cambria; this company line ran from about one mile north of Rockwood to its mining property about three miles to the east, following the course of Wilson Creek.

==Geography==
Rockwood is located at (39.916222, -79.155808). It is situated near and below the west-side crest of the Eastern Continental Divide separating the Potomac-Mississippi riverine systems along the north bank of the Casselman River—whose head waters are to the south in nearby Western Maryland—and just west of its confluence with Coxes Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

The borough of Rockwood is served by the Rockwood Area School District, which includes Rockwood Area Elementary School and Rockwood Area Junior/Senior High School. Both schools are located along the borough&#x27;s boundary with Milford Township. A second elementary school within the district was the Kingwood Elementary School, which was not within the borough of Rockwood. Kingwood Elementary School is now closed, and the building was sold to the Kingwood Church of God.

Typically, Rockwood Area High School graduates 65-80 students per year.

== Transportation ==
Pennsylvania Route 653 runs through Rockwood. It comes southeast from New Centerville through part of Milford Township, entering Rockwood as Bridge Street. PA 653 then turns east onto Main Street, which it follows through the borough and out of town, entering Milford Township again briefly before crossing Coxes Creek and entering Black Township. The nearest limited-access highway is the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Somerset (Exit 110), to the north.

Up until April 30, 1971, Rockwood was a stop on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio&#x27;s daily Washington—Akron passenger train. Since 1981 Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; (Chicago—Washington) has passed through Rockwood without stopping. Since 1990 local officials have lobbied for Rockwood to be added as a stop, and in October 2009 Amtrak released a feasibility study which placed the cost of a new station at $2.2 million. Proponents of the stop suggest that it might even benefit local resorts Seven Springs and Hidden Valley by increasing tourism business throughout the area.

==History==
Christian Shank, a German immigrant, built a cabin on Stony Creek in 1798, later building a grist mill and two saw mills in the vicinity. Emmanuel Shaffer opened a store at the site in 1828, and the following year Shank laid out the town of Shanksville. The town was the home of John Suhre, a Union army private who was fatally wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg and whose last days are described in Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s short novel &quot;Hospital Sketches&quot;. The Shanksville post office was opened in 1874. Shanksville was incorporated as a borough on January 25, 1913.

===September 11 attacks===
On September 11, 2001, during the terrorist attacks on the United States, Shanksville received worldwide attention after United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, north of the town of Shanksville, killing all 40 civilians and four al-Qaeda hijackers on board. The hijackers had intended to fly the plane to Washington, D.C. and crash it into either the Capitol or the White House. However, after learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, the passengers on board revolted against the hijackers and fought for control of the plane, causing it to crash. It was the only one of the four aircraft hijacked that day that never reached its intended target.

There are two memorials to the event. The original, temporary Flight 93 National Memorial to the passengers and crew of Flight 93 was located on a hill, about from the crash site. On July 8, 2010, a new temporary entrance and memorial were opened at an area called &quot;the Western Overlook&quot;. It is where the FBI set up their command center and where family members first saw the aftermath of the crash, bringing their own memorials, and where visitors can leave them today. The initial phase of permanent construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial, including the visitors&#x27; center, was completed by the 10th anniversary in 2011. The memorial is built around the crash site, following the plane&#x27;s flight path, and protecting the area of impact, known as the &quot;Sacred Ground&quot;, which remains protected and accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew.

Shanksville&#x27;s volunteer firefighters and emergency personnel from the nearby towns of Central City, Somerset, and others rushed to the crash scene to search for survivors. Members of the New York City Fire Department donated to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department a cross-shaped piece of steel salvaged from the World Trade Center. Mounted atop a Pentagon-shaped base, it was installed outside the firehouse and dedicated on August 24, 2008.

==Government==

The mayor of Shanksville is Chris Baeckel.

==Education==
The Shanksville-Stonycreek School District  is the area school district and operates public schools.

==History==

Somerset was a central stage for the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. Several rebellion leaders, including Harmon Husband, lived in Somerset. The federal militia sent to put down the rebellion worked from its headquarters in the nearby town of Berlin. 

A major fire on the afternoon of May 9, 1872, destroyed a significant portion of the town within just a few hours.

In July 2002, nine miners were trapped for 77 hours, underground, by flooding in the Quecreek coal mine, just outside Somerset. All nine miners were rescued. The Quecreek Mine Rescue was chronicled by journalists from around the world and was televised globally.

<text>Stonycreek Township is a township in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township takes its name from the stony creek, which flows through it and represents its western boundary. The stream takes its name from the rocky bed over which it flows for a great part of its course. Its Indian name was Sinne-Hanne or Achsin-Hanne. Hanne means a stream and especially a swift mountain stream. The population was 2,087 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, metropolitan statistical area.

Stonycreek Township garnered global attention during the September 11 attacks when United Airlines Flight 93, intended to strike the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., crashed into a field near downtown after civilian passengers on the flight from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport rebelled against the flight&#x27;s al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers.

==History==
What is now Stonycreek Township was settled in 1762. Most old records call it Stony Creek. The Township was incorporated in 1792 from portions of Quemahoning Township as the last of the six original townships of Somerset County.

Glessner Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

===September 11 attacks===
Stonycreek Township gained global attention on September 11, 2001, when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed there. Flight 93 was one of four airliners hijacked that day as part of the Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the United States. It is widely held that the Flight 93 hijackers intended to use the craft to target the United States Capitol. The crash resulted after the passengers of the plane attacked the hijackers in an effort to gain control of the aircraft, resulting in the terrorists deliberately crashing it to prevent them from gaining the upper hand. They learned of the plane&#x27;s intended fate through cell phone calls to and from family members. All 44 people aboard the plane, including four hijackers, were killed. The site is now the location of a national memorial honoring the passengers.

===Flight 93 National Memorial===
The original temporary memorial to the passengers and crew of Flight 93 was located on a hill, about 500 yards from the crash site. On July 8, 2010, a new temporary entrance and memorial were opened at an area called &quot;The Western Overlook&quot;. It is where the FBI set up their command center and where family members first saw the aftermath of the crash, bringing their own memorials, where visitors can leave them today. The initial phase of permanent construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial, including the visitor center, was to be completed by the 10th anniversary in 2011. The first phase of the permanent memorial was completed, opened, and dedicated on September 10, 2011. The current design for the memorial is a modified version of the entry &quot;Crescent of Embrace&quot; by Paul and Milena Murdoch. The memorial was built around the crash site, following the plane&#x27;s flight path, and protects the area of impact, known as the &quot;Sacred Ground&quot;, which will remain protected and accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew.

<text>Stoystown is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 300 at the 2020 census. Stoystown is located south-southeast of Johnstown and northeast of Somerset.

==History==

The site of the Stony Creek Encampment is near the eastern end of Stoystown, slightly north of U.S. Route 30. This small supply depot was located along Forbes Road during the French &amp; Indian War.

Daniel Stoy was one of the first settlers west of the mountains. From the records of Harmon Husband, we find that Stoy lived along the Forbes Road about 1762 near the Casper Stotler place in Shade Township, that he made his living by hunting, and that he was driven from his cabin home several times by the Indians, taking refuge at Fort Bedford. The records of Husband state that on one occasion Stoy shot an Indian intruder from his cabin door. With the construction of the Pennsylvania Road, Stoy decided to move to a place about ten miles farther west along the road where he received a warrant for more than three hundred acres of land. Here on this tract of land along the Pennsylvania Road, he founded the town of Stoystown in 1774. Stoy served as a volunteer in the Revolutionary War with the rank of corporal. It is thought that he also served in the French and Indian War, although the records are rather vague. Henry was born in 1747. Married Sally Stoy, daughter of Daniel M. Stoy, who sold lots and laid out the town of Stoystown about 1800, one of the oldest towns in Somerset Co., Pennsylvania. Daniel M. Stoy served as captain in Gen. George Washington&#x27;s army for 12 months. He was discharged at Long Island, New York, July 1778. Later he moved to what is now Somerset Co., Pennsylvania. He was a justice of the peace. He served in the General Assembly in 1809–10 and 1813. He died 1834. D.A.R. marker on grave. Daniel Stoy, born in England, May 3, 1738, died January 11, 1835, in Stoystown, Somerset Co., Pennsylvania. He was married about 1759 to Sarah Higgins of Scotland (April 4, 1737 – October 31, 1818. Soon after their marriage they came to America and located at Conchohockin, Pennsylvania, where their six children were born, viz., (1) Sarah (Sally), the oldest daughter, married Henry Beaver; (2)Daniel married a Miss Shedrick; (3)Ned never married; (4) John married Elizabeth Pisel; (5) William; (6) Margaret, the youngest child (Conchohockin, October 15, 1780 – December 6, 1868). She was 7 years old when her parents moved to what was then Bedford Co., now Somerset Co., Pennsylvania. She married Abraham Spangler and they had 14 children. Henry Beaver moved his family from Stoystown, Pennsylvania, to Greensburg, Westmoreland Co., Pennsylvania. They had one son that we know of, John F. Beaver, who read law at Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The Stoystown Historic District and Hite House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Oyster is the common name for a number of different families of salt-water bivalve molluscs that live in marine or brackish habitats. In some species, the valves are highly calcified, and many are somewhat irregular in shape. Many, but not all oysters, are in the superfamily Ostreoidea.

Some species of oyster are commonly consumed and are regarded as a delicacy in some localities. Some types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle. Others, such as the translucent Windowpane oysters, are harvested for their shells.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;oyster&quot; comes from Old French , and first appeared in English during the 14th century. The French derived from the Latin , the feminine form of , which is the latinisation of the Ancient Greek () &#x27;oyster&#x27;. Compare () &#x27;bone&#x27;.

==Types==

===True oysters===

True oysters are members of the family Ostreidae. This family includes the edible oysters, which mainly belong to the genera &quot;Ostrea&quot;, &quot;Crassostrea&quot;, &quot;Magallana&quot;, and &quot;Saccostrea&quot;. Examples include the European flat oyster, eastern oyster, Olympia oyster, Pacific oyster, and the Sydney rock oyster. Ostreidae evolved in the Early Triassic epoch: The genus &quot;Liostrea&quot; grew on the shells of living ammonoids.

===Pearl oysters===

Almost all shell-bearing mollusks can secrete pearls, yet most are not very valuable. Pearls can form in both saltwater and freshwater environments.

Pearl oysters are not closely related to true oysters, being members of a distinct family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured pearls and natural pearls can be extracted from pearl oysters, though other molluscs, such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value.

The largest pearl-bearing oyster is the marine &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot;, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. Not all individual oysters produce pearls.

In nature, pearl oysters produce pearls by covering a minute invasive object with nacre. Over the years, the irritating object is covered with enough layers of nacre to become a pearl. The many different types, colours and shapes of pearls depend on the natural pigment of the nacre, and the shape of the original irritant.

Pearl farmers can culture a pearl by placing a nucleus, usually a piece of polished mussel shell, inside the oyster. In three to seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. Since the beginning of the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the cultured pearl market has far outgrown the natural pearl market.

===Other types===

A number of bivalve molluscs (other than true oysters and pearl oysters) also have common names that include the word &quot;oyster&quot;, usually because they either taste like or look somewhat like true oysters, or because they yield noticeable pearls. Examples include:
* Thorny oysters in the genus &quot;Spondylus&quot;
* Pilgrim oyster, another term for a scallop, in reference to the scallop shell of St. James
* Saddle oysters, members of the Anomiidae family also known as jingle shells
* Dimydarian oysters, members of the family Dimyidae
* Windowpane oysters

In the Philippines, a local thorny oyster species known as Tikod amo is a favorite seafood source in the southern part of the country. Because of its good flavor, it commands high prices.

== Anatomy ==
Oysters breathe primarily via gills. In addition to their gills, oysters can exchange gases across their mantles, which are lined with many small, thin-walled blood vessels. A small, three-chambered heart, lying under the adductor muscle, pumps colorless blood to all parts of the body. At the same time, two kidneys, located on the underside of the muscle, remove waste products from the blood. Their nervous system includes two pairs of nerve cords and three pairs of ganglia. There is no evidence that oysters have a brain.

While some oysters have two sexes (European oyster and Olympia oyster), their reproductive organs contain both eggs and sperm. Because of this, it is technically possible for an oyster to fertilize its own eggs. The gonads surround the digestive organs, and are made up of sex cells, branching tubules, and connective tissue.

Once her millions of eggs are fertilized, the female discharges them into the water. The larvae develop in about six hours and exist suspended in the water column as veliger larvae for two to three weeks before settling on a bed and reaching sexual maturity within a year.

== Feeding ==
Oysters are filter feeders, drawing water in over their gills through the beating of cilia. Suspended plankton and non-food particles are trapped in the mucus of a gill, and from there are transported to the mouth, where they are eaten, digested, and expelled as feces or pseudofeces that fall to the bottom and remain out of the water column. Oysters feed most actively at temperatures ranging from the high 60s to the high 70s (). Under ideal laboratory conditions, an oyster can filter up to of water per day. Under average conditions, mature oysters filter . Chesapeake Bay&#x27;s once-flourishing oyster population historically filtered excess nutrients from the estuary&#x27;s entire water volume every three to four days. As of 2008 it was estimated that a complete cycle would take nearly a year.

== Habitat and behaviour ==

A group of oysters is commonly called a bed or oyster reef.

As a keystone species, oysters provide habitat for many marine species.
&quot;Crassostrea&quot; and &quot;Saccostrea&quot; live mainly in the intertidal zone, while &quot;Ostrea&quot; is subtidal. The hard surfaces of oyster shells and the nooks between the shells provide places where a host of small animals can live. Hundreds of animals, such as sea anemones, barnacles, and hooked mussels, inhabit oyster reefs. Many of these animals are prey to larger animals, including fish, such as striped bass, black drum and croakers.

An oyster reef can increase the surface area of a flat bottom 50-fold. An oyster&#x27;s mature shape often depends on the type of bottom to which it is originally attached, but it always orients itself with its outer, flared shell tilted upward. One valve is cupped and the other is flat.

Oysters usually reach maturity in one year. They are protandric; during their first year, they spawn as males by releasing sperm into the water. As they grow over the next two or three years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing eggs. Bay oysters usually spawn from the end of June until mid-August. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop into larvae, which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster&#x27;s shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called spat. Spat are oysters less than long. Many species of bivalves, oysters included, seem to be stimulated to settle near adult conspecifics.
Oysters filter large amounts of water to feed and breathe (exchange and with water) but they are not permanently open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submersed. Their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative moon and sun positions. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during the spring tide.

Some tropical oysters, such as the mangrove oyster in the family Ostreidae, grow best on mangrove roots. Low tide can expose them, making them easy to collect.

The largest oyster-producing body of water in the United States is the Chesapeake Bay, although these beds have decreased in number due to overfishing and pollution. Other large oyster farming areas in the US include the bays and estuaries along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Apalachicola, Florida, in the east to Galveston, Texas, in the west. Large beds of edible oysters are also found in Japan and Australia. In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global oyster harvest. In Europe, France remained the industry leader.

Common oyster predators include crabs, seabirds, starfish, and humans. Some oysters contain crabs, known as oyster crabs.

==Nutrient cycling==
Bivalves, including oysters, are effective filter feeders and can have large effects on the water columns in which they occur. As filter feeders, oysters remove plankton and organic particles from the water column. Multiple studies have shown individual oysters are capable of filtering up to of water per day, and thus oyster reefs can significantly improve water quality and clarity. Oysters consume nitrogen-containing compounds (nitrates and ammonia), phosphates, plankton, detritus, bacteria, and dissolved organic matter, removing them from the water. What is not used for animal growth is then expelled as solid waste pellets, which eventually decompose into the atmosphere as nitrogen. In Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay Program had implemented a plan to use oysters to reduce the amount of nitrogen compounds entering the Chesapeake Bay by per year by 2010. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically alter nitrogen levels in estuaries. In the U.S., Delaware is the only East Coast state without aquaculture, but making aquaculture a state-controlled industry of leasing water by the acre for commercial harvesting of shellfish is being considered. Supporters of Delaware&#x27;s legislation to allow oyster aquaculture cite revenue, job creation, and nutrient cycling benefits. It is estimated that can produce nearly 750,000 oysters, which could filter between of water daily. Also see nutrient pollution for an extended explanation of nutrient remediation.

== Ecosystem services ==
As an ecosystem engineer, oysters provide supporting ecosystem services, along with provisioning, regulating and cultural services. Oysters influence nutrient cycling, water filtration, habitat structure, biodiversity, and food web dynamics. Oyster reef habitats have been recognized as green infrastructure for shoreline protection. Assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus into shellfish tissues provides an opportunity to remove these nutrients from the water column. In California&#x27;s Tomales Bay, native oyster presence is associated with higher species diversity of benthic invertebrates. As the ecological and economic importance of oyster reefs has become more acknowledged, restoration efforts have increased.

==Human history==

Middens testify to the prehistoric importance of oysters as food, with some middens in New South Wales, Australia, dated at ten thousand years. They have been cultivated in Japan from at least 2000 BC. In the United Kingdom, the town of Whitstable is noted for oyster farming from beds on the Kentish Flats that have been used since Roman times. The borough of Colchester holds an annual Oyster Feast each October, at which &quot;Colchester Natives&quot; (the native oyster, &quot;Ostrea edulis&quot;) are consumed. The United Kingdom hosts several other annual oyster festivals; for example, Woburn Oyster Festival is held in September. In fact, in Victorian England, it was quite common for people to go to the pub and enjoy their favorite beer with some oysters. They quickly realized that the &quot;rich, sweet, malty stouts&quot; were great with the &quot;briny, creamy oyster&quot;. Then brewers found that oyster shells naturally clarify a beer and they started putting crushed oyster shells into their brews. The first known brewery to start this was in 1938 at the Hammerton Brewery in London. That is where the oyster stout was first started.

The French seaside resort of Cancale in Brittany is noted for its oysters, which also date from Roman times. Sergius Orata of the Roman Republic is considered the first major merchant and cultivator of oysters. Using his considerable knowledge of hydraulics, he built a sophisticated cultivation system, including channels and locks, to control the tides. He was so famous for this, the Romans used to say he could breed oysters on the roof of his house.

In the early 19th century, oysters were cheap and mainly eaten by the working class. Throughout the 19th century, oyster beds in New York Harbor became the largest source of oysters worldwide. On any day in the late 19th century, six million oysters could be found on barges tied up along the city&#x27;s waterfront. They were naturally quite popular in New York City, and helped initiate the city&#x27;s restaurant trade. New York&#x27;s oystermen became skilled cultivators of their beds, which provided employment for hundreds of workers and nutritious food for thousands. Eventually, rising demand exhausted many of the beds. To increase production, they introduced foreign species, which brought disease; effluent and increasing sedimentation from erosion destroyed most of the beds by the early 20th century. Oysters&#x27; popularity has put ever-increasing demands on wild oyster stocks. This scarcity increased prices, converting them from their original role as working-class food to their current status as an expensive delicacy.

In Britain, the native species (&quot;European flat oyster&quot;) has five years to mature and is protected by the people during their May-to-August spawning season. The current market is dominated by the larger Pacific oyster and Rock oyster species which are farmed year-round.

===Fishing from the wild===

Oysters are harvested by simply gathering them from their beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops them up with the rake or tongs.

In some areas, a scallop dredge is used. This is a toothed bar attached to a chain bag. The dredge is towed through an oyster bed by a boat, picking up the oysters in its path. While dredges collect oysters more quickly, they heavily damage the beds, and their use is highly restricted. Until 1965, Maryland limited dredging to sailboats, and even since then motor boats can be used only on certain days of the week. These regulations prompted the development of specialized sailboats (the bugeye and later the skipjack) for dredging.

Similar laws were enacted in Connecticut before World War I and lasted until 1969. The laws restricted the harvesting of oysters in state-owned beds to vessels under sail. These laws prompted the construction of the oyster sloop-style vessel to last well into the 20th century. &quot;Hope&quot; is believed to be the last-built Connecticut oyster sloop, completed in 1948.

Oysters can also be collected by divers.

In any case, when the oysters are collected, they are sorted to eliminate dead animals, bycatch (unwanted catch), and debris. Then they are taken to market, where they are either canned or sold live.

===Cultivation===

Oysters have been cultured since at least the days of the Roman Empire. The Pacific oyster (&quot;Magallana gigas&quot;) is presently the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form &quot;seed oysters&quot;. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the cultivator putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or rack to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.

The Pacific oyster has been grown in the outflow of mariculture ponds. When fish or prawns are grown in ponds, it takes typically of feed to produce of product (dry-dry basis). The other goes into the pond and after mineralization, provides food for phytoplankton, which in turn feeds the oyster.

To prevent spawning, sterile oysters are now cultured by crossbreeding tetraploid and diploid oysters. The resulting triploid oyster cannot propagate, which prevents introduced oysters from spreading into unwanted habitats.
===Restoration and recovery===

In many areas, non-native oysters have been introduced in attempts to prop up failing harvests of native varieties. For example, the eastern oyster (&quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;) was introduced to California waters in 1875, while the Pacific oyster was introduced there in 1929. Proposals for further such introductions remain controversial.

The Pacific oyster prospered in Pendrell Sound, where the surface water is typically warm enough for spawning in the summer. Over the following years, spat spread out sporadically and populated adjacent areas. Eventually, possibly following adaptation to the local conditions, the Pacific oyster spread up and down the coast and now is the basis of the North American west coast oyster industry. Pendrell Sound is now a reserve that supplies spat for cultivation.
Near the mouth of the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, five-year-old artificial reefs now harbor more than 180 million native &quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;. That is far lower than in the late 1880s, when the bay&#x27;s population was in the billions, and watermen harvested about annually. The 2009 harvest was less than . Researchers claim the keys to the project were:
* using waste oyster shells to elevate the reef floor to keep the spat free of bottom sediments
* building larger reefs, ranging up to in size
* disease-resistant broodstock

The &quot;oyster-tecture&quot; movement promotes the use of oyster reefs for water purification and wave attenuation. An oyster-tecture project has been implemented at Withers Estuary, Withers Swash, South Carolina, by Neil Chambers-led volunteers, at a site where pollution was affecting beach tourism. Currently, for the installation cost of $3000, roughly 4.8 million liters of water are being filtered daily. In New Jersey, however, the Department of Environmental Protection refused to allow oysters as a filtering system in Sandy Hook Bay and the Raritan Bay, citing worries that commercial shellfish growers would be at risk and that members of the public might disregard warnings and consume tainted oysters. New Jersey Baykeepers responded by changing their strategy for utilizing oysters to clean up the waterway, by collaborating with Naval Weapons Station Earle. The Navy station is under 24/7 security and therefore eliminates any poaching and associated human health risk. Oyster-tecture projects have been proposed to protect coastal cities, such as New York, from the threat of rising sea levels due to climate change. Additionally Oyster reef restoration has shown to increase the population of oyster beds within the oceans while also conserving the biolife within the oyster reefs.

===Human impact===

The accidental or intentional introduction of species by humans has the potential to negatively impact native oyster populations. For example, non-native species in Tomales Bay have resulted in the loss of half of California&#x27;s Olympia oysters. Oyster reefs occupy a small fraction of their distribution prior to mass harvesting during the last three centuries.

In October 2017, it was reported that underwater noise pollution can affect oysters as they close their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions. Oysters rely on hearing waves and currents to regulate their circadian rhythms, and perception of weather events—such as rain—may induce spawning. Cargo ships, pile drivers, and explosions conducted underwater produce low frequencies that may be detected by oysters.

Environmental stressors as a result of global change are also negatively impacting oysters around the world, with many impacts affecting molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes in species including &quot;Magallana gigas.&quot;

===Shell recycling===
Recycled oyster shells can help restore oyster reefs to provide marine life habitat that reduces flooding, and protects shorelines from storms. Shell-recycling non-profits retrieve shells from restaurants, wash and dry them, and set them in the sun for up to a year to kill bacteria. Some states encourage shell recycling by offering tax incentives.

==As food==

Jonathan Swift is quoted as having said, &quot;He was a bold man that first ate an oyster&quot;. Evidence of oyster consumption goes back into prehistory, evidenced by oyster middens found worldwide. Oysters were an important food source in all coastal areas where they could be found, and oyster fisheries were an important industry where they were plentiful. Overfishing and pressure from diseases and pollution have sharply reduced supplies, but they remain a popular treat celebrated in oyster festivals in many cities and towns.

It was once assumed that oysters were only safe to eat in months with the letter &#x27;r&#x27; in their English and French names. This myth is based in truth, in that in the Northern Hemisphere, oysters are much more likely to spoil in the warmer months of May, June, July, and August. In recent years, pathogens such as &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot; have caused outbreaks in several harvesting areas of the eastern United States during the summer months, lending further credence to this belief.

===Dishes===
Oysters can be eaten on the half shell, raw, smoked, boiled, baked, fried, roasted, stewed, canned, pickled, steamed, or broiled, or used in a variety of drinks. Eating can be as simple as opening the shell and eating the contents, including juice. Butter and salt are often added. Poached oysters can be served on toast with a cream roux. In the case of Oysters Rockefeller, preparation can be very elaborate. They are sometimes served on edible seaweed, such as brown algae.

Care should be taken when consuming oysters. They may be eaten raw, with no dressing or with lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Raw oysters have complex flavors that vary among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic or fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy. North American varieties include Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, Rappahannock River and James River from Virginia, Chesapeake from Maryland and Cape May from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral and nutritional content influence their flavor.

===Nutrition===
Oysters are an excellent source of zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium, as well as vitamin A and vitamin B12. Oysters are low in food energy; one dozen raw oysters provides only . They are rich in protein (approximately 9 g in 100 g of Pacific oysters). Two oysters () provide the Reference Daily Intake of zinc and vitamin B12.

Traditionally, oysters are considered to be an aphrodisiac, partially because they resemble female sex organs. A team of American and Italian researchers analyzed bivalves and found they were rich in amino acids that trigger increased levels of sex hormones. Their high zinc content aids the production of testosterone.

===Shucking oysters===

Opening oysters, referred to as &quot;oyster-shucking&quot;, requires skill. The preferred method is to use a special knife (called an oyster knife, a variant of a shucking knife), with a short and thick blade about long.

While different methods are used to open an oyster (which sometimes depend on the type), the following is one commonly accepted oyster-shucking method.
* Insert the blade, with moderate force and vibration if necessary, at the hinge between the two valves.
* Twist the blade until there is a slight pop.
* Slide the blade upward to cut the adductor muscle which holds the shell closed.

Inexperienced shuckers can apply too much force, which can result in injury if the blade slips. Heavy gloves, sometimes sold as oyster gloves, are recommended; apart from the knife, the shell itself can be razor-sharp. Professional shuckers require fewer than three seconds to open the shell.

If the oyster has a particularly soft shell, the knife can be inserted instead in the &quot;sidedoor&quot;, about halfway along one side where the oyster lips widen with a slight indentation.

Oyster-shucking has become a competitive sport; competitions are staged around the world. The Guinness World Oyster Opening Championship was held annually in September at the Galway International Oyster Festival, in Galway, Ireland until 2010. Since 2011, &quot;Guinness&quot; has been dropped from the title.

===Food safety and storage===
Unlike most shellfish, oysters can have a fairly long shelf life of up to four weeks. However, their taste becomes less pleasant as they age. Fresh oysters must be alive just before consumption or cooking.

Cooked oysters that do not open are generally assumed to be previously dead and therefore unsafe. There is only one criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should be tapped on the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which are open and unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand, may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as &quot;clackers&quot;.

Oysters can contain harmful bacteria. Oysters are filter feeders, so will naturally concentrate anything present in the surrounding water. Oysters from the Gulf Coast of the United States, for example, contain high bacterial loads of human pathogens in the warm months, most notably &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; and &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot;. In these cases, the main danger is for immunocompromised individuals, who are unable to fight off infection and can succumb to sepsis, leading to death. &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is the most deadly seafood-borne pathogen.

====Depuration====

Depuration of oysters is a common industry practice and widely researched in the scientific community but is not commonly known by end consumers. The main objective of seafood depuration is to remove fecal contamination in seafood before being sold to end consumers. Oyster depuration is useful since they are generally eaten raw and in many countries, the requirement to process is government-regulated or mandatory. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) formally recognizes depuration and has published detailed documents on the process, whereas the Codex Alimentarius, encourages the application of seafood depuration.

Oyster depuration begins after the harvest of oysters from farmed locations. The oysters are transported and placed into tanks pumped with clean water for periods of 48 to 72 hours. The holding temperatures and salinity vary according to species. The seawater that the oysters were originally farmed in does not remain in the oyster, since the water used for depuration must be fully sterilized, and the depuration facility would not necessarily be located near the farming location. Depuration of oysters can remove moderate levels of contamination of most bacterial indicators and pathogens. Well-known contaminants include &quot;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&quot;, a temperature-sensitive bacterium found in seawater animals, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, a bacterium found in coastal waters near highly populated cities having sewage systems discharging waste nearby, or in the presence of agricultural discharges. Depuration expands beyond oysters into many shellfish and other related products, especially in seafood that is known to come from potentially polluted areas; depurated seafood is effectively a product cleansed from inside-out to make it safe for human consumption.

===Cultural aspects===
====Religious====

As shellfish, consumption of oyster is forbidden by Jewish dietary law. Similarly, in Islam, Jaʽafari Shia and Hanafi Sunni dietary jurisprudence prohibit consuming bivalves, including oysters, as it is &quot;makruh&quot; (highly disliked).

==Diseases==
Oysters are subject to various diseases which can reduce harvests and severely deplete local populations. Disease control focuses on containing infections and breeding resistant strains, and is the subject of much ongoing research.
* &quot;Dermo&quot; is caused by a protozoan parasite (&quot;Perkinsus marinus&quot;). It is a prevalent pathogen, causes massive mortality, and poses a significant economic threat to the oyster industry. The disease is not a direct threat to humans consuming infected oysters. Dermo first appeared in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, and until 1978 was believed to be caused by a fungus. While it is most serious in warmer waters, it has gradually spread up the east coast of the United States.
* Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) is caused by the protozoan &quot;Haplosporidium nelsoni&quot;, generally seen as a multinucleated &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. It is infectious and causes heavy mortality in the eastern oyster; survivors, however, develop resistance and can help propagate resistant populations. MSX is associated with high salinity and water temperatures. MSX was first noted in Delaware Bay in 1957, and is now found all up and down the East Coast of the United States. Evidence suggests it was brought to the US when &quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot;, Pacific oyster variety, was introduced to Delaware Bay.
* Denman Island disease causes visible yellow/green pustules on the body and adductor muscles of oysters. This disease mainly affects Pacific oysters (&quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot;). The disease was first described in 1960 near Denman Island off the eastern aspect of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It was found that the causative agent of these lesions are associated with amitochondriate protistan microcells, which were later identified as &quot;Mikrocytos mackini.&quot;

Some oysters also harbor bacterial species which can cause human disease; of importance is &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot;, which causes gastroenteritis, which is usually self-limiting, and cellulitis. Cellulitis can be severe and rapidly spreading, requiring antibiotics, medical care, and in some severe cases amputation. It is usually acquired when the contents of the oyster come in contact with a cut skin lesion, as when shucking an oyster.

<text>Windber is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States, which is located approximately south of Johnstown. The population was 3,930 at the 2020 census. A former manufacturing town, Windber is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Windber was established in 1897 as a company town for nearby coal mines in the vicinity of Johnstown. The establishment was overseen by coal barons Charles and Edward Julius Berwind, owners of the Berwind Corporation; the name &quot;Windber&quot; simply switches the order of the two syllables in the family name &quot;Berwind&quot;. The Berwind-White Coal Mining Company imported workers from eastern and southern Europe and exploited ethnic divisions in the area (which had been settled by Germans and Irish in the 19th century).

On Good Friday 1922 during the UMW General coal strike, coal miners walked out of the mines in Windber and several nearby locations in Somerset County, attempting to force the mine owners to recognize their United Mine Workers union, as well as accurately weigh the coal they mined.

The company employed legal tactics (the United States Supreme Court decided two lawsuits) as well as strike-breakers, but the miners received considerable favorable national publicity and local support and held out until the end of the following summer. However, the UMW successfully organized the mines during 1933, after the Great Depression led to the election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The Vintage Electric Streetcar Company, popularly called the &quot;trolley graveyard&quot;, is located in Windber. The private scrapyard houses a number of PCC streetcars and other transit equipment from systems like the MBTA Green Line, which are sold for reuse or scrapped for parts.

==History==
Eagles Mere was laid out in 1877 and incorporated in 1899. The Eagles Mere Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Eagles Mere&#x27;s name literally means &quot;the eagle&#x27;s lake&quot;, the word &quot;mere&quot; being a poetic synonym of &quot;lake&quot;.

Civil engineer Embley S. Chase came in 1886 to oversee its development as a resort town and laid the ground work. He participated in establishing its street plan, water sports carnival, ice toboggan slide, and trail system. He helped organize the borough, design its water and sewer works, electrify it, and plot the bottom of the lake. He helped design the narrow gauge railroad that once connected it to Sonestown.

Among the five large resort hotels serving the area from the 1880s to 1940s was the Forest Inn, opened in 1902. Its guests included General George C. Marshall and theater director Alvina Krause. 
Lucy McCammon (a faculty member at nearby Bloomsburg State) and Miss Krause (her longtime companion) leased the Inn&#x27;s Eagles Mere Playhouse in 1945 and ran it for twenty years; it featured performers such as Patricia Neal, Jimmy Gheen, Charlton Heston, Jennifer Jones, Paula Prentiss, and Richard Benjamin.
That troupe is gone, but in 1993 the David A. Dewire Community Center was the site of a nationally recognized summer drama workshop.

==Clifford Picnic==
The Clifford Picnic is a fair usually celebrated during the last full week in July. The picnic is a local institution and a fund raising event for the Clifford Township Volunteer Fire Department.

The first picnic was held in August 1949. For the first several years, the Firemen Picnics were held in the field behind the home of Mr. and Mrs. Walter LaCoe. The fire engine was kept across the street at LaCoe&#x27;s Clifford Farm Supply Store. As this meant that stands and tents needed to be erected each year, the Fire Company purchased of land including a small pond.

This location is known locally simply as &quot;the Picnic grounds&quot;, but may also be called &quot;the Clifford Carnival grounds&quot;, &quot;the Clifford Picnic grounds&quot;, or, since they built a new station on the grounds in the last decade, &quot;the fire house&quot;.

The Clifford Twp. Volunteer Fire Company is home to a miniature railroad that once existed at Rocky Glen Park in Moosic. The train was added to Rocky Glen in 1924 and was a part of the Nallin-Jennings Park&#x27;s side of Rocky Glen (John Nallin and Joseph Jennings), as the park at the time was split into two. It operated in the same area the 1905 Miniature Railroad did with a slightly different path, which in the 1980s would be where the Jet Coaster was located.

The railroad operated until the early 1950s, when Nallin-Jennings&#x27; side of Rocky Glen suffered the Fire of 1950, which destroyed Nallin-Jennings&#x27; three major rides, including the Pippin Coaster, The Fun House (the remodeled Crystal Dance Pavilion) and the Tokyo Canal water ride, an Old Mill type ride. With barely anything left but a few rides, what was left of Nallin-Jennings&#x27;s business was sold to Benjamin &amp; Lena Balka, who immediately sold it to Ben and Mae Sterling, the owners of the other half of the park. Because Sterling had now control of the whole park, during the years from 1951 to 1954, they began removing the duplication of rides that existed on both sides of the park and, by 1954, finally tore down the back half of the Pippin Coaster which stood for four years.

Sterling had his own Miniature Railroad that went out along the &quot;Million Dollar&quot; Roller Coaster and was a much better attraction because of the proximity to the lake and large coaster. The now former Nallin-Jennings Miniature Railroad was dismantled and then sold by new owner Ben Sterling to persons from the Clifford Township Volunteer Fire Company, where it has remained with some modifications over the years to keep it going.

As of 2018, it will be in its 94th year in operation.

<text>Dimock Township is a township in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,232 at the 2020 census. It is the home of former U.S. Congressman Chris Carney, a Democrat who represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 2007 to 2011. The school building for the Elk Lake School District is located near the village of Elk Lake in Dimock township.

Dimock was the site of a much publicized incident of water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, a process used to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Formation. In May 2012, after the installation of water treatment systems in affected homes, methane and arsenic were found only in small amounts at one home. At that time the EPA reported that their most recent &quot;set of sampling did not show levels of contaminants that would give EPA reason to take further action.&quot; As of 2012, natural gas companies have been permitted to resume hydraulic fracturing in the area. The EPA and various universities continue to monitor water quality.

==History==
Named after Elder Davis Dimock, Dimock Township was formed from parts of Springville and Bridgewater Townships in December 1832.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (1.53%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,497 people, 570 households, and 425 families residing in the township. The population density was . There were 723 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 97.3% White, 0.1% African American, 0.05% American Indian, 0.05% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.3% from other races, and 1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2% of the population.

There were 570 households, out of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.2% were married couples living together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.4% were non-families. 20.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.00.

In the township the population was spread out, with 24.9% under the age of 18, 60.9% from 18 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.5 years.

The median income for a household in the township was $47,159, and the median income for a family was $55,139. Males had a median income of $40,924 versus $23,958 for females. The per capita income for the township was $22,648. About 7.3% of families and 8.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.9% of those under age 18 and 12.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Water contamination incident==

Dimock was the site of a much publicized water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, which was shown in the 2010 documentary &quot;Gasland&quot;. In 2009, 13 water wells in Dimock, Pennsylvania were contaminated with methane, and one exploded. Arsenic, barium, DEHP, glycol compounds, manganese, phenol, and sodium were found in unacceptable levels in the wells. As a result, Cabot Oil &amp; Gas was required to financially compensate residents and provide alternative sources of water until mitigation systems were installed in affected wells. The company continues to deny that hydraulic fracturing was involved. In May 2012, after the installation of water treatment systems in affected homes, EPA reported that their most recent &quot;set of sampling did not show levels of contaminants that would give EPA reason to take further action.&quot; Methane and arsenic were found only in one well. Cabot has held that the methane was preexisting, but state regulators have cited chemical fingerprinting as proof that it was from Cabot&#x27;s hydraulic fracturing activities. Both Duke University and University of Rochester are conducting studies of the age of the well water to confirm the sources of the various contaminants. EPA plans to re-sample four wells where previous data by the company and the state showed levels of contaminants.

<text>Forest City is a borough in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, situated at the corner of Susquehanna, Lackawanna and Wayne counties and is designated by a marker which is located in the Forest City Industrial Park.

Forest City is four avenues by 10 blocks as the &#x27;main city&#x27;, with a small surrounding suburb housing 1,748 in the 2020 census, with 87% of the population living &#x27;in town&#x27;.

At its height in the early twentieth century, between the timber, silk, lumber and coal industries, the population was close to 6,000—a booming town with a busy Main Street.

==Pre-history==
The land that is Forest City and the surrounding area was originally part of the Delaware-Munsee Indian Tribe. By the time it became Forest City, it had been unoccupied, virgin land.

==History==
The land that would become Forest City had been known as &quot;Forest Mills&quot; since the 1850s. From 1879 to 1886, the post office was called &quot;Pentecost&quot;. It was named after one of the first local settlers, William Pentecost, who had started the lumbering and milling industries in the area. The post office was renamed Forest City in 1886, and the Forest City borough was formed in 1888.

Between 1866 and 1871, the Jefferson Branch, a railroad spur of the D &amp; H Canal Company, was built in Forest Mills. It ran between Susquehanna Depot and Carbondale, transporting the harvested lumber. Lumbering was the only industry of this area, with the exception of a small mining operation run by William Pentecost, which supplied only sufficient coal to neighboring farmers with winter fuel.

In 1871, an outcropping of coal was discovered. The Hillside Coal and Iron Company bought large tracts of land in the area, and by 1872 the first commercially profitable coal mining enterprise was established at North Railroad Street. A small breaker erected on Railroad Street processed the 75-ton daily output from this operation until 1883.

In 1886, another shaft, Shaft No. 2, was opened. This brought an influx of miners, mostly Welsh, into the area. There were now 300 men and boys employed in the production of coal.

&quot;The 1922 Breaker #2 collapse&quot;

On April 1, 1916, there was a mine collapse at Shaft #2 that most notably killed 7 Welsh mining-boys between the ages of 6 and 11. This event was the basis for the song &quot;Crugybar o frynian caersalem&quot; performed by the Wilkes-Barre Quartet in 1922, which commemorates the event, as the boys were &quot;fresh off the boat&quot; from the Salem&#x27;s Hills area of Northeast Wales.

Coal mining continued until The Great Depression hit this town hard, as primary sector of the economy products as lumber and coal were hardest hit. The population slowly dwindled as the coal mining came to a halt. Today, the Forest City Area Historical Society serves as a reminder of this once flourishing coal town.

There are important agricultural interests in the region. At the onset of the twentieth century, coal-mining and silk manufacturing were the chief industries, but with the onset of The Great Depression in the 1920s, businesses decreased to a core of generational store owners.

2017 was a turnaround year for Forest City. In August 2017, a sweeping fire destroyed 25% of the storefronts in town. Then in September, a sudden real estate frenzy bought all lower priced houses in town. Additionally, according to US census records, the highest age percentile decreased below the 35 to 59 age percentile, the first time since 1910. Historically, this signifies the onset of gentrification.

==Geography==

Forest City is north by east of Scranton.

Forest City is located at (41.650907, -75.468180).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (3.23%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 1,911 people, 817 households, and 462 families residing in the borough.

The entire village is only .9034 square miles or 2.33 km2.

There were 817 households, out of which 28.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.6% were married couples living together, 15.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.5% were non-families. 39.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 23.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.91.

The median age was 47. For every 100 females, there were 84.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 78.0 males.

The median income for a household in the borough was $33,618, and the median income for a family was $41,985. The per capita income for the borough was $19,245. About 6.4% of families and 21.3% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 28.4% of those under age 18 and 17.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Churches==
Due to the historical influx of immigrants settling in primary sector of the economy towns such as Forest City, as each successive ethnic minority would build their own church. In its height in the 1920s, Forest City was known as &quot;the town with the most churches in it&quot; to the locals.

Until recently, Forest City&#x27;s overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population boasted five churches: St. Anthony, St. Michael, St. Agnes, St. Joseph, and Sacred Heart. Each of these churches were ethnic, St. Agnes being Irish, St. Anthony&#x27;s was Lithuanian; St. Michael&#x27;s was Slovak; St. Joseph&#x27;s was Slovenian; and Sacred Heart was Polish. Early consolidations were planned in the 1970s, but public resistance kept some of the buildings intermittently open for decades. The Ascension of Our Lord Parish was created and dedicated in 2010, and the worship site, St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, was renovated to accommodate the merger.

Forest City is also home to an Episcopal church, a Byzantine Catholic church, and a non-denominational church. The Methodist Church closed May 2013 and the building was generously donated to the Forest City Area Historical Society which is now society headquarters and museum.

==Senior care==

The William Penn apartment complex for seniors is on Main Street and the Forest City Nursing and Rehab Center is on Delaware Street. This represents up to 7% of the population of Forest City.

==Government and services==
Forest City has its own police department which serves some surrounding municipalities on a contractual basis. The police department consists of a Police Chief, Assistant Police Chief and several Patrol Officers. The police department is located on the second floor of Forest City&#x27;s Boro Hall, which also is the office for town&#x27;s mayor. Boro Hall also houses the Forest City Library.

Forest City has two parks: John F. Kennedy Park and Babe Ruth Park. Kennedy Park, located on Pennsylvania Route 247, five blocks from Main Street, has a lake, baseball fields, tennis and basketball courts, frisbee golf course, playground, and nature trail. Babe Ruth Park is located on Railroad Street and features a playground, playing field, and a basketball court.

Forest City used to hold an annual festival called &quot;Old Home Week” Economics, and the donations of the few Forest City businesses has made it unsustainable as a week-long event.

Forest City is the starting point to the Steamtown Marathon, which is held the Sunday before Columbus Day.

==Education==

Forest City Regional School District is a Preschool-12th grade public school district serving residents of Forest City.

According to the 2010 census, there are at least 17 students per grade living in Forest City.

<doc id="133856" wikidata="Q175078" url="?curid=133856" title="Betty Comden">
<text>Betty Comden (May 3, 1917 – November 23, 2006) was an American lyricist, playwright, and screenwriter who contributed to numerous Hollywood musicals and Broadway shows of the mid-20th century. Her writing partnership with Adolph Green spanned six decades: &quot;the longest running creative partnership in theatre history.&quot; The musical-comedy duo of Comden and Green collaborated most notably with composers Jule Styne and Leonard Bernstein, as well enjoyed success with &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, as part of the famed &quot;Freed unit&quot; at MGM.

==Early life==
Betty Comden was born Basya Cohen in Brooklyn, New York in 1917, the younger child of Leo Cohen (originally Astershinsky), a lawyer, and Rebecca ( Sadvoransky) Cohen, an English teacher. Both were Russian immigrants and observant Jews. She had an older brother, Nathaniel (&quot;Nat&quot;), born . Basya &quot;attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied drama at New York University, graduating in 1938,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 1938, mutual friends introduced her to Adolph Green, an aspiring actor. Along with the young Judy Holliday and Leonard Bernstein, Comden and Green formed a troupe called the Revuers, which performed at the Village Vanguard, a club in Greenwich Village. Due to the act&#x27;s success, the Revuers appeared in the 1944 film &quot;Greenwich Village&quot;, but their roles were so small they were barely noticed, and they returned to New York.

Comden and Green&#x27;s first Broadway show was in 1944, with &quot;On the Town&quot;, a musical about three sailors on leave in New York City that was an expansion of a ballet entitled &quot;Fancy Free&quot; on which Bernstein had been working with choreographer Jerome Robbins. Comden and Green wrote the book and lyrics, which included sizable parts for themselves (as &quot;Claire&quot; and &quot;Ozzie&quot;). Their next musical, &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; in 1945, with music by Morton Gould was not a success, and their 1947 show &quot;Bonanza Bound&quot; closed out-of-town and never reached Broadway.

==Broadway and film success==
Comden and Green headed to California and soon found work at MGM. They wrote the screenplays for &quot;Good News&quot; and &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (which reunited Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers), and then adapted &quot;On the Town&quot; for Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, scrapping most of Bernstein&#x27;s music at the request of Arthur Freed, who did not care for the Bernstein score. The duo reunited with Gene Kelly for their most successful project, the classic &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, about Hollywood in the final days of the silent film era. Comden and Green provided the story and screenplay; the songs were hits from the late 1920s and early 1930s by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.

They followed this with another hit, &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, in which the characters of Lester and Lily, a husband-and-wife musical-writing team, were patterned after themselves. As with &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, the real-life team did not write the songs. They were Oscar-nominated twice, for their screenplays for &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;. Both films also received Screen Writers Guild Awards; &quot;On the Town&quot; did too.

Comden and Green&#x27;s stage work of the 1950s included &quot;Two on the Aisle&quot;, starring Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray, with music by Jule Styne; &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, a musical adaptation of the play &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, with music by Bernstein; and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, which reunited them with Judy Holliday and Jule Styne. The score, including the standards &quot;Just in Time&quot;, &quot;Long Before I Knew You&quot;, and &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, proved to be one of their richest.

The duo contributed additional lyrics to the 1954 musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, translated and streamlined &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera, and collaborated with Styne on songs for the play-with-music &quot;Say, Darling&quot;. In 1958, they appeared on Broadway in &quot;A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green&quot;, a revue that included some of their early sketches. It was a critical and commercial success, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977.

The pair wrote the screenplay for &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; in 1958. The &quot;New York Times&quot; movie review from that year lays it out as follows:

Comden and Green&#x27;s Broadway work in the 1960s included four collaborations with Jule Styne. They wrote the lyrics for &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;, and the book and lyrics for &quot;Subways Are For Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot;, and &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; Their &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; score won a Tony Award.

Comden and Green wrote the libretto for the 1970 musical &quot;Applause&quot;, an adaptation of the film &quot;All About Eve&quot;, and wrote the book and lyrics for 1978&#x27;s &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, with music by Cy Coleman. Comden also played Letitia Primrose in that musical when original star Imogene Coca left the show. Comden and Green&#x27;s final musical hit was 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Will Rogers Follies&quot;, providing lyrics to Cy Coleman&#x27;s music. The duo&#x27;s biggest failure was 1982&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s Life&quot;, an attempt to figure out what Nora did after she abandoned her husband in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, which ran for only five performances, although they received Tony Award nominations for its book and score.

In 1980, Comden was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. And, in 1981, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. In the early 1980s, Comden acted in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s play &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot;, portraying the lead character&#x27;s mother.

In 1984, filmmaker Sidney Lumet directed a film about Greta Garbo, &quot;Garbo Talks&quot;, starring Anne Bancroft and Ron Silver. The producers of the film were sure that the real Garbo either could not be located or would refuse flatly to appear in a cameo. They asked a known associate of Garbo to ask the great actress if she would appear in the film, but received no response. So, Comden was asked to appear in the film for the brief, pivotal &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; scenes.

Comden and Green received Kennedy Center Honors in 1991.

In 1994, Comden and Green were guest callers, &quot;Linda&quot; and &quot;Walter&quot;, on the long-running sit-com &quot;Frasier&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;Burying a Grudge.&quot;

==Family==
Comden and Green were a creative partnership, not a romantic couple. In 1942, Comden married Siegfried Schutzman, a designer and businessman, who changed his name to Steven Kyle. He died in 1979 of acute pancreatitis. They had two children, a daughter, Susanna, and a son, Alan, who died in 1990. 
 She never remarried.

==Death==
Betty Comden died of heart failure following an undisclosed illness of several months at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan on Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2006, aged 89. She was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, New York.
