<text>Seagraves is a city in Gaines County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,153 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A post office at the home of S.J. Blythe occupied the area known as Blythe, Texas. In 1917, the Santa Fe Railroad moved into the vicinity, but the rail company ran into a problem. Santa Fe already had one town by that name located in Blythe, California. The company decided to change the name of this new location to honor Charles L. Seagraves, an employee who worked as a traveling agent and was favored by local residents. The Spearman Land Company building was the first to be erected, and the Higginbotham Bartlett Lumber Company followed shortly thereafter. Seagraves grew rapidly as a town, and in 1928, suffered a fire that burned a major portion of the business section. The only building left standing on the west side of Main Street was the Seagraves Motor Company, which led to the rebuilding of modern brick buildings, many of which remain today.

<text>Seminole is a city in and the county seat of Gaines County, Texas, United States. Its population was 6,430 at the 2010 census. Seminole and Gaines County are home to a large population of Low German Mennonites from Russia that came to West Texas in the 1980s.

It is the birthplace of country music singers Larry Gatlin and Tanya Tucker.

==History==
The land for Seminole was donated by nonresident landowners to become the county seat for Gaines County. In 1906, the first move to Seminole was made by W. B. Austin and his wife Emma, who moved their general store there, which was located in Caput, Texas. During this time, several post offices found a new home in Seminole. Seminole National Bank opened its doors in 1906, followed by First State Bank in 1907. In 1912, Seminole National Bank lost over $3,000 when it was robbed. In 1914, the two banks merged to form First State Bank. In 1950, Seminole&#x27;s population surpassed Seagraves, Texas, for the first time.

Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites became an ethnoreligious group in the Russian Empire and migrated from there to Canada and then to Mexico. In 1977, some 100 families from Mexico bought land southwest of Seminole to settle there, but faced difficulties with immigration. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed legislation allowing the original 100 families to gain full citizenship. In 2016, about 6,000 Plautdietsch speakers lived around Seminole.

<text>Bacliff is a census-designated place (CDP) in north-central Galveston County, Texas, United States, northwest of Galveston. The population was 9,677 at the 2020 census, up from 8,619 at the 2010 census. Bacliff, originally called Clifton-by-the-Sea, began as a seaside resort town. Located on the western shore of Galveston Bay, Bacliff, along with San Leon and Bayview, are the largest unincorporated communities on the Galveston County mainland.

The Bacliff CDP is home to the Kenneth E. Little Elementary school and Bayshore Park, created from land donated by Texas Genco.

==History==
Bacliff was established in 1910 by local landowners G.C. Perkins and W.Y. Fuqua as Clifton-by-the Sea. The area was developed as a seaside weekend resort, and included parks, hotels, summer homes, and a bathhouse and open air pavilion built on a pier over the water. Telephone service came to Clifton-by-the-Sea in 1913, and Grand Avenue (FM 646) became the main street. Hurricanes, Galveston&#x27;s recovery after the Hurricane of 1900, and rapid transportation diminished Clifton-by-the-Sea&#x27;s popularity.

The hurricane of 1915 destroyed many of the improvements to the area, but by 1924 the bathhouse and pavilion had been restored and summer residents returned to the community. A fire destroyed the pavilion in 1929 and it was rebuilt and hosted numerous summer concerts by both the Galveston and Houston
orchestras. The hurricane of 1943 caused major damage to the area and the bathhouse and pavilion were not rebuilt.

In 1933, Clifton-by-the-Sea was home to 50 residents and two businesses, and from 1940 to 1949 it was home to 100 residents and four businesses. After World War II the area expanded as it became home for workers of the nearby petrochemical plants. The expansion of the area required the establishment of a post office in 1948. The U.S. Postal Service refused to allow the name Clifton-by-the-Sea to be used due to its length, and the name Clifton was already in use by another Texas town, so the residents chose the same name as the subdivision at the center of business, Bay Cliff, as a replacement. However, the name was misspelled on the postal paperwork as Bacliff. The new name had only seven letters, so it was admissible.

&quot;Gator&quot; Miller, former publisher of the &quot;Seabreeze&quot;, said that in the 1950s the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; bought a large parcel of land and awarded free lots to subscribers; people who canceled subscriptions lost their homesites, which were given to other subscribers. Miller said that this resulted in confused titles and a lack of large business; Miller said that a retailer would not wish to buy land in Bacliff and then discover that an individual claimed title to the land.

In 1964, Houston Lighting and Power began construction on two 450 MW electric generating units in Bacliff as part of the company&#x27;s Project Enterprise expansion. The units were of supercritical boiler design, which was then a new technology. The power plant, originally known as the Bacliff Plant, was renamed the P. H. Robinson plant, in honor of company president Perk H. Robinson.

In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dispute over the valuation of the power plant between HL&amp;P and the Dickinson Independent School District (DISD). In 1979 HL&amp;P said the plant was worth $238 million but DISD&#x27;s board of equalization said it was worth over $242 million. A legal dispute ensued between the two agencies.

During the 1980s, three measures to incorporate the Bacliff area failed by wide margins. In April 1985, residents of Bacliff, Bayview, and San Leon considered an incorporation proposal to become the City of Bayshore. Judge Ray Holbrook signed an order for the election to take place on April 6, 1985, freeing the area, which had a population of 11,000, from the extraterritorial jurisdiction of League City and Texas City. Residents rejected the incorporation proposal. The vote was tallied with 1,268 against and 399 in favor. Proponents wanted a local police force and the ability to pass ordinances. Opponents said that the tax base was too small to support municipal services including police and road and drainage improvements.

By 1986, the community became a bedroom community for workers commuting to jobs in the area; during that year, the Bacliff community had 4,851 residents and 19 businesses.

In 1986, residents in Bacliff and Bayview considered incorporating into a general law city. Supporters said that incorporation would establish more local control over affairs, an area police department, and the ability to pass ordinances. Opponents said that the area&#x27;s tax base could not sufficiently support municipal service, including police protection and road and drainage improvements. At the time the area of considering incorporation had 7,000 people. Galveston County Judge Ray Holbrook signed an order setting the date of the election as Saturday, August 9, 1986, and releasing the area from the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Kemah, League City, and Texas City. In 1986, the Bacliff and Bayview area received water and sewer services from two municipal utility districts; if the incorporation measure had passed the districts would have likely remained. Donna Maples, vice president of the Bacliff-Bayview Community Association, supported the incorporation measure. The officials overseeing the election described turnout as &quot;heavy.&quot; Officials announced that the incorporation proposal failed on a 770 to 163 count.

In 2000, in Bacliff there were 6,692 people organized into 2,523 households. That year Bacliff and San Leon formed a nine member board to prepare the communities for incorporation. At that time Bacliff and San Leon had a combined population of 10,000. The board was to have three members from the Bacliff area, three members from the San Leon area, and three at large members. It was prompted after the City of Texas City suddenly annexed several commercial parcels along Texas State Highway 146 between Kemah and Dickinson Bayou in the year 2000. The board hoped to convince Texas City to reverse the annexation.

In 2003, the P. H. Robinson power plant was mothballed by Texas Genco. The plant was mothballed due to the proliferation of newer gas-fired merchant plants in Texas. Robinson Units 1-4 had 2,213 MW. The plant was decommissioned in 2009 and demolished in 2012. In 2013, NRG began construction on a 6 unit electrical generation &quot;peaking plant&quot;. This plant was placed in service on June 1, 2017

After Hurricane Ike hit Texas in September 2008, Galveston County officials offered a debris removal program to residents in unincorporated areas, including Bacliff. Flooding from hurricane Ike was minimized due in part to Bacliff&#x27;s relatively high elevation of 16 feet.

In 2017, in Bacliff there were 10,925 people organized into 3,004 households.

==Demographics==

===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 9,677 people, 3,672 households, and 2,684 families residing in the CDP.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 8,619 people, 3,022 households, and 2,095 families residing in the CDP. This represented a growth of approximately 23.8% since the 2000 census. The population density was 3,405.4 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the CDP was 74.3% White, 3.5% African American, 0.7% Native American, 2.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 15.9% from other races, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 37.1% of the population.

There were 3,022 households, out of which 34.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.9% were married couples living together, 14.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.7% were non-families. 24.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.87 and the average family size was 3.41.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 18.7% under the age of 18 years, 7.5% from 18 to 24 years, 31.3% from 25 to 44 years, 22.5% from 45 to 64, and 8.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.3 males.

As of 2012 most residents of Bacliff are commuters. As of 2012 Bacliff, Bayview, and San Leon together make up the largest unincorporated community in the mainland portion of Galveston County by population.

In 2008 Phale Cassady Le, an outreach coordinator of Boat People SOS Houston, said that in Bacliff and San Leon there were between 150 and 200 Vietnamese families with origins in crab, oyster, and shrimp fishing operations. According to Le, most of the Vietnamese have no house or boat insurance, and even if they did have this insurance, their English is not well developed enough to read the terms of the policies. Many families had hand-made boats that were constructed over several years as the owner made more and more money. Nick Cenegy of &quot;The Galveston County Daily News&quot; said that the Vietnamese community in Bacliff and San Leon had a &quot;tradition of self-reliance and wariness of outsiders.&quot;

The Vietnamese first moved into the Galveston Bay Area in the 1970s and established shrimping businesses with borrowed money. By the early 1980s, many native residents in the area became angered and a conflict started between the groups. Because media groups portrayed White residents as, in the words of Bob Burtman of the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;bigoted rednecks,&quot; many residents had a suspicion of the media; Burtman said that the media had exaggerated the importance of Ku Klux Klan involvement in that conflict. Due to the conflict, local residents had also gained anti-government feelings that were present in 1997. That year, Burtman said &quot;For the most part, the Vietnamese and Texan shrimpers have ironed out their differences, though mistrust remains.&quot;

==Crime==
As of 2008 (Originally started in 1995), Bacliff had the 4th Street Bloods (4SB), a street gang consisting of mostly White Americans. The name of the gang originates from its headquarters in Bacliff. Documents filed in federal court stated that the gang was formed by six people in the mid-1990s. Cindy George of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said &quot;The gang purportedly makes money by selling powdered and crack cocaine as well as methamphetamine.&quot; To identify themselves, members wore red and had tattoos that read &quot;4th Street Playa&quot; and &quot;Kliff Side&quot;.

In 2008 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Texas City Safe Street Task Force, the Galveston County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and other agencies started an investigation into the gang. That year, 10 people were arrested, accused of drug charges. In 2011 the Federal Government of the United States arrested four men from Bacliff, accusing to be a part of the gang and charging them crimes related to crack cocaine distribution. In 2011 12 people accused of being members faced drug charges. In 2012 a federal judge in Houston sentenced four 4SB men to prison. They had pleaded guilty to their crimes.

==Infrastructure==
===Utilities===
Two municipal utility districts serve the Bacliff CDP. Some sections of the Bacliff CDP are served by the Bacliff Municipal Utility District (MUD), while other sections are served by the Bayview MUD. In November 2011 the Bacliff MUD requested and received an 8.95 million dollar bond issue for the expansion of water services which are currently provided to about 2,700 water taps. This bond issue will be funded by Bacliff residents through increased property taxes. In addition to water/sewer service, the Bacliff MUD became responsible for administering trash collection as of February 2016. The Bacliff Volunteer Fire Department provides fire protection services. In 2010, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the fire department got a $356,320 loan and a $191,854 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development. The department used it to buy a newly built pumper fire truck.

Of them 56 (1.8% of the total Bacliff CDP civilian workforce) were employees of their own corporations, 82 (2.6%) were private non-profit wage and salary workers, 151 (4.8%) worked for local governments, 144 (4.6%) were state government workers, 53 (1.7%) were federal workers, 268 (9.3%) were self-employed, and 14 of them (less than 1% of the total Bacliff CDP workforce) worked in agriculture, forestry, fishing, or hunting. 14 (Less than 1%) were unpaid family workers.

== Education ==

Some of the areas within the Bacliff CDP fall under the boundary of Dickinson Independent School District (DISD), while northern areas are zoned to Clear Creek Independent School District (CCISD). The CCISD part of the community north of Bay Avenue is within the Board of Trustees District 5, represented by Dee Scott as of 2014.

The DISD portion is zoned to Kenneth E. Little Elementary School in the Bacliff community in unincorporated Galveston County.

The current facility, on a campus, has 33 classrooms and capacity for about 750 students. The architect of the building was Bay Architects and the construction company was Falcon Group Construction. Construction began in the year 2000 and completion was scheduled for June 2001. The cost was $7.5 million. Classrooms are arranged in pods organized by grade level. Each pod has a commons area. The school has a lighthouse motif reflecting its proximity to the Galveston Bay. The school entrance has a frosted dome, pyramidal skylight. The previous school building was located on the same site. Portions of the original building were to be demolished after students moved into the new school facility.

Residents of the DISD portion are also zoned to Barber Middle School in Dickinson, McAdams Junior High School in Dickinson, and Dickinson High School in Dickinson. CCISD pupils are zoned to Stewart Elementary School (formerly Kemah Elementary School) in unincorporated Galveston County, Bayside Intermediate School in League City, and Clear Falls High School in League City. Previously residents were zoned to League City Intermediate School, and Clear Creek High School in League City.

Residents of Dickinson ISD and the Galveston County portion of Clear Creek ISD (and therefore Bacliff) are zoned to the College of the Mainland, a community college in Texas City.

==Parks and recreation==
Along the Galveston Bay Bacliff has several boat ramps.

The Galveston County Department of Parks and Senior Services operates several recreational facilities in Bacliff. The Bacliff Community Center is at 4503 11th Street. The Bayshore Park at 5437 East Farm to Market Road 646 (FM 646) has five baseball fields, one boat ramp, one historic site, ten picnic areas, one pier, one playground, and five practice backstops. The park was originally owned by Texas Genco for 35 years; the county operated the park according to an agreement. In 2005 Texas Genco donated the park to the county. Many anglers and their families use Bayshore Park as a place of recreation.

In 2014 Galveston County purchased and cleared a new tract in Bacliff which will become a new park for the Bayshore area. 
In August 2016 the Galveston County Commissioners Court approved a $1.9 million contract to build a Community Center at the park with Galveston County crews initiating construction the same month. As of January 2018 the new Bacliff Community Center and Park was in full operation.

The Bacliff Boat Ramp is located behind Clifton&#x27;s Seaside Diner, while the Bayshore Park Boat Ramp is located on Farm to Market Road 646, aka Bayshore Drive. The nearest full service marina is the Eagle Point fishing camp, located off East Bayshore Drive in San Leon.

As of 2016 one of the most popular restaurants in Bacliff was Noah&#x27;s Ark. T.J. Aulds of &quot;The Galveston County Daily News&quot; said that Bacliff, San Leon, and Bayview &quot;are known for great spots to eat seafood.&quot;

As of 1991 Bacliff, along with Kemah and Seabrook, houses pleasure boats from NASA employees due to its proximity to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

<text>Bolivar Peninsula ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Galveston County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,769 at the 2020 census. The communities of Port Bolivar, Crystal Beach, Caplen, Gilchrist, and High Island are located on Bolivar Peninsula.

==History==
The peninsula was named in 1816 for SimÃ³n BolÃ­var, the famed Venezuelan political leader involved in the independence movements of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and other Latin American nations.
The pirates/privateers Jean Laffite and Louis-Michel Aury each used the Bolivar Peninsula as part of the pirate &quot;kingdom&quot; established around the Galveston Bay. The peninsula was part of an overland slave route between Louisiana and Galveston.
James Long based his operations on the peninsula since 1819 with the first establishment of Bolivar Peninsula, and Fort Las Casas was built in 1820. Samuel D. Parr was responsible for starting the settlement in 1838 that would later become Port Bolivar.

The Point Bolivar Lighthouse (which is now privately owned and not open to the public) has an important history with the peninsula, built in 1872. The lighthouse is located on the western end of the peninsula, directly across from Fort Travis seawolf Park. Fort Travis in Bolivar Peninsula, a separate facility from Fort Travis in Galveston, was built with construction starting in 1898.
The North Jetty, extending from Bolivar Peninsula, of the entrance to Galveston Bay started being constructed in 1874.
From 1896 to 1942, the Gulf &amp; Interstate, a subsidiary of Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway, connected Beaumont to Galveston Island with aid of train ferries.
At one time the Bolivar Peninsula was called the &quot;breadbasket of Galveston&quot; and the &quot;watermelon capital of Texas&quot;.

Crystal Beach was incorporated from 1971 until 1987, and it has been the most populated community of the Bolivar Peninsula.
On April 23, 1991, communities of Bolivar Peninsula received an enhanced 9-1-1 system which routes calls to proper dispatchers and allows dispatchers to automatically view the address of the caller. The Bolivar Peninsula suffered heavy damage from Hurricane Ike that made landfall on the Texas coast on September 13, 2008.

==Geography==
The Bolivar Peninsula forms a very narrow strip of land in Galveston County, separating the eastern part of Galveston Bay from the Gulf of Mexico. Its narrowest point is a quarter of a mile and is near the unincorporated community of Gilchrist, where the peninsula was divided by Rollover Pass.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.7%, is water.

== Communities ==
While every community on the Bolivar Peninsula is Unincorporated, Crystal Beach, formerly known as Patton, was an Incorporated community from 1971 until 1987.

==Education==

Bolivar Peninsula residents are divided between the Galveston Independent School District and the High Island Independent School District.

The western portion of the Bolivar Peninsula, including the unincorporated communities of Port Bolivar and Crystal Beach, are within the Galveston Independent School District. That portion is served by the Pre-K-8 Crenshaw Elementary and Middle School, located on the peninsula, and Ball High School (9-12), located on the island of Galveston. The current Crenshaw building, in Crystal Beach, opened in 2005. Prior to the opening of the current campus, the previous facility consisted of two separate buildings, in Port Bolivar. there are no particular attendance boundaries in GISD so parents may apply to any school they wish, but only Bolivar Peninsula residents may have school bus service to Crenshaw K-8.

The eastern portion of the peninsula, including the unincorporated communities of Caplen, Gilchrist, and High Island, is served by the High Island Independent School District.

As of 2003 some residents of the GISD portion sent their children to HIISD, and some residents of the GISD portion expressed a belief that the district was not giving fair treatment to their area schools despite the tax money they pay.

Both GISD and HIISD (and therefore the entire peninsula) are assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

==Parks and recreation==
The Galveston County Department of Parks and Senior Services operates the Joe Faggard Community Center at 1760 State Highway 87 in the Crystal Beach area and the Fort Travis Seashore Park.

The community holds a Mardi Gras celebration along Texas State Highway 87 each year. Many people and groups, including beach bars, politicians, and school groups have krewes in the celebration. Brittanie Shey of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described the celebration as a &quot;small town parade.&quot;

==Transportation==
The Texas Department of Transportation provides ferry service from Port Bolivar at the western end of the Bolivar Peninsula to Galveston. During the non-tourist season, there is only a tentative daily schedule for this service, running approximately every thirty minutes from either side during daylight hours and once an hour after nightfall. Boats will depart the landing from any given side on the captain&#x27;s prerogative. During tourist season and on occasion of holiday weekends and large events on the island of Galveston (only) the boats have been known to run as quickly as every fifteen minutes departing both sides every twenty minutes at most. On these occasions, the ferry service may have as many as five boats in the water, compared to three during the off-season. There was a proposal to build the Bolivar Bridge to connect Galveston Island to Bolivar Peninsula, but it has been canceled.

==Hurricane Ike==
At 7:10 UST on September 13, 2008 (2:10 am local), Hurricane Ike made landfall at the east end of Galveston Island, Texas, as the largest North Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. At the height of the storm, Ike&#x27;s cloud mass essentially covered the entire Gulf of Mexico. The Wind and Surge Destructive Potential Classification Scale, which was detailed in Tropical Cyclone Destructive Potential by Integrated Kinetic Energy (by Dr. Mark Powell and Dr. Tim Reinhold, April 2007) offers a new way to assess hurricane size and strength by calculating the total kinetic energy contained in a 1-meter deep horizontal slice of the storm at an elevation of 10 meters above the land or ocean surface. Using this type of calculation, the integrated kinetic energy was calculated for Ike and was found to be 25 percent greater than the comparable maximum estimate for Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Hurricane Ike caused destruction of the peninsula, reducing the region to rubble and causing severe, permanent change in the shoreline. Entire communities along the upper Texas coast were simply wiped out by Ike&#x27;s catastrophic storm surge. Ike&#x27;s effects were disproportionally felt near the long, low-lying Bolivar Peninsula which has typical elevations around 2Â m. Despite being only a strong category 2 storm with maximum winds at landfall of 95 knots (49Â m/s, Berg, 2009), Ike&#x27;s extremely large, long-lasting surge and waves devastated the peninsula. In Gilchrist, Texas, NOAA aerial photography reveals complete destruction. The Rollover Pass bridge was reduced to one lane. Of the 1,000 buildings in Gilchrist, 99.5% of them were knocked off of their foundations. Of the buildings off of the foundations, the storm demolished some and washed others onto swamplands behind Gilchrist.

The Bolivar Peninsula was just to the right of landfall, placing it on the strong side of the hurricane. H Wind reconstructions (Powell et al., 1998) show winds blowing strongly from offshore-to-onshore for most of the storm, which acted to increase both surge and waves. Surge is extremely important for the particular case of the Bolivar Peninsula, as it allowed large waves to penetrate inland into areas they could not otherwise have reached. Shoreline erosion was around 75Â m, which undermined the piled foundations of oceanfront buildings. Most other houses in this area were reduced to either piles or slabs by large waves riding on surge, with only a very few remaining more or less intact. Peak coastal surges reached . Water depths of at least covered all of the Bolivar Peninsula, with most areas covered by at least of water (not including wave action). Much of the southern part of Chambers County was also inundated by at least of water. According to post-storm analyses by both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division and Applied Research Associates (ARA), a research and engineering company, the best estimates of 3-second peak wind gusts along the eastern portion of the peninsula were between 110Â mph and 115Â mph. Research observations also suggest most of eastern and southeastern Texas was subjected to tropical storm and hurricane-force winds for ten hours, and possibly longer.

Cindy Horswell of &quot;McClatchy - Tribune Business News&quot; said that authorities said that 3,600 structures on the peninsula, 62% of them, were destroyed or severely damaged by Ike&#x27;s storm surge. By January 2009, 40% of Bolivar Peninsula&#x27;s population had returned. Of the Bolivar Peninsula communities, Gilchrist received the fewest returnees.

===Bolivar Peninsula after Ike===
==Government and infrastructure==
The United States Postal Service once operated the Gilchrist Post Office, which opened on September 16, 1950. It closed on July 31, 2010.

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston maintains the Our Lady By The Sea Chapel and Catholic Center in Crystal Beach. Its service area is the entire peninsula. This site is a part of the Holy Family Parish, which has other sites on Galveston Island.

Our Mother of Mercy Church in Port Bolivar was established circa 1950. Crystal Beach formerly had St. Theresa of Liseaux Mission, built in 1994. St. Theresa sustained damage during Hurricane Ike in 2008, and due to the damage the archdiocese had it razed. Our Lady By The Sea was built on its site. Our Mother of Mercy was undamaged, but it remained closed after the hurricane and the archdiocese had it demolished anyway.

Between Hurricane Ike and the opening of Our Lady by the Sea, Bolivar residents attended church in Galveston or in Winnie. John Nova Lomax of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that the Our Lady church, dedicated in 2010 and on the site of the former St Therese of Lisieux, &quot;effectively consolidates&quot; the two former churches. Residents opposed to the demolition of Our Mother of Mercy expressed a negative reception to the opening of Our Lady by the Sea.

<text>Clear Lake Shores is a city in Galveston County, Texas, United States, located within the HoustonâSugar LandâBaytown metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 1,258.

==History==
During the oil boom years of the 1920s, developers began to sell properties around the Clear Lake estuary as waterfront recreational retreats. The new development was named &quot;Clear Lake Shores&quot;. Though the development was initially successful, the Great Depression halted most of the area&#x27;s growth.

After World War II the area began to redevelop with increasing numbers of permanent residents (as opposed to simply weekend residents). The town was incorporated in 1962 and has since continued to be primarily residential with a small, tourism-focused business community.

In September 2008, the eye of Hurricane Ike hit and destroyed many homes.

==Geography==
Clear Lake Shores is located at (29.546493, â95.032605) and is part of the Clear Lake Area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 27.69%, is water.

All Clear Lake Shores addresses share the 77565 zip code with the city of Kemah.

==History==

Dickinson is located on a tract of land granted to John Dickinson in 1824, and named after him. A settlement had been established in this area on Dickinson Bayou before 1850. The Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad was built directly through Dickinson. This line was used in the American Civil War to successfully retake Galveston.

The Dickinson Land and Improvement Association was organized in the 1890s by Fred M. Nichols and eight other businessmen. It marketed to potential farmers with claims of the soil&#x27;s suitability for food crops, and to socialites with the creation of the Dickinson Picnic Grounds and other attractions. By 1911, the GalvestonâHouston Electric Railway had three stops in Dickinson, and the Oleander Country Club was a popular destination for prominent Galvestonians.

In 1905, Italian ambassador Baron Mayor des Planches convinced about 150 Italians from crowded eastern cities to move to Dickinson. They joined the dozens relocated there after flooding in Bryan forced them to seek new homes.

During the 1920s, Dickinson became a significant tourist destination resulting from investment by the Maceo crime syndicate, which ran Galveston during this time. The syndicate created gambling venues in the city such as the Silver Moon casino.

The city received international attention after they tried to force citizens to sign loyalty pledges to Israel to receive relief aid. Local officials said it was required, due to Texas&#x27; strict anti-BDS laws.

In January 2021, Dickinson made national news by the mayoral election run-off ending in a tie (1,010 votes each), Mayor Sean Skipworth was selected by drawing a name out of a hat.

In August 2021, Dickinson made national news again when Council Member Position 1, H. Scott Apley died of the COVID-19 virus after making many antimask and antivaccine social-media posts. Johnnie Simpson Jr., a United Methodist pastor, won the seat after earning 49% of the vote in a four-way special election, and 60.3% of the vote in a runoff.

<text>Jamaica Beach is a city in Galveston County, Texas, United States on Galveston Island. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,078. The city is bordered by Galveston to the east and west, the east bay on the north, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south.

==History==

Before its development, Jamaica Beach was a burial ground of the Karankawa people. Johnny Goyen and Earl Galceran of the Jamaica Corporation developed Jamaica Beach as a 2,000-lot resort subdivision close to a marina. The individuals who were a part of the development effort were Goyen, Galceran, brothers Jack and Welcome Wilson, Bill Sherrill, and Jack Valenti. They acquired an area of that was owned by the Moody family. An oil businessperson named R.E. &quot;Bob&quot; Smith decided not to be a partner in the development, but he purchased the Moody land and sold it to the developers. He did not ask for any down payments and he guaranteed a $250,000 bank loan. Initially, the beachfront lots, each , were sold for $3,500 apiece. The &quot;second-row&quot; houses sold at a quick pace. As the subsequent rows of houses opened for sale, the sales figures decreased slowly because while wealthy people were easily able to acquire second houses, middle-class homebuyers were unable to get a mortgage, and needed to pay for the homebuilding with cash.

In the 1960s, the discovery of a skull and that it was connected to a Karankawa Native American burial ground led to an increase in public exposure and visitors. Welcome Wilson said that no additional sales were generated by the publicity. With the growth of the second house market, almost all of the lots on Jamaica Beach had been sold by the 1970s. Due to a decline in the United States economy, the developer closed its doors. The city incorporated on May 12, 1975. By 1978, 141 residents lived in Jamaica Beach. By 1988, the city had 446 residents and no businesses. By 1990, the city had 624 residents.

Jamaica Beach was affected by Hurricane Alicia in August 1983. In September 2008, the city was affected by Hurricane Ike.

On Saturday August 9, 2008, Jamaica Beach celebrated the 50th anniversary of its groundbreaking. At the ceremony, Welcome Wilson donated boxes of news articles, brochures, and promotional materials in order to build a collection for a museum located at the city hall. In addition, the five children of Welcome Wilson donated $10,000 to the new museum.

<doc id="135923" wikidata="Q981422" url="?curid=135923" title="Kemah, Texas">
<text>Kemah ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, southeast of Houston along west Galveston Bay. The city&#x27;s population was 1,807 at the 2020 census, down from 2,330 at the 2000 census. Located in GalvestonÂ County, Kemah&#x27;s main industry is shipping. Originally a small fishing town, the city has become a tourist destination for the area&#x27;s restaurants and attractions, which are contained within the Kemah Entertainment District. In 2012 Kemah was ranked the top tourism spot in the Greater Houston area.

==Geography==
Kemah is located in the northeastern corner of Galveston County at (29.5425, â95.0203) and is part of the Clear Lake Area. It is bordered to the west and south by League City, to the northwest by Clear Lake Shores, to the southeast by unincorporated Bacliff, and at its northern end by Seabrook across the Clear Creek Channel in Harris County. Texas State Highway 146 leads through the center of Kemah, leading north to Baytown and south to Texas City. Galveston is to the south, and Houston is to the northwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Kemah has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.55%, are water.
==History==
The land, measuring approximately , was the basis for a town that would be called Kemah. This land was granted to one of the first colonists who was a farmer and stockraiser, Michael Gouldrich, on August 24, 1824. Gouldrich&#x27;s land was located near Clear Creek and Galveston Bay.

However, after Gouldrich disappeared, William Vince from Harris County acquired Gouldrich&#x27;s Clear Creek land. Afterwards John Flanders, an Alamo fighter who was not supposed to have taken any land, bought the property from William Vince and it was renamed &quot;Flanders Grove&quot; or &quot;Flanders Labor&quot;. When Flanders died at the age of 36, Allen Vince, of Vince&#x27;s Bayou, was appointed executor of Flanders&#x27; estate in 1841. On May 28, 1844, there was a petition to sell the land to pay off debts. Soon after, the land was appraised for $2 an acre and sold to Jonathan D. Waters. He bought the Clear Creek land on July 2, 1844, for $354.

After October 1850, Waters sold of the Clear Creek property to various people, but Henry Kipp eventually owned the land. During the 1890s, the Bradford and Kipp families moved to the area and portioned off the land into town lots in 1898, thus establishing the town known as &quot;Evergreen&quot;. It was located along the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, and the area was also called &quot;Shell Siding&quot; for the oyster shell middens lining the bay, in some places deep.

After the 1900 Galveston hurricane, when the majority of the towns around Galveston Bay were destroyed, the Kipp and Bradford families were forced to evacuate, but later moved back to Evergreen in 1901. They rebuilt and restored the town, making two-story homes with porches for themselves on 10th street. In order for there to be a post office in the town, the name had to be changed because there was already a town called Evergreen. The name &quot;Kemah&quot; was chosen with the Karankawa Indian word meaning &quot;wind in my face&quot;. In 1907, John H. Kipp Sr. established a post office in the newly named town of Kemah.

From the 1920s to the 1950s Kemah became a significant tourist destination resulting from investment by the Maceo crime syndicate which ran Galveston during this time. The syndicate created a lavish casino district along the boardwalk featuring venues such as the Chili Bowl and the Kemah Den. During the 1950s the state Attorney General and the Texas Rangers finally shut down the Galveston vice empire. Kemah&#x27;s casinos were closed and its tourism base declined drastically.

During the 1950s a major commercial shrimp fishing fleet was established in the town as the Clear Creek Channel was opened. Though Hurricane Carla severely damaged the city in 1961, the city rebuilt and the fishing business revived. During the 1970s, in part as a result of the establishment of the Johnson Space Center on Clear Lake, tourism began to re-emerge as pleasure boats began to fill the lake.

On October 22, 1966, the town of Kemah adopted Vernon&#x27;s Texas Civil Statutes and became a General Law City. In 1992, the city expanded to , or , and the population increased to 1,300 residents.

In the late 1990s, Kemah continued to expand and began to be known as a tourist and recreational hot spot. This occurred when Landry&#x27;s Restaurants opened the Kemah Boardwalk. The boardwalk now includes amusement rides for tourists and residents to enjoy.
On the morning of September 13, 2008, a Category 2 hurricane named Ike made landfall in Galveston County. Although the hurricane caused more damage to Galveston, Kemah still felt the effects of the storm. Hurricane Ike caused power outages in Kemah, destruction of homes and business, and streets to be piled with trees and debris. However, most importantly, the storm surge affected the Kemah Boardwalk the most. Although it did not take Landry&#x27;s long to start to rebuild the tourist attraction, a waterline in the Landry&#x27;s Restaurant is a reminder of the devastating hurricane.

<text>La Marque ( ) is a city in Galveston County, Texas, United States, south of Houston. The city population in 2020 was 18,030. La Marque experienced considerable growth in the 1950s, during which the city provided a general administrative and trades and crafts workforce helping to support the petrochemical complex in adjoining Texas City. It is the hometown of U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Norman Bulaich.

==History==
La Marque, also once known as Highlands and Buttermilk Junction, is an incorporated residential community on Interstate Highway 45, State Highway 3, and Farm Roads 519, 1765, and 2004, some 12 miles northwest of Galveston in northwestern Galveston County. The community was originally known as Highlands, probably for its location near Highland Creek, and was renamed in the 1890s when residents learned of another mainland community of the same name. Madam St. Ambrose, a French Catholic Ursuline Sister and postmistress, chose the new name, which in French means &quot;the mark&quot;.

The community&#x27;s post office operated from 1887 until the 1930s. During the Civil War, the town was known as Buttermilk Junction after the soldiers&#x27; practice of purchasing buttermilk there on the trip between Galveston and Houston. In 1867, the town had six families and its residents raised cattle or rice. The local population rose from 100 in 1890 to 175 in 1896, when the community had a Baptist church and several fruit growers. A school with 14 students existed before 1895, when Amos Stewart gave land for a larger facility. By 1909, two teachers served an enrollment of 55 students, and in 1913, further construction began.

By 1914, the community had been reached by four railroads: the International and Great Northern; the Galveston, Houston and Henderson; the Missouri, Kansas and Texas; and the Interurban. At that time, La Marque had both a railroad station and general store located in a private home. The town&#x27;s population reached 500 in 1914 and 1,500 by 1952, when it had 90 businesses. As it grew together with nearby Texas City, La Marque served as a residential community for employees at nearby industrial facilities (e.g., chemical plants and refineries) in the La Marque-Texas City area, as well as the Galveston Island Medical Center. The town had a population of 17,000 and 130 businesses in 1977. In 1988, it had 15,697 residents and 158 businesses, and in 1991, some 14,258 residents and 272 businesses.

In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including La Marque. This meant an influx of children from the Galveston Independent School District into other school districts.

La Marque operates under a councilâmanager form of government. In this system, the City Council sets policy and direction for the community, while a City Manager is appointed to oversee day-to-day operations and implement the Councilâs policies. Currently, the city is led by Interim City Manager J.B. Pritchett, who was appointed by the City Council to manage municipal operations and ensure that the cityâs services run smoothly. His role includes supervising city departments, managing the budget, and acting as the chief executive officer of the city government.
==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====
Most of the city is served by the Texas City Independent School District (TCISD). Small portions of La Marque are served by the Dickinson Independent School District, Hitchcock Independent School District, and Santa Fe Independent School District. Previously La Marque Independent School District (LMISD) served what became the TCISD area. On December 2, 2015, Texas Education Agency Commissioner Michael Williams announced that TCISD would absorb the former LMISD effective July 1, 2016.

La Marque High School continues to serve the former LMISD area. The respective schools for other parts are Dickinson High School, Hitchcock High School, and Santa Fe High School.

La Marque Independent School District was mismanaged for so long that it was finally dissolved, when it was assigned by the commissioner of education an accreditation status of &quot;Not Accredited-Revoked&quot;. By law, a school district that is closed must be annexed into an adjoining district. Accordingly, Texas City, Hitchcock, Dickinson, and Santa Fe school districts jointly absorbed the responsibility of educating La Marque students.

Before shutting down the school district, Commissioner of Education Michael Williams gave the La Marque schools ample opportunity and time for improvement. In 2011, the school district was judged &quot;academically unacceptable&quot;. Similarly, in 2013 and 2014, La Marque schools were given a rating of &quot;improvement required&quot;. Finally, an October 2015 review by the TEA found La Marque ISD&#x27;s rating at &quot;substandard achievement&quot;. This ultimately led to the revocation of the accreditation status. Critics of the school district point out that administrators failed to manage the tax funds properly, failed to hire and train competent instructors, and emphasized sports to the exclusion of academics.

===Colleges and universities===
The former La Marque district (as well as the Texas City district), Dickinson, Santa Fe, and Hitchcock school districts (and therefore all of La Marque) is served by the College of the Mainland.

===Public libraries===
The city owns the La Marque Public Library, which is located at 1101 Bayou Road.

==Transportation==
Greyhound Bus Lines operates the Texas City La Marque Station at McKown Air Conditioning in nearby Texas City.

==Parks and recreation==
The Galveston County Department of Parks and Senior Services operates the Wayne Johnson III Community Center at Carbide Park.

<text>San Leon is a census-designated place (CDP) in Galveston County, Texas, United States. The population was 6,135 at the 2020 census.

==History==
During the early 19th century, the pirate Jean Lafitte, who ruled Galveston Island, established a stronghold at Eagle Point in modern San Leon. Eagle Point went on to become an important shipping and trading post for slaves. A community was established, known as Edward&#x27;s Point and later North Galveston. When the North Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City Railroad was built through the area in 1893, the town began to develop as a commercial center. However, following the hurricanes in 1900 and 1915, the town was devastated and never able to fully recover. Attempts were made in the early 20th century to establish a resort community in the area, but these efforts met with only modest success. Growth and development since this time have been relatively stagnant.

The San Leon Municipal Utility District (MUD) was created by an Act of the 1965 Texas Legislature with all the powers of a Texas Conservation and Reclamation District, a Municipal Corporation and a Water Control and Improvement District (WCID).

In April 1985, residents of San Leon, Bacliff and Bayview considered an incorporation proposal to become the City of Bayshore. Judge Ray Holbrook signed an order for the election to take place on April 6, 1985, freeing the area, which had a population of 11,000, from the extraterritorial jurisdiction of League City and Texas City. Residents rejected the incorporation proposal. The vote was tallied with 1,268 against and 399 in favor. Proponents wanted a local police force and the ability to pass ordinances. Opponents said that the tax base was too small to support municipal services including police and road and drainage improvements.

San Leon was not in a 1986 proposal to incorporate that included Bacliff and Bayview. Donna Maples, vice president of the Bacliff - Bayview Community Association, said that historically, San Leon had generated most of the opposition to incorporation proposals. She said, &quot;In the past, San Leon has shown it is not interested in incorporation. So this time we decided not to include them. They don&#x27;t have as much in common as we do.&quot;

On April 23, 1991, the community, and other areas of Galveston County, received an enhanced 9-1-1 system which routes calls to proper dispatchers and allows dispatchers to automatically view the address of the caller. On September 13, 2008, San Leon, TX received extensive damage from Hurricane Ike.

In 2000, there were 4,365 people organized into 1,815 households. That year, Bacliff and San Leon formed a nine-member board to prepare the communities for incorporation. At that time, Bacliff and San Leon had a combined population of 10,000. The board was to have three members from the Bacliff area, three members from the San Leon area, and three at-large members. It was prompted after the City of Texas City suddenly annexed several commercial parcels along Texas State Highway 146 between Kemah and Dickinson Bayou in 2000. The board hoped to convince Texas City to reverse the annexation.

In 2012, the P.H. Robinson electric generation plant formerly operated by Texas Genco, located in the area, was demolished.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.61%, is covered by water.

The Bacliff, San Leon, and Bayview communities form the &quot;Bayshore&quot; area.

Shore erosion had affected San Leon. Avenue A was built along the north shore. By 1997, it was no longer contiguous because portions had been destroyed by erosion.

Effective August 15, 2019 Galveston County Commissioners Court approved revised Federal Emergency Management Agency flood plain maps which categorized the vast majority of San Leon as being at high risk from floods.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 6,135 people, 2,276 households, and 1,649 families residing in the CDP.

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, 4,970 people, 1,815 households, and 1,121 families resided in the CDP. The population density was . The 2,293 housing units averaged 469.7 per square mile (181.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 80.41% White, 0.80% African American, 0.82% Native American, 7.61% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, 8.27% from other races, and 1.97% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 14.36% of the population.

Of the 1,815 households, 25.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.6% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.2% were not families. About 30.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 2.99.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.0% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 28.5% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 110.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.8 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $31,687, and for a family was $40,656. Males had a median income of $32,574 versus $25,526 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $19,422. About 14.8% of families and 19.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.5% of those under age 18 and 2.3% of those age 65 or over.

As of 1986, the community is primarily residential. During weekends and summer, many people stayed in their cottages and small houses.

As of 2012, San Leon, Bayview, and Bacliff together make up the largest unincorporated community in the mainland portion of Galveston County by population. As of July 2019 the San Leon CDP included 2632 single family residences, 14 multi-family residences and 2116 vacant lots which provided a tax base of $369,924,758.

In 2008, Phale Cassady Le, an outreach coordinator of Boat People SOS Houston, said that in San Leon and Bacliff, between 150 and 200 Vietnamese families were involved with crab-, oyster-, and shrimp-fishing operations. According to Le, most of the Vietnamese have no house or boat insurance, and even if they did have this insurance, their English is not well developed enough to read the terms of the policies. Many families had hand-made boats that were constructed over several years as the owner made more and more money. Nick Cenegy of &quot;The Galveston County Daily News&quot; said that the Vietnamese community in San Leon and Bacliff had a &quot;tradition of self-reliance and wariness of outsiders.&quot;

In 2017 there were 4,890 people organized into 2,036 households.

==Economy==
The most significant sector of the community&#x27;s economy is oyster and shrimp fishing. Many homes in the community are second homes used as summer residences. Like Bacliff and Bayview, many residents in San Leon commute to work in Houston.

==Government==
San Leon CDP is located within Galveston County Precinct 1 and is represented in Galveston County Commissioners Court by the Honorable Darrell A. Apffel who was elected November 8, 2016.

<text>Santa Fe () is a city in Galveston County, Texas, United States. It is named for the Santa Fe Railroad (now part of BNSF Railway) which runs through the town alongside State Highway 6. The population of Santa Fe at the 2020 census was 12,735.

==History==
In 1877, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the western part of Galveston county. By the turn of the century, three small, unincorporated towns had formed along the railway: Alta Loma, Arcadia, and Algoa. The Santa Fe Independent School District which was named after the railway, was established shortly afterward to serve the area.

In the mid-1970s, the neighboring city of Hitchcock attempted to annex an area in eastern Alta Loma known as the Morningview neighborhood. Amid intense opposition to becoming part of Hitchcock, residents began a petitioning effort to incorporate the area into a new city. On January 21, 1978, a ballot proposal to incorporate Alta Loma and parts of Arcadia passed by a wide margin and the city of Santa Fe was born. Santa Fe has since grown to include all of Arcadia and parts of Algoa, and ironically is now twice the size of Hitchcock.

On February 14, 1981, the Ku Klux Klan hosted a fish fry on a private farm in Santa Fe to protest the growing presence of Vietnamese shrimpers in the Gulf. During the event, a Vietnamese fishing boat was ceremonially burned. The controversy and similar conflicts in nearby port towns like Rockport, led to a decision of the United States District Court, S.D. Texas, Houston Division &quot;Vietnamese Fishermen&#x27;s Association v. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, and also was the basis of the story for the 1985 Ed Harris film &quot;Alamo Bay&quot;.

On June 19, 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Santa Fe Independent School District&#x27;s policy of permitting &quot;student-led, student-initiated&quot; prayer at football games and other school events violated the Constitution&#x27;s prohibitions against the establishment of state religion.

On the morning of May 18, 2018, a school shooting occurred at Santa Fe High School when 17-year-old student Dimitrios Pagourtzis opened fire in an art classroom, killing ten students including Sabika Sheikh, 17 (an exchange student from Pakistan) and faculty and injuring thirteen others. Students and faculty evacuated the building when a fire alarm was activated. Pagourtzis surrendered after being injured in an exchange of gunfire with school officers. Originally scheduled to stand trial in January 2020 for ten counts of capital murder, Pagourtzis has been in custody at a state mental hospital since being found unfit to stand trial in November 2019.

<text>Post is a city in and the county seat of Garza County, Texas, United States. Its population was 4,790 at the 2020 census. According to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 3,486. The Triassic reptile &quot;Postosuchus&quot; is named after the city.

==History==
Post is located on the edge of the caprock escarpment of the Llano Estacado, the southeastern edge of the Great Plains. It is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes 84 and 380.

The land had been on John Bunyan Slaughter&#x27;s U Lazy S Ranch. In 1906 Slaughter sold it to C. W. Post, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, who founded &quot;Post City&quot; as a utopian colonizing venture in 1907. Post devised the community as a model town. He purchased of ranchland and established the Double U Company to manage the town&#x27;s construction. The company built trim houses and numerous structures including the Algerita Hotel, a gin, and a textile plant. They planted trees along every street and prohibited alcoholic beverages and brothels. The Double U Company rented and sold farms and houses to settlers. A post office began in a tent during the year of Post City&#x27;s founding, being established (with the name Post) July 18, 1907, with Frank L. Curtis as the first postmaster. Two years later, the town had a school, a bank, and a newspaper, the &quot;Post City Post&quot;, the same name as the daily in St. Louis, Missouri. The Garza County paper today is called the &quot;Post Dispatch&quot;âby coincidence, also the same as the current daily in St. Louis. The railroad reached the town in 1910. The town changed its name to &quot;Post&quot; when it was incorporated in 1914, the year of C. W. Post&#x27;s death. By then, Post had a population of 1000, 10 retail businesses, a dentist, a physician, a sanitarium, and Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches.

From 1910 to 1913, Post experimented with attempts at rainmaking. Explosives were detonated in the atmosphere at timed intervals. Precipitation records, however, showed that the efforts failed.

The C. W. Post estate pledged $75,000, and the town raised $35,000 in 1916 to bid unsuccessfully to become the site of the proposed West Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College.

Postex Cotton Mills began production in 1913 with 250 employees. When the Post interests sold the business in 1945 to Ely and Walker Dry Goods Company of St. Louis, the plant was producing six million yards of cloth a year and employed 375 workers, who manufactured Postex cotton sheets and Garza pillow cases. Ely and Walker sold Postex in 1955 to Burlington Industries, the world&#x27;s largest textile manufacturer at that time. By 1973, the company employed 450 persons. The mill has since closed.

Oilfield service companies have been important to the economy, as have farming and ranching. In 1989, Post had two libraries, a hospital, a nursing home, an airport, the &quot;Post Dispatch&quot; (founded 1926), and 90 businesses. The population reached 3,400 in 1928, declined to 2,000 in 1940, but increased to 3,100 during the 1950s. With the development of the local oil industry, the town&#x27;s population attained its highest level of 4,800 in 1964. The 1980 census showed a population of 3,864, but by 1988 the &quot;Texas Almanac&quot; reported 4,162. In 1990, the population was 3,768.

Many ranchers and civic boosters live in Garza County, among them Giles McCrary, a former mayor, who until his death in 2011 operated the OS Museum, a hybrid of exhibits from both the American West and Asia, which are changed three times per year. Two baseball fields in Post are named for former resident Norm Cash.

Fredericksburg was founded in 1846 and named after Prince Frederick of Prussia. Old-time German residents often referred to Fredericksburg as Fritztown, a nickname that is still used in some businesses. It is located 70 miles northwest of San Antonio, and approximately 80 miles west of Austin. This city is also notable as the home of Texas German, a dialect spoken by the first generations of German settlers who initially refused to learn English. Fredericksburg shares many cultural characteristics with New Braunfels, which had been established by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels the previous year. Fredericksburg is the birthplace of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz. It is the sister city of Montabaur, Germany. On October 14, 1970, the Fredericksburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in Texas.

Enchanted Rock offers 8.4 miles of hiking trails, camping, picnicking, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities. It is one of the largest batholiths (underground rock formation uncovered by erosion) in the United States, and was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1970. In 1994, the State of Texas opened it as Enchanted Rock State Natural Area after adding facilities. The same year, Enchanted Rock was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The first known record of Cross Mountain (elevation ) was in 1847 by Ferdinand von Roemer. Native Americans used the location to signal each other about intrusions into their territory. The area was part of settler John Christian Durst&#x27;s allotment. Durst found a timber cross on the mountain, indicating that Spanish missionaries had once used the site. Durst named the place &quot;Kreuzberg&quot; or Cross Mountain. In 1849, Father George Menzel erected a new cross. In 1946, St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church erected a metal and concrete cross. The mountain has been used both for the Easter Fires pageant and for Easter sunrise services. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 1976.

==Churches and religion==


==Nimitz Hotel and National Museum of the Pacific War==
==Railway==
On January 3, 1913, the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway was chartered to connect Fredericksburg with the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway near Waring. In 1913 a long railroad tunnel was built. The cost of the tunnel sent the railroad into receivership on October 28, 1914. It was sold under foreclosure on December 31, 1917, to Martin Carle who deeded the property to the Fredericksburg and Northern Railway, which had been chartered on December 26 of that year. The train operated until July 27, 1942. Since the shutdown of the railway the tunnel has become a bat cave, hosting over 3 million Mexican free-tailed bats. In 2012 it became Old Tunnel State Park, with provides picnic and restroom facilities for visitors.

==Agritourism==
The Fredericksburg-Stonewall area has become known as the Peach Capital of Texas and Benjamin Lester Enderle is known as the Father of the Hill Country Peach Industry. He was Gillespie County Surveyor and a math and science teacher at Fredericksburg High School when he planted five peach trees and began selling the fruit in 1921. Enderle worked to develop the Hale, Burbank, Elberta, and Stark varieties. He began marketing them through the H-E-B grocery chain, and eventually had 5,000 producing peach trees on . Growers claim the taste is due to the area having the right combination of elevation, sandy soil, and climate to produce flavorful clingstone and freestone peaches. The fruit ripens MayâAugust, and consumers can either buy picked fruit, or pick their own.

Herb farms, grape culture, lavender production, and wildflower seeds have become burgeoning businesses in Fredericksburg. Combinations of agribusiness with day spas, wedding facilities, or bed-and-breakfast accommodations are not unusual. Even a Texas Hill Country Lavender Trail has been designated.

Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s passion for Texas wildflowers not only lives on in the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, but also sparked a high demand for seed. The Wildseed Farms in Fredericksburg was founded by John R. Thomas in 1983 as a result of that high demand, and produces 88 varieties of wildflower seeds. It is the largest family-owned wildflower seed farm in the United States and host of an annual Wildflower Celebration.

==History==

===Spain===
In 1747, the Spanish government sent JosÃ© de EscandÃ³n to inspect the northern frontier of its North American colonies, including Spanish Texas. In his final report, EscandÃ³n recommended the Presidio La BahÃ­a be moved from its Guadalupe River location to the banks of the San Antonio River, so it could better assist settlements along the Rio Grande. Both the &quot;presidio&quot; and the mission that it protected, Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora del EspÃ­ritu Santo de ZÃºÃ±iga, moved to their new location sometime around October 1749. EscandÃ³n proposed that 25 families from New Spain be relocated near the presidio to form a civilian settlement, but he could not find enough willing settlers.

With the conclusion of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763, France ceded Louisiana and its Texas claims to Spain. With France no longer a threat to the Crown&#x27;s North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubi to inspect all of the &quot;presidios&quot; on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future. Rubi recommended that several presidios be closed and that La Bahia be kept and rebuilt in stone. La Bahia was soon &quot;the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River&quot;. The presidio was at the crossroads of several major trade and military routes. IIt quickly became one of Texas&#x27;s three most important areas, alongside BÃ©xar and Nacogdoches. A civil settlement, then known as &quot;La Bahia&quot;, soon developed near the presidio. By 1804, the settlement had one of only two schools in Texas.

In early August 1812, during the Mexican War of Independence, Mexican revolutionary Bernardo GutiÃ©rrez de Lara and his recruits, called the Republican Army of the North, invaded Texas. In November the invaders captured Presidio La Bahia. Texas governor Manuel MarÃ­a de Salcedo laid siege to the fort for the next four months. Unable to win a decisive victory, Salcedo lifted the siege on February 19, 1813, and turned toward San Antonio de Bexar. The rebels controlled the presidio until July or August 1813, when JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n de Arredondo led royalist troops in retaking all of Texas. Henry Perry, a member of the Republican Army of the North, led forces back to Texas in 1817 and attempted to recapture La Bahia. The Spanish reinforced the &quot;presidio&quot; with soldiers from San Antonio, and defeated Perry&#x27;s forces on June 18 near Coleto Creek.

The area was invaded again in 1821. The United States and Spain had signed the AdamsâOnÃ­s Treaty in 1819, which ceded all US territorial claims on the Texas area to Spain. On October 4, the Long Expedition (with 52 members) captured La Bahia. Four days later, Colonel Ignacio PÃ©rez arrived with troops from Bexar, and Long surrendered. By the end of 1821, Mexico had achieved its independence from Spain, and Texas became part of the newly created country.

===Mexico===
In 1829, the name of the Mexican Texas village of La BahÃ­a was changed to &quot;Goliad&quot;, believed to be an anagram of &quot;Hidalgo&quot; (omitting the silent initial &quot;H&quot;), in honor of the patriot priest Miguel Hidalgo, the father of the Mexican War of Independence.

On October 9, 1835, in the early days of the Texas Revolution, a group of Anglo-American immigrants attacked the &quot;presidio&quot; in the Battle of Goliad. The Mexican garrison quickly surrendered, leaving the Anglo-Americans in control of the fort. The first declaration of independence of the Republic of Texas was signed here on December 20, 1835 and immediately thereafter Nicholas Fagan raised the &quot;Bloody Arm Flag&quot; also known as the &quot;First Flag of Texas Independence&quot; over Presidio LaBahia. Anglo-Americans held the area until March 1836, when their garrison under Colonel James Fannin was defeated at the nearby Battle of Coleto. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, then President of Mexico, ordered that all survivors were to be executed. On Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, in what was later called the Goliad Massacre, 303 were marched out of the fort to be executed, and 39 were executed inside the &quot;presidio &quot;(20 prisoners were spared because they were either physicians or medical attendants); 342 men were killed and 28 escaped.

The famous Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza was born in Goliad in 1829. He commanded the forces resisting the French Army in the Battle of Puebla, now celebrated as &quot;Cinco de Mayo&quot; on May 5, 1862.

The Texas gunfighter King Fisher lived for a time in Goliad before moving to Eagle Pass in Maverick County, Texas.

===1902 tornado===

The 1902 Goliad tornado devastated the town, killing 114 people, including Sheriff Robert Shaw, and injuring at least 225. It is tied for the deadliest tornado in Texas history and the 10th-deadliest in the United States. Dr. Louis Warren Chilton, a young doctor whose wife was injured and whose daughter was lifted in the tornado funnel but survived, set up a temporary hospital and morgue in the courthouse. The Dr. L.W. and Martha E.S. Chilton House was built starting in June and included an underground shelter.

<text>Gonzales is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, with a population of 7,165 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Gonzales County. The &quot;Come and Take It&quot; incident, the ride of the Immortal 32 into the Alamo, and the Runaway Scrape after the fall of the Alamo, all integral events in the War for Texas Independence from Mexico, originated in Gonzales.

Its cattle and poultry economy is enhanced by oilfield services and light manufacturing enterprises, a short rail connection to a major Union-Pacific rail line, and lodging oil field workers from the nearby Eagle Ford Shale. It is the site of the Battle of Gonzales, the first battle of the Texas Revolution.

==History==
Gonzales is one of the earliest Anglo-American settlements in Texas, the first west of the Colorado River. It was established by Empresario Green DeWitt as the capital of his colony in August 1825. DeWitt named the community for Rafael GonzÃ¡les, governor of Coahuila y Tejas. Informally, the community was known as the DeWitt Colony.

The original settlement (located where Highway 90-A crosses Kerr Creek) was abandoned in 1826 after two Indian attacks. It was rebuilt nearby in 1827. The town remains today as it was originally surveyed.

Gonzales is referred to as the &quot;Lexington of Texas&quot; because it was the site of the first skirmish of the Texas Revolution. In 1831, the Mexican government had granted Green DeWitt&#x27;s request for a small cannon for protection against Indian attacks. At the outbreak of disputes between the Anglo settlers and the Mexican authorities in 1835, a contingent of more than 100 Mexican soldiers was sent from San Antonio to retrieve the cannon.

When the soldiers arrived, only 18 men were in Gonzales, but they refused to return the cannon, and men from the surrounding area soon joined them. Texians under the command of John Henry Moore confronted them. Sarah DeWitt and her daughter sewed a flag bearing the likeness of the cannon and the words &quot;Come and Take It&quot;, which was flown when the first shots of Texian independence were fired on October 2, 1835. The Texians successfully resisted the Mexican troops in what became known as the Battle of Gonzales.

Gonzales later contributed 32 men from the Gonzales Ranging Company to the defense of the Alamo. It was the only city to send aid to the Alamo, and all 32 men lost their lives defending the site. Susanna Dickinson, widow of one of the Alamo defenders, and Joe, the slave of William B. Travis, fled to Gonzales with news of the Alamo massacre. General Sam Houston was there organizing the Texas forces. He anticipated the town would be the next target of General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna&#x27;s Mexican army. Gathering the Texians at Peach Creek east of town, under the Sam Houston Oak, Houston ordered Gonzales burned, to deny it to the enemy. He began a retreat toward the U.S. border. The widows and orphans of Gonzales and their neighbors were forced to flee, thus precipitating the Runaway Scrape.

The town was derelict immediately after the Texas Revolution, but was eventually rebuilt on the original site in the early 1840s. By 1850, the town had a population of 300. The population rose to 1,703 by time of the 1860 census, 2,900 by the mid-1880s, and 4,297 in 1900. Part of the growth of the late 19th century can be attributed to the arrival of various immigrants, among them Jews, many of whom became peddlers and merchants.

==Arts and culture==
===Historic monuments and buildings===
The site of the Battle of Gonzales, in the village of Cost, off Highway 97, is marked by a handsome stone and bronze monument commissioned by the State of Texas in 1910. The Gonzales Memorial Museum, built and dedicated by the State of Texas as part of the state&#x27;s 1936 Centennial celebrations, houses the &quot;Come and Take It&quot; cannon and memorializes Gonzales&#x27;s Old Eighteen and the Immortal 32. The monument at Texas Heroes Square is the work of the Italian-born San Antonio artist Pompeo Coppini, Texas&#x27; leading sculptor in his day.

The Gonzales County Courthouse (1896), on the National Register of Historic Places, is by the master of Texas courthouses, James Riely Gordon. Winning a country-wide competition for the Bexar County Courthouse in San Antonio launched Gordon&#x27;s career, as the first of 72 courthouses, 18 of them in Texas (with 12 remaining in this state). J. Riely Gordon was also a master of the Romanesque Revival style, hugely popular in the 1890s, and seen here with good effect.

===Historic houses===
Gonzales has an exceptionally high concentration of historic houses and buildings.

In 2012, &quot;This Old House&quot; named Gonzales as one of the Best Old House Neighborhoods, noting its well-preserved downtown, its large stock of affordable and fixer-upper fine houses in Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, Italianate, and Greek Revival styles, as well as the town&#x27;s low cost of living and convenience to the big cities of Austin, San Antonio, and Houston.

The oldest dwellings in Gonzales date to the mid-19th century, but most of the architecturally notable houses were constructed beginning in the late Victorian period, from about 1880 to about 1915. Queen Anne style houses are the most common, with Colonial Revival and Classical Revival houses as well. J. Riely Gordon and Atlee B. Ayers were among the renowned architects active here. Many of the most notable homes, built for the important families of Gonzales, were erected along St. Louis St. and St. Lawrence St. Those two roads edge, to the south and north, a long stretch of public land one block wide running from the historic downtown commercial center and courthouse all the way to Kerr Creek to the east.

==Education==
During the 19th century, the town was a center for higher education in Texas. Construction of Gonzales College began in 1851, and it opened in 1853, with 50 students. An 1855 addition for the men&#x27;s program was torn down during the Civil War; the materials were used to build Fort Waul, just to the north of the town. By 1857, the school granted bachelor of arts degrees to females, making it one of the earliest colleges in Texas to do so. The college was purchased in 1891, and its building converted into a private residence by W.M. Atkinson.

The city of Gonzales is served by the Gonzales Independent School District and is home to the Gonzales High School Apaches. According to the University Interscholastic League of Texas, the Gonzales Apaches football team is in the 4A-1 Region IV District 15; Division: 4A-1.

The city of Gonzales also is home to the Gonzales Center, a branch of the Victoria College which is located in Victoria, Texas.

<text>Lefors ( ) is a town in Gray County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Pampa, Texas micropolitan statistical area. Its population was 420 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area around modern Lefors was near the heart of Comancheria and a common village site for the nomadic tribes of Comanche.

Randolph Marcy&#x27;s 1852 expedition passed this way. The Battle of the North Fork of the Red River, between the U.S. Army under the command of Ranald Slidell Mackenzie and the Comanche, was fought near here on September 29, 1872. Cheyenne chief Grey Beard&#x27;s band was attacked near here in 1874 by the U.S. Army.

Lefors was founded in 1888 by Travis Leach, Perry LeFors, Henry Thut, and Henry B. Lovett. The town was named for Perry LeFors, who traveled with his father to the Panhandle in 1878 and later became foreman of the Diamond F Ranch, a part of the Francklyn Land and Cattle Company, which became insolvent in 1886 and became the White Deer Lands Trust Company, of which Timothy Dwight Hobart was the agent.

In 1882, the first homestead on the future townsite was laid by Travis Leach, a rancher and surveyor, whose log cabin served as a stagecoach stop on the mail route from Fort Elliott and Mobeetie to Tascosa. Henry B. Lovett, a former buffalo hunter, and Henry Thut, a Swiss immigrant whose sister-in-law, Emma Lang, married LeFors, also settled in the vicinity during the 1880s. George Henry Saunders had a ranch camp headquarters nearby.

Other settlers soon moved into the area, and in 1892, a post office was opened at Lefors with Thut as postmaster. (Postal officials required that the F be lower-cased.) Four years later, a combination school and church building was built. When Gray County was organized on May 27, 1902, Lefors was named the county seat. A two-story frame courthouse was built for less than $2,500, and Thut, who became the first county treasurer, erected a hotel. Perry LeFors served as the town&#x27;s first constable. The population reached 150 in 1910, and despite its small size and the lack of a railroad, the town managed for a time to remain the county seat.

When the oil boom hit the county during the 1920s, three oil pools were discovered in the vicinity. Lefors profited from the boom, especially in real estate; the boom resulted in the establishment of an independent school district and the bringing of electricity and other modern utilities to the town.

By 1931, Lefors had incorporated, and in 1932, the town finally obtained a railroad, when the Fort Worth and Denver extended its line from Pampa. The population increased to 809 by 1940. Several Protestant denominations established churches in the community.

Eight people died when an early spring snowstorm stranded about 100 people in around 55 automobiles on the road between Pampa and Lefors on April 7â8, 1938. After between 10 and 12 inches of snow fell in the Panhandle, with 50-mile-an-hour winds creating drifts 5-25 tall, men with farm tractors and heavy oilfield equipment had to come to the rescue of the snowed-in travelers, which included two school buses rescued by the army.

The town suffered a flood in 1961, unemployment from the closure of several area carbon black plants in 1964, and a tornado in 1975.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Lefors is on the North Fork of the Red River and State Highway 273, 12 miles southeast of Pampa in central Gray County.

Of the 231 households, 32.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.0% were married couples living together, 6.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were not families. About 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the town was $47,833, and for a family was $38,594. Males had a median income of $28,611 versus $21,071 for females. The per capita income for the town was $13,165. About 8.3% of families and 9.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.7% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
The Town of Lefors is served by the Lefors Independent School District. The school serves all children prekindergarten through grade 12. A school bond was passed to renovate the auditorium and old gymnasium. Two previous bonds were passed to renovate the secondary building and the track. The Lefors Pirates and the Lefors Bandits, the middle school team, play six-man football on the newly refurbished grounds during the fall. Lefors ISD offers football, tennis, golf, basketball, cross country, and track and field through its athletic department, as well as academic UIL.

The school is in the process of bringing more technology to the students, and has recently reached a one-to-one ratio of students to laptops in the secondary building. The elementary-school children also have access to tablets.

Lefors ISD typically enrolls about 170 students per school year, with many of them transfer students from Pampa.

<text>McLean is a town in Gray County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Pampa micropolitan statistical area. Its population was 665 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
McLean is located in southeastern Gray County. Interstate 40 passes through the southern part of the town, leading east to Oklahoma City and west to Amarillo. Interstate 40 Business (Old U.S. 66) passes through the town as First Street (westbound) and Railroad Street (eastbound), connecting to I-40 at Exit 141 west of town and Exit 143 to the east. Texas State Highway 273 runs along the western edge of McLean, accessing I-40 at Exit 142 and running north then northwest to Pampa, the Gray County seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, McLean has a total area of , all land.

==History==

In 1901, Alfred Rowe, an English rancher who later perished in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, donated land near a railroad cattle-loading stop for the establishment of a town site. The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Texas Railroad Company constructed a water well and a switch and section house there. The town was named for Judge William P. McLean (1836â1925) of the Texas Legislature and Railroad Commission. The town grew rapidly. By 1904, McLean had three general stores, a bank, two wagon yards and livery stables, a lumber yard, and a newspaper, the &quot;McLean News&quot;. A windmill pumped water from a well drilled in the middle of Main Street, and citizens hauled the water in barrels and buckets. The town was incorporated in 1909, with C. S. Rice as mayor, and became a center for agriculture.

In 1927, the Mother Road, U.S. Route 66, was built through the town, and it became a stop for tourists and a center for oil, livestock, and agriculture processing and shipping. By 1940, the population had risen to 1,500 with six churches, 59 businesses, and a newspaper. In 1942, a prisoner-of-war camp was built east-northeast of the town, and was operated until 1945, housing about 3,000 German prisoners.

As the prominence of other Texas Panhandle cities, especially Amarillo and Pampa, surpassed McLean, the town began to decrease slowly in size. In 1984, the town was bypassed as part of the final phase of construction of Interstate 40, which replaced the old U.S. Route 66 through that area.

==Demographics==

==Public library==
The Lovett Memorial Library was established August 9, 1940, in the City Hall of McLean. The city council voted to give $10.00 a month to help finance the new library, and appointed a library board to be the governing body. Mrs. Lady Bryant was hired to open the library from 12:00 noon until 5:00 pm daily (closed on Sundays). Since 1940, the library has seen some changes. The current location of 302 N. Main Street in McLean now houses five public-access computers, Wi-Fi access, fax, copying, printing, movies, audio books, and a selection of large-print, fiction, mystery, Western and nonfiction titles.

<text>Pampa (from the Quechua: &quot;pampa&quot;, meaning &quot;plain&quot;) is a city in Gray County, Texas, United States. Its population was 16,867 as of the 2020 census. Pampa is the county seat of Gray County and is the principal city of the Pampa micropolitan statistical area, which includes both Gray and Roberts Counties. Pampa is named after the Pampas Lowlands in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil.

Pampa hosts the Top o&#x27; Texas Rodeo each year in July, which brings competitors from Texas and the surrounding states to Gray County. The White Deer Land Company Museum, which showcases ranching exhibits, is located in downtown Pampa.

==History==
In 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad was constructed through the area where Pampa would be established. A rail station and telegraph office were built, and the townsite was laid out by George Tyng, manager of the White Deer Lands ranch. The town was first called &quot;Glasgow&quot;, then &quot;Sutton&quot;, and then the name was changed to &quot;Pampa&quot; after the &quot;pampas&quot; grasslands of South America at Mr. Tyng&#x27;s suggestion. Timothy Dwight Hobart, a native of Vermont, sold plots of land for the town only to people who agreed to settle there and develop the land, and Pampa soon became a center for agriculture. Gas and oil were discovered in the Texas Panhandle in 1916. Pampa prospered greatly in the resulting oil boom, and the Gray County seat of government was moved in 1928 from Lefors to Pampa.

The Army Air Forces Training Command operated the Pampa Army Air Field that was in operation from 1942 to 1945. The former base is located near the intersection of SH 152 and FM 1474, about 10 miles east of the town.

==Library==

The Lovett Memorial Library was built on the entire west half of the 100 block of North Houston Street. The building was dedicated on January 18, 1955. In 1985, the Harrington Foundation of Amarillo paid for the computerization of library records, joining the library for the first time into a consortium with most of the public libraries in the Panhandle. By the mid-1990s, Lovett Library was showing its age, and not compliant with the Americans for Disabilities Act. In October 1995, it was announced that Mrs. Ruth Ann Holland has left $500,000 to the Library Foundation in her will.

In 1996, the Lovett Library Foundation, which managed the Holland bequest and several other substantial bequests, announced that a plan was being made to extensive renovate the old building. In January 1998, the library staff, along with all books and much equipment, moved from the Houston Street facility to the old B. M. Baker school on the south side, where the library was set up in the cafeteria and classroom annex in the south part of the school complex.

This freed the old building on Houston Street for renovation. The children&#x27;s area was moved to the second floor; a bridge was built between the second floor facility and other children&#x27;s rooms in the south part of the building; an elevator was installed; new shelves, lighting, and ceiling tiles were installed; and the building was made completely ADA compliant.

In June 2003, it was announced that R. L. Franklin, prominent rancher of Pampa, would donate two statues to the library to honor the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building in January 1955. One statue, by Don Ray of Channing, represents a seated woman reading to a child; this is erected in front of the library. Another statue representing a Pioneer Woman was by David Frech of New York was placed in the library&#x27;s Reading Garden. Both statues were dedicated to four local women, including the donor&#x27;s mother, each of whom had a long involvement with the library. The statues were dedicated on January 9, 2005, and at one of the dedicatory events, author Elmer Kelton was the guest speaker.

<text>Denison is a city in Grayson County, Texas, United States, south of the TexasâOklahoma border. Its population was 24,479 at the 2020 census, up from 22,682 at the 2010 census. Denison is part of the Texoma region and is one of two principal cities in the ShermanâDenison metropolitan statistical area. Denison is the birthplace of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==History==
Denison was founded in 1872 in conjunction with the MissouriâKansasâTexas Railroad (MKT) or &quot;Katy&quot; depot. It was named after wealthy Katy vice president George Denison. Because the town was established close to where the MKT crossed the Red River (both important conduits of transportation in the industrial era), it came to be an important commercial center in the 19th-century American West. In 1875, Doc Holliday had offices in Denison.

During the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century, which destroyed the vast majority of wine grapes in Europe, Denison horticulturalist T.V. Munson pioneered methods in creating phylloxera-resistant vines, and earned induction into the French Legion of Honor, as well as sister city status for Denison and Cognac, France.

In 1901, the first electric &quot;Interurban&quot; railway in Texas, the Denison and Sherman Railway, was completed between Denison and Sherman.

In 1915, Kentucky-based evangelist Mordecai Ham held a revival meeting in Denison, which resulted in 1,100 professions of faith in Jesus Christ.

Denison played host to 20th-century notables such as the Marx Brothers and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was born on October 14, 1890, in Denison.

<text>Gunter is a city in the southwestern corner of Grayson County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,060 at the 2020 census, up from 1,498 at the 2010 census. It is part of the ShermanâDenison metropolitan area.

==History==

Gunter was founded in 1902 (other sources report 1901, with a post office as early as 1898) when the family of John (a/k/a Jot) Gunter deeded for the original townsite, near the intersection of current State Highway 289 and Farm to Market Road 121. The first residence was established in 1903 by Albert Earthman, who would later charter the First National Bank in Gunter. A second bank, the First State Bank, would later open.

Gunter steadily grew until 1924, when the First State Bank (having outlasted the First National Bank) closed, leaving many businesses and farmers in financial ruin. The Great Depression and two devastating fires in 1930 and 1948 further damaged the local economy.

Gunter began to increase its population in the 1950s, and experienced its greatest growth, at 37 percent, during the 1990s. Gunter has started to experience overflow growth from the northern Metroplex suburbs, due to its location on State Highway 289 approximately north of Celina, as well as its proximity to the Sherman-Denison metropolitan area and nearby Lake Texoma. In May 2002, a branch of Ada, Oklahoma-based Landmark Bank (now part of Simmons Bank) opened in Gunter, providing the town its first financial institution in nearly 90 years.

==Geography==

Gunter is located in southwestern Grayson County. State Highway 289 leads north to Sherman, the county seat, and south to Celina.

The city&#x27;s boundaries expanded between 2000 and 2010. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , all land, in 2000, which had increased to in 2010, of which were land and , or 0.63%, were water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Gunter has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,060 people, 495 households, and 413 families residing in the city.

==Government==
Gunter is led by a six-person City Council, consisting of the Mayor and five members, all of which are elected at-large.

On December 12, 2023, all five of the at-large members resigned from their positions (and failed to appear at a scheduled City Council meeting the following night), leaving the Mayor as the only remaining member.

==Education==
Students are served by the Gunter Independent School District.

<text>Howe is a town in Grayson County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,571 in the 2020 U.S. Census. It is part of the ShermanâDenison metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The first settlers in the area arrived around the time of the Texas Revolution in 1836. In 1843, the last Indian battle in Grayson County was said to have been fought in the area. The first settlers of Howe were Jabez and Harriet Haning, and Jabez&#x27;s brother John. They received land through the Peters colony after their arrival from Pennsylvania before 1850. The Houston and Texas Central Railway built through the area in 1873, and a railroad switch was located in the community. It was called &quot;Summit&quot; because at above sea level, it was supposed to be the highest point between the Red River and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1873, when Summit received a post office, two businesses were located at the switchâa general store and a saloon. Several houses were built to the east of the switch. Jabez Haning persuaded the railroad to establish a depot on his land by donating every second lot in his newly platted town to the railroad. The names of the depot, the store, and the post office were changed in 1876 to &quot;Howe&quot;, after F. M. Howe, who worked for the Houston and Texas Central. Howe had three saloons until around 1900, when the town voted to go dry. Its first one-room school building opened in 1877 and was replaced by a two-story building in 1884.

In 1884, Howe was incorporated, with George M. McCrary as mayor. By the late 1880s, the town had become a major grain shipping center and was the home of red rust-proof oats. A number of seed companies had their beginnings there in that decade. Howe became home to a Farmers&#x27; Alliance Cooperative Association, which was absorbed by the Howe Grain and Mercantile Company in 1894. In 1890, Howe had a population of 450, a steam gristmill, a Farmers&#x27; Alliance Cooperative, and Baptist and Methodist churches, as well as a number of hotels, doctors, druggists, and barbers. Several newspapers were published in Howe, such as the &quot;Howe Herald&quot; from 1890 to the 1910s and the &quot;Howe Messenger&quot; in the late 1930s and early &#x27;40s. During the 1930s, the &quot;Howe Chronicle&quot; was published by former Governor James E. Ferguson and his brother A. M. Ferguson. The &quot;Howe Enterprise&quot; was established in 1963 by A.P. &quot;Pop&quot; Sloan.

On May 15, 1896, an F5 category tornado passed through the west side of Howe and the Farmington community, sweeping away around 17 homes. On October 6, 1904, &quot;The Arlington Journal&quot; reported a fire through Howe&#x27;s business district and named four stores it destroyed.

By 1914, the Texas Traction Company, better known as the Interurban, was providing service to Howe. This electric train ran between Denison and Dallas with a stop in Howe. By 1914, Howe also had the Farmers National Bank, the &quot;Howe Herald&quot;, three grain elevators, and an ice plant. The community&#x27;s population had grown from 521 in 1904 to 680 in the early 1960s. After then, it rose rapidly through the early 1980s, reaching 2,173 by 1990. By 2000, the population was 2,478. 
Throughout most of its history, Howe remained primarily an agricultural center, but some oil has been produced in the area. During the early 1980s, Howe reported some 30 businesses. In 1981, local industries included a shirt manufacturer and a hydraulics company, and by 1991, the number of manufacturers in Howe had risen to five, including makers of plastics, electronics, and agricultural equipment.

On April 26, 2016, an EF1 category tornado struck Howe around 10:00 pm, injuring three people, damaging over 20 homes, and even damaging the Howe High School. It started in a field behind the Summit Hill housing division, where a home was destroyed off Smith Road, then it proceeded northeast and crossed US Hwy 75, where trucker Gene Marshall was filming it; the storm tossed his truck and semitrailer to the other side of the road along with three cars. It then hit the north side of the high school before going directly through Stark Lane. It then proceeded to the Luella/Ida area before it dissipated.

==Geography==

Howe is located in southern Grayson County at the intersection of U.S. Highway 75, Texas State Highway 5, and Farm to Market Road 902, and it is bordered to the north by Sherman, the county seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Howe&#x27;s elevation of is the highest point along US 75 between the Red River and the Gulf of Mexico.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,571 people, 1,069 households, and 775 families residing in the town.

==Traditions==

===Founders Day===

Howe celebrates its history and origins every May with a Founders Day celebration. The first Founders Day in 1986 featured a professional rodeo along with many festival events. Each year, vendors line up in the downtown parking spaces with items for sale. The festival features food, shaved ice, bounce houses, and the like. It is a product of the Howe Area Chamber of Commerce. The city celebrated the 30th anniversary of Founders Day in on May 7, 2016, with live music most of the evening.

<text>Pottsboro is a town in Grayson County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,488 at the 2020 census, up from 2,160 at the 2010 census. It is part of the ShermanâDenison metropolitan statistical area.

==Geography==
Pottsboro is located in northern Grayson County. Texas State Highway 289 passes through the western side of the town, leading south to Southmayd and north 10 miles to a dead end at Preston on Lake Texoma. Denison is east of Pottsboro via Farm to Market Road 120, and Sherman, the county seat, is to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Pottsboro has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Judge James G. Thompson and Mr. James Archer Potts both owned large ranches at the future site of Pottsboro, before its inception.

Pottsboro was established in 1876 by James A. Potts, a pioneer settler who donated land for a town and a right-of-way so the MissouriâKansasâTexas Railroad would extend its tracks westward from Denison to his settlement. The community, no doubt aided by its status as a stop on the railroad, grew rapidly for the rest of the 1800s. It incorporated in 1880 with the name &quot;Pottsborough&quot;, and by 1885, its population had reached 200 and it supported a cotton gin, several gristmills, and a number of churches. Pottsboro suffered devastating fires that destroyed a great deal of the business section of the town: 1890, 1902, 1923, and 1924. Father-in-law of J.A. Potts, Judge James G. Thompson, applied for a post office in 1891, when they responded, the &quot;ugh&quot; was dropped from the name by the federal government, and the town&#x27;s name finally became &quot;Pottsboro&quot;. A post office opened there in 1891.

The population reached 454 in 1920 and 500 in 1925. By that time, the community was served by some 25 businesses, including a bank, and by two schools with a combined enrollment of 300 students. Pottsboro declined to a population of 358 by 1936 and 312 by the mid-1940s. It then grew to 383 by 1957. The number of businesses had fallen to 12 by 1948, though by the late 1950s, it was back up to more than 20. The town began to grow again during the 1950s, perhaps spurred by the rapid expansion of nearby Denison. By 1967, Pottsboro reported 30 businesses and a population of 750, and by 1990, its population was 1,177. The population grew to 1,579 in 2000.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,488 people, 902 households, and 598 families residing in the town.

==Climate==
Pottsboro is part of a humid subtropical climate region.

==Education==
The town is served by the Pottsboro Independent School District.

<text>Sherman is a city in and the county seat of Grayson County, Texas, United States. The city&#x27;s population in 2020 was 43,645. It is one of the two principal cities in the ShermanâDenison metropolitan statistical area, and is the largest city in the Texoma region of North Texas and southern Oklahoma.

==History==

Sherman was named after General Sidney Sherman (July 23, 1805 â August 1, 1873), a hero of the Texas Revolution. The community was designated as the county seat by the act of the Texas Legislature, which created Grayson County on March 17, 1846. In 1847, a post office began operation. Sherman was originally located at the center of the county, but in 1848, it was moved about east to its current location. By 1850, Sherman had become an incorporated town under Texas law. It had also become a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail route through Texas. By 1852, Sherman had a population of 300 and consisted of a public square with a log court house, several businesses, a district clerk&#x27;s office, and a church along the east side of the square. In 1861, the first flour mill was built.

During the 1850s and 1860s, Sherman continued to develop and to participate in regional politics. Because many residents of North Texas had migrated from the Upper South and only a low percentage were slaveholders, considerable Unionist sentiment existed in the region. E. Junius Foster, the publisher of Sherman&#x27;s antisecessionist Whig newspaper, the &quot;Patriot&quot;, circulated a petition to establish North Texas as an independent free state. Following Confederate passage of a conscription law, resistance arose to conscription in North Texas, especially as owners of many slaves were exempt.

Late in the Civil War, pro-Confederate guerrillas led by William Quantrill spent the winter of 1863-1864 in North Texas, with a camp in Sherman and two others in nearby Kentuckytown to the south and Fink to the north. Former guerrilla Jesse James also came to Sherman for his honeymoon. He was photographed seated on his horse in Sherman.

During the 1860s, secondary education developed in North Texas. The Sherman Male and Female High School began accepting students in 1866, under the patronage of the North Texas Methodist Conference. It became one of three private schools operating in Sherman. The school operated under several names, including the North Texas Female College and Conservatory of Music from 1892 to 1919 and Kidd-Key College and Conservatory, from 1919 to 1935. It gradually lost Methodist support, following the opening of Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1915. In 1876, Austin College, the oldest continuously operating college in Texas, was relocated to Sherman from Huntsville. The Sherman Female Institute, later called Mary Nash College, opened in 1877 under sponsorship of the Baptist Church. It continued to operate until 1901, when the campus was sold to Kidd-Key College. CarrâBurdette College, a women&#x27;s college affiliated with the Disciples of Christ, operated from 1894 to 1929. Sherman also has a long history within the Jewish community. By 1873, Jews in the region regularly met for the High Holidays.

While general depression and lawlessness occurred during the Reconstruction, Sherman remained commercially active. During the 1870s, Sherman&#x27;s population reached 6,000. In 1875, after two fires destroyed many buildings east of the town square, a number of civic buildings were rebuilt using more permanent materials. This included a new Grayson County Courthouse built in 1876. In 1879, the Old Settlers&#x27; Association of North Texas formed and met near Sherman. The organization incorporated in 1898 and purchased Old Settlers&#x27; Park in 1909.

On May 15, 1896, a tornado measuring F5 on the Fujita scale struck Sherman. The tornado had a damage path wide and long, killing 73 people and injuring 200. About 50 homes were destroyed, with 20 of them obliterated.

In 1901, the first electric &quot;Interurban&quot; railway in Texas, the Denison and Sherman Railway, was completed between Sherman and Denison. The Texas Traction Company completed a interurban between Sherman and Dallas in 1908, and in 1911 purchased the Denison and Sherman Railway. Through the connections in Dallas and Denison, travel to the Texas destinations of Terrell, Corsicana, Waco, Fort Worth, Cleburne, and Denton, became possible, as well as to Durant, Oklahoma, by interurban railways. One popular destination on the Interurban between Sherman and Denison was Wood Lake Park, a private amusement park at the time. By 1948, all interurban rail service in Texas had been discontinued.

===Sherman Riot of 1930===

During the Sherman Riot of May 9, 1930, the Grayson County Courthouse was burned down by local citizens in an attempt to lynch George Hughes, an African American suspected of assaulting a white woman. During the riot, Hughes was locked in the vault at the courthouse and apparently died in the fire. Rescue work was hindered by saboteurs cutting the fire hoses. After rioters retrieved Hughes&#x27; body from the vault, it was dragged behind a car, hanged, and set afire. The black business section of Sherman was also burned down, and many African Americans fled. Texas Ranger Frank Hamer was in Sherman during this riot, and reported the situation to Texas Governor Dan Moody. Governor Moody sent National Guard troops to Sherman on May 9 and martial law was declared in Sherman for ten days. Fourteen men were later indicted, not for lynching, but for arson and rioting. In the end, only J.B. &quot;Screw&quot; McCasland was convicted and sentenced to prison for arson and for rioting.

<text>Tom Bean is a city in Grayson County, Texas, United States. The population was 930 at the 2020 census, down from 1,045 at the 2010 census.

Tom Bean is part of the ShermanâDenison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

On October 27, 1888, Tom Bean was founded on what was then a new branch of the Cotton Belt Railway between Commerce and Sherman, Texas. 

The town was named by J.W. Pennell in honor of his friend Thomas C. Bean, who was a wealthy, eccentric land surveyor and donor of the land upon which the town was built. Bean, a bachelor who lived in Bonham, Fannin County, Texas owned a section of land at what ultimately became the town, and as an inducement for the railroad to build through that area, he donated land for the railroad right of way,and later 50 acres of land to be used for the townsite. 

Bean died in 1887; the year the city of Tom Bean was informally established. Nearby Whitemound, which was bypassed by the railroad, lost its post office to Tom Bean in 1888; many Whitemound settlers subsequently vacated and moved to the new town where they established homes and businesses. 

Mr. Bean&#x27;s estate began to sell town lots surrounding the railroad in the 1890s. The city school was moved in 1891 from a one-room structure to a two-story building with an auditorium. Several Christian denominations, including the Church of Christ (1890), Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist, established churches in town. 

J.B. Hindman was the first railroad agent, and a boxcar served as the first temporary depot until a more permanent one could be erected in February 1888.The original business district ran parallel to the railroad, but in 1906, three brick buildings were erected one block south of the railroad. 

News from the time indicates that Tom Bean first voted to incorporate sometime in mid 1891. W.W.Arnold was elected as Tom Bean&#x27;s first Mayor in 1893, and H.A.Sroufe was its first City Marshal. A city charter was signed in 1897, and the first mayor elected thereafter was Ice B. Reeves.

In the early days of the 20th century, the city boomed. Within a few years, it boasted a grain company, a furniture company, a drugstore, a newspaper called the &quot;Tom Bean Bulletin&quot;, a saloon, a dance hall, a movie theater, a justice court, a jail, and the Tom Bean social club. 

As time progressed, the sharp increase in automobile travel and transport, and the decline of cotton as the principal crop of the area, led businesses to the larger cities of Denison and Sherman, the county seat.

Though never again the railroad boomtown of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the community enjoyed a growth spurt in the 1950s and 1980s, celebrating its centennial in 1987.

Current growth is due to its proximity to nearby Sherman, to the northwest.

<text>Whitesboro is a city in Grayson County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,074 at the 2020 census. Whitesboro is named for its founder, Ambrose B. White.

It is part of the Sherman-Denison metropolitan area.

==History==
Native Americans had hunted in the area. 

The area was once known as &quot;Wolfpath&quot;. The first settler in the area was Robert Diamond, but the settlement of Wolfpath began with the arrival of Ambrose B. White and his family in 1848. The Butterfield Overland Mail route used White&#x27;s Westview Inn as the &quot;Diamond Station&quot; on its trail from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Coast from 1858 to 1861. A post office, under the name &quot;Whitesborough&quot;, began operations there in 1860.

After the Civil War, Whitesborough grew into a frontier town where female residents were prohibited from leaving their homes on Saturday nights because shootings were so common. Whitesborough had a population of 500, saloons, several stores, and other businesses when it was incorporated on June 2, 1873. By 1879, it had a bank, a newspaper, and train service from Denison on a line from the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad. In 1887, it altered the spelling of its name to &quot;Whitesboro&quot;.

In 1903, racial tensions were high in Whitesboro after an &quot;Anti-White Man&#x27;s Club&quot; left a note threatening to poison local wells and &quot;foully treat&quot; and murder &quot;some white girl&quot;. Later that year, a black male was held by police for identification following an alleged attempted rape of a white Whitesboro woman. A large mob broke into the man&#x27;s cell and attempted to hang him from a tree; he was rescued by police. The mob then fired guns toward homes occupied by blacks, and ordered them to leave town, resulting in the large exodus of a once majority black town.

It was suspected that threats made from the &quot;Anti-White man&#x27;s club&quot; were fabricated notes from white residents of Whitesboro created in order to create fake hysteria and further racial tensions.

Whitesboro is believed to have once been a sundown town, meaning only white people were allowed in after dark, and black people found after dark were murdered.

<text>White Oak is a city in Gregg County, Texas, United States. It was incorporated in 1960. The population was 6,225 as of 2020.

==History==
In the later parts of the 1800s, White Oak was a small farming community with three sawmills located on thick forested land. By 1884, there were roughly 15 families living in the area. Most sought to either work at the large sawmills dominating the area or farm the land near the creaks and rivers. A small school was built near Hawkins Creek which would also be utilized as a church on sundays. The school burned to the ground in 1885 due to suspected arson, though no one was ever brought to trial.

A new school was established in 1887. Local land owners, Andrew J. Tuttle and his father-in-law, John Bumpus, gathered a group of men in the area to erect a new school. Mr. Tuttle&#x27;s uncle, Pleas Harris, and Kaleb Bumpus donated land near a spring on which to build the new school. Local tales say Tuttle and Bumpus noticed the two White Oak trees on either side of the building after construction. It was then decided the community would be known as White Oak.

The community grew during the oil boom of the 1930s, and continued to increase after World War II. The City was incorporated in 1960.

<text>Anderson is a city and county seat of Grimes County, Texas, United States. The population was 193 as of the 2020 census. The town and its surroundings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Anderson Historic District.

The town is named for Kenneth Lewis Anderson, a vice-president of the Republic of Texas, who died here at the Fanthorp Inn in 1845.

==History==
Long occupied by indigenous peoples, this area was initially settled by Europeans and creole Spanish during Spanish colonial rule. Anglo-Americans began to enter the area in the 1820s from the Southern United States. After Mexico achieved independence, it accepted additional settlers from the United States into eastern Texas. It allowed them to practice their own religion, if they swore loyalty to Mexico. A few structures in town date from this period.

Texas achieved independence in 1836 and settlers continued to arrive from the United States. As they came mostly from the South and brought slaves with them, Grimes and other eastern counties had the highest proportion of slaveholders and slaves in the republic.

Grimes County was organized in 1846, soon after the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States. Henry Fanthorp, a new Anglo-American settler in Texas, offered land for the county seat. The town grew quickly between 1846 and 1885, reaching a peak population of about 3,000 people. County population was majority-black and enslaved by 1860. The black majority continued until many African Americans left during the 20th century in the Great Migration, to leave behind Jim Crow conditions.

Anderson in 1859 rejected being connected to the Texas and Central Railroad, and was soon surpassed in population and economic growth by Navasota. Anderson could not catch up again, although it accepted a railroad in 1903. The town was incorporated, but records show elected officials only for the years 1867 and 1875.

In 1983 a movement to revive city government was defeated at the polls. In 1995, the town began having major sewer problems and the state threatened to shut down the county courthouse if the problems were not fixed. One solution was to incorporate the town again so that it would be eligible for grants to acquire a sewer system. In 1995, John Freeman was elected as the first mayor, and the town was incorporated in 1998. He retired in 2003 and Gail Sowell was elected as mayor.

===Anderson Historic District===

The entire town and surrounding areas has been recognized as the Anderson Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The area was originally settled during Spanish colonial rule. The town is unusual in that a large number of structures have survived that reflect the history of Texas from the Mexican period through the years of the Republic of Texas and into early statehood. Anderson has never fully recovered from economic decline suffered during the late nineteenth century. As a result, the town&#x27;s appearance has been largely unchanged since the beginning of the twentieth century.

Some buildings within the district are listed as Texas State Antiquities Landmarks or Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks. Sites include:
*Allen Home, built around 1840 and first served as a girls&#x27; academy.
*Anderson Baptist Church, built between 1853 and 1855 from native stone by enslaved African-American laborers and artisans. The Baptist General Convention of Texas was organized here in 1848.
*Rueben Bennett House.
*H. H. Boggess House.
*Fanthorp Inn State Historic Site. Held the region&#x27;s first post office. In 1845, Vice President Kenneth Lewis Anderson of the Republic of Texas, after whom the town is named, died while staying at the inn. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department acquired the property in 1977 and, opened the site to the public in 1987 as a demonstration of life at a stagecoach stop and family home in 1850.
*B. B. Goodrich House. Benjamin Briggs Goodrich served as a member of the Convention of 1836 and signed the Texas Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.
*The Harris-Martin House. Harris followed his parents, John R. Harris and Jane Harris, to Texas, who preceded him to found the colony of Harrisburg, Texas (now in modern Houston).
*Grimes County Courthouse.
*Steinhagen Log Cabin.
*Vernacular Palladian House.

<text>Navasota is a city primarily in Grimes County, Texas, United States. The population was 7,643 at the 2020 census. In 2005, the Texas Legislature designated Navasota as the &quot;Blues Capital of Texas&quot; in honor of the late Mance Lipscomb, a Navasota native and blues musician. Technically, a sliver of Navasota is in Brazos County, which is part of the Bryan-College Station Metropolitan area.

==Geography==

Navasota is located in southwestern Grimes County, east of the Navasota River (a tributary of the Brazos River). It is northwest of Houston. Texas State Highway 105 is the main eastâwest route that passes through the center of Navasota, leading southwest to Brenham and east to Conroe. Texas State Highway 6 passes northâsouth through the eastern side of the city as a four-lane bypass, leading northwest to College Station and south to Hempstead.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.47%, is water.

==History==

The French explorer RenÃ©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who was misguided in his 1687 attempt to locate the Mississippi River and trying to find his way back to French-held lands near the Great Lakes, came through the area that would become Navasota, where he was murdered by one of his men. After numerous voyages, explorations of the Mississippi River valley, and trading ventures and several mutinies, La Salle&#x27;s bones are believed to have found their resting place in the Navasota Valley.

Navasota was founded by European Americans in 1831 as a stagecoach stop named &quot;Nolansville.&quot; Its name was changed in 1858 to Navasota, a name perhaps derived from the Native American word &quot;nabatoto&quot; (&quot;muddy water&quot;).

After September 1859, when the Houston and Texas Central Railway built rails through the town, Navasota became an important shipping and marketing center for the surrounding area. When the nearby historic town of Washington-on-the-Brazos resisted railways, it forfeited its geographic advantage and began to decline after many of its businesses and residents began to migrate to the new railhead to the northeast across the Brazos River at Navasota.

Slavery was integral to the local economy. A few wealthy planters depended on enslaved African Americans to provide labor for their large cotton plantations. The slaves were brought to the city and sold in the domestic slave trade. They worked primarily in the cotton fields, which were a major commodity crop in the area. Guns were made in nearby Anderson. Cotton, gunpowder, and shoes were made, processed, and stored in Anderson for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

By 1865, the population of Navasota was about 2,700. Throughout the Civil War, all the marketable goods produced in the region were brought to Navasota, which at the time was the furthest inland railhead in Texas. Such goods were shipped south by rail to Galveston, where they could be transported by steamboat along the Texas coast and up the Mississippi River to the war effort or exported to Mexico or overseas to Europe.

==Disasters and decline==

Navasota suffered a series of disasters in the mid-1860s that severely depleted its population. In 1865, a warehouse filled with cotton and gunpowder exploded after it was torched by returning Confederate soldiers. The blast killed a number of people and started a fire that destroyed much of the original downtown. Many buildings were damaged, including the post office. Not long afterward, the town was struck by a deadly cholera epidemic. That was followed in 1867 by an even more dangerous epidemic of yellow fever. Many Navasota citizens, including the mayor, fled to escape the disease, and the town&#x27;s population dropped by about 50 percent.

In the late 1860s the KKK moved into Navasota, prompting a tense confrontation between federal soldiers and a crowd of local whites on one occasion.

Navasota was considered such a &quot;wild and woolly&quot; place that women and children were discouraged from going downtown even in broad daylight. The downtown buildings were overrun with lawless ruffians, gamblers, prostitutes, and drunks. Lawmen had to hide and watch, and often were afraid of the streets at night. There were many saloons and gaming halls to entertain the cowboys, railroad men, and others on the loose. Every Sunday morning the undertaker hitched up a buggy and went downtown to collect the bodies he expected to find after another wild Saturday night.

==Marshal Frank Hamer==

In 1908, Navasota was still a Wild West boomtown: according to one source, &quot;shootouts on the main street were so frequent that in two years at least a hundred men had died&quot;. Famed lawman Frank Hamer, then 24 years old, was hired from the Texas Rangers to become the City Marshal. Hamer moved in and imposed law and order, prosecuting Navasota criminals until the town became safe again. He served as marshal until 1911. Hamer became more widely known in 1934 as a leader of the posse that hunted down and fatally shot Bonnie and Clyde. In 2012, the City of Navasota commissioned local sculptor Russell Cushman to design and create a statue of Frank Hamer, which is now on display in front of the city hall building.

==Present==

As of 2018, the population of the town was an estimated 7,715 people. The industrial sector of the community boasts 23 companies and over 1,200 jobs. In 2009, Navasota was selected as a &quot;Visionaries in Preservation&quot; city by the Texas Historical Commission to protect the numerous historic structures in the city. A new municipal building was completed in 2011 and continued downtown improvements are under construction, with completion scheduled for 2023.

In 2012, Navasota Municipal Airport completed an expansion of its runway to long by wide and is now able to accommodate jets on the runway.

The city of Navasota earned a 2011 Gold Leadership Award from the Texas Comptroller&#x27;s Office for efforts in transparency. Its application scored 17 of 20 points. Navasota was one of 70 (out of over a thousand) cities in Texas to receive the Gold status. It also received the award in 2013. 

In 2012, Navasota was named by the Union Pacific Railroad as &quot;Train Town USA&quot;.

In August 2013, Navasota was named a Go Texan &quot;Certified Retirement Community&quot; by the Texas Department of Agriculture.

==Media==

Navasota is served by the weekly &quot;Navasota Examiner&quot; newspaper, which has been reporting on Grimes County since 1894. The city is also home to the Willy 98.7 FM and 1550 AM radio stations, which are owned and managed by Bryan Broadcasting in Bryan, Texas. Willy 98.7 is a classic country station with local programming that includes the Navasota News and live broadcasts of Navasota Rattlers football games.

In 2013, the British documentary project known as &quot;Vague Direction&quot; visited Navasota and interviewed local residents Misslette The Singing Cowgirl and hog trapper Steve Stribling.

==Attractions==
Navasota has many shops and artisans in its historic downtown district, including antique, gift, and boutique stores and art galleries housed in old classic stone and brick structures. Live plays are performed regularly at the Sunny Furman Theatre. The city also has golfing facilities and parks as well as wineries.

Navasota retains a number of historic Victorian homes on Washington Avenue, the main residential and commercial thoroughfare through town.

Another attraction is the historic Brule Field, a natural amphitheater built in the 1930s out of native stone. It served as the primary grid for the local high school football team, the Navasota Rattlers, until the new stadium was constructed in 2006. Several native-stone churches also remain near downtown, with distinctive Victorian fronts.

The city is home to two statues of French explorer RenÃ©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, including a bronze monument, dedicated in 1936 by the DAR, to celebrate the travels of the famous French explorer. The second is a stone bust that was previously in downtown, and was rededicated by the French consulate in May 2012 at nearby August Horst Park. The bust was donated to the city by the French government in 1978.

Each spring, Navasota is a popular destination for its bluebonnet fields, the state flower of Texas. A statue of Mance Lipscomb is now a part of Mance Lipscomb Park, near downtown. A statue of Frank Hamer stands in front of city hall, honoring the time he served as city marshal. Local artist and sculptor Russell Cushman designed and built the bronze statue. Other attractions include art galleries, the Horlock House Artists-in-Residence program and museum, live music venues, food truck parks and several murals that present great selfie locations for area visitors. Seasonal festivals attract crowds each year, with live music being a large part of the draw.

<doc id="135960" wikidata="Q977791" url="?curid=135960" title="Geronimo, Texas">
<text>Geronimo is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Guadalupe County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,097 at the 2020 census, up from 1,032 at the 2010 census. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1831 during the Mexican Texas period, James Bowie surveyed eleven leagues of land within the colony of Green DeWitt. Located on the northeast bank of the Guadalupe River, the area surrounded the natural springs called &quot;Tio Geronimo&quot;. JosÃ© Antonio Navarro purchased land and lived here later, 1840â1853. As a champion of human rights, he was a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, and the Constitution of the State of Texas.

Navarro lived here on his San Geronimo Ranch. It was located on Geronimo Creek and named for Saint Jerome (translator of the Bible into Latin). The town and creek are named to honor this saint, although others claim that the name comes from original owner of the springs, &quot;Tio&quot; (Uncle) Geronimo Flores. JosÃ© Antonio Navarro&#x27;s brother, Luciano Navarro, also ran a ranch in the area. The area is about north of Seguin, the Guadalupe County seat.

In the mid-1800s, Geronimo became popular as a social center for German settlers. German settlers from Schumansville moved into the area in 1860 and formed a community. One enterprising settler opened a bank and German civic center. The community had grown into a small town by 1891, sporting a general store, a post office (former bank), a steam-powered cotton gin, and a population of twenty. A one-teacher school brought education to forty students in 1904. By 1917, the post office had relocated, sharing occupancy with a local feed store. In 1919, a park, complete with a spring-fed swimming pool, was constructed beside Geronimo Creek. After World War II, Geronimo hosted two gins and 123 residents.

==Geography==
Geronimo is located in northern Guadalupe County along Texas State Highway 123, which leads north to San Marcos and south to Seguin, the Guadalupe County seat. New Braunfels is to the west via Farm-to-Market Roads.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Geronimo CDP has a total area of , all land.

<text>Seguin ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Guadalupe County, Texas, United States. The population was 29,433 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 36,013.

==Description==
Seguin&#x27;s economy is primarily supported by a regional hospital, as well as the Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation water-utility, that supplies the surrounding Greater San Antonio areas from nearby aquifers as far as Gonzales County. Several dams in the surrounding area are governed by the main offices of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, headquartered in downtown Seguin.

Seguin, named in honor of Juan SeguÃ­n, a Tejano Texian freedom fighter and early supporter of the Republic of Texas, is one of the oldest towns in Texas, founded just 16 months after the Texas Revolution began. The frontier settlement was a cradle of the Texas Rangers and home to the celebrated Captain Jack Hays, perhaps the most famous Ranger of all. At this time, the Seguin area was a part of Gonzales County, the remaining portion known as present-day Belmont. The Rangers had found this was a good halfway stop between their patrol points. It had been maintained as a base camp by the Rangers since the early founding of the Dewitt Colony.

==History==
Seguin was the home of Dr. John E. Park, who experimented in construction using concrete made from local materials. The nearly 100 structuresâthe courthouse, schools, churches, homes, cisterns, walls, etc.âmade up the largest concentration of early 19th-century concrete buildings in the United States. About 20 of them remain standing.

The use of concrete largely ended when the railroad arrived in 1876, bringing cheap lumber and the equipment needed for brick-making. The town had five brickworks, and the wooden buildings of downtown were completely replaced with brick by the beginning of World War I.

For almost 100 years, the town was dependent on the rich surrounding farmland and ranches. Then, the Texas oil boom came just as the Great Depression was taking down other towns and cities. The town commemorated its centennial by opening Max Starcke Park, with a golf course, a pavilion, picnic tables, and BBQ pits along a scenic river drive, and a curving dam that created a waterfall.

To preserve some of the historic character of the town, Seguin became one of the state&#x27;s first Main Street cities, and the downtown district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fine homes by leading architects J. Reily Gordon, Solon McAdoo, Leo M.J. Dielman, Atlee B. Ayers, and Marvin Eickenroht dating from the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be found on many streets. However, the city does not have any officially designated historic residential districts.

The postwar era had industrial development, including a small mill that turned scrap metal into construction products.

In 1972 Motorola built a plant to manufacture automotive electronics. It was bought by Continental AG in 2006, became Vitesco Technologies in 2021, acquired by Schaeffler in 2024, and is the city&#x27;s largest employer with 1,750 employees. Caterpillar opened a diesel engine assembly plant in 2008 which is the second largest employer.

===Prehistory===
The Seguin area was once inhabited by the native hunter-gatherer Native Americans of Texas. An ongoing archeological dig indicates campgrounds dating back 10,000 years or so, with trade items from Mexico and Arizona. The early visitors may have come to gather pecans, because the native trees bearing the tasty nut thrive in the river bottoms of the Guadalupe. By the time the first European explorers passed through, predominantly Tonkawas lived in the area, camping around the Guadalupe and other streams in the area. Eventually, Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo settlers started farms and ranches in the location that would become Seguin.

===Early history===
JosÃ© Antonio Navarro, one of the earliest settlers and an important figure of Texas history, developed a ranch near Seguin. In 1831, land was granted to Umphries Branch by the Mexican government. The Branch and John Newton Sowell Sr. families settled in 1833 in the western part of Green DeWitt&#x27;s colony. Sowell was a farmer, and in 1833 he and his brothers became the first Anglo-American immigrants to raise corn in future Guadalupe County.

Between 1827 and 1835, 22 families came to the area as part of the DeWitt Colony; by 1833, 40 land titles were in the region, 14 of which received grants directly from the Mexican government. In 1836, John Gladden King lived near Seguin. His farm neighbored the Sowells on the northwest and Branch on the southeast. A son, William Philip King, reportedly was part of a cannon crew and was the youngest defender killed during the Battle of the Alamo. These homesteads were abandoned in the Runaway Scrape.

===Old Seguin===
The town of Seguin was founded August 12, 1838, 16 months after Texas won its independence at the Battle of San Jacinto, making it one of the oldest towns in Texas. Members of Mathew Caldwell&#x27;s Gonzales Rangers acquired land originally granted to Umphries Branch, who had departed during the Runaway Scrape and sold his land to Joseph S. Martin.

At this time, the Seguin area was a part of Gonzales County, the remaining portion known as present-day Belmont. The Rangers had found this was a good halfway stop between their patrol points. The big oaks and walnut groves along the Walnut Branch, had become a familiar and pleasant location. It had been maintained as a base camp by the rangers since the early founding of the Dewitt Colony.

===19th century history===
Under an ancient live oak, 33 Rangers signed the charter for the town. Many were surveyors who joined Joseph Martin in laying out the lots for the town. Its original name was Walnut Springs, but was changed just 6 months later to honor San Jacinto veteran and then a Senator of the Republic of Texas, Juan SeguÃ­n. The surveyors&#x27; plan for the city included a main northâsouth street that ran straight and flat for a mile and more. The streets form a grid, around a central square of two blocks, today&#x27;s Courthouse Square and Central Park, formerly known as Market Square.

A tree called the Whipping Oak grows across from the courthouse. In the 19th century, runaway slaves as well as criminals were bound to an iron ring embedded in the tree, then whipped as a punishment.

Manuel Flores, veteran of San Jacinto and brother-in-law of Juan Seguin, established a ranch just south of Seguin in 1838. It became a safe-haven for San Antonio families and a staging point for counterattack when Bexar was overrun in 1842 by Santa Anna&#x27;s forces under RÃ¡fael VÃ¡squez and Adrian Woll.

Leading the resistance forces from this location was Texas Ranger John Coffee &quot;Jack&quot; Hays. When duty allowed, Hays was a familiar resident of Seguin. In 1843, Hays set up a gathering point at the &quot;Walnut Branch Ranger Station in Seguin, where the classic Ranger character was born. He met Susan Calvert, whose father owned the Magnolia Hotel, where they married in April 1847.

Serving under Hays were two other famous Ranger residents of Seguin: Henry and Ben McCulloch. Their home known as &quot;Hardscramble&quot; still stands and was designated a Texas State Centennial historic site in 1936. Colonel James Clinton Neill, commander of the Alamo, was known to be buried here. The site was also historically marked during the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition.

Seguin was named the county seat, and Guadalupe County was organized, early in 1845, as Texas became a state. The first county judge was Michael H. Erskine. The town was incorporated in 1853, and a city government was organized under acting Mayor John R. King, until elections were held later that year and John D. Anderson became the first elected mayor.

A few years later, another town was laid out on the west side of Seguin, on land that had been titled by the Alamo defender Thomas R. Miller, and sold in 1840 to Ranger James Campbell in partnership with Arthur Swift and Andrew Neill. This area became part of Seguin within a few years, but 150 years later, the eastâwest streets still do not match up to cross through the old Guadalupe Street border.

When Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels and his German colonists were making their way in 1845 to the land they had bought to settle, Calvin Turner and Asa Sowell from Seguin were hired to guide them. Later, Seguin became a stopping point and trade center for German immigrants along their route from the ports of Indianola and Galveston to the German settlements around New Braunfels and Fredericksburg. Many Germans &quot;en route&quot; heard of the hard times in those Hill Country settlements and decided instead to buy land and settle around Seguin.

After Texas became a state, many settlers arrived from the Old South, bringing in hundreds of slaves in total, though only a few plantation owners held more than a dozen slaves. Most of the slaves lived on small farms with their owners, who remained subsistence farmers for years after settling their land. The contributions of African Americans to building the community are all but ignored in local histories written during the period when slavery was still being excused as justifiable due to the alleged low development of those enslaved. In fact, for the first 50 years or so, and probably for the first 100 years of the town, blacks did most of the construction work, including the main concrete buildings such as Sebastopol. 

Education was important to the town. By 1849, it chartered a school. The first schoolhouse was built in 1850; it burned and was soon replaced by a two-story limecrete building. This Guadalupe High School, now a part of the St James parochial school, was recognized by a historical marker in 1962 as the oldest continuously used school building in Texas.

Seguin was home to Dr. John E. Park&#x27;s concrete (limecrete). Called &quot;the Mother of Concrete Cities&quot; in the 1870s, the town once had nearly 100 structures made of limecrete, including the courthouse, schools, churches, houses, cisterns, and many walls. So many limecrete walls and corrals were built that Seguin gave the effect of being a walled city. This was the largest and most significant concentration of 19th-century concrete buildings in the U.S. About 20 of these vintage buildings survive today.

In 1857, Frederick Law Olmsted, later famous as the landscape architect of New York&#x27;s Central Park, toured Texas, writing dispatches to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Olmsted exclaimed at the concrete structures he found here, almost on the edge of the frontier, and described the city as &quot;the prettiest town in Texas.&quot;

One surviving concrete home, the Sebastopol House; built in 1856, is a Texas Historical Commission landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places due to its unusual limecrete construction and architectural style.

Stagecoaches began to serve the town in 1848, connecting coastal ports to San Antonio and points west. The Magnolia Hotel was an overnight stop for the exhausted, hungry, and dirt-covered riders. A young slave had the duty of standing on a stone to pull the bell rope alerting the community to the arrival of the stage, which brought visitors, the mail, newspapers, and special merchandise. Heading west from the Magnolia, the stage route went through town, passing the courthouse. Today, a mural commemorates its path. During the Great Depression, workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps traced part of the route with stone walls, showing how it moved downhill, crossed Walnut Branch (a spring-fed tributary of the Guadalupe River), and climbed the other side.

The historic Wilson Pottery site is on Capote Road, near Seguin. The pottery was the first successful business in Texas owned and operated by freed slaves, beginning in 1869.

During Reconstruction, the freed slaves in Seguin organized their own congregation, the Second Baptist Church, and in 1876, a school that came to be known as the Lincoln School. In 1887, they established Guadalupe College, comparable to a junior college today, with a heavy concentration on vocational education. These institutions were begun with the help of Rev. Leonard Ilsley, an abolitionist minister from Maine, but William Baton Ball, himself an ex-slave, Union soldier in the Civil War, and former Buffalo Soldier, became their leader. He was greatly assisted by his friend and benefactor George Brackenridge of San Antonio. (The main buildings of Guadalupe College burned due to a boiler malfunction during a bitterly cold night in 1936, and the college ended.)

The railroad reached Seguin in 1876&quot; en route &quot;to San Antonio, when the oldest railway in Texas, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad, chartered on February 11, 1850, as the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway Company built the first Seguin depot. It became part of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and now the main southern line of the Union Pacific.

John Ireland was mayor of Seguin in 1858. Elected the 18th Governor of Texas 1883â1887, he had an important part in the construction of the Texas State Capitolâinsisting on using native stone, red granite from the Hill Country, instead of limestone imported from Indiana. He also presided over the opening of the University of Texas at Austin.

===20th century history===
From before the Civil War until at least World War II, cotton was the money crop of the local farms, and the county had at least a dozen gins, with three in the town of Seguin, but agriculture was more diversified than in many counties where cotton was king, with corn, peanuts, hogs, and cattle, as well as wheat, oats, sugarcane, and most notably, pecans. The tiny but tasty native nuts were an early export. The crops improved as the bottomlands were converted to orchards, and eventually bigger varieties of nuts were grafted onto the local trees. This was one of the first counties to have a pecan growers&#x27; association, and in 1921, its leader, P.K. DeLaney, helped start the Texas Pecan Growers Association. The county remains one of the state&#x27;s leading producers. Seguin has been called &#x27;a big orchard with a small town in it&#x27; because almost every house is shaded by a pecan tree in the yard. A tribute to the nut&#x27;s importance is &quot;the World&#x27;s Largest Pecan&quot; erected on the courthouse lawn.

Small mills were put on the Guadalupe River even before the Civil War. William Saffold established a mill at what is today Max Starcke Park. Later, Henry Troell made major improvements there, and in 1894, used hydroelectric power to light the town. The City of Seguin took over the dam and electric plant in 1907. The supply of cheap and reliable electricity helped to make possible several gins, mills, silos, an ice plant and ice cream maker, a cold meat storage facility, and other types of agribusiness.

In 1912, citizens of Seguin lured a struggling church school to the city with cash, and 15 acres of land donated by Louis Fritz. It grew to a junior college and then into a four-year college to become today&#x27;s Texas Lutheran University, with some 1,400 students and boasting high rankings on the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; comparisons of universities.

During this time, Texas State Architect, Atlee Ayres designed several commercial, public and residential buildings in Seguin. In 1912 he designed the Starcke Furniture Company, the Seguin High School building aka Mary B. Erskine School (1914), the Aumont Hotel (1916), Langner Hall at Texas Lutheran University and the Blumberg and Breustedt mansions.

During the 1920s, the county began to enjoy a foretaste of an oil boom. While the first fields were at the far edge of the county, near Luling, the paperwork of deeds and leases (as well as any resulting lawsuits) passed through the Guadalupe County Courthouse. Then in December 1929, the Darst Creek Field was opened, only 15 miles east of Seguin. (The creek had been named for colonist and landowner Jacob C. Darst. He was one of the original &quot;Old Eighteen&quot;, defenders of the Gonzales cannon and then a member of the Gonzales Ranging Company relief force to the Alamo during the siege in 1836.)

With the Darst Field, Seguin became a supply center, and residents were able to rent out rooms to oil field workers for cash even during the worst years of the depression of the 1930s. As a result, Seguin was able to collect taxes when other towns just had to give up. It used the money to match federal grants for what some derided as &quot;make-work&quot; projects. Under the leadership of the popular mayor, Max Starcke, Seguin was transformed, with a new post office, a new Art Deco City Hall, courthouse, jailhouse and fountain in Central Park, new storm sewers and sidewalks, and a small park along Walnut Branch, with rustic stone walls that protected the historic springs and traced the route of the stagecoach as it headed west through town. The little city had three swimming pools, one for whites, one for blacks at the segregated high school, and one for Spanish-speaking citizens at the Juan Seguin school.

Max Starcke&#x27;s biggest achievement was a large park along the Guadalupe River, designed by Robert H.H. Hugman, famous now as &quot;the Father of the River Walk&quot; in San Antonio. The park featured a handsome Art Deco recreation building designed by Hugman (now offices) with changing rooms for the swimming pool. The nine-hole course was designed by John Bredemus, a prolific course designer who has been called &quot;the father of Texas golf&quot;. The park offered picnic tables and bar-be-que pits between a scenic river drive and the river. Most of all, at a disused mill, Hugman and the young men of the National Youth Administration put a curving dam. As the 1938 dedication marker tells, funds were raised in part by public subscription. Dozens of groups and individuals made contributions to build the park that the town named for its popular mayor, who was moving on to, and soon to head, the Lower Colorado River Authority in Austin.

After World War II, entrepreneurs fresh out of the university used electric furnaces to melt scrap into reinforcing bars with a company then called Structural Metals. The minimill (now CMC Steel) has been joined by manufacturers including Alamo Group, building roadside mowing equipment; Schaeffler (was Vitesco Technologies, Continental Automotive Systems, originally Motorola), making electronic powertrain control modules and emissions sensors; Hexcel, producing reinforcements for composites using glass fiber, carbon fiber, aramids, and specialty yarns; Minigrip, manufacturing re-closeable plastic bags for food and home storage; Tyson Foods, processing chicken. In 2009 Caterpillar opened a plant assembling diesel engines. Most recently Rave Gears, a make of precisions gears, opened a plant and headquarters.

==Geography==
Seguin is located in the center of Guadalupe County. It is east-by-northeast of downtown San Antonio, on Interstate 10, which serves Seguin with five exits. It is approximately south of Austin on Highway 123, via Interstate 35, or by Highway 130, a toll road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and , or 0.58%, are covered by water.

The Guadalupe River flows through the southern side of the city, reaching the Gulf of Mexico south of Victoria.

===Weather and climate===
On the northern edge of the South Texas Plains, Seguin enjoys a mild winter. The sunny days of spring bring on spectacular shows of wildflowers from March into June. Like most of Central Texas, it suffers very hot, humid summers from June into September. Then cold fronts pushing down from the north usually trigger precipitation and make October a rainy month, bringing &quot;a second spring&quot; of wildflowers. At their worst, fall and winter have &quot;northers&quot;, fast-moving cold fronts with wind, often rain, and rapid drops of temperature, frequently falling 30 Â°F (17 Â°C) or more during one day. Northers give way to warm spells, right through the winter.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 29,433 people, 10,542 households, and 7,026 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 11,563 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 53.5% White, 6.5% African American, 0.8% Native American, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 17.2% from some other races and 20.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 53.74% of the population. 21.7% of residents were under the age of 18, 6.0% were under 5 years of age, and 16.9% were 65 and older.

==Government==
The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s 12th Flying Training Wing operates an airfield for practice approaches and touch-and-go landings, known as Randolph AFB Auxiliary Field/Seguin Field. It was originally constructed with three runways about 12 miles east-northeast of Randolph AFB, in 1941. Today it has a single active 8350-ft runway. Normally unattended, it is supported by a manned runway supervisor unit and aircraft rescue and fire fighting vehicles when conducting flight operations.

The main offices of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority are located on East Court St. in Seguin. The GBRA manages Canyon Dam, upstream on the Guadalupe, as well as four small dams in the county and other facilities.

The Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation, half owned by each city, was created in 1998 to develop and operate a wholesale water supply system. Using wells in the Carrizo Aquifer in Gonzales County, production began in September 2002. It now also supplies Selma, Universal City, and Converse, as well as Springs Hill Water Supply Corp., and the San Antonio Water System. Its offices are in Starcke Park, near the Seguin waterworks.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates a parole office in Seguin.

The United States Postal Service operates the Seguin Post Office at 531 West Court St. and the Seguin Annex at 1500 East Court, in the mall next to Bealls.

===State and federal districts===
Seguin was represented in the Texas House of Representatives from 1983 to 2010 by the Republican Edmund Kuempel. He was noted for helping to get the State of Texas to restore the 19th century mansion called Sebastopol and operate it as a Historic Site for 25 years. A native of Austin, businessman Kuempel died in office two days after being unopposed for reelection. John Kuempel, Edmund Kuempel&#x27;s son, won the special election on December 14 of that year to succeed his father in the District 44 seat in the Texas House. He was reelected in 2012 and 2014.

Democrat Vicente Gonzalez has represented Guadalupe County in the U.S. House of Representatives as part of Texas&#x27; 15th Congressional District, since 2017. One of the &quot;fajita&quot; districts, the 15th runs in a narrow strip from Seguin down to McAllen in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

===Education===
The city is served by the Seguin Independent School District, with about 8,000 students in 14 schools. Under the 2013 accountability ratings released by the Texas Education Agency, Seguin ISD and each of its campuses received &quot;Met Standard&quot; ratings based upon the new performance standards. The performance index-based rating system applies one of two labels to districts and public schools across the state: Met Standard or Improvement Required. The public schools include:

===Newspapers and radio===
Seguin is one of the very few cities in the country with competing daily papers. The &quot;Gazette&quot;, a broadsheet, has been publishing for more than 125 years, since 1888. It is now part of the Southern Newspapers chain. The &quot;Daily News&quot; is part of the news operation of the locally owned and independently programmed radio station KWED.

===Attractions===
* ZDT&#x27;s Amusement Park, a family-owned, family-oriented amusement park, features over a dozen attractions. Repurposed century-old agribusiness structures provide Texas&#x27; highest indoor playground with tunnels and slides, wall climbing up former silos, and riding go-karts through, and on the roof of, an old warehouse, as well as modern parachute drop and a water ride. A new, old-style wooden roller coaster, called Switchback, opened in 2015.
* The Texas Agricultural Education and Heritage Center, the &quot;Big Red Barn&quot;, helps kids and others learn the mechanics and history of farming in Central Texas, with sample crops and gardens, barnyard animals and poultry, and displays of vintage equipment and tools. A collected village has houses, barns, a one-room schoolhouse, a pharmacy, a blacksmith shop, a gas station, a church, and other relics from the rural past. Many events are held on weekends, and tours are given by appointment.
* Sebastopol House Historic Site is perhaps the finest surviving 19th-century concrete building west of the Mississippi. Here on the frontier, settlers began experimenting with concrete construction years before the Civil War, and built 100 or so structures of &quot;lime-crete&quot;, as it was called. A team of slaves built this mansion, mixing local gravel, sand, lime, and some organic materials, then pouring the mix into wooden forms. When the concrete was solid, they raised the forms and repeated the process. A journalist declared Seguin &quot;the Mother of Concrete Cities&quot;. Sebastopol House, a well-preserved architectural masterpiece, built in 1856 in Greek Revival style, is now a museum offering free tours.
* The Fiedler Museum displays geological examples, with various types of rocks from across the state in a small garden at Langner Hall on the TLU campus.
* The &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Pecan&quot; is a 5-ft-long, two-and-a-half-ft-wide concrete nut erected in 1962; it sits in front of the county courthouse. This county is a large producer of pecans and often claims the nickname &quot;Pecan Capital of Texas&quot;. Seguin has been described as &quot;a big pecan orchard with a small town in it&quot;. A new pecan-shaped sculpture, 4 ft longer than the previous record holder, was unveiled on July 4, 2011, to ensure its place as the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest&quot;. It can be seen at the Texas Agricultural Education and Heritage Center. The original and still photogenic &quot;big pecan&quot; remains at its downtown location.
* &quot;True Women&quot; â Seguin is one of the settings of the 1994 Janice Woods Windle historical novel &quot;True Women&quot;. The author grew up here, learning the women&#x27;s side of history from family members. A self-drive tour of sites in the book is available at the Chamber of Commerce or at .

It is among the oldest newspapers in Texas still in publication, and became fully computer paginated in 1994, the same year it began publishing an online edition. Customers in the city are also served by the &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot;, which often reports on news from Plainview.

Eight radio stations broadcast from the city, including KVOP, among the oldest in the region. KVOP&#x27;s call sign originally meant &quot;Voice of Plainview&quot;.

The city is within the Lubbock television market. Due to the terrain, television stations based in Amarillo can be received over-the-air, either directly or via repeaters north of the city. Prior to 1993, virtually all stations broadcast from Lubbock and Amarillo markets were retransmitted by the local cable operator. After changes were made to must-carry rules by the Federal Communications Commission, only stations from Lubbock are available to cable and digital satellite customers in the city.

The Steve Martin film &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (1992) was filmed in and around Plainview. Several residents were hired as extras for the film. Until 2016, a water tower east of downtown bore the name and mascot of the fictional town on which the movie was set: &quot;Rustwater Bengals&quot;.

An episode of &quot;Vice&quot; portrayed the city as a ghost town in a documentary feature called &quot;Deliver Us from Drought&quot;, despite 22,000 residents still living in the city at the time of filming. The documentary featured numerous locations, many of which had been closed or abandoned for years prior, as examples of recent rural flight following a drought. The documentary followed the template of a similar short, &quot;Dry and Drier in West Texas&quot;, which was broadcast on Showtime. Both documentaries portrayed residents of the city as excessively religious.

<doc id="135975" wikidata="Q975384" url="?curid=135975" title="Estelline, Texas">
<text>Estelline is a town located in Hall County, Texas, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 121. In 2012, Estelline was ranked #1 in a National Motorists Association listing of its &quot;Worst Speed Trap Cities&quot; in North America (with a population of less than 50,000). Estelline often refers to itself as the &quot;Town of Estelline&quot;, with a &quot;Town Hall&quot; and a &quot;Town Council&quot;, rather than the customary &quot;city&quot; label. However, under Texas law, all incorporated municipalities are considered to be cities.

==History==

Estelline was established in 1892 by the brothers Elam and Math Wright. It was on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway and was named for Estelle de Shields, daughter of an early settler. The area was originally part of the Diamond Tail Ranch. The Mill Iron range lay nearby, and after 1896 the Continental Land and Cattle Company moved its headquarters to a nearby bluff overlooking the Red River. A post office was opened in May 1892, and by 1894 Estelline had two hotels, a Methodist church, a cotton gin, a livery stable, and a one-room schoolhouse. Tom Macy opened the first store, and soon afterward T. R. Garrott established the Estelline Supply Company. In 1894 Math Wright obtained a depot and sidetrack for his town, and throughout the remainder of the decade Estelline was an important shipping point on the Fort Worth and Denver City line. Cattle from nearby Silverton and Paducah were driven there for shipment. In 1896 the Mill Iron Ranch bought the Estelline Supply Company and opened a large general merchandise store and lumberyard with R. L. Biggerstaff as manager. Two years later Biggerstaff established a private bank, which became the Estelline State Bank in 1905. The town had two newspapers, the Estelline Star (1894â1896) and the Estelline News (1907â1910). A two-story school was built in 1909. In 1912 the citizens of Estelline elected to incorporate with a mayor, a city marshal, and five aldermen. By then the town had attained a population of over 1,000.

The 1920s saw the erection of permanent brick school facilities, the emergence of a champion basketball team, and the organization of a town band conducted by Paul James. In 1927 the railroad began construction of a branch line out of Estelline to Plainview in Hale County. However, the Great Depression led to the closing of the bank and a decline in the population to 603 by 1940. That year two fires destroyed several businesses. Subsequent improvements in highway transportation led to an overall decline in Estelline&#x27;s importance as a railroad junction town. The number of businesses dropped from fifteen in 1947 to four by 1980, when the population was 258. The town was still incorporated, and the post office remained open.

In 1983, Estelline citizens voted to allow the sale of alcohol beverages. Estelline is the only seller of alcohol beverages within &#x27;dry&#x27; Hall County. Estelline has a reputation for being a prominent Texas speed trap and relies on speeders to pay its bills. The Estelline Independent School District was declared dormant in 1987 and students were sent to Memphis schools. Estelline was home to 194 residents in 1990, 168 in 2000 and 145 in 2010. In 2012, the Town Hall was mysteriously gutted by fire. Texas Rangers and the State Fire Marshal have both described the incident as arson. A highly publicized 2013 civil rights case revealed that 89 percent of Estellines 2012Â gross revenue came from asset forfeiture and traffic fine revenue.

===2013 civil rights case===
In September 2013, a federal suit was filed by Laura Dutton, alleging that the cities of Estelline and Memphis, former Officer Jayson Fry and Memphis Police Chief Chris Jolly violated her Fourth Amendment rights against illegal search and seizure when she was arrested November 28, 2012, in Estelline on a felony money laundering charge, seizing more than $29,000 from her pickup and keeping $1,400 of her cash. The city maintained no written records of past searches or seizures, yet traffic fines and forfeitures made up more than 89 percent of its gross revenues in fiscal year 2012. The cities and the officers denied her claims, but in July 2014, the city of Estelline and City of Memphis authorities settled with Dutton for $77,500.

=== 2015 police chief arrest ===
Estelline Chief of Police Duwayne Marcolesco surrendered his peace officer license after being charged with official oppression, stemming from an incident on February 9, 2015. Duwayne Marcolesco was arrested after stopping a car while off duty in his personal car in Childress County. The two women in the car that was stopped made an official complaint, and through an investigation the Childress County Sheriff says they discovered Marcolesco was threatening and terrorizing the women. Marcolesco surrendered his peace officer licenses meaning he can no longer work as a peace officer in Texas, and no longer is the chief of police in Estelline.

=== 2017 police chief arrest ===
On the night of June 1, 2017, Estelline Police Chief Leigh Weiser was arrested for alleged sexual activity with a person in custody, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

<doc id="135976" wikidata="Q170481" url="?curid=135976" title="Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation">
<text>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC ) is an inter-governmental forum for 21 member economies in the Pacific Rim that promotes free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Following the success of ASEAN&#x27;s series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s, APEC started in 1989, in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-Pacific economies and the advent of regional trade blocs in other parts of the world; it aimed to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw materials beyond Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as one of the highest-level multilateral blocs and oldest forums in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts significant global influence.

The heads of government of all APEC members except Taiwan (which is represented by a ministerial-level official as &quot;economic leader&quot;) attend an annual APEC Economic Leaders&#x27; Meeting. The location of the meeting rotates annually among the member economies, and a famous tradition, followed for most (but not all) summits, involves the attending leaders dressing in a national costume of the host country. APEC has three official observers: the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. APEC&#x27;s Host Economy of the Year is considered to be invited in the first place for geographical representation to attend G20 meetings following G20 guidelines.

==History==

The initial inspiration for APEC came when the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)&#x27;s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the mid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences among ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing economies. By 1986, the post-ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace 12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The developments led Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke to believe in the necessity of region-wide co-operation on economic matters. In January 1989, Bob Hawke called for more effective economic co-operation across the Pacific Rim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the Australian capital of Canberra in November, chaired by Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with commitments to hold future annual meetings in Singapore and South Korea. Ten months later, representatives of 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra, Australia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was established to co-ordinate the activities of the organisation.

During the 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC leaders adopted the Bogor Goals, which aimed for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialised economies and by 2020 for developing economies. During the November 1995 Ministerial Meeting in Osaka, Japan, a business advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) composed of three business executives from each member-country was agreed to be established in 1996.

In April 2001, APEC, in collaboration with five other international organisations (Eurostat, International Energy Agency, , Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the  United Nations Statistics Division) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI).

===Meeting locations===
The location of the annual meeting rotates among the members.

==Member economies==
Currently, APEC has 21 members. The criterion for membership, however, is that each member must be an independent economic entity, rather than a sovereign state. As a result, APEC uses the term &quot;member economies&quot; rather than &quot;member countries&quot; to refer to its members. One result of this criterion is that membership of the forum includes Taiwan (officially the Republic of China, participating under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;) alongside People&#x27;s Republic of China (see Cross-Strait relations), as well as Hong Kong, which entered APEC as a British colony but it is now a Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. APEC also includes three official observers: ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.

===Leaders===
====Current leaders====
==Possible enlargement==
India has requested membership in APEC, and received initial support from the United States, South Korea, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. Officials have decided not to allow India to join for various reasons, including the fact that India does not border the Pacific Ocean, which all current members do. However, India was invited to be an observer for the first time in November 2011.

Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Macau, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, are among a dozen other economies that have applied for membership in APEC. Colombia applied for APEC&#x27;s membership as early as in 1995, but its bid was halted as the organisation stopped accepting new members from 1993 to 1996, and the moratorium was further prolonged to 2007 due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

==Business facilitation==
As a regional organization, APEC has always played a leading role in the area of reform initiatives in the area of business facilitation. The APEC Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAPI) has contributed to a reduction of 6% in the cost of business transactions across the region between 2002 and 2006. According to APEC&#x27;s projections, the cost of conducting business transactions will be reduced by another 5% between 2007 and 2010. To this end, a new Trade Facilitation Action Plan has been endorsed. According to a 2008 research brief published by the World Bank as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation Project, increasing transparency in the region&#x27;s trading system is critical if APEC is to meet its Bogor Goal targets. The APEC Business Travel Card, a travel document for visa-free business travel within the region is one of the concrete measures to facilitate business. In May 2010 Russia joined the scheme, thus completing the circle.

===Proposed FTAAP===
APEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for such an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist &#x27;s proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement proposal. While it gained little traction, the idea led to the formation of Pacific Trade and Development Conference and then the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council in 1980 and then APEC in 1989.

In the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and existing free trade agreement (FTA) partners negotiated the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without China or Russia involved became the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.

The proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations, and as a way to overcome the &quot;noodle bowl&quot; effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious free trade agreements â there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in 2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free trade agreements â many of which were bilateral.

The FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region. The economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other regional free trade areas such as the ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN + China, South Korea and Japan). Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications with nations of other regions. The development of the FTAAP is expected to take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations between member economies. It is also affected by the absence of political will and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.

At the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch &quot;a collective strategic study&quot; on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016. APEC Executive Director Alan Bollard revealed in the Elite Talk show that FTAAP will be APEC&#x27;s big goal out into the future.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership included 12 of the 21 APEC members and had provisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which expressed interest in membership.

==APEC Study Centre Consortium==
In 1993, APEC Leaders decided to establish a network of APEC Study Centres (APCs) among universities and research institutions in member economies. The purpose is to foster cooperation among tertiary and research institutes of member economies, thus having better academic collaboration on key regional economic challenges. To encourage independence from the APEC conference, the APCs are funded independently and choose their own research topics.

As of December 2018, there are 70 APCs among the member economies. An annual conference is usually held in the host economy for that year.

==APEC Business Advisory Council==
The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) was created by the APEC Economic Leaders in November 1995 with the aim of providing advice to the APEC Economic Leaders on ways to achieve the Bogor Goals and other specific business sector priorities, and to provide the business perspective on specific areas of co-operation.

Each economy nominates up to three members from the private sector to ABAC. These business leaders represent a wide range of industry sectors. ABAC provides an annual report to APEC Economic Leaders containing recommendations to improve the business and investment environment in the Asia-Pacific region, and outlining business views about priority regional issues. ABAC is also the only non-governmental organisation that is on the official agenda of the APEC Economic Leader&#x27;s Meeting.

==Annual APEC economic leaders&#x27; meetings==
Since its formation in 1989, APEC has held annual meetings with representatives from all member economies. The first four annual meetings were attended by ministerial-level officials. Beginning in 1993, the annual meetings are named APEC Economic Leaders&#x27; Meetings and are attended by the heads of government from all member economies except Taiwan, which is represented by a ministerial-level official.

===Meeting developments===
In 1997, the APEC meeting was held in Vancouver. Controversy arose after officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used pepper spray against protesters. The protesters objected to the presence of autocratic leaders such as Indonesian president Suharto.

At the 2001 Leaders&#x27; Meeting in Shanghai, APEC leaders pushed for a new round of trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and capacity building. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade transaction costs in the Asia-Pacific region by five percent over five years, and pursue trade liberalisation policies relating to information technology goods and services.

In 2003, Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Isamuddin had planned to attack the APEC Leaders Meeting to be held in Bangkok in October. He was captured in the city of Ayutthaya, Thailand by Thai police on 11 August 2003, before he could finish planning the attack.

Chile became the first South American nation to host the Leaders&#x27; Meeting in 2004. The agenda of that year was focused on terrorism and commerce, small and medium enterprise development, and contemplation of free agreements and regional trade agreements.

The 2005 Leaders&#x27; Meeting was held in Busan, South Korea. The meeting focused on the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, leading up to the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 held in Hong Kong in December. Weeks earlier, trade negotiations in Paris were held between several WTO members, including the United States and the European Union, centred on reducing agricultural trade barriers. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European Union to agree to reduce farm subsidies. In a continuation of the climate information sharing initiative established by the APEC Climate Network working group, it was decided by the leaders to install the APEC Climate Center in Busan. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting schedule was not affected.

At the Leaders&#x27; Meeting held on 19 November 2006 in Hanoi, APEC leaders called for a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism and other threats to security. APEC also criticised North Korea for conducting a nuclear test and a missile test launch that year, urging the country to take &quot;concrete and effective&quot; steps toward nuclear disarmament. Concerns about nuclear proliferation in the region was discussed in addition to economic topics. The United States and Russia signed an agreement as part of Russia&#x27;s bid to join the World Trade Organization.

The APEC Australia 2007 Leaders&#x27; Meeting was held in Sydney from 2â9 September 2007. The political leaders agreed to an &quot;aspirational goal&quot; of a 25% reduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development. Extreme security measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-concrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential terrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security envelope was penetrated with ease by a spoof diplomatic motorcade manned by members of the Australian television program &quot;The Chaser&quot;, one of whom was dressed to resemble the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

The APEC Chile 2019, originally to be held 16â17 November 2019 in Chile, was cancelled due to ongoing protests by sections of its population over inequality, the cost of living and police repression.

The 2023 APEC meeting was notable for a lack of consensuses of group members on their stance over the RussiaâUkraine and IsraelâHamas conflicts as well as consensus for WTO reforms. The meeting between Biden and Xi was also seen as significant in terms of reducing tensions between the US and China.

===APEC leaders&#x27; group photo===
At the end of the APEC Economic Leaders&#x27; Meeting, the leaders gather for the official APEC Leaders&#x27; Family Photo. A tradition has the leaders dressing to reflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S.Â President Bill Clinton insisted on informal attire and gave the leaders leather bomber jackets. At the 2010 meeting, Japan had the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono. Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S.Â President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in &quot;flowered shirts and grass skirts&quot;. After viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama instead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for the photo. Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik outfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in the Philippines 2015 barong tagalogs; in Peru 2016 vicuÃ±a wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.

==Criticism==
APEC has been criticised for promoting free trade agreements that would impose restrictions on national and local laws, which regulate and ensure labour rights, environmental protection and safe and affordable access to medicine. According to the organisation, it is &quot;the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region&quot; established to &quot;further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community&quot;. The effectiveness and fairness of its role has been questioned, especially from the viewpoints of European countries that cannot take part in APEC and Pacific Island nations that cannot participate but stand to be affected by its decisions.

<text>Lakeview is a town in Hall County, Texas, United States. The population was 60 at the 2020 census, down from 107 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Lakeview is located along State Highway 256 in north-central Hall County, southwest of Memphis, the county seat, and by road southeast of Clarendon.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Lakeview&#x27;s beginnings are unique as it has occupied two different sites in Hall County. The first site was located near the geographic center of the county on a section of the Southern Pacific Railroad survey in May 1890. A post office and several businesses sprang up at the site. After a failed attempt to become the county seat, most of the homes were sold to farmers and the land reverted to the family of S.L. Lindley. The post office was eventually relocated to the homestead of David H. Davenport, who operated a general store in 1902.

Three years later, Davenport purchased land north of his farm that had a supply of soft water, making it a suitable site to develop a community. On June 11, 1908, he moved his store and post office and platted the second Lakeview site at its present-day location. Prospects for a new railroad grew in 1910, when the Altus, Roswell, and El Paso Company constructed a roadbed through Lakeview, but prevailing conditions forced them to abandon the project. Despite this and two disastrous fires in 1918 and 1919, the community survived. Lakeview was incorporated in 1921. By the late 1920s, the town had several stores and a population exceeding 1,000.

A third fire in 1930 destroyed the business district, and the impact of the Great Depression contributed to Lakeview&#x27;s decline. A short-lived boom in the late 1940s occurred, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to revive the town. The First State Bank of Lakeview, in operation since 1908, merged with the First National Bank of Memphis in 1953. By 1980, the population had fallen to 244. That figure declined to 202 in 1990 and 152 in 2000.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 152 people, 51 households, and 36 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 74 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 45.39% White, 9.21% African American, 43.42% from other races, and 1.97% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 55.26% of the population.

==Education==

<text>Memphis is a city in and the county seat of Hall County, Texas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,290.

==History==
Memphis, Texas, the county seat of Hall County, is at the junction of U.S. Highway 287, State Highway 256, and Farm to Market Road 1547, in the northeastern part of the county. It started in 1889, when J. C. Montgomery purchased land for a townsite north of Salisbury on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway. This land had been previously owned by W. H. Robertson, who had a dugout near Parker Creek. Montgomery and Robertson, with Rev. J. W. Brice and T. J. Woods, Jr., of Dallas, formed a townsite company and presented a plat early in January 1890. P. M. Kelly opened a law office. A rooming house (later the Memphis Hotel), a general store, a drugstore, and several residences were soon erected. For a time, the new town was without a name. Several suggestions were submitted to federal postal authorities, but with negative results. Finally, as the story goes, Reverend Brice, while in Austin, happened to see a letter addressed by accident to Memphis, Texas, rather than Tennessee, with the notation &quot;no such town in Texas&quot;. The name was submitted and accepted, and a post office was established on September 12, 1890, with Robertson as postmaster.

In the meantime, Hall County was being organized. Memphis was engaged in a heated county seat battle with neighboring Salisbury and Lakeview. Memphis won the election with a total of 84 votes. County officers were elected in June, and a school district was subsequently formed. Since Memphis was without a depot and trains did not stop there, certain citizens sought to remedy that situation by smearing the tracks with lye soap. A subsequent agreement was struck between town promoters and railroad officials. In 1891, a depot was built, and businesses were moved on wheels from Salisbury to the new county seat, where a courthouse of homemade bricks was constructed in 1892.

Memphis thus enjoyed a boom period. Two saloons, a bank, numerous stores, blacksmith shops, and livery stables attested to its role as a shipping and trading center for area ranchers and farmers. The Missionary Baptist Church was organized in Memphis; its minister Rev. J. L. Pyle began Baptist congregations throughout the county. Telephone service was first installed in 1901. In June 1906, the town was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government. The Memphis Cotton Oil Mill was established in 1907. Memphis had at one time or another several newspapers, including the &quot;Hall County Record&quot; (1889â1893), the &quot;Hall County Herald&quot; (1890â1928), the&quot; Memphis Journal&quot; (1892â1894), the &quot;Memphis Times&quot; (1896), the &quot;Memphis Leader&quot; (1897â1899), the &quot;Hall County News&quot; (1897â1903), and the &quot;Memphis News&quot; (1928â1929). The only newspaper extant in 1986, the &quot;Memphis Democrat&quot;, was launched in 1908 and went through a succession of owners. By the 1920s, Memphis had a new brick-and-stone courthouse, modern utilities, a cotton compress, three hotels, brick school buildings, and a Carnegie Library. In 1922, the city&#x27;s Morning Side addition was founded east of the tracks as a residential area for blacks who labored in the cotton fields and mills. In 1935, E. M. Ewen and his wife formed the Hall County Old Settlers&#x27; Reunion (later the Hall County Picnic Association). Four years later, they staged a rodeo as part of the annual two-day celebration.

Since the Great Depression era, Memphis has continued as a farm supply center. In 1986, the city had a cotton compress, gins, a grain elevator, two banks, eight churches, four public schools, a modern medical complex, two motels, several mercantile stores (including three wholesale houses), and a municipal airport northeast of town. In addition, Memphis is noted for its tree-lined streets, city park, one swimming pool, community center, and 50 blocks of brick paving laid in 1926. Brookhollow Country Club Lake, a private fishing lake with cabin sites, is six miles northeast of the city. Heritage Hall, which occupies the old First National Bank building on the square, contains local history displays and natural science exhibits. The population was 3,332 in 1960 and 3,352 in 1980. Memphis reported 81 businesses in 1984. United States Congressman Jack Hightower comes from Memphis. The route of the annual Cotton Boll Enduro, a 125-mile cross-country motorcycle event held in late October, begins and ends at Memphis. In 1990 Memphis had a population of 2,465. The population was 2,479 in 2000 and 2,290 in 2010.
The county was named after Warren D.C. Hall, who served as Secretary of War while Texas was a republic. He was a lawyer from North Carolina before coming to Texas.

===2013 Civil rights case===

In September 2013, a federal suit was filed by Laura Dutton, alleging that the cities of Estelline and Memphis, former Officer Jayson Fry and Memphis Police Chief Chris Jolly violated her Fourth Amendment rights against illegal search and seizure when she was arrested November 28, 2012, in Estelline on a felony money-laundering charge, seizing more than $29,000 from her pickup and illegally keeping $1,400 of her cash. The city of Estelline maintained no written records of past searches or seizures, yet traffic fines and forfeitures made up more than 89% of its gross revenues in fiscal year 2012. The cities and the officers denied her claims, but in July 2014, the city of Estelline and Hall County authorities settled with Dutton for $77,500.

==History==

Spearman was platted in May 1917 in anticipation of construction of the North Texas and Santa Fe Railway. A post office opened in 1917, and by that time, E. C. Hays had a store near the site. The city was named for Thomas E. Spearman, a vice president of the North Texas and Santa Fe Railway.

World War I delayed completion of the railroad from Shattuck, Oklahoma, until October 1919, but Spearman was already thriving; several churches and businesses had moved in from Hansford. Spearman remained the terminus of the railroad until 1931, when the line was extended to Morse and points south. The town was incorporated in 1921 and had 30 businesses, a brick school building, and a population of 1,000 by 1926.

In the November 2011 election, Spearman residents voted to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages within the city limits, making Spearman a &quot;wet&quot; city in an otherwise &quot;dry&quot; county. The law took effect December 15, 2011, and allows the sale of beer and wine in retail establishments such as grocery stores and all liquor sales in a licensed liquor store. Additionally, all alcoholic beverages may now be sold in restaurants that apply for and receive a liquor license.

Chillicothe is on U.S. Route 287 (USÂ 287), Farm to Market Road 91, Farm to Market Road 2006, and the Fort Worth and Denver and Santa Fe railroads in eastern Hardeman County. It was founded in the early 1880s and developed rapidly after the construction of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway in 1887. The community, named by A. E. Jones for his hometown in Missouri, grew up on Wanderer&#x27;s Creek near the headquarters of W. H. Worsham&#x27;s R2 Ranch in the 1870s. The post office was established in 1883 with Charles E. Jones as postmaster. A fire destroyed the town in 1890, and citizens rebuilt south of the rail line rather than north.

Pioneers include Sam L. Crossley, who became the first mayor in 1903, J. J. Britt, J. A. Shires, and W. L. Ledbetter. Wheat elevators were constructed in 1892â1893, and the town was incorporated in 1907 with a population of 800. Additional rail service from the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway began in 1908. Chillicothe is called the Iris Village because of the many irises gracing the town. The population was 1,610 in 1930 and has been declining ever since.

<doc id="135993" wikidata="Q981154" url="?curid=135993" title="Sour Lake, Texas">
<text>Sour Lake is a city in Hardin County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,773 at the 2020 census. It was originally named &quot;Sour Lake Springs&quot;, after the sulphurous spring water that flowed into the nearby lake. The city is part of the BeaumontâPort Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sour Lake is the oldest surviving town in Hardin County. It is called by some the &quot;Gateway to the Big Thicket&quot;.

==History==
Sour Lake was first settled around 1835 when the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas granted Stephen Jackson one league of land covering by land grant. Sam Houston visited Sour Lake in his later years. The town is home to one of the biggest sinkholes in Texas.

Sour Lake became a short-lived boomtown with the discovery of oil in 1901, shortly after oil was found at the nearby Spindletop salt dome. It is known as the birthplace of Texaco. Formed in 1903, the Texas Company (Texaco&#x27;s former corporate name) is one of the three major oil companies that can trace its origins to the oil fields around Southeast Texas. The Sour Lake oilfield produced about of oil up to 1948, when it was producing about daily and new drilling was still underway. Today the Sour Lake oilfield is the oldest continuously producing oil field in the world.

The town of Atcheson in Bruce McCandless&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;Sour Lake&quot; appears to be based at least loosely on the real Sour Lake. Atcheson, like the real-life Sour Lake, is situated in the Big Thicket and experienced a short-lived oil boom in early years of the 20th century. Yvette Benavides, in a &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; review of the book, noted, &quot;There is a lot that is historically factual in this novel. That&#x27;s part of the fun of reading &quot;Sour Lake&quot;.&quot;

The Ecuadorian jungle town commonly referred to as Lago Agrio was named after Sour Lake by Texaco when the company established the oil-producing settlement. &quot;Lago Agrio&quot; is Spanish for &quot;Sour Lake&quot;. The official name of the Ecuadorian town is Nueva Loja.

The complex has barbecue grills, one barbecue pavilion, 10 lighted baseball fields, two lighted American football fields, picnic tables, two playgrounds (one is an all-inclusive playground and toilet facility for children of all physical abilities), four lighted softball fields, 18 unlighted soccer (football) fields, and toilet facilities. Additions added later in the park&#x27;s life include a donor pavers garden, sensory garden for children with impaired sight, three 30-seat picnic pavilions, a paved walking trail around the playground, and additional trees.

<text>Barrett, also named Barrett Station, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Harris County, Texas, United States. The population was 5,223 at the 2020 census. It was founded in 1889 by Harrison Barrett, a former slave.

==History==
Located south of Crosby and the present-day Highway 90, Barrett&#x27;s Settlement was founded by Harrison Barrett (1845â1917) and has been registered in the Texas Family Land Heritage as Texas Century Farm.

Born into slavery, Barrett was the son of Simon and Lisa Barrett, who came to Texas from Louisiana. Following the emancipation of Texas slaves in 1865, Barrett spent several years gathering his family together. He eventually found all of them except one sister, and they settled on land east of the San Jacinto River. He purchased this land in 1889 and began a community that later would be known as Barrett&#x27;s Settlement. Beginning with seven houses, the community grew to include additional homes, farms, and businesses. Barrett established a school, church, and cemetery. After a post office station was opened there in 1947, the area became known as Barrett Station. Harrison Barrett&#x27;s homestead, twice rebuilt by his descendants, stands on its original location.

<doc id="135997" wikidata="Q773495" url="?curid=135997" title="Bellaire, Texas">
<text>Bellaire is a city in southwestern Harris County, Texas, United States, within the metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the city population was 17,202. It is surrounded by the cities of Houston and West University Place. Bellaire is known as the &quot;City of Homes&quot;, owing to its mostly residential character; but it has offices along the I-610 Loop within the city limits.

== History ==
Bellaire was founded in 1908 by William Wright Baldwin, who was the president of the South End Land Company. Baldwin, a native of Iowa, was well known as the vice president of the Burlington Railroad. Bellaire was created on what was part of William Marsh Rice&#x27;s ranch. Baldwin surveyed the eastern of the ranch into small truck farms. He named them &quot;Westmoreland Farms&quot;. Baldwin started Bellaire in the middle of &quot;Westmoreland Farms&quot; to serve as a residential neighborhood and an agricultural trading center. South End Land Company advertised to farmers in the Midwestern United States. Baldwin stated that the town was named &quot;Bellaire&quot;, or &quot;Good Air&quot; for its breezes. Bellaire may have been named after Bellaire, Ohio, a town served by one of Baldwin&#x27;s rail lines.

Six miles of prairie were a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally, the town was bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910, Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so he could implement Sid Hare&#x27;s landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as a city with a general charter in 1918, 10 years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while annexing surrounding areas that were unincorporated.

Bellaire&#x27;s population had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population explosion in the post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire&#x27;s land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston, and adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950, the city&#x27;s residents had numbered 10,173, with 3,186 houses. Each subsequent year for the next two years, though, an additional 600 to 700 new houses were added. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marian High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s, 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished to make way for the right-of-way of the I-610 Loop, which bisected the city.

According to a Bellaire resident quoted in the &quot;Houston Post&quot;, prior to 1992, the tax base of the city of Bellaire had been decreasing. After neighbor West University Place eased restrictions on developers, new houses were constructed in West University Place, and the city gained a larger tax base. Bellaire decided to also liberalize its development restrictions to allow for new development by streamlining its no-growth building permit process. According to Karl Lewis, a vice president and sales manager at John Daugherty Realtors, when the prices of West University Place land reached about $20/sq ft, area home buyers began to consider Bellaire, which had an average price of $10â12/sq ft. Don Stowers of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that Bellaire and West University Place had &quot;comparable&quot; attributes such as independent fire and police departments, zoning, recreation facilities and parks, and schools &quot;among the best in Houston.&quot; Michael Blum, president of Blum &amp; Associates Realty, said &quot;Bellaire is a bargain.&quot; Blum added that Bellaire was affordable compared to similar American neighborhoods and that Bellaire had proximity to business districts, &quot;excellent&quot; municipal services, and &quot;superior&quot; schools. Affluent families increasingly moved to Bellaire. The price of an average house in Bellaire increased from $75,000 to $500,000 from 1986 to 2006.

In 2002, the City of Bellaire attempted to acquire all or part of the Teas Nursery, Bellaire&#x27;s oldest business and the oldest nursery in Greater Houston, for park development. The company fought the city&#x27;s take-over attempt. During that year the owners of Teas sold at the rear of the property to Lovett Homes, a home developer. Frank Liu, the owner of Lovett Homes, said that it had an option to buy the remaining . When the City of Bellaire denied a replat application sent by Teas Nursery, in June 2002 the nursery filed a lawsuit against the city and its zoning commission. In 2005 the lawsuit was settled out of court.

During the Hurricane Rita evacuation, a bus filled with residents from Brighton Gardens, a nursing home in Bellaire, caught on fire and exploded in the city of Wilmer. The September 23, 2005, explosion killed 24 of the 38 residents and employees on the bus. The resulting lawsuit was settled in June 2009. On March 23, 2008, a tour bus carrying Tejano singer Emilio Navaira crashed in Bellaire. By 2008, an increasing number of houses sold for over $1,000,000.

On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police officers confronted Robbie Tolan, the son of former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan&#x27;s family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and his liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, JosÃ© Cruz Jr., son of baseball player JosÃ© Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement told him that he had a warrant for his arrest. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city would investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it had established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if they do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations.

On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition, the family sued the police department and the police officer. The trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.

Teas Nursery closed in 2010; the company president, Tom Teas, intended for the property to be redeveloped into single-family houses. The Teas Nursery business was either going to move to a new location or be liquidated. In December the Rubenstein family bought the Teas property; the family planned to donate it to the City of Bellaire for community purposes. The Teas property has two historic buildings. Scott Rubenstein, who handled negotiations for the Rubenstein family, described the Teas lot as &quot;the last largely undeveloped tract in the city, and frankly, in the inner loop of the city of Houston where you can do something that can be used by people from all around the city.&quot; Mayor of Bellaire Cindy Seigel said, &quot;I am just thrilled we&#x27;ll be able to preserve a historical property that is an important piece of Bellaire&#x27;s history.&quot;

In January 2010, Siegel announced that she would oppose a plan to locate a permanent, privately funded Houston Dynamo stadium at the intersection of South Rice and Westpark, near Bellaire. In April 2010, the Dynamo stadium, now known as BBVA Compass Stadium, was announced as being built in East Downtown Houston.

Andrew Friedberg became the mayor in November 2015 and remained in his position after a 2019 election.

In August 2017, the city was affected by Hurricane Harvey.

As of July 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, 78 people were confirmed to have had the disease; at that time, no Bellaire residents had died from it. Ryan Nickerson of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;local officials&quot; credited the lower population density and the relative wealth of Bellaire residents. The first COVID deaths in the city occurred by March 2021.

== Geography and climate ==
Bellaire is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city is surrounded by Houston, West University Place, and Southside Place.

=== Cityscape ===

Bellaire&#x27;s housing lots are by , allowing for houses larger than those that could be built on typical by West University Place lots. A Bellaire lot can accommodate a house with a detached garage and a swimming pool, while the typical West University Place lot could accommodate a newly constructed Georgian house described by Don Stowers of the &quot;Houston Post&quot; as &quot;lot-hugging&quot;. The more spacious and inexpensive housing lots prompted area home seekers to consider Bellaire.

The original Bellaire housing stock typically consisted of three-bedroom, one-bathroom, post-World War II houses described by Stowers as &quot;smallish&quot;. Because of the attributes, developers did not hesitate to tear these houses down and build new houses. Some individuals chose to renovate their houses instead of having them torn down. Many individuals who would otherwise renovate the houses reconsidered their decisions as the land value increased. In some cases, the land value was higher than the value of the structure on the lot. Some subdivisions had larger houses, particularly the Carroll subdivision south of Bellaire Boulevard and the Braeburn Country Club Estates subdivision between Chimney Rock and Rice. Many of the houses in those subdivisions were built in the 1950s and early 1960s, and many were on lots. Karl Lewis, the vice president and sales manager of John Daugherty Realtors, said that many of the houses were &quot;still quite attractive&quot; and &quot;similar to the large Tanglewood homes.&quot; In 1992 smaller lots in Bellaire were about $50,000 ($93,953.05 in 2021) and up, while larger lots were $300,000 ($563,718.28 in 2021) to $500,000 ($939,530.47 in 2021).

In a 2007 &quot;Houston Press&quot; article John Nova Lomax, a journalist, said that parts of Bellaire&#x27;s downtown had &quot;a certain raffish 1950s charm â the Bellaire Broiler Burger, for example â but it&#x27;s boring.&quot; Lomax stated in a 2008 &quot;Houston Press&quot; article that, due to the growth and dominance of Houston, municipal enclaves with their own services, including Bellaire, &quot;are little more than glorified neighborhoods.&quot;

Many Bellaire streets, such as &quot;Holly,&quot; &quot;Holt,&quot; &quot;Maple,&quot; and &quot;Pine,&quot; are named after trees. The word &quot;Holt&quot; means a small grove or a forest of trees.

One community in Bellaire, Southdale, was developed by William G. Farmington, the developer of Tanglewood. Southdale was originally developed in the late 1940s with two-bedroom houses. The houses were marketed to World War II veterans. The houses were about a fourth as expensive, around $25,000 each ($274,376.73 in 2021 dollars) as Tanglewood houses. Another subdivision in Bellaire is named &quot;Broad Acres.&quot;

Zoning and land use controversies, common throughout Bellaire&#x27;s history, resulted in the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members. The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15, 2007. Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan, one council member, voted for the ban, while the other five members, including Peggy Faulk, voted against the ban.

It belonged to the company prior to its merger with Chevron. The section of the street which the building was on was originally Gulfton Drive, but it was changed to Fournace, after Bellaire resident J.J. Fournace, because the Texaco management did not want their building on a street with a name similar to that of rival company Gulf Oil. In 2016 900 employees, working in company&#x27;s pipeline division and other divisions, worked in the office. The parcel was the only portion of Bellaire zoned to be a &quot;Technical Research Park&quot; or TRP.

In addition, a middle school called Pin Oak Middle School, which was built in 2002, is located in Bellaire.

====History of schools====


Bellaire&#x27;s first school opened in 1909; the school moved to a new site in 1914 and an addition opened in 1927; when the addition opened the school was renamed &quot;Condit.&quot; Horn opened in 1949, Pershing opened in 1927, and Bellaire High School opened in 1955. Condit received a new wing with 12 classrooms in the 1950s. Pin Oak opened in 2002. Pershing&#x27;s current campus opened in January 2007. The current Horn and Lovett buildings were scheduled to open in August 2011. The rebuilds of Horn, Lovett, and Herod Elementary of Houston together had a cost of $49 million and were a part of a $1 billion bond program approved by HISD voters in 2007.

Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire does not have a zoning boundary; before 2012 it drew excess students from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September of that year. In 2012 HISD opened the Mandarin Chinese Language Immersion Magnet School Chinese language-immersion magnet school, in the former Gordon Elementary building. It is HISD&#x27;s first Chinese immersion school. The school was scheduled to move to the St. George Place area of Houston; it was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School&#x27;s baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.

On April 29, 1992, during an attendance boundary hearing committee for Southwest Houston, residents of a small portion of Bellaire zoned to Cunningham Elementary School, a school in Houston that was one block away from the city limits of Bellaire, advocated for a rezoning to Condit Elementary School, a facility in the City of Bellaire that was about away from that section. Condit was about 50% White and had a middle class student body while Cunningham was 95% Hispanic. On May 21, 1992, the HISD board voted to rezone that portion to Condit.

Around the early 1990s portions of Bellaire west of the 610 Loop were zoned to Jane Long Middle School, while portions inside the 610 Loop were zoned to Pershing. During that decade, the Bellaire Area School Improvement Committee, or BASIC, was formed to improve the reputation of HISD in Bellaire and to improve Bellaire area schools. The committee opened after HISD&#x27;s failed attempt to acquire property in Bellaire for the West University relief school. An attempt to buy land at Bissonnet Street at Newcastle Drive in the City of Bellaire for a school to relieve West University Elementary School failed since City of Bellaire officials and parents living in Bellaire complained when they learned that they would not be zoned to the new school while losing what Tim Fleck of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described as &quot;a prime chunk of taxable property.&quot;

After its formation, BASIC installed a gifted and talented magnet at Jane Long, a school which Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of &quot;Fighting to Save Our Urban Schoolsâand Winning!: Lessons from Houston&quot;, described as a school that was &quot;unacceptable&quot; to Bellaire residents since it was less than 10% white. McAdams added that even with the new program, to many parents in Bellaire, Long was &quot;never going to be acceptable&quot; due to the overwhelming Hispanic presence. Therefore, there was a proposal to convert Gordon into a small middle school for Bellaire. The school would have space for about 500 students and would be at least 50% White, so it was popular among many Bellaire residents, particularly those outside of the 610 Loop. However those inside the 610 Loop did not want to lose access to Pershing, a full service middle school that was about 40% White. An attendance boundary committee for at HISD met from December 1992 to March 1993. McAdams wrote that the committee was &quot;an all-out war&quot; between the two sides. In February 1993 pro-Gordon persons argued that HISD should purchase a commercial building north of Long and renovate it into an elementary school which would relieve Gordon Elementary and other overcrowded are schools. McAdams wrote that the staff members of HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo &quot;liked the idea, but unfortunately, on close examination the building proved to be inadequate.&quot; In April 1993 the HISD board declared that the Gordon campus would continue to be an elementary school. McAdams wrote that the Gordon supporters and many Bellaire residents were &quot;furious&quot;.

=== Primary and secondary private schools ===

Three independent (private) schools, including Episcopal High School (9â12), The Post Oak School (Montessori Kâ8), and the Veritas Christian Academy (Kâ8), are located in Bellaire.

As of 2010 METRO has proposed to build the Bellaire Station as part of the METRORail University Line.

In Bellaire&#x27;s early history, Bellaire Boulevard and a historic street car line connected Bellaire to Houston. The street car line, which ran a four-mile (6Â km) stretch from central Bellaire to Houston&#x27;s Main Street, started construction in 1909. The streetcar line consisted of one railway track and an overhead electric wire. A waiting pavilion and a turnaround loop were located at the terminus in Bellaire. The Houston Electric Company had simultaneously constructed a south end line from Eagle Avenue to what is now Fannin Street to connect to the Bellaire Boulevard line. Service, with one required transfer at Eagle Avenue, began on December 28, 1910. The streetcar was nicknamed the &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot;. On September 26, 1927, the trolley line was abandoned and replaced by a bus line. This was due to frequent derailments caused by a worn-out track and the advent of the automobile. In 1985, a similar streetcar was acquired in Portugal and brought to Bellaire for permanent display.

<text>Crosby is a census-designated place in Harris County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,417 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The site north of U.S. Route 90 (according to some) was an encampment nicknamed Lick Skillet in 1823 by Humphrey Jackson, one of the 300 original colonists to settle Texas. The name &quot;Lick Skillet&quot; came from the phrase, &quot;The East Texas oxen team drivers sipped the spring sweet water and licked their skillets clean.&quot;

Humphrey Jackson (1784â1833) moved to Texas from Louisiana in September 1823 and built a log cabin outside Austin&#x27;s colony on the San Jacinto River, west of the site of present-day Crosby. On August 16, 1824, the Baron de Bastrop granted him title to a league and a labor of land, including the place where he had settled, in what is now Harris County. Jackson next petitioned the Mexican government to form the San Jacinto District under control of the Austin colony; he was elected &quot;alcalde&quot; of the new district in 1824, 1825, and 1827, and served as ex officio militia captain of the San Jacinto area. Jackson was buried at Crosby. Jackson&#x27;s Bayou in eastern Harris County is probably named for him.

In 1860, the town was named Gentry after President of the Sabine and Galveston Bay Railroad and Lumber Company, A. M. Gentry who constructed the 41 miles of railroad from Houston to Liberty in what was called the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, Texas Division. The first general store was built in 1865 by Charlie Karcher, and thereafter the town would become a shipping and retail center for lumber and agricultural products.

The railroad was eventually taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad and rebuilt. The platform which had been built with a sign showing the name &quot;Gentry&quot; was located and a new depot built. In 1877, the town was renamed by former judge, state representative, legislator, and Vice President of the railroad, Josiah Frasier Crosby, and a post office was established. By 1884 Crosby reported a population of 50, a school, a Baptist church, and a general store. In 1905 it had one school with four teachers and 122 students. As of 1929, the population was about 600, but the Great Depression reduced this number by half. World War II brought the population to over 900, and the population continued to grow.

For a brief 19 days in 1953 (from December 19 to 31), the town of Crosby briefly changed the name to Hope, Texas in order to partake in a contest conducted by comedian Bob Hope. Reported in a news transcript from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth, Texas; &quot;Hope recently announced that he would like to have a pretty girl from every city in the nation named Hope to appear on his television show next Tuesday. Maine, Rhode Island, Michigan, Kansas and Indiana are sending representatives, so the folks in Crosby decided they&#x27;de [sic] get into the act. The result: they changed the town&#x27;s name to Hope and set about naming a queen. The town will keep its new name until New Years Day, then it will become Crosby, Texas, again.&quot;

<text>Deer Park is a city in the U.S. state of Texas within the HoustonâSugarÂ LandâBaytown metropolitan area. The city is located in HarrisÂ County and is situated in Southeast Harris County. At the 2020 U.S. census, the population of DeerÂ Park was 34,495.

== History ==

Deer Park was founded in 1892 by Simeon H. West, a farmer, retired legislator, and much-traveled adventurer from Illinois. He named the town for the large number of deer that roamed the Gulf plains. A railroad station opened later that year and a post office followed in 1893.

The subdivision was established in 1893 and was the site of a Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway station by about 1894. A Deer Park post office was established in 1893, discontinued in 1919, and reestablished in 1930. In 1896, the community, with a population of forty, had a hotel, a general store, and three resident carpenters. By 1922, Deer Park had dwindled down to almost nothing with four houses, one little schoolhouse, and an old hotel with a few scattered shacks along the railroad right-of-way. In 1928, Shell Oil Company broke ground on a new refinery. In the 1930s, an independent school district was established. By 1940, the population had grown to 100. By 1946, however, the area began to flourish as Deer Park became the site of refineries and toluene plants for the production of TNT.

The citizens of Deer Park voted to incorporate on December 12, 1948, and a few weeks later Earl E. Dunn became the first mayor.
Because of the 1948 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Deer Park&#x27;s territory into its city limits. The first city council meeting was held on February 7, 1949. The population had grown to 700 by 1948, to 5,000 by 1960 with a fire station, city hall, playground parks and an independent city water supply. A public library was begun in 1962 on Center Street. Population was 12,773 in 1970, and 28,520 in 2000. This growth has been fueled by the growth of the petrochemical industry as well as the growth of business along the Houston Ship Channel. Deer Park has a school district with 14 campuses, a city library, community theater, municipal court building, three fire stations, numerous city parks and recreational facilities, state-of-the-art water and sewer processing facilities, a post office, several hotels, 14 major industries as well as several light industrial companies. Today, Deer Park has approximately 9,000 homes and more than 30,000 residents.

Deer Park is near the site of the Battle of San Jacinto, where, on April 21, 1836, Texas won its independence from Mexico. Because the initial surrender treaty after the battle was drafted in Dr. George Moffitt Patrick&#x27;s cabin, Deer Park bills itself as the &quot;Birthplace of Texas&quot;. The original cabin was located on Buffalo Bayou where Rohm and Haas, now owned by Dow Chemical Company, established a chemical plant in Deer Park. A replica of Dr. Patrick&#x27;s cabin is in front of the Theatre/Courts Building on Center Street. The Texas State Historical sign marker was relocated from the Dow Chemical parking lot to the replica log cabin home of Dr. Patrick located at the Theatre/Courts Building.

=== Shell Chemical plant explosion ===
On June 22, 1997, an ethylene explosion occurred at the nearby Shell Chemical Company plant that was heard and felt as far as away. While no evacuation of the city was ordered, residents living within a mile west of the plant were advised to remain inside their homes.

=== Intercontinental Terminals Company&#x27;s chemical fire ===
On March 17, 2019, a chemical fire broke out at Intercontinental Terminals Company. The fire, which was caused from a pump seal failure, eventually spread to a dozen tanks.
The resultant fire and smoke plume could be seen for miles and lasted for three days. The tanks involved in the fire contained chemicals including xylene, naptha, pyrolysis gasoline (Pygas), and toluene. Deer Park residents were required to shelter in place during the fire. A probe by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board concluded that leaking chemicals had accumulated in an above-ground storage tank for about 30 minutes before they ignited. In April 2024, the state of Texas and the U.S. government reached a $6.6 million settlement with ITC; the money will be used to reimburse the state and federal government for damages caused by the blaze.

=== January 24, 2023 tornado ===

Deer Park has been known for several smaller and less destructive tornadoes in its past, but on January 24, 2023, a large EF3 tornado hit downtown Deer Park. It caused damage most notably to the local skating rink, a nursing home, an animal shelter and knocked out power to many areas, including schools in the Deer Park Independent School District. Schools were still in session at the time of the tornado, but no students or teachers in the affected schools were injured or killed. Entire neighborhoods were severely damaged as a result of the tornado. The tornado prompted the first ever tornado emergency issued by the National Weather Service in League City.

=== 2023 Shell refinery explosion ===
In May 2023, a Shell petrochemical plant in Deer Park, causing a three-day blaze that resulted in toxic contamination in the air and water. The Shell plant had a long history of chemical incidents between 2016 and 2022, including 68 emissions events that released 974,847 pounds of toxic emissions into the air. The company had eight &quot;excessive&quot; events at the plant during that time.

=== 2023 Emergency siren overhaul ===
Deer Park&#x27;s 10 emergency warning sirens began experiencing failures over the years following a 2019 upgrade on the former siren system. In August 2023, the City of Deer Park replaced all 10 outdoor warning sirens with rotating, more efficient sirens. That also included strobe lights on each siren across the city to make fit for the hearing-impaired. 17-year-old deaf citizen William Stokes, presented the idea to the city during the replacement project. Emergency sirens are tested every Saturday at 12:00 PM.

<text>Galena Park is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States, within the HoustonâSugar LandâBaytown metropolitan area. The population was 10,740 at the 2020 census. The population is predominantly Hispanic.

Issac Batterson and his family settled in the area in 1833; it was a part of the Ezekiel Thomas survey. The area of Galena Park began as the settlement of Clinton in 1835. The center of what would become Galena Park was a tract that Batterson purchased from the estate of Ezekiel Thomas. The settlement originally served as a farming and ranching community, but in the 1880s transformed into a railroad center along the new Port of Houston. With the coming of the petrochemical industry in the early 1900s, Clinton again transformed into a refinery center.

Clinton attempted to establish a post office in 1935, but the request was denied, as another Clinton, Texas, had established the name. The settlement&#x27;s name was changed to Galena Park after the Galena Signal Oil Company of Texas, which built the first refinery there. Galena Park&#x27;s original name survives today as the name of a major street in the city, Clinton Drive. Because of the 1935 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Galena Park&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. By the late 1930s Houston was growing as a port, so Galena Park expanded. Since the 1940s, area residents considered the city to be a part of greater Houston.

The economy of Galena Park began to suffer in the early 1980s, when cranes used to haul ship cargo were reduced; prior to the early 1980s, a team of workers, known on the docks as longshoremen, took up to one week to unload cargo off a ship. Many lived in the Galena Park area and contributed to its local economy. The use of cranes, however, led to ships unloading all cargo in less than one day. The 1980s also hit Galena Park&#x27;s economy with layoffs from the steel mills as the U.S. steel contracted due to overseas competition. The economy further decreased after the September 11 attacks, when seaport administrators tightened security rules that governed whether sailors could leave ships docked at port.

<text>Hedwig Village is a city in Harris County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,370 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Spring Branch Memorial area was originally settled by German immigrants in the 19th century. Hedwig Village&#x27;s name originates from Hedwig Road, which was built on the property of Hedwig Jankowski Schroeder; Schroeder emigrated from Germany to Texas in 1906 to help her sister operate a business in Houston. There she met, and married, Henry Schroeder, son of Jacob Schroeder, one of the area&#x27;s earliest immigrants. They established their home and farmed in the area now known as Hedwig Village.

In the mid 1950s, efforts to form a Spring Branch municipality failed. Hedwig Village was incorporated on December 23, 1954 and established a zoning ordinance in 1955. Because of the 1955 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Hedwig Village&#x27;s territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated. Hedwig Village incorporated because residents feared that Houston would annex them. Around 1963, residents of Hedwig Villages and other Memorial villages wanted what Gia Gustilo of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; referred to as &quot;a more country-like atmosphere in close proximity to Houston.&quot; Laverne Coller, a resident, quoted in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; who moved to Hedwig Village in 1963, was paraphrased by Gustilo as &quot;Hedwig Village is unique among the villages in that it was the only municipality to accept the existing commercial sector, which was quite a bonus to the city&#x27;s revenues.&quot;

In 1960, the city had 1,182 residents. By 1966, the community had two schools, one library, and two churches. By 1970, the city had 3,255 residents, and in 1971 the city completed a park. The city had 3,994 residents in 1980 and 2,616 in 1990. Coller said in 2003 that many children of early Hedwig Village residents had begun to settle the Hedwig Village area. In 2003 Coller, as paraphrased by Gustilo, said &quot;Despite the changes, several of her old neighbors remain and the camaraderie with new residents is good.&quot;

==Geography==
Hedwig Village is located at (29.779990, â95.519412).

=== Cityscape ===
When Hedwig Village was first established, houses were similar to ranch houses and there were more private dirt roads than paved streets. Katy Road (now Interstate 10, Katy Freeway) had many neighborhood stores, according to Laverne Coller.

In 2003, Edith Spang, a former librarian at the Spring Branch Memorial Branch Library quoted in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, said that as time passed, the civic locations, including the library; the medical care facilities; the shopping venues; and the traffic were all parts of Hedwig Village&#x27;s growth Spang remarked that Hedwig Village &quot;has definitely changed along with the other villages. It&#x27;s lost the sleepy little country atmosphere.&quot; Coller said that none of the stores that had originally existed when she moved still existed by 2003.
