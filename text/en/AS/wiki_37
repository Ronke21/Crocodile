<text>Working Girl is a 1988 American romantic comedy drama film directed by Mike Nichols, written by Kevin Wade, and starring Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Cusack, and Melanie Griffith. Its plot follows an ambitious secretary from Staten Island working in mergers and acquisitions. The secretary, who has been going to business night school, pitches a profitable idea, only to have her new boss attempt to take credit. When her boss is laid up with a broken leg, she secretly takes over her boss&#x27;s role to prove her capabilities in the corporate world. 

The film&#x27;s opening sequence follows Manhattan-bound commuters on the Staten Island Ferry accompanied by Carly Simon&#x27;s song &quot;Let the River Run&quot;, for which she received the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, making her the first artist to win this trio of awards for a song composed and written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist.
The film was met with critical acclaim, and was a major box office success, grossing a worldwide total of $103 million.

&quot;Working Girl&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for Griffith, while both Weaver and Joan Cusack were nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The film won four Golden Globes (from six nominations), including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Musical or Comedy for Griffith, and Best Supporting Actress for Weaver. It also received three BAFTA nominations: Best Actress for Griffith, Best Supporting Actress for Weaver, and Best Original Score for Simon.

==Plot==
Tess McGill is a working-class Irish-American woman from Staten Island who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder to an executive position. Despite holding a business degree earned through evening classes, her boss and male co-workers at the stockbroker firm in lower Manhattan where she works as a secretary treat her like a bimbo, even though they benefit from her intelligence and business instincts. After reaching her limit with her boss&#x27;s humiliations, Tess dramatically quits.

Tess then lands a job as an administrative assistant to Katharine Parker, a young associate in Mergers and Acquisitions. At first, Katharine seems supportive of Tess, encouraging her to share ideas, but eventually tells Tess her proposed purchase of a radio network by Trask Industries would not work out.

When Katharine breaks her leg skiing, she asks Tess to house-sit. While there, Tess discovers meeting notes that reveal Katharine plans to pass off the Trask Industries idea as her own. She later returns home to find her live-in boyfriend having sex with another woman. He attempts to reconcile and proposes marriage, but she responds ambivalently, and they end things. With her boss away, Tess decides to use Katharine&#x27;s connections and clothes to move ahead with her merger plans. With the help of her friend Cyn, Tess cuts her hair and borrows Katherine&#x27;s stylish clothing to look more professional. Tess schedules a meeting with Jack Trainer, a mergers and acquisitions associate from another company. The night before, she attends a dinner on Katharine&#x27;s behalf, hosted by Trainer&#x27;s firm in an attempt to say hello prior to their meeting. Trainer is attracted to and approaches Tess at the bar but does not reveal his name, even after she inquires whether he knows a Jack Trainer. Tess eventually leaves and he follows, taking her back to his apartment after she passes out in a cab from a combination of Valium and alcohol.

Tess leaves early the next morning, believing them to have slept together, to attend her meeting with Trainer and is surprised to see he is the man from the previous night. They both feign non-recognition. Although Tess lacks confidence during the meeting with Trainer and his associates and leaves thinking it was a failure, Jack soon arrives at her office, telling her they did not sleep together and that he wants to move forward with her idea. Together, they prepare the financials for the merger proposal, and they give in to their attraction, ending up in bed. However, Tess is tempted to confess the truth about the idea&#x27;s origins, but she demurs after discovering Jack is also involved with Katharine, whom he planned to break up with before her injury.

Katharine returns home on the day of the merger meeting, and while Tess is helping her get settled, Katharine brings up the Trask merger, saying she was intending to take it to Jack and give Tess credit eventually, but was restricted due to Jack&#x27;s strict ethical code preventing him from looking at other&#x27;s work without verifying the source after being accused of stealing himself. Jack eventually arrives to end things with Katharine. Tess accidentally leaves her appointment book in Katharine&#x27;s apartment before leaving for the same meeting, leading to Katharine discovering Tess&#x27;s deception.

At the meeting, Tess asks Jack whether he has such an ethical code, and he denies this or that he was ever accused of stealing. Katharine confronts Tess during the meeting, outing her as her secretary and accusing her of stealing the idea. Tess feels she cannot defend herself and leaves, apologizing profusely. Days later, Tess is offered an entry-level job with Trask Industries after Trask confronts Katharine, who is unable to explain where she got the merger idea and promises to have her fired for her actions. Jack and Tess embrace and start a relationship.

On her first day at Trask, Tess meets a colleague named Alice, who Tess initially assumes will be her new boss but who she then realizes is actually her (Tess&#x27;s) secretary. Tess insists they work together as colleagues, showing she will be very different from Katharine. Finally, Tess calls her friend Cyn from her own office to tell her that she has made it.

==Cast==

==Production==

===Development===
Screenwriter Kevin Wade was inspired to write the screenplay after visiting New York City in 1984 and witnessing throngs of career women walking through the streets in tennis shoes while carrying their high-heels.

===Casting===
Melanie Griffith read the screenplay for &quot;Working Girl&quot; over a year before the production began, and expressed interest in playing the role of Tess McGill. Approximately a year later, Mike Nichols agreed to direct the film after reading the screenplay while shooting his film &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; in Arkansas. Following Nichols&#x27; attachment, Griffith had a formal audition for the role. Molly Ringwald auditioned but was deemed &quot;too young.&quot; Nichols was so determined for Griffith to have the part that he threatened to drop out of the production if the studio, 20th Century Fox, would not hire her.

Following the casting of Sigourney Weaver and Harrison Ford—both major stars at that point—the studio agreed to cast Griffith, as they felt Weaver and Ford&#x27;s involvement gave them a higher chance of box-office success.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Working Girl&quot; began on February 16, 1988, in New York City. Many scenes were shot in the New Brighton section of Staten Island in New York City. One half-day of shooting to complete the skiing accident scene took place in New Jersey. Four different buildings portrayed the offices of Petty Marsh—1 State Street Plaza; the Midday Club, which served as the company&#x27;s club room; the lobby of 7 World Trade Center (one of the buildings destroyed in the September 11 attacks); and the reading floor of the L. F. Rothschild Building. One Chase Manhattan Plaza was featured at the end of the film as the Trask Industries building. Filming completed on April 27, 1988, with the final sequence being shot on the Staten Island Ferry.

Throughout the shoot, Griffith was in the midst of struggling with a years-long alcohol and cocaine addiction, which at times interfered with the shoot. &quot;There were a lot of things that happened on &quot;Working Girl&quot; that I did that were not right,&quot; Griffith recalled in 2019. &quot;It was the late &#x27;80s. There was a lot going on party-wise in New York. There was a lot of cocaine. There was a lot of temptation.&quot; After Nichols realized that Griffith had arrived on set high on cocaine, the shoot was temporarily shut down for 24 hours. Griffith elaborated on the experience:

Three weeks after filming was completed, Griffith entered a rehabilitation facility to receive treatment for her addiction. Ironically, according to the biography &quot;Mike Nichols: A Life&quot;, written by Mark Harris, Nichols had been battling a cocaine addiction of his own around the same time.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s main theme &quot;Let the River Run&quot; was written, arranged, and performed by American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and won her an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy Award for Best Original Song, making Simon the first artist to win this trio of awards for a song written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist. As a single, &quot;Let the River Run&quot; reached No. 49 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart in early 1989.

The film&#x27;s additional soundtrack was scored by Simon and Rob Mounsey. The soundtrack album was released by Arista Records on August 29, 1989, and peaked at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Release==

===Box office===
The film was released in the United States and Canada on December 21, 1988, in 601 theaters before expanding to 608 theaters on Friday, December 23; 1,046 theaters on Christmas Day; and 1,051 on Monday, December 26. It grossed $4.7 million in its opening four-day weekend and $5.6 million in its first 6 days. It went on to gross $63.8 million in the United States and Canda and $39.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $103 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Working Girl&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1989 by CBS/Fox Video; &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, one of the shorts from &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; featuring &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, was included before the movie on the VHS release. The film was released on DVD on April 17, 2001, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Special features included two theatrical trailers and three TV spots. The film was released on Blu-ray on January 6, 2015. The special features from the DVD release were carried over for the Blu-ray release.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Working Girl&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. It has an 83% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews, and an average score of 7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is; &quot;A buoyant corporate Cinderella story, &quot;Working Girl&quot; has the right cast, right story, and right director to make it all come together.&quot; The film also has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 at Metacritic based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;The plot of &quot;Working Girl&quot; is put together like clockwork. It carries you along while you&#x27;re watching it, but reconstruct it later and you&#x27;ll see the craftsmanship&quot;. In her review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley described Melanie Griffith as &quot;luminous as Marilyn Monroe, as adorable as one of Disney&#x27;s singing mice. She clearly has the stuff of a megastar, and the movie glows from her&quot;. Janet Maslin, in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;Mike Nichols, who directed &quot;Working Girl&quot;, also displays an uncharacteristically blunt touch, and in its later stages the story remains lively but seldom has the perceptiveness or acuity of Mr. Nichols&#x27;s best work&quot;. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;Kevin Wade shows this in his smart screenplay, which is full of the atmospheric pressures that allow stars to collide. Director Mike Nichols knows this in his bones. He encourages Weaver to play (brilliantly) an airy shrew. He gives Ford a boyish buoyancy and Griffith the chance to be a grownup mesmerizer&quot;.

<doc id="129430" wikidata="Q1544743" url="?curid=129430" title="Greenfield, Ohio">
<text>Greenfield is a village in Highland and Ross counties, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,339.

==History==
Greenfield was named for its rural appearance, and was founded by General Duncan McArthur in 1799.

Most of Greenfield&#x27;s early settlers moved to Ohio to work in anti-slavery efforts. In April 1833, the Abolition Society of Paint Valley was founded. Its main effort was to educate and do missionary work in the stance of ending slavery. The Abolition Society of Paint Valley was later disbanded but was quickly re-organized as the Greenfield Antislavery Society. Records become thin due to the large number of citizens helping African Americans to gain freedom. Greenfield played a major part in the ending of slavery. Former slaves passed through the area on their way to Canada during the operation of the Underground Railroad with much help from Greenfield&#x27;s community members.

In 1893, the first African American owned car company was first founded in Greenfield. The C.R. Patterson and Sons company started as a horse-drawn buggy company but later produced cars, buses, and trucks. C.R. Patterson, alongside J.P. Lowe, moved to Greenfield where they founded the car company. The C.R. Patterson and Sons car company provided Greenfield schools buses to conduct routes. Other industries in Greenfield include Ruckers Quarry, which day and night quarried stone such as limestone on a large scale for the Cincinnati market. Another industry was Harps Manufacturing which was most well known for the Never-fail Oil Can, which was originally designed by Eugene Arnott but then perfected by Harp&#x27;s Manufacturing.

Edward Lee McClain High School opened on September 23, 1915. People who wished to attend paid a fee of 15 cents for admission. It was the first school in Ohio to have an indoor swimming pool, which is still there today, with minor construction revisions.

In 1988, the 29.5-mile railroad line connecting the city to the national rail network was scheduled to be decommissioned, but Greenfield bought it for $2.4 million and kept it operational in order to retain a transportation outlet for the local manufacturing industry. This also made the city the smallest in the U.S. to own its own rail line.

===Historic sites===
Much of Greenfield&#x27;s early history concentrates on the Travellers&#x27; Rest Inn at the eastern end of Jefferson Street. Constructed in 1812, it was the village&#x27;s first stone building. It also served as its first post office, and was the space for its first doctor&#x27;s office. Now operated as a museum, the inn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Samuel Smith House and Tannery is also listed on the National Register.

<text>Driving Miss Daisy is a 1989 American comedy drama film directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Alfred Uhry, based on his 1987 play. The film stars Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman, and Dan Aykroyd. Freeman reprised his role from the original Off-Broadway production.

The story defines Daisy and her point of view through a network of relationships and emotions by focusing on her home life, synagogue, friends, family, fears, and concerns over a twenty-five-year period.

&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was a critical and commercial success upon its release and at the 62nd Academy Awards received nine nominations, and won four: Best Picture, Best Actress (for Tandy), Best Makeup, and Best Adapted Screenplay. , it is the most recent PG-rated film to have won Best Picture.

==Plot==
In 1948, Daisy Werthan, or Miss Daisy, a 72-year-old wealthy, Jewish, widowed, retired schoolteacher, lives alone in Atlanta, Georgia, except for a black housekeeper, Idella, who comes in daily. When Miss Daisy accidentally drives her 1946 Chrysler Windsor into her neighbor&#x27;s yard, her 40-year-old son, Boolie, buys her a Hudson Commodore and hires 60-year-old Hoke Colburn, a black chauffeur, as Miss Daisy can no longer drive due to her being a high insurance risk. Boolie tells Hoke that Miss Daisy may not appreciate his efforts, but she cannot fire him, because Boolie is his employer. At first, Miss Daisy refuses to let anyone drive her, but Hoke&#x27;s patience pays off, and she reluctantly accepts the first two trips; one to the Piggly Wiggly supermarket, the other to her synagogue. Then she tries to get Boolie to fire Hoke after discovering a can of salmon missing from her pantry. However, Hoke, unprompted, admits to eating the salmon, and offers a replacement.

As Miss Daisy and Hoke spend time together, she comes to appreciate his many skills. She teaches him to read for the first time using her teaching skills and resources. After Idella dies in the spring of 1963, rather than hire a new housekeeper, Miss Daisy decides to care for her own house and have Hoke do the cooking and the driving. Meanwhile, Hoke buys the cars in which he drives Miss Daisy, after they are traded in for newer models, and he negotiates a higher salary with Boolie.

The film explores racism against African Americans and antisemitism in the South. After her synagogue is bombed, Miss Daisy realizes that she is also a victim of prejudice. American society is undergoing radical changes, and Miss Daisy attends a dinner at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gives a speech. Boolie declines when she invites him to the dinner, suggesting that Miss Daisy invite Hoke. She waits until the last moment, asking Hoke to be her guest during the car ride to the event. She attends the dinner alone while Hoke, who is insulted by the manner of the invitation, listens to the speech on the car radio.

One morning in 1971, Hoke arrives at the house to find Miss Daisy agitated and showing signs of dementia: she believes that she is a young teacher again. Hoke calms her down. In that conversation, she calls Hoke her &quot;best friend&quot;. Boolie arranges for Miss Daisy to enter a retirement home.

In 1973, Hoke, now 85 and rapidly losing his eyesight, retires. Boolie, now 65, drives Hoke to the retirement home to visit Miss Daisy, now 97. The two catch up, and Hoke gently feeds her Thanksgiving pie. The final scene is an image of the black Cadillac driving on a road.

==Cast==
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was given a limited release on December 15, 1989, earning $73,745 in three theaters. The film was given a wide release on January 26, 1990, earning $5,705,721 over its opening weekend in 895 theaters, becoming the number one film in the United States. It remained at number 1 the following week but was knocked off the top spot in its third weekend of wide release by &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;. It returned to number one the next weekend and remained there for a fourth week. The film ultimately grossed $106,593,296 in North America, and $39,200,000 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $145,793,296. The film was released in the United Kingdom on February 23, 1990.

===Critical reaction===
&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was well received by critics, with particular praise for the screenplay and performances by Freeman, Tandy and Aykroyd. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 85% rating based on reviews from 104 critics, with an average score of 7.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;While it&#x27;s fueled in part by outdated stereotypes, &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; takes audiences on a heartwarming journey with a pair of outstanding actors.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 81 based on 17 reviews. CinemaScore similarly reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; declared &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; one of the best films of 1989. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;a film of great love and patience&quot; and wrote, &quot;It is an immensely subtle film, in which hardly any of the most important information is carried in the dialogue and in which body language, tone of voice or the look in an eye can be the most important thing in a scene. After so many movies in which shallow and violent people deny their humanity and ours, what a lesson to see a film that looks into the heart.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave the film a positive review, calling Tandy&#x27;s performance &quot;glorious&quot; and opining, &quot;This is Tandy&#x27;s finest two hours onscreen in a film career that goes back to 1932.&quot; The performances of Tandy and Freeman were also praised by Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who observed, &quot;The two actors manage to be highly theatrical without breaking out of the realistic frame of the film.&quot;

On the other hand, the film has been criticized for its handling of the issue of racism. Candice Russell of the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; described Freeman&#x27;s character as having a &quot;toadying manner&quot; which was &quot;painful to see&quot;, and said that the film was ultimately &quot;one scene after another of a pompous old lady issuing orders and a servant trying to comply by saying &#x27;yassum.&#x27;&quot; The film&#x27;s nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards over Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; was controversial. Lee later reflected on the controversial decision by saying that &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was &quot;not being taught in film schools all across the world like &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; is.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; received 9 Academy Award nominations and also achieved the following distinctions in Oscar history:
* It is the only film based on an off-Broadway production ever to win Best Picture.
* Jessica Tandy (at age 80) became the oldest winner in history to win Best Actress.
* It was the first Best Picture winner since &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; in 1932 to not also receive a Best Director nomination (this has occurred three times since, &quot;Argo&quot; in 2012, &quot;Green Book&quot; in 2018, and &quot;CODA&quot; in 2021; &quot;Wings&quot; the first to win Best Picture in 1927 did not have a nomination for director William A. Wellman). In his opening monologue at the 62nd awards ceremony, host Billy Crystal made fun of this irony by calling it &quot;the film that apparently directed itself&quot;.
* As of 2024, it is the latest Best Picture winner that was rated PG. All the winners since have been rated PG-13 or R.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* AFI 100 Years 100 Cheers – No.77

===Oscar &quot;test of time&quot; recount===
In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past close run decisions. Academy members indicated that, given a second chance, they would award the 1990 Oscar for Best Picture to &quot;My Left Foot&quot; instead.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who won a BMI Film Music Award and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television for his work. The score was performed entirely by Zimmer, done electronically using samplers and synthesizers, and did not feature a single live instrument. There is a scene, however, in which the &quot;Song to the Moon&quot; from the opera &quot;Rusalka&quot; by Antonín Dvořák is heard on a radio as sung by slovak sopranist Gabriela Beňačková.

Similarities have been noted between the main theme and the &quot;plantation&quot; folk song &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread&quot;. The soundtrack was issued on Varèse Sarabande.

==Home media==
The film was also successful on home video. It was released on DVD in the United States on April 30, 1997, and the special edition was released on February 4, 2003. The movie was first released on Blu-ray disc in Germany, and was finally released on Blu-ray in the United States in a special edition digibook in January 2013 by Warner Bros.

In the UK, Warner Home Video released &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; on VHS in 1989. &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; was then released on DVD in 2005 by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and then in 2008 by Pathé through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

<text>New London is a village in Huron County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,416 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first permanent settlement at New London was made in 1816. The village was named after New London, Connecticut, the native home of a share of the early settlers. New London was incorporated in 1853. In the early 20th century, New London (popularly known as &quot;Ferretville&quot;) was the center of the American ferret industry, with the surrounding region raising around 20,000 ferrets annually.

==Geography==
The village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. New London is bound to the north, west, and east by New London Township, and to the south by Ruggles Township in Ashland County. The village is located south of Lake Erie.

===Cultural geography===

New London&#x27;s economy is closely tied to agriculture and manufacturing. Although well within the Great Lakes region (a sub region of the Midwest) and arguably located at the center of the Rust Belt, significant influences from New England and the South have contributed to New London&#x27;s cultural identity. The village was founded by settlers from Connecticut (and to a lesser extent other parts of the Northeast) along with neighboring communities in the Firelands in the early nineteenth century. The village&#x27;s New England heritage is most evident in its architecture, the names of local families, and the presence of a village green (a common characteristic of many cities and towns in Northern Ohio).

In the mid twentieth century, at the climax of the manufacturing boom in the Great Lakes region, New London welcomed an influx of new residents from the Appalachian South - primarily Eastern Kentucky - to work in fields and factories locally and in nearby metropolitan Cleveland. Today, the influence of these Southerners is most evident in the hospitality and kindness of New London&#x27;s residents, and the close-knit community that has grown up in the midst of such diversity.

<text>Norwalk is a city in and the county seat of Huron County, Ohio, United States. The population was 17,068 at the 2020 census. The city is the center of the Norwalk micropolitan area and part of the Cleveland–Akron–Canton combined statistical area. Norwalk is located approximately south of Lake Erie, west/southwest of Cleveland, southeast of Toledo, and west/northwest of Akron.

==History==

On July 11, 1779, Norwalk, Connecticut, was burned by British Loyalists under Lieutenant-general William Tryon. In 1800, the U.S. federal government gave an area in the Connecticut Western Reserve as compensation; and in 1806, 13 men arrived to make the first survey of what would be called the Firelands.

Between 1806 and 1810, many families made the trip to look over land they had purchased in the Firelands. During the War of 1812, because of the fear of British and Indian raids, settlement of the Huron County area came almost to a standstill. However, in 1815, Platt Benedict of Danbury, Connecticut, visited and examined the present site of Norwalk. He returned to Danbury and purchased of land with an eye toward establishing a town.

In July 1817, Benedict returned to Norwalk with his family and immediately built a house. This was the first permanent residence established within the limits of Norwalk. In May 1818, the county seat was successfully removed from Avery, Ohio, to Norwalk.

Benedict was the first white permanent settler in Norwalk, when he came with his wife, Sarah DeForest, and their children. His descendants remained prominent in the area. On January 19, 1936, the Sandusky Daily Register published the obituary of John L. Severance, the multi-millionaire businessman and Standard Oil founding member. In the obituary, he is listed as &quot;a great grandson of Platt Benedict, one of the founders of [Norwalk, Ohio]&quot;.

Among the earliest settlers of Norwalk were other men of wealth and education. They brought with them not only the customs, but also the architecture of New England. Many of their homes are still standing today. In 1881, Norwalk&#x27;s population reached the required minimum to incorporate as a city, and the City of Norwalk dates from April 12, 1881.

The gastroenteritis-causing virus norovirus is named after the city. It was initially named the &quot;Norwalk Agent&quot;. The virus was discovered via electron microscopy of a stool sample from the town in 1972.

==Geography==
Norwalk is located at the center of the Firelands, a subregion of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The subregion&#x27;s name recalls the founding of the area as one for settlers from cities in Connecticut that were largely destroyed by fire during the Revolutionary War. Several locations in the Firelands were named in honor of those cities, including Danbury, Greenwich, Groton, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, Norwich, and Ridgefield. Other locations were named for the settlers, including Clarksfield, Perkins, and Sherman.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city of Norwalk is bound by Norwalk Township in each direction and a small portion of the west side is bound by Ridgefield Township. The city is located approximately south of Lake Erie.

<doc id="129452" wikidata="Q2233885" url="?curid=129452" title="Willard, Ohio">
<text>Willard is a city in southwestern Huron County, Ohio, United States, approximately southwest of Norwalk. The population was 6,197 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The original name of Willard was Chicago, named for the junction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s line to Sandusky (the Sandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad) and the branch west to Chicago (the Baltimore and Ohio and Chicago Railroad). Later the Akron and Chicago Junction Railroad was built east from the junction, providing a more direct route between the Northeastern United States and Chicago.

With the name &quot;Chicago&quot;, passengers would mistake the community for Chicago, Illinois, so they changed the name to Chicago Junction, however, the word &quot;junction&quot; did not fit on boards at the time so it did not fix the problem. In 1917, to finally rectify the confusion, the town changed its name to Willard, after the then president of the B&amp;O, Daniel Willard. Willard officially became a city in the year of 1960

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

To the south of Willard are located the unincorporated communities of Celeryville and New Haven, plus the planned development of Holiday Lakes to the north.

The Welsh-American Heritage Museum is located in the former Welsh Congregational Church on East Main St in the Village.

Oak Hill&#x27;s early industrial history included Jefferson Furnace (which is acclaimed for producing Iron for the Iron Clad Monitor) being located a couple miles west of the Village and other iron furnaces being located in the surrounding region.

Few firebrick related businesses operate in the Oak Hill area to date.

The Oak Hill Union Local School District was formed around 1890, with the first graduating class of Oak Hill High School being the Class of 1893.

<text>Bergholz ( ) is a village in northwestern Jefferson County, Ohio, United States. The population was 544 at the 2020 census. The village&#x27;s name is German and translates to &quot;mountain timber&quot;. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area.

==History==
Initially, the Bergholz area was a settlement called Nebo. Modern Bergholz had its start in 1883 when the railroad was built through that territory in order to access a mine. The settlement was named Bergholz in honor of one of the mine owners. It was incorporated as a village in 1906.

During Morgan&#x27;s Raid, a Union victory in the Civil War in 1863, Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan traveled through the Bergholz area on his way to defeat at the Battle of Salineville.

===Amish beard cutting scandal===
In September 2012, a group of 16 Amish men and women from the Bergholz Community, were convicted on federal hate-crime and conspiracy charges after five hair- and beard-cutting incidents. Samuel Mullet Sr., who did not participate in the five hair- and beard-cutting attacks, was tried as the leader of the campaign. Initially Samuel Mullet Sr. was sentenced to 15 years in prison on February 8, 2013, with fifteen others receiving lighter sentences ranging from one year and one day to seven years; after these convictions were overturned in August 2014 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, these sentences were reduced in March 2015.

Due to the cloistered nature of Amish lifestyle, they are often reluctant to bring complaints to local police who describe the attacks as &quot;very rare&quot;.

<doc id="129460" wikidata="Q1563847" url="?curid=129460" title="Born on the Fourth of July">
<text>Born on the Fourth of July, published in 1976, is the best-selling autobiography by Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam War veteran who became an anti-war activist. Kovic was born on July 4, 1946, and his book&#x27;s ironic title echoed a famous line from George M. Cohan&#x27;s patriotic 1904 song, &quot;The Yankee Doodle Boy&quot; (also known as &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;). The book was adapted into the 1989 Academy Award-winning film of the same name directed and co-written by Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic, starring Tom Cruise as Kovic.

==Origin==
&quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; was written in Santa Monica, California, during the fall of 1974 in exactly one month, three weeks and two days. It tells the story of Kovic&#x27;s life growing up in Massapequa, New York, joining the United States Marine Corps right out of high school, going to Vietnam for two tours of duty, getting shot, finding himself paralyzed and in need of a wheelchair, and eventually starting a new life as a peace activist.

==Differences from the film adaptation==

* Ron Kovic is shown to have confessed his supposed role in the Marine Corporal&#x27;s accidental death to the deceased man&#x27;s sympathetic parents and widow, who admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive him, but God might do so. In reality, this meeting never happened, but director Stone admits this was done to add to the inner conflict Kovic was going through and to give him some closure.
* Kyra Sedgwick&#x27;s character of Donna, Ron&#x27;s on-screen high school sweetheart, never existed and did not inspire him to become an anti-war activist. The film portrays Kovic watching her protest after the Kent State Shootings and get beaten up by police. Although Kovic did not witness the protest in person, he nevertheless did watch the event on television, and the memoir states that he was outraged by the treatment of the protesters, much like his feelings towards the treatment of his fellow veterans.

==Cultural references==
*Bruce Springsteen dedicated his 1978 performance of &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; live at Winterland to Kovic, saying that he read &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, and &quot;loved the book a whole lot&quot;. He frequently mentions the book, and his chance meeting with Kovic, before playing his song &quot;Shut Out the Light&quot;.

<text>Mount Pleasant is a village in southern Jefferson County, Ohio, United States. The population was 394 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area.

==History==
Mount Pleasant was laid out in 1803. It was named for its scenic landscape. An early variant name was Jesse-Bobtown. In 1802 Nathan Updegraff of the Pennsylvanian Op den Graeff family settled north in Mount Pleasant. His family belonged to the 19th-century Quaker families of Ohio and produced a lot of Quaker Ministers and elders.

In 1817, Quaker Charles Osborn established &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;, the first newspaper in the country advocating the abolition of slavery, in Mount Pleasant. The abolitionist James Birney would later adopt the name &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; for his anti-slavery newspaper, published in Cincinnati and distributed in New Richmond, Ohio beginning in 1836.

In 1821, the Quaker abolitionist Benjamin Lundy started publishing &quot;The Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot;, another abolitionist newspaper, also in Mount Pleasant. The paper eventually moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Lundy&#x27;s house is a National Historic Landmark. Nathan Updegraffs son David Benjamin Updegraff (1789–1864) was a conductor of the Underground Railroad in Mount Pleasant.

Most of the village has been designated a historic district, the Mount Pleasant Historic District; it too is a National Historic Landmark.

<text>New Alexandria is a village in eastern Jefferson County, Ohio, United States. The population was 232 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area.

==History==

New Alexandria derives its name from the former proprietor, Alexander Smith, who laid out the town in 1831. Prior to this, the area was known as &quot;Tempo&quot; by the surrounding local community. This derives from either a temperance hotel that was kept there (something that was unusual for the time) by Matthew Thompson as far back as 1820, or the village Tempo in Fermanagh County, Ireland where Thompson grew up. This information can be found in a privately printed biography of the Scott Family which was written primarily by a nephew of Thompson. However, no further evidence as to if Mr. Thompson&#x27;s temperance hotel has anything to do with the name; note that there was also a small collection of houses here prior to Smith laying out the area. Mr. Thomson also started the first store and was the first postmaster of the village. In 1831 Mr. Smith opened a hotel and store in the newly organized area. Being distant from any rail or water transportation the village grew at a slow rate, it did however have a fairly large area of local trade with the rural community surrounding it. The village was incorporated in 1871 and has been the home of several small businesses, churches, clubs, a cemetery, a post office, a community park, a school and a volunteer fire department over the years.


During Morgan&#x27;s Raid, a Union victory in the Civil War in 1863, Confederate Brid. Gen. John Hunt Morgan 
traveled through the Moorefield, Harrisville, New Athens, 
Smithfield, New Alexandria, Goulds, Wintersville, Two Ridge, 
Richmond, East Springfield, Bergholz, and Monroeville

<text>Rayland is a village in southern Jefferson County, Ohio, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 389 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area.

==History==

Rayland was originally called Portland Station. A post office called Portland Station was established in 1871 giving the village its name. The village name was changed to Rayland in 1928. Rayland incorporated as a village in 1938. Rayland was once of the largest port towns on the river during its heyday as Portland Station.

The Stringer Stone House, also known as the John B. Bayless House, was a historic stone mansion located at 224 Warren Avenue in Rayland, Ohio. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 10, 1974. It was destroyed by fire in 1982.
The house was built in 1836 by John Brown Bayless, an abolitionist from Maryland. The interior was decorated with murals by an Italian artist, including a waterfall beside the stairs, William Penn&#x27;s treaty with the Indians, a castle in England, and a gristmill and mill workers.[2] In 1860 it was purchased by Jefferson D. Stringer. Rutherford B. Hayes visited it in 1876, during his term as governor of Ohio.[3]
Bayless constructed a three-and-a-half-story building out of gray sandstone. Much about the design was unusual: he placed the main entrances on the second story, the stone chimneys on each end consisted of attached pairs, and the house faced away from the road. The largest exception to the house&#x27;s almost complete stone construction was a small wooden porch surrounding the front entrance; it was accessed by a set of stone steps.

<doc id="129470" wikidata="Q986432" url="?curid=129470" title="Steubenville, Ohio">
<text>Steubenville ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Ohio, United States. Located along the Ohio River west of Pittsburgh, it had a population of 18,161 at the 2020 census. The city&#x27;s name is derived from Fort Steuben, a 1786 fort that sat within the city&#x27;s current limits and was named for Prussian military officer Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. It is a principal city of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area, which had a 2020 population of 116,903 residents.

Steubenville&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;City of Murals&quot;, after its more than 25 downtown murals. The campus of Franciscan University of Steubenville is in the city. Historically, it was known as the birthplace and home town of Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War during the American Civil War. It is known as the city where legendary entertainer Dean Martin of the Rat Pack was born and raised. It has recently attracted attention for the Steubenville Nutcracker Village, an annual Christmastime event.

==History==

In 1786–87, soldiers of the First American Regiment under Major Jean François Hamtramck built Fort Steuben to protect the government surveyors mapping the land west of the Ohio River, and named the fort in honor of Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from Fort Steuben to honor Baron von Steuben (the fort was named for the Baron). The town was sometimes referred to as La Belle City, a franglais interpretation of &quot;The Beautiful City&quot;.

On July 29, 1797, Jefferson County was organized by a proclamation of Governor Arthur St. Clair, and Steubenville was selected as the county seat. It was platted in the same year by Bezaliel Wells and James Ross, the city&#x27;s co-founders. Wells, a government surveyor born in Baltimore, received about of land west of the Ohio River; Ross, a lawyer from Pittsburgh, owned the land north of Wells.

On March 1, 1803, Ohio was admitted to the Union as the 17th state. During the first half of the nineteenth century, Steubenville was primarily a port town, and the rest of the county was small villages and farms. Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, which connected Pittsburgh to Chicago and St. Louis.

The Steubenville Female Seminary, also known as Beatty&#x27;s Seminary for Young Ladies or Steubenville Seminary, was an early private educational institution for women founded by Presbyterian minister Charles Clinton Beatty in 1829. It was closed in 1898 and the buildings were eventually razed for part of what is now Ohio State Route 7.

In 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular. In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to Franciscan University of Steubenville. In 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded. In 1977, its name was changed to Jefferson Technical College. In 1995, it became a community college and was renamed Jefferson Community College. In 2009, the college expanded its service district by three Ohio counties, and was renamed again: Eastern Gateway Community College.

The city gained international attention in late 2012 from the events surrounding the Steubenville High School rape case, which occurred in August 2012. The case was first covered by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that December, followed by the computer hacker group Anonymous later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013. The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of rape culture.

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Steubenville has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
The city&#x27;s population peaked in 1940 at 37,651. After large declines for many decades, the population decline stabilized some, with the 2010 and 2020 censuses showing the smallest declines in any decade since the peak. This trend is reflected in the US Census Bureau&#x27;s estimate of the 2020 population from its American Community Survey of 17,882 being lower than the actual count in the 2020 census of 18,161, an increase compared to the estimate of 279. This is similar to the situation in 2010 when the estimated population of the American Community Survey was 18,578, but the actual count in the 2010 census was 18,659, an increase of 81.

==Arts and culture==
===Historic sites===

Fort Steuben, located downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the Seven Ranges of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.

Adjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.

&quot;Ohio Valley Steelworker&quot; Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the Ohio Valley Steelworkers. The life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd). In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.

There is a statue downtown commemorating Edwin Stanton, President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s secretary of war. Stanton was born and raised in Steubenville.

===Steubenville Nutcracker Village===
In 2015, two local businessmen started a Christmas-themed festival, the Steubenville Nutcracker Village and Advent Market. The event is centered around a large collection life-size nutcracker sculptures spread throughout Fort Steuben Park in downtown Steubenville. The Nutcracker Village is free and open to the public 24 hours a day and generally runs from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to Epiphany Sunday in early January.

The event began in 2015 with 37 locally produced, hand-painted nutcrackers. They are made of fiberglass and foam at a local business. Design and production takes about 40 hours each. In the second year, there were a total of 75 nutcrackers; by 2023, there were 209 around town. Each of the nutcrackers, which range in height from tall is unique, and the designs include fictional characters from books, movies, comic strips, and songs, holiday characters like Mrs. Claus, and professions, such as a steel welder. 

Live entertainment and a German-style Advent Market featuring local artisans and craftsmen, as well as hot food and drink vendors, runs each weekend through the month of December in Fort Steuben Park to coincide with the Nutcracker Village event. The popularity of the Nutcracker Village since its inception has inspired other nutcracker-themed ventures in the City of Steubenville, including Drosselmeyer&#x27;s Nutcracker Shoppe, a year-round Christmas shop in downtown Steubenville, and &quot;Wooden Hearts Follies&quot;, a locally-written and performed musical centered around characters from the event. The Nutcracker Village attracted over 40,000 visitors in 2017 and is credited with bringing new life to Steubenville&#x27;s downtown area.

===Politics===
The City of Steubenville is part of the 6th congressional district of Ohio and was represented by Bill Johnson until January 2024. The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.

====Policing, civil rights lawsuits, and reform====
In 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to &quot;excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports&quot; and had engaged in practices regarding &quot;improper stops, searches, and seizures&quot;. The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were &quot;likely to complain of abuse&quot;. It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that &quot;misconduct would not be recorded&quot;.

As a result, the city&#x27;s police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the &quot;pattern or practice&quot; provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an &quot;early warning system&quot;.

Based on reformed use of force policies and improved police training requirements implemented by the city and its police department, the consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice ended on March 4, 2005. These reforms and improvements were reviewed by the city council in 2020, and the city manager outlined use of force policies, data, and training that showed continuing improvements.

====Speed camera lawsuit====
The speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets (at $85 each) were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was &quot;bound by contract to continue the services&quot; of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge&#x27;s order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.

In mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000. Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city&#x27;s ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue. On November 8, 2006, city residents voted to end the city&#x27;s speed camera program with a 76.2 percent majority.

==Education==
===Postsecondary===
Steubenville is home to the Franciscan University of Steubenville, a private university affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church founded in 1946. Eastern Gateway Community College was a public community college located in the city from 1968 to 2024.

On July 24, 2012, after being threatened with a lawsuit from the atheist Freedom from Religion Foundation, the Steubenville city council decided to remove the image of Franciscan University from its town logo rather than pay for a lawsuit. The city later proposed a logo that included a chapel and cross.

===Primary and secondary===
Public schools in Steubenville are operated by the Steubenville City School District. There are a total of five schools in the district: Wells Academy, West Pugliese, Garfield, Harding Middle, and Steubenville High School. A portion of far western Steubenville is served by the Indian Creek Local School District. Several private schools are located in Steubenville. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Steubenville operates Bishop John King Mussio Central Elementary School, Bishop John King Mussio Central Junior High School and Steubenville Catholic Central High School.

== Media ==
Steubenville shares a media market with nearby Wheeling, West Virginia. The city is home to the market&#x27;s NBC and FOX affiliate, WTOV-TV. In print, it is home to the daily &quot;Herald-Star&quot; newspaper, which traces its history to 1806.

The radio station WIXZ 950 AM has broadcast Oldies music from the city since 1974. Previously, Steubenville also has radio stations WSSS-LP and WSTV (AM).

<text>Fairport Harbor is a village in Lake County, Ohio, United States, along Lake Erie at the mouth of the Grand River. The population was 3,108 at the 2020 census. A far-eastern suburb of Cleveland, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

Fairport Harbor is home to two lighthouses: the Fairport Harbor West Breakwater Light in Painesville Township, operated by the United States Coast Guard and the Grand River (Fairport Harbor) Light operated by the Fairport Harbor Historical Society. It is also the home of the Finnish Heritage Museum.

==History==
Fairport Harbor&#x27;s location at the mouth of the Grand River made it an ideal place for a settlement. After being claimed as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve by the Connecticut Land Company in 1796–1797, the town of Grandon was platted there on May 16, 1812. When the town incorporated in 1836, the name was changed to &quot;Fairport.&quot; Fairport is a commendatory name. The current name was adopted in 1959.

After receiving federal sponsorship, the village&#x27;s port flourished, and an influx of Finns, Hungarians, and Slovaks arrived there. The port also imported iron ore for use at area steel mills. The port continues operation at a more limited capacity.

Later in the village&#x27;s history, the Diamond Alkali Company operated from 1912 to 1976.

In recent years Fairport Harbor has hosted the Lake County Perch Fest and opened the Finnish Heritage Museum.

On January 24, 2011, an overpressurized Dominion East Ohio natural gas pipeline caused devices in at least 17 dwellings to explode, causing the structures to burn and leading to a mass evacuation. The excess pressure has been attributed to ice present in a sensor line causing a false reading in a pressure regulator. The backup regulator for the pipeline also failed. While no injuries were reported in the community, the cost of damage was placed at approximately $1.2 million.

==Geography==
Fairport Harbor is located within Painesville Township.

<text>Kirtland is a city in Lake County, Ohio, United States. The population was 6,937 at the 2020 census. Kirtland is known for being the early headquarters of the Latter Day Saint movement from 1831 to 1837 and the site of the movement&#x27;s first temple, the Kirtland Temple, completed in 1836. The Kirtland Temple and nearby Historic Kirtland Village are maintained as historic sites highlighting that era. The city is also the location for multiple parks in the Lake Metroparks system, as well as the Holden Arboretum.

==History==
After the founding of the United States, northern Ohio was designated as the Western Reserve and was sold to the Connecticut Land Company. The area was first surveyed by Moses Cleaveland and his party in 1796.

Kirtland is named for Turhand Kirtland, a principal of the Connecticut Land Company and judge in Trumbull County, the first political entity in Ohio that included Kirtland township. Kirtland, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, demonstrated &quot;both breadth of vision and integrity&quot; in his fair dealings with the local Native Americans. He was known for his bravery, resourcefulness, and passion for justice. Dr. Jared Potter Kirtland was the son of the former; he helped to found a medical college in nearby Willoughby, Ohio, and he compiled the first ornithology of Ohio. The bird Kirtland&#x27;s warbler is named for Jared Kirtland. This rare species has been documented in the city during migration, but it does not nest in Ohio.

The densely forested, clay soiled, high, hilly, land of Kirtland was settled later than surrounding townships: Mentor in 1798, and Chester in 1802. Kirtland&#x27;s first European settlers were the John Moore family, soon followed by the Crary family who came to Kirtland in 1811. In 1893 Christopher Crary wrote a memoir of his Kirtland life, which provided a great deal of material for Anne B. Prusha&#x27;s 1982 history of Kirtland.

===Headquarters of the Latter Day Saint movement===
From 1831 to 1832 and again from 1833 to 1838, Kirtland was the headquarters for the Latter Day Saint movement. Joseph Smith moved the church to Kirtland in 1831, shortly after its formal organization in April 1830 in Fayette, New York. In Kirtland, Latter Day Saints built their first temple, the Kirtland Temple. The temple was built with a degree of opulence, considering the underdeveloped nature of the area and the poverty of most early church members. Many attending the Kirtland Temple dedication in 1836 claimed to see multiple heavenly visions and appearances of heavenly beings, including deity. For this and other reasons, Kirtland remains a place of importance to those of all Latter Day Saint denominations. Many sections from the Doctrine and Covenants, considered modern revelations and canonical by most denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, originated in Kirtland during the 1830s.

Ownership of the Kirtland Temple came into question after the main body of Latter Day Saints moved west. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ) sought to have the matter settled in civil court; but ultimately obtained ownership of the property through adverse possession. Besides giving tours, Community of Christ allowed others to use the temple for special meetings. On March 5, 2024 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Community of Christ announced that ownership of the site had transferred to the former as part of a $192.5 million acquisition of historic sites and objects.

===1838 to present===
After the majority of the Latter Day Saints departed Kirtland in 1837–38, and during the latter part of the 19th century, Kirtland&#x27;s population diminished and life was typical of that of the region. Crary recalls the last rattlesnakes being killed on Gildersleeve Mountain in the 1830s. During this period most of the wooded areas near Kirtland were cleared for agriculture, with corn and apples being the predominant crops.

In the early 20th century, Kirtland School (now Kirtland Elementary) was built to consolidate three school houses. One of the old school houses can still be found at the corner of Baldwin and Booth Roads in Kirtland Hills. Kirtland saw few changes until after World War II when several residential subdivisions were built. In 1957 a high school was built and in 1961, Gildersleeve Elementary was built along Chardon Road (US 6). In 1968 a middle school was completed for grades 6–8.

The 1960s saw an influx and expansion of local businesses. A shopping center was built, which combined the hardware, drug store, grocery, barber shop, plus the local doctor and dentist in one building. By 1965, Interstate 90 was open, allowing a quicker trip into Cleveland. In 1968 the citizens of Kirtland voted in a special election to incorporate the township. James Naughton was the first mayor of the village, which became a city when the 1970 census showed population exceeded 5,000. Naughton was succeeded as mayor by Doug Guy, Wesley Phillips, Mario Marcopoli, Edward Podajol, and Mark Tyler. Kirtland continued to grow in population slowly through the 1970s and 1980s.

In April 1989, Jeffrey Lundgren, a religious extremist, coerced some in his cult into murdering a family of five and hiding their bodies in a pit dug inside a barn, on Chardon Road (U.S. 6). Those of Lundgren&#x27;s cult who participated in the murders were sentenced to life in prison; Lundgren was executed on October 24, 2006. The site of the murders was converted from a privately owned home into a church beginning in 2007. New Promise Church opened in April 2009.
The LDS Church purchased the N.K. Whitney Store in 1979 and restored it in 1984, operating it as a historic site open to tours. The Whitney home, across the street, was acquired soon after and was used for many years as a visitor center. By the late 1990s, Kirtland was becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination, so the creation of Historic Kirtland Village was announced in April 2000, located in the Kirtland flats along the East Branch of the Chagrin River, to provide insight into what life was like during the 1830s when Kirtland was the home of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and other founders of Mormonism. As part of the project, to create a pedestrian-friendly area, Kirtland-Chardon Road was rerouted along the eastern side of the site, while Ohio State Route 615 was rerouted around the northern side, eliminating what had been a busy intersection right in front of the Whitney home and store. The Whitney home was restored to its 1830s appearance, while historically accurate replicas of the original John Johnson Inn, schoolhouse, sawmill, and ashery were researched and constructed on or near their original sites, along with a new visitor center. The project was completed and dedicated in 2003. In 2023, the church completed and dedicated the restored Joseph and Emma Smith home on Chillicothe Road, just north of the Kirtland Temple. From 2004 through 2016, a group of volunteers produced an annual musical theater production celebrating the city&#x27;s Latter Day Saint history called &quot;This Is Kirtland!&quot;, which was held at the nearby LDS meetinghouse.

In 2003, Schupp&#x27;s farm and orchard, on Hobart Road, became inactive leaving Rock&#x27;s farm on Chillicothe Road, the only active for-profit farm in the city. As of 2006, there are still active cattle and horse farming in the city and some commercial nursery activity. Sugaring still occurs, with at least two active sugar bushes other than the large scale Bicknell Sugar Bush at the Holden Arboretum.

Kirtland has been visited by two sitting Presidents of the United States, including George W. Bush.

<text>Mentor ( ) is the largest city in Lake County, Ohio, United States. The population was 47,450 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cleveland metro area.

Mentor was first settled in 1797. In 1876, James A. Garfield purchased a home in Mentor, from which he conducted the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency; the house is now maintained as the James A. Garfield National Historic Site. The city is home to Headlands Beach State Park, the longest public swimming beach in Ohio. The city is a major center of retail stores, ranking sixth-largest in Ohio , and restaurants, ranking seventh-largest in the state . Mentor Avenue (US 20) is the major retail center, which includes the Great Lakes Mall, with additional shopping and strip malls found along most major roads. Convenient Food Mart is based in Mentor. Major products include medical related, polymers, plastics, electric boards and other peripherals that generally serve the computer and automation industries. Two major railroads pass through the city, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern. Medical equipment company Steris is based in Mentor.

==Etymology==
Mentor is named after the Greek figure Mentor, in keeping with the Connecticut Western Reserve settlers&#x27; tradition, as well as that of most other Americans at the time, of celebrating aspects of Greek classicism (nearby Solon, Macedonia, Euclid, and Akron also were named using that principle).

The pronunciation of the city&#x27;s name is a shibboleth, with many residents pronouncing it as &quot;men-ner&quot; and outsiders using the more conventional &quot;men-tore&quot;, while in the media and among most residents, &quot;men-ter&quot; is prominent. The city&#x27;s former slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s better in Mentor,&quot; reflects this fact.

==History==

Mentor was formally established in 1855 but founded in the late eighteenth century by Charles Parker who built the first settlement.
This settlement was established before Ohio became the 17th state in the Union in 1803. It earned the nickname &quot;Rose Capital of the Nation&quot; due to the abundant rosebushes that grew throughout the city. During the time this nickname developed, Mentor&#x27;s tourist industry boomed due to Clevelanders trying to escape a dirty, industrial atmosphere. Post World War II, most Mentor dwellers had cars and could efficiently drive to work. This caused an increase in middle and working-class families and by 2000, about 50,000 people lived in Mentor.

===Flag===
The &quot;Official Flag of the City of Mentor&quot; was designed by Brad Frost in 1988 for a contest by Mentor Headlands. The flag&#x27;s appearance is similar to Ohio&#x27;s flag in that they have similar shapes, a large blue triangle, and stripes. The blue triangle represents Ohio&#x27;s hills while the stripes represent roads and waterways. There is a white circle, symbolizing Ohio, with a cardinal, the official bird of Ohio and Mentor, sitting in the middle. There are six stars surrounding the circle symbolizing the 6 original townships, including Mentor, surveyed in 1797.

==Crime==
In 2016, Mentor&#x27;s rate of 1.1 violent crimes per 1,000 residents was equal to the average (median) among Ohio cities. However, its rate of 22.1 property crimes per 1,000 residents was higher than the state median of 18.3 per 1,000 people. The property crime rate was high primarily due to the incidence of theft (larceny) in the city.

In 2014, Garden Thieves Pictures released &quot;Mentor&quot;, a documentary directed by Alix Lambert about a series of four student suicides beginning in 2010 at Mentor High School that have been attributed to bullying and harassment at the school. Lambert received ten violent threats after the release of the film&#x27;s trailer. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote about the documentary, saying &quot;This is a problem of not just one town, but of the entire culture of conformity. It’s much bigger than just one bad kid or bad teacher. In my films I&#x27;m interested in looking at the whole problem rather than the easy answers.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; called Mentor High School &quot;Suicide High.&quot;

==Media==

Primarily receiving the Cleveland-area television market, Mentor residents (being so much further east of Cleveland) can also receive Youngstown-area television reception from WFMJ-TV with a good antenna. This allowed access to NBC programming pre-empted by KYW-TV from 1956 until 1965, when Cleveland&#x27;s channel 3 was owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, before the sale was undone and it returned to NBC ownership as WKYC.

==Transportation==

<doc id="129493" wikidata="Q106316" url="?curid=129493" title="Dead Poets Society">
<text>Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman. The film, starring Robin Williams, is set in 1959 at a fictional elite boarding school called Welton Academy, and tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.

&quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; was released in the United States on June 2, 1989. The film was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $235 million worldwide, became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1989, and received generally positive reviews from critics. The film received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, as well as a Best Actor nomination for Williams. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film, the César Award for Best Foreign Film and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Film. Schulman received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work.

==Plot==

In 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an Episcopalian all-male preparatory boarding school in Vermont. Todd is assigned one of Welton&#x27;s top students, junior Neil Perry, as his roommate, and through Neil, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.

On the first day of classes, the boys are taken aback by the unusual teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus who studied English Literature at Cambridge, Keating encourages his students to &quot;seize the day&quot;, referencing the Latin expression &quot;carpe diem&quot;.

Keating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating&#x27;s methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan.

Upon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating&#x27;s lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his.

Neil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of Puck in a local production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend Harvard to study medicine. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class.

Charlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan paddles Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys, warning them that one must assess all potential consequences of one&#x27;s actions.

On the eve of the play&#x27;s opening performance, Neil&#x27;s father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to stand his ground to prove to his father that he takes acting seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by withdrawing him from Welton and enrolling him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father&#x27;s gun.

At Neil&#x27;s parents&#x27; request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan&#x27;s office to sign a letter confirming Cameron&#x27;s false allegations. When Todd&#x27;s turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under the pressure of his parents, and Keating is fired as a result.

Nolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating&#x27;s English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot;. The other members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron, along with several other students in the class, follow suit. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys before departing.

==Cast==

==Production==
=== Development ===
The original script was written by Tom Schulman, based on his experiences at the Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, particularly with his inspirational teacher, Samuel Pickering. Jeff Kanew was originally hired as the director, and Kanew had envisioned Liam Neeson in the role of Keating. Other actors considered for the role were Dustin Hoffman, Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks and Mickey Rourke. Robin Williams, who was Touchstone Pictures&#x27;s preferred choice, was ultimately cast, but on the first day of shooting outside Atlanta, Williams did not show, for he did not want to work with Kanew. The studio burned down the already-built sets, and replaced Kanew with another director.

In late 1988, Peter Weir met with Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney. Katzenberg, who oversaw Touchstone Pictures, suggested that Weir read Schulman&#x27;s script. On the flight back to Sydney, Weir was captivated, and six weeks later returned to Los Angeles to cast the principal characters. It was when Weir was given directing duties that filming began in earnest. In Schulman&#x27;s manuscript, Keating had been ill and slowly dying of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a scene showing him on his hospital deathbed. This was removed by Weir, who deemed it unnecessary, reasoning that it would focus audiences&#x27; attention on Keating&#x27;s illness, rather than on what he stood for. Early notes on the script from Disney also suggested making the boys&#x27; passion dancing rather than poetry, as well as a new title, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, focusing on the character of Mr. Keating, rather than on the boys, but both were dismissed outright.

===Filming===
Filming began in November 1988, and wrapped in January 1989. After filmmakers scouted more than 70 different universities and private schools, they decided that &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; would take place at St. Andrew&#x27;s School and the Everett Theatre in Middletown, Delaware, as well as at locations in New Castle, Delaware, and in nearby Wilmington, Delaware. Classroom scenes with Keating were filmed in a replica classroom built on a soundstage in Wilmington. To emphasize a film set back in time, storefronts in Delaware towns were transformed, with all modern conveniences removed. During the shooting, Weir requested that the young cast not use modern slang, even off camera. Weir also said that he hid a half-day&#x27;s filming from Disney executives to allow Williams free range to use his comedic improvisational skills.

&quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; held two open casting calls, in which more than 3,000 extras were used. During filming, Williams cracked many jokes on set, which Ethan Hawke found irritating. However, Hawke&#x27;s first agent signed with Hawke when Williams told him that Hawke would &quot;do really well&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The worldwide box office was reported as $235,860,579, which includes domestic grosses of $95,860,116. The film&#x27;s global receipts were the fifth-highest for 1989, and the highest for dramas.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; holds an approval rating of 85%, based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Affecting performances from the young cast and a genuinely inspirational turn from Robin Williams grant Peter Weir&#x27;s prep school drama top honors&quot;. On Metacritic, the film received a score of 79, based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade on a scale of A+ to F.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s reviewer called it &quot;solid, smart entertainment&quot;, and praised Robin Williams for giving a &quot;nicely restrained acting performance&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised Williams&#x27; &quot;exceptionally fine performance&quot;, while writing that &quot;&quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;... is far less about Keating than about a handful of impressionable boys&quot;.

Pauline Kael was unconvinced about the film and its &quot;middlebrow highmindedness&quot;, but praised Williams. &quot;Robin Williams&#x27; performance is more graceful than anything he&#x27;s done before [–] he&#x27;s totally, concentratedly there – [he] reads his lines stunningly, and when he mimics various actors reciting Shakespeare there&#x27;s no undue clowning in it; he&#x27;s a gifted teacher demonstrating his skills.&quot; Roger Ebert&#x27;s review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four. He criticized Williams for spoiling an otherwise creditable dramatic performance by occasionally veering into his onstage comedian&#x27;s persona, and lamented that for a film set in the 1950s, there was no mention of the Beat Generation writers popular among college students of the era. Additionally, Ebert described the film as an often poorly constructed &quot;collection of pious platitudes... The movie pays lip service to qualities and values that, on the evidence of the screenplay itself, it is cheerfully willing to abandon.&quot;

On their Oscar-nomination edition of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, both Gene Siskel (who also gave the film a mixed review) and Ebert disagreed with Williams&#x27; Oscar nomination. Ebert said that he would have swapped Williams with either Matt Dillon for &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; or John Cusack for &quot;Say Anything&quot;. On their &quot;If We Picked the Winners&quot; special in March 1990, Ebert chose the film&#x27;s Best Picture nomination as the worst nomination of the year, believing that it took a slot that could have gone to Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;. Film historian Leonard Maltin wrote: &quot;Well made, extremely well acted, but also dramatically obvious and melodramatically one-sided. Nevertheless, Tom Schulman&#x27;s screenplay won an Oscar.&quot;

John Simon, writing for &quot;National Review&quot;, said that &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; was the most dishonest film that he had seen in some time. Richard Schickel reviewed the film for &quot;Time&quot;, commenting: &quot;Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.&quot; Kevin Dettmar wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;: &quot;The beloved film&#x27;s portrayal of studying literature is both misleading and deeply seductive.&quot; He commented further on how literature was taught in the film (by Robin Williams&#x27;s character John Keating), describing it as &quot;the literary equivalent of fandom,&quot; and &quot;anti-intellectual.&quot;

===Accolades===
American Film Institute Lists

The film was voted #52 on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Cheers list, a list of the top 100 most inspiring films of all time.

The film&#x27;s line, &quot;&quot;Carpe diem&quot;. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.&quot;, was voted as the 95th greatest movie quote by the American Film Institute.

===Legacy===
After Robin Williams&#x27; death in August 2014, fans of his work used social media to pay tribute to him with photo and video reenactments of the film&#x27;s final &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot; scene. Upon hearing about Robin William&#x27;s death, many teachers came forward to pay him their respects online, and even revealed that they were inspired to become teachers because of his character, Mr. Keating, from &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;.

Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles feature prominently in the music video for &quot;Fortnight&quot; by American singer Taylor Swift from her album &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot; (2024), as a nod to the similarity between the two titles.

==Adaptations==

=== Novelization ===
Nancy H. Kleinbaum&#x27;s novel, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989), is based on the movie.

===Stage play===
A theatrical adaptation written by Tom Schulman and directed by John Doyle opened off-Broadway October 27, 2016, and ran through December 11, 2016. Jason Sudeikis starred as John Keating, with Thomas Mann as Neil Perry, David Garrison as Gale Nolan, Zane Pais as Todd Anderson, Francesca Carpanini as Chris, Stephen Barker Turner as Mr. Perry, Will Hochman as Knox Overstreet, Cody Kostro as Charlie Dalton, Yaron Lotan as Richard Cameron, and Bubba Weiler as Steven Meeks. The production received a mixed review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, with critic Ben Brantley calling the play &quot;blunt and bland&quot;, and criticizing Sudeikis&#x27; performance, citing his lack of enthusiasm when delivering powerful lines.

In 2018, the theatrical adaptation of the film, written by Tom Schulman and directed by Francisco Franco, premiered in Mexico. The Mexican actor, Alfonso Herrera, played the main character. An adaptation was made for the Bad Hersfelder Festspiele in Germany, also with the assistance of Tom Schulman. It premiered in July 2021, and was still staged two years later. The lead actor was Francis Fulton-Smith.

===Parodies===
The ending of the film was parodied in the 2009 &quot;Community&quot; episode, &quot;Introduction to Film&quot;. It was also parodied in the 2016 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, &quot;Farewell, Mr. Bunting&quot;, with Fred Armisen playing Williams&#x27; role. The sketch is a largely faithful recreation of the scene, until a student (Pete Davidson) is decapitated by a ceiling fan when he jumps on top of his desk.

General Edward Paine (1746–1841), a native of Bolton, Connecticut, who had served as a captain in the Connecticut militia during the war, and John Walworth arrived in 1800 with a party of sixty-six settlers, among the first in the Western Reserve. General Paine later represented the region in the territorial legislature of the Northwest Territory.

In 1800 the Western Reserve became Trumbull County and at the first Court of Quarter Sessions, the county was divided into eight townships. The smallest of these townships was named Painesville, for General Paine, and encompassed what later became the townships of Perry, Leroy, Hambden, Concord, Chardon, Mentor, and Kirtland. The township government was organized in 1802. The post office in Painesville was opened in 1803 with John Walworth as postmaster.

In what was to become the commercial center of the township was a settlement called Oak Openings, its name being descriptive of the scrub oaks and sandy soil. It was here in 1805 that Gen. Henry Champion laid out a village plat and called it Champion, a name that it carried only until incorporation in 1832, when the name &quot;Painesville&quot; was chosen in honor of General Paine. Two of his descendants, Eleazer A. Paine and Halbert E. Paine, later served as Union Army generals during the American Civil War.

In 1840, Lake County, Ohio was created from portions of Geauga County and Cuyahoga County, and Painesville was made the county seat and a courthouse was erected. In 1852, the community of Painesville became a village, and in 1902 the village attained city status.

===Underground Railroad===
Rider&#x27;s Inn opened on June 16, 1812, on what is now US Route 20 to serve weary travelers passing through Painesville. But later in the 19th century it served a greater purpose – as a stop on the Underground Railroad. The freedom seekers would come to a dry well located behind the inn. There, they would find a ladder leading down to a door to the inn&#x27;s basement. Fugitive slaves were able to rest and recharge before making their way across Lake Erie into Canada. Over the years, historians estimate that 3,000 former slaves came through Rider&#x27;s Inn. The inn served as a meeting spot for the anti-slavery committee in town, and documents have been found detailing their abolitionist movement. After over two hundred years, Riders inn became a bed and breakfast locally owned by 2 businesses women but unfortunately Riders inn closed unexpectedly in 2025 and remains unoccupied as of February 2025. Historical photographs, memorabilia and documents such as the anti-slavery &quot;Bugle&quot; are currently on display in the main lobby and can be visible by looking in windows.

The Coulby Mansion and Park were built between 1911 and 1915 by Harry Coulby, a shipping magnate who served as Wickliffe&#x27;s first mayor. It cost over $1 million at the time. This mansion is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Coulby Mansion was Coulby&#x27;s home before he died in January 1929. After that it was used as a Catholic girls&#x27; school, until Wickliffe City purchased the building and grounds in 1954, converting it into Wickliffe&#x27;s City Hall. The previous owners did not damage or remove many original fixtures. Coulby Mansion has sixteen rooms, seven fireplaces, a Tiffany skylight, hand-carved walnut moldings and paneling from Bohemia, and an extensive garden with fountains. The exterior of the building is white glazed terra cotta. The grounds have been formed into Coulby Park, the city&#x27;s principal open area. It has trails, a pool facility, extensive playground equipment, and a pond stocked with fish.

==Parks and recreation==
Wickliffe hosts several parks; the most-known is Coulby Park with its aquatic center, baseball fields and pond. It is also home to City Hall. There are also Jindra Park, Nehls Park, Featherston Park, Orlando Park, Levi Lane Park, and Intihar Park. Three of the parks, Featherston, Intihar and Jindra, were renamed to honor residents who died in military service.

==Government==

Wickliffe has a mayor-council system of government. As of 2024, the mayor is Joe Sakacs, a Republican. The City Council consists of seven members, who are elected for four-year terms.

The public school mascots are known as the Wickliffe Blue Devils. There is also a Roman Catholic school, Mater Dei Academy, founded in 2010, which offers education for children in pre-school through grade 8.

Wickliffe High School, the associated athletic field, and Board of Education offices are located on the land occupied by the former estate of Frank Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller. The Board building was the previous carriage house for the Rockefeller estate.

Previously, there were two other elementary schools - Worden and Mapledale. These were closed in 1982. Around 2010, Mapledale was demolished and replaced by a housing community and golf course. Worden was also demolished and replaced by the Wickliffe Community Center.

====1994 Wickliffe Middle School shooting====

The Wickliffe Middle School shooting was a school shooting that occurred on November 7, 1994, at Wickliffe Middle School in Wickliffe, Ohio, United States. The gunman, 37-year-old Keith A. Ledeger, was a former student at Wickliffe Middle School.

===Higher education===
Wickliffe is home to Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology, the Roman Catholic seminary serving the Diocese of Cleveland. It was established in 1848 by the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, Louis Amadeus Rappe. It is located at 28700 Euclid Avenue. The seminary was originally a high school built by the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd. It housed the first Marycrest School for troubled girls. It was not a home for unwed mothers. The Good Shepherd Sisters sold the school building and grounds to the diocese for Boromeo Seminary use in the mid-1940s and moved the school to the Marcus Hanna estate in Independence, Ohio. Marycrest High School closed its doors on September 11, 2001.

Wickliffe is home to the Telshe Yeshiva, an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva which originated in Telz, Lithuania, and moved to Wickliffe after Lithuania fell to the Nazis in World War II.

<text>Willoughby is a city in Lake County, Ohio, United States, along the Chagrin River. The population was 23,959 at the time of the 2020 census. A suburb of Cleveland, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area.

== History ==

Willoughby&#x27;s first permanent settler was David Abbott in 1798, who operated a gristmill. Abbott and his family were said to have had close relations with a band of Indians along the banks of the local river, which the Indians called the &quot;Sha-ga-rin&quot; meaning &quot;Clear Water.&quot; This river was later called the Chagrin River, though the origin of the name remains in dispute.

In 1835, the village was permanently named &quot;Willoughby&quot; in honor of Westel Willoughby, Jr., a public health official that the founders of a short-lived Medical College, which was based in the city, hoped to attract to the area. Many historical buildings from this period survive to this date, affording the downtown Willoughby area some outstanding specimens of 19th century architecture.

In World War I, the U.S. Army chose Willoughby as the site for a chemical weapons plant producing lewisite.

Over time, Willoughby sent citizens into every major U.S. military conflict. Several memorials and historical relics are displayed in Wes Point Park, the center of downtown Willoughby, to honor those that have served.

Willoughby is the only town in America that has belonged, at one time or other, to six counties (Washington, Jefferson, Trumbull, Geauga, Cuyahoga, and Lake).

==Geography==

<text>Ironton is a city in and the county seat of Lawrence County, Ohio, United States. The population was 10,571 at the 2020 census. Located in southernmost Ohio along the Ohio River, it is northwest of Huntington, West Virginia, within the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s name is a contraction of &quot;iron town&quot;, stemming from its long ties to the iron industry. It also had one of the first professional football teams, the Ironton Tanks.

== History ==

Ironton was founded in 1849 by John Campbell, a prominent pig iron manufacturer in the area. He chose the location of Ironton because of its site along the Ohio River, which would allow for water transport of iron ore to markets downriver.

Between 1850 and 1890, Ironton was one of the foremost producers of iron in the world. England, France, and Russia all purchased iron for warships from here due to the quality. Iron produced here was used for the &quot;USS Monitor,&quot; the United States&#x27; first ironclad ship. More than ninety furnaces were operating at the peak of production in the late 19th century.

The iron industry generated revenues that were invested in new industries, such as soap and nail production. The Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad was constructed through two states, carrying iron to Henry Ford&#x27;s automaking plants in Michigan. The city had a street railway, the Ironton Petersburg Street Railway, four daily newspapers, and a few foreign-language publications. Ironton was also known for its accommodating attitude toward sin and vice associated with the mine and ironworkers.

=== Underground Railroad and Civil War ===
With its location on the Ohio River, Ironton became a destination on the Underground Railroad for refugee slaves seeking freedom in the North. John Campbell and some other city leaders sheltered slaves in their homes during their journeys.

During the American Civil War, local military regiments were mustered, quartered, and trained at Camp Ironton, a military post located at the county fairgrounds.

=== Changing economics of the iron industry ===
The downfall of Ironton came as the market for iron changed. Also, the nation was making the transition from a demand for iron to steel. After a nationwide economic recession in the late 19th century, Ironton was no longer growing.

The Norfolk and Western Railway built a new railroad station downtown in 1906, and it continued in operation into the mid-20th century. Two major floods (1917, 1937) caused extensive damage to the city and its industries. The second flood came during the Great Depression; together with the shift in the iron industry, it devastated the city. The iron industry declined, affecting other industries as well. As the iron industries closed, Ironton had little with which to replace them.

An industrial city, Ironton worked to attract other heavy industry to the region. Companies such as Allied Signal and Alpha Portland Cement did build in town. The region has had difficulty creating an alternate economy. By 2004, both Alpha Portland Cement and Allied Signal were gone, and Ironton had shrunk by nearly 30% from its peak population in 1950. (See US Census table below.)

=== Professional football and Thanksgiving Day football tradition ===
Ironton had one of the first professional football teams in the United States, called the Ironton Tanks. The team was organized in 1919 and played through 1930. The football field previously used by the Tanks is now home to the Ironton High School Football team, the Ironton Fighting Tigers.

The Tanks began what is now the National Football League&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Game tradition of the Detroit Lions. The Tanks played a game in 1920 the day after Thanksgiving with the Lombards, a crosstown rival, winning 26–0. In 1922, they played and defeated the Huntington Boosters 12–0 on Thanksgiving Day, Nov 30. The Tanks continued playing on this national holiday each year thru 1930, which was the Tanks final season. Several Tank players (including Glenn Presnell) continued their football careers by joining the nearby Portsmouth Spartans, who continued the annual tradition until their demise after the 1933 season.

The Spartans&#x27; assets were acquired by businessman G.A. Richards and moved to Detroit, where they were renamed the Lions. Asked by Richards about ways to improve ticket sales, the players replied that they always got a good turnout on Thanksgiving Day. He promptly scheduled the first Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit.

Ironton is largely transitional in its plant life, sharing traditionally northern trees in landscaping like the blue spruce along with Magnolia and the occasional Needle Palm from the Upland South.

<doc id="129514" wikidata="Q2485187" url="?curid=129514" title="Granville, Ohio">
<text>Granville is a village in Licking County, Ohio, United States. The population was 5,946 at the 2020 census. The village is located in a rural area of hills, known locally as the Welsh Hills, in central Ohio. It is east of Columbus, the state capital, and west of Newark, the county seat.

The village began as a settlement by European-Americans of Welsh descent. It has long served as a hub for education in the area. It also served as a hotbed for Temperance Movement and Abolitionist activity.

Granville is home to Denison University. The village has a number of historic buildings, including Greek Revival structures like the Avery Downer House, St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church (1837) and others. The Buxton Inn (1812), the Granville Inn (1924), Bancroft House (1834) and Bryn Du Mansion are local landmarks.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian cultures===

Granville is the location of the prehistoric Alligator Effigy Mound, built by the indigenous people of the Fort Ancient culture, between 800 and 1200 CE, more than four hundred years before European contact. It may be an effigy of the underwater panther featured in Native American mythology. The mound is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area has evidence of Indigenous cultures. Less than five miles from the Alligator Effigy Mound are the Newark Earthworks, associated with the earlier Hopewell culture of roughly 100 BCE to 500 CE.

===Pioneer settlers===
Granville was not settled by European Americans until 1805, but the first house was built in 1801 by John Jones, a Welshman born in New Jersey. He erected a small hut with his wife and paved the first street in Granville, calling it Centerville Street. Mr. Jones&#x27;s close friend Mr. Patrick Cunningham built the second cabin in the township the next spring. People began to settle at the village regularly over the next four years. The first large group of settlers were from Granville, Massachusetts, and they named the new village after their former home. The area was first surveyed by United States representatives in 1797, as land set aside by the national government for payment in land grants to veterans who had served in the Revolutionary War.

Among the earliest settlers were Theophilus Rees amd his son John. Born in Wales, they immigrated to the United States in 1795, and headed west for a new life on the American frontier. They arrived in what is now Granville township in 1802, following a brief time in Philadelphia. Other Welsh settlers followed them, leaving their heritage in numerous place names.

===Early schools===
Granville&#x27;s first school was built in January 1806, approximately two months after the first band of settlers arrived. The log structure, which was used as both a school and a church, sat on the south side of the public square. It had windows made of oiled paper and benches and desks made of split logs. This building served as the local school for four to five years until the community build a framed schoolhouse on the east side of the square. By 1820, a three-story brick schoolhouse had been built. Because there were not enough students to fill it, only the main floor was used for educational purposes; the basement served as a market, and a Masonic fraternity used the upper floor. In 1854, the village built the Union School, which served as a district school and accommodated about 200 students.

Throughout the 19th century, Granville&#x27;s residents established a number of academies and seminaries (institutions of secondary education similar to high schools).

* Granville Academy / Doane Academy: Built in 1827 by the Congregational Church, Granville Academy was initially open to both males and females, but by the time it was incorporated by the Ohio Legislature in 1836, it served only women. The preparatory school changed its name to Doane Academy when it moved onto Denison University&#x27;s campus 1894. The academy closed in 1927 due to low enrollment, and the school building now houses Denison University&#x27;s administrative offices. 
* Granville Female Seminary / Episcopal Female Seminary: In 1832, the Baptist Society founded Granville Female Institute, which had a boarding house and educational building on Main Street. In 1840, the school changed ownership and became the Episcopal Female Seminary.
* Ladies&#x27; Female Institute / Baptist Female Seminary: The Ladies Female Institute was started in 1860 by Rev. N. S. Buxton and his wife, and it operated out of the basement of the Baptist church. Later, it consolidated with another school and became the Baptist Female Seminary.

The college now known as Denison University first organized in 1831 under the name Granville Literary and Theological Institute. It was located on a 135-acre farm southwest of Granville, where students performed manual labor. The school had four departments: preparatory, English, collegiate, and theological. Its name changed to Granville College in 1845, and in 1855, soon after its name changed to Denison University, the college moved to its current sight on a hill north of the village.

===Temperance===
The Temperance Movement, a social and religious movement against the consumption of alcohol, had many supporters in Granville. Jacob Little, a Congregationalist pastor in Granville from the late 1820s to 1866, was a leading advocate for temperance. Little sought to achieve temperance in Granville and dedicated most of his life to achieving this goal. He is well known for writing a large number of pamphlets. Little also presented his ideas on alcohol consumption through his annual New Year&#x27;s Day Sermons. In these sermons, he would highlight the wrongdoings of Granville members that had occurred throughout the previous year, publicly shaming those who consumed large amounts of alcohol. He continued his fight for temperance for 38 years, but temperance was not implemented in Granville until 1874.

The Granville Women&#x27;s Temperance League was formed in 1873 and worked to achieve temperance in Granville. In 1874 the Village Council banned the production, sale, and consumption of alcohol. The Granville Women&#x27;s Temperance League would organize public demonstrations, petitions, and educational campaigns to raise awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.

Granville&#x27;s pro-temperance stance played a role in the lynching of Carl Etherington, a 17-year-old Anti-Saloon League agent who was murdered in Newark, Ohio, after taking part in several saloon raids. On July 8, 1910, Granville&#x27;s mayor, Dr. E.J. Barns, tasked Etherington and at least 18 other hired agents with executing search and seizure warrants for illicit saloons in Newark, Ohio. In the ensuing confrontations between the agents and Newark citizens, Etherington shot a former police captain and bar owner, and he was subsequently chased, beaten, and killed.

The village of Granville remained dry until 1974, 41 years after the Prohibition ended.

=== Abolitionism ===
In the early days of the Abolitionist Movement, Granville was widely divided over the issue of slavery, but abolitionist groups began to grow in size and influence, holding regular meetings and lectures in the village. Oftentimes, these lectures were met with harsh resistance from anti-abolitionist locals, which eventually led to violence. For example, an abolitionist named Mr. Weld attempted to hold a lecture in Granville on April 1, 1835, but he was egged and stoned by townspeople. After multiple instances of these violent outbursts, citizens of Granville began to express apprehension about holding these lectures because of the division and aggression they were causing. With a large lecture scheduled to be held in Granville in April 1836 by an abolitionist group from Cleveland, Ohio, a notice was posted by some Granville residents in the &quot;Newark Gazette&quot; asking organizers not to hold the meeting in the village. Despite this, the meeting took place on April 27 of that year, and once again, anti-abolitionist townspeople retaliated. Large mobs gathered to egg and stone the lecturers, and even shaved the tails and manes of the horses belonging to the abolitionist group. After the convention, the two factions clashed in the streets, using bats and daggers as weapons. Though no one was killed, many were severely injured.

After this riot, the village&#x27;s approach towards abolitionism shifted. There was less retaliation out of fear of violence, and abolitionist groups grew in power. This growth led to Granville&#x27;s participation in the Underground Railroad system, not as a main station, but as an alternative route in the case that routes through Columbus or the surrounding areas were too dangerous. Among few of the most notable railroad operators were Joseph Linnel and Edwin Cooley Wright, who regularly hosted people fleeing from slavery on their farms.

Granville has a long history of being home to the administrative center of the American Baptist Church in Ohio. Formerly known as the Ohio Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Churches of Ohio&#x27;s office remains located in the village. Denison University was founded as a Baptist college and had a long association with the church. Like other Ohio independent colleges founded in the nineteenth century by religious denominations, the significance of Denison&#x27;s church affiliation faded and today the university is a non-sectarian institution.

==Education==

Granville&#x27;s public schools are operated by the Granville Exempted Village School District. The system includes, Granville High School, Granville Middle School, Granville Intermediate School and Granville Elementary School.

The district receives strong performance rankings from the Ohio Department of Education Located in the village is the Granville Christian Academy serving K-12 students. Also, there are several private preschools.
===Denison University===
On a hill overlooking the village is the campus of Denison University, founded in 1831 as the Granville Theological and Literary Seminary, originally affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention. Today, Denison is a private, residential, non-sectarian liberal arts college with a student body of about 2,300 and a faculty of 235. The school is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is certified by the Ohio Board of Regents to grant Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees. 74% of the student body comes from out of state, including representatives from forty countries. The Homestead at Denison University is a residential student intentional community focusing on environmental sustainability. Swasey Chapel is the iconic campus structure. Completed in 1924, the chapel is named in honor of Ambrose Swasey, a benefactor to the college and prominent Cleveland inventor and businessman.

The history of Granville has been interwoven with that of the college for nearly two centuries. Denison faculty and staff make up an important segment of the village&#x27;s population, and student patronage is central to many village businesses. Granville residents may take advantage of many university facilities, such as the athletic center, free of charge. The college has recently embarked on a number of in-town purchases, including the Granville Golf Club and the Granville Inn.

<text>Heath is a city in Licking County, Ohio, United States, and is located approximately 30 mi (48 km) east of Columbus. The population was 10,412 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
This area is known to have been populated by the Hopewell Indians through the first century CE. They built large earthworks, including ancient burial mounds which are now preserved within Moundbuilders State Memorial on the north side of the city.


This also has the Great Circle Earthwork, considered part of the Newark Earthworks, which has two other sections within the boundaries of nearby Newark, Ohio. The complex originally covered more than 3,000 acres, and was surveyed before 1850 by a team for the Smithsonian Institution. The -wide Newark Great Circle is one of the largest circular earthwork in the Americas, at least in construction effort. A deep moat is encompassed by walls that are high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.

The Newark Earthworks is operated as a state park by the Ohio History Connection. Designated as a National Historic Landmark, in 2006 the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the &quot;official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio.&quot;

===European-American settlement===
Early European-American settlement did not take place until the nineteenth century. Much of the county was originally devoted to agriculture. In the process of clearing and cultivating land, farmers destroyed some of the earthworks in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other development also encroached on the ancient works.

After World War II, Newark Air Force Base was established here, and it operated for 35 years as the seat of United States Air Force Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center. This function is now served by AFMETCAL and the contractor-operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab.

Heath was incorporated as a village in 1952, with Richard Hoback being elected as the first mayor. Over the next decade, Heath grew quickly, going from a population of 2,426 in 1960 to 6,066 in 1965, when it was chartered as the 196th city in Ohio. It is one of three in the county.

In 1986, Indian Mound Mall opened in Heath, the first and only indoor shopping mall in Licking County. By 1990, the city had a population of 7,231. Despite the large population growth on the western edge of Licking County, Heath remains the third-largest municipality in the county, and one of only three cities. Other residential areas nearby include Newark, Granville, and Hebron.

<doc id="129523" wikidata="Q986689" url="?curid=129523" title="Newark, Ohio">
<text>Newark ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Licking County, Ohio, United States; it is located east of Columbus at the junction of the forks of the Licking River. The population was 49,934 at the 2020 census, making it the 18th-largest city in Ohio. It is most known for having the world&#x27;s largest basket, former headquarters of the now defunct Longaberger Company. The city is part of the Columbus metropolitan area.

It is the site of much of the Newark Earthworks, a major ancient complex built by the Hopewell culture. The Great Circle portion and additional burial mounds are located in the neighboring city of Heath, Ohio. This complex has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and is operated as a state park by the Ohio History Connection.

==History==

Cultures of indigenous peoples lived along the river valleys for thousands of years before European contact. From more than two thousand years ago, 100 AD to 500 AD, people of the Hopewell culture transformed the area of Newark and Heath. They built many earthen mounds and enclosures, creating the single largest earthwork complex in the Ohio River Valley. The Newark Earthworks, designated a National Historic Landmark, have been preserved to document and interpret the area&#x27;s significant ancient history. The earthworks cover several square miles and about 206 acres. This is operated as a state park by the Ohio History Connection.

The Observatory Mound, Observatory Circle, and the interconnected Octagon earthworks span nearly in length. The Octagon alone is large enough to contain four Roman Coliseums. The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt would fit precisely within Observatory Circle. The even larger -diameter Newark Great Circle, located in Heath, is the largest circular earthwork in the Americas. The -high walls surround a -deep moat. At the entrance, the walls and moat are of greater and more impressive dimensions. 

Contemporary archaeogeodesy and archaeoastronomy researchers have demonstrated that the Hopewell and other prehistoric cultures had advanced scientific understandings which they used to create their earthworks for astronomical observations, markings and celebrations. Researchers analyzed the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the Hopewell earthworks to understand what had been done. Today, the Ohio Historical Society preserves the Great Circle Earthworks in a public park near downtown Newark, called Mound Builders Park (or the Newark Earthworks) located at 99 Cooper Ave, Newark, Ohio. The area of the Octagon Earthworks had been leased to a country club, but new arrangements in 1997 provided for more public access to it. Beginning in January of 2025, the Octagon Earthworks have now been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is open to full public access. Later American Indian tribes inhabiting the area at the time of European contact were distant descendants of the Hopewell peoples. 

===European-American settlement===
 After exploration by traders and trappers in earlier centuries, the first European-American settlers arrived in 1802, led by Gen. William C. Schenck. He named the new village after his New Jersey hometown.

Nineteenth-century investment in infrastructure resulted in growth in the town after it was linked to major transportation and trade networks. On July 4, 1825, Governors Clinton of New York and Morrow of Ohio dug the first shovelfuls of dirt for the Ohio and Erie Canal project, at the Licking Summit near Newark, Ohio. On April 11, 1855, Newark became a stop along the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad that was built to connect Pittsburgh to Chicago and St. Louis. On April 16, 1857, the Central Ohio Railroad connected Newark west to Columbus, and later Newark maintained a station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

The Heisey Glass Company started in Newark in 1895. The factory operated there for 62 years, until the company&#x27;s demise in 1957 due to changing tastes. The National Heisey Glass Museum, operated by the Heisey Collectors of America, Inc., is located on Sixth Street in Newark.

In 1909, The Arcade was opened. Modeled after innovative European retail buildings, it became one of Newark&#x27;s first successful retail emporiums. Later versions of buildings that contained a variety of shops indoors became known as shopping malls. At , the Arcade is one-third the size of an average modern Wal-Mart.

The main shopping center in the area is the Indian Mound Mall, located in nearby Heath. The mall is named for the internationally known, ancient complex called the Newark Earthworks, built 2,000 years ago by the Hopewell culture of central Ohio. It is a National Historic Landmark and major elements of the earthworks are located less than a mile away from the shopping mall named for them.

Ray Kinsella lives with his wife, Annie, and daughter, Karin, on their corn farm in Dyersville, Iowa. Troubled by his broken relationship with his late father John, a devoted baseball fan, Ray fears growing old without ever having done anything to achieve his dreams.

While walking through his cornfield one evening, he hears a voice whispering, &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; and sees a vision of a baseball diamond in the cornfield and the ghost of &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson standing in the middle. Annie agrees to uproot part of their field to build a baseball field, at risk of financial hardship.

As Ray builds the field, he tells Karin about the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. As Ray is beginning to doubt himself, Shoeless Joe reappears one evening. Joe asks Ray, &quot;Can I come back again? There were others, you know? There were eight of us.&quot; Ray replies, &quot;Any time; they&#x27;re all welcome here&quot;. The next day, Joe returns with the seven other Black Sox players. Annie&#x27;s brother, Mark, cannot see the players. He warns the couple they are going bankrupt and offers to buy their land. The voice, meanwhile, urges Ray to &quot;ease his pain.&quot;

Ray and Annie attend a PTA meeting, where she argues against someone who is trying to ban books by Terence Mann, a controversial author and activist from the 1960s. Ray deduces the voice was referring to Mann, who had named one of his characters &quot;John Kinsella&quot; and had once professed a childhood dream of playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. That night, after Ray and Annie have identical dreams about Ray and Mann attending a game together at Fenway Park, Ray drives to Boston to find him. Mann, who has become a disenchanted recluse, agrees to attend one game. There Ray hears the voice urging him to &quot;go the distance&quot;, seeing statistics on the scoreboard for Archie &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, who played in one 1922 game for the New York Giants but never got to bat. Mann also admits to hearing the voice and seeing the scoreboard.

The pair drive to Chisholm, Minnesota, and learn that Graham, who became a physician, had died years earlier. Ray researches Graham, whose obituary said he was a beloved and charitable doctor, but makes no mention of his baseball career. Ray suddenly finds himself in 1972, and meets an elderly Graham, who feels his calling in life is medicine, not sports, and declines to visit Ray&#x27;s baseball field. During the drive back to Iowa, Ray and Mann pick up a young hitchhiker named Archie Graham, who is looking for a baseball team to join. Ray later tells Mann that his father dreamed of being a baseball player, then tried to make him pick up the sport instead. At 14, after reading one of Mann&#x27;s books, Ray stopped playing catch with his father, and they became estranged after he mocked John, saying &quot;[he] could never respect a man whose hero [Joe] was a criminal.&quot; Ray admits that his greatest regret is that his father died before they could reconcile. As they continue the drive, Mann and Ray acknowledge the building of the field, and bringing Joe back, is Ray&#x27;s penance for the estrangement with his father. Arriving at the farm, they see various all-star players of the 1920s have arrived, fielding a second team. A game is played and Graham finally gets his turn at bat.

The next morning, Mark returns, demanding that Ray sell the farm or the bank will foreclose on him. Karin insists that people will pay to watch the ballgames. Mann agrees, saying that &quot;people will come&quot; to relive their childhood innocence. Ray and Mark scuffle, accidentally knocking Karin off the bleachers. despite knowing he will be unable to return after stepping off the saves her from choking on a hot dog. Having become old Doc Graham again, he reassures Ray that he has no regrets. As he heads back toward the cornfield, he is commended by the other players, and before he can disappear into the corn, Shoeless Joe calls out, &quot;Hey, rookie!&quot;, Graham stops and turns to Shoeless Joe, who tells him, &quot;You were good.&quot; Doc Graham&#x27;s eyes shine with tears before he smiles, turns back toward the corn, and disappears into it. Suddenly, Mark too can see the players and urges Ray to keep the farm after all.

Shoeless Joe invites Mann to enter the corn, and Mann disappears into it. Ray is angry at not being invited but Joe rebukes him, glancing towards the catcher at home plate, saying, &quot;If you build it, &quot;he&quot; will come.&quot; When the catcher removes his mask, Ray recognizes him as his father, John, as a young man. Ray and Annie then understand that &quot;ease his pain&quot; and &quot;go the distance&quot; both refer to his father. Ray says to Shoeless Joe, &quot;It was you&quot; [the voice], but Joe replies, &quot;No, Ray, it was you&quot;.

Ray introduces John to his wife and daughter, without acknowledging him as his father. Later, as evening falls, John says goodnight to Ray and they shake hands. As John is walking towards the cornfield, Ray calls out, &quot;Hey, Dad...you wanna have a catch?&quot;. John gladly accepts as hundreds of cars are seen approaching the field, fulfilling the prophecy that people will come to the field to watch baseball.

==Cast==

In addition, Anne Seymour, who died four months before the film&#x27;s release, makes her final film appearance as the kindly Chisholm publisher who helps Ray and Mann. The identity of the actor who provided &quot;The Voice&quot;, who speaks to Ray throughout the film, has remained unconfirmed since the film&#x27;s release. Some believe it is Costner or Liotta, but the book&#x27;s author W.P. Kinsella said he was told it was Ed Harris (Madigan&#x27;s husband). Then-teenagers Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were extras in the Fenway Park scene.

==Production==
20th Century Fox executive Sara Colleton first discovered and optioned &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; in early-1980s. Colleton developed the project with producers Lawrence and Charles Gordon. Lawrence Gordon worked for 20th Century Fox, part of the time as its president, and repeatedly mentioned that the book should be adapted into a film, but the studio always turned down the suggestion because they felt the project was too esoteric and noncommercial—Fox’s Production Chief, Scott Rudin, eventually withdrew his support and put &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; into turnaround. Meanwhile, Phil Alden Robinson went ahead with his script, frequently consulting Kinsella for advice on the adaptation. Lawrence Gordon left Fox in 1986 and started pitching the adaptation to other studios. Universal Pictures accepted the project in 1987 and hired USC coach Rod Dedeaux as baseball advisor. Dedeaux brought along World Series champion and USC alumnus Don Buford to coach the actors.

The film was shot using the novel&#x27;s title; eventually, an executive decision was made to rename it &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;. Robinson did not like the name, saying he loved &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;, and that the new title was better suited for one about dreams deferred. Kinsella told Robinson after the fact that his original title for the book had been &quot;The Dream Field&quot; and that the publisher had imposed the title &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;.

===Casting===
Robinson and the producers did not originally consider Kevin Costner for the part of Ray Kinsella because they did not think that he would want to follow &quot;Bull Durham&quot; with another baseball film. The role of Ray was first offered to Tom Hanks but he turned it down. He did, however, end up reading the script and became interested in the project, stating that he felt it would be &quot;this generation&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;&quot;. Since Robinson&#x27;s directing debut &quot;In the Mood&quot; had been a commercial failure, Costner also said that he would help him with the production. Amy Madigan, a fan of the book, joined the cast as Ray&#x27;s wife, Annie.

In the book, the writer Ray seeks out is real-life author J.D. Salinger. When Salinger threatened the production with a lawsuit if his name was used, Robinson decided to rewrite the character as reclusive Terence Mann. He wrote with James Earl Jones in mind because he thought it would be fun to see Ray trying to kidnap such a big man.

Robinson had originally envisioned Shoeless Joe Jackson as being played by an actor in his 40s, someone who would be older than Costner and who could thereby act as a father surrogate. Ray Liotta did not fit that criterion, but Robinson thought he would be a better fit for the part because he had the &quot;sense of danger&quot; and ambiguity which Robinson wanted in the character. The role of Moonlight Graham was offered to James Stewart but he turned it down.

Burt Lancaster had originally turned down the part of Moonlight Graham, but changed his mind after a friend, who was also a baseball fan, told him that he had to work on the film.

===Filming===
Filming began on May 25, 1988. The shooting schedule was built around Costner&#x27;s availability because he would be leaving in August to film &quot;Revenge&quot;. Except for some weather delays and other time constraints, production rolled six days a week. The interior scenes were the first ones shot because the cornfield planted by the filmmakers was taking too long to grow. Irrigation had to be used to quickly grow the corn to Costner&#x27;s height. Primary shot locations were in Dubuque County, Iowa; a farm near Dyersville was used for the Kinsella home; an empty warehouse in Dubuque was used to build various interior sets. Galena, Illinois, served as Moonlight Graham&#x27;s Chisholm, Minnesota. One week was spent on location shots in Boston, most notably Fenway Park.

Robinson, despite having a sufficient budget as well as the cast and crew he wanted, constantly felt tense and depressed during filming. He felt that he was under too much pressure to create an outstanding film, and that he was not doing justice to the original novel. Lawrence Gordon convinced him that the end product would be effective.

During a lunch with the Iowa Chamber of Commerce, Robinson broached his idea of a final scene in which headlights could be seen for miles along the horizon. The Chamber folks replied that it could be done and the shooting of the final scene became a community event. The film crew was hidden on the farm to make sure the aerial shots did not reveal them. A production assistant drove from the set into town and measured the distance between, deducing it would require 1,500 cars to fill the shot. Dyersville was then blacked out and local extras drove their vehicles to the field. In order to give the illusion of movement, the drivers were instructed to continuously switch between their low and high beams.

===Field===

Scenes of the Kinsella farm were taken on the property of Don Lansing in Dyersville, Iowa; some of the baseball field scenes were shot on the neighboring farm of Al Ameskamp. Because the shooting schedule was too short for grass to naturally grow, the experts on sod laying responsible for Dodger Stadium and the Rose Bowl were hired to create the baseball field. Part of the process involved painting the turf green.

===Music===
Leonard Bernstein was the first choice to compose the score for the film but he was overbooked. At first, James Horner was unsure if he could work on the film due to scheduling restrictions until he watched a rough cut and was so moved that he accepted the job of scoring it. Robinson had created a temp track which was disliked by Universal executives. When the announcement of Horner as composer was made, the executives felt more positive because they expected a big orchestral score, similar to Horner&#x27;s work for &quot;An American Tail&quot;. Horner, in contrast, liked the temporary score, finding it &quot;quiet and kind of ghostly&quot;. He decided to follow the idea of the temp track, creating an atmospheric soundtrack which would &quot;focus on the emotions&quot;. The score was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score but lost to the Alan Menken score for &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. In addition to Horner&#x27;s score, portions of several pop songs are heard during the film. They are listed in the following order in the closing credits:
* &quot;Crazy&quot;, written by Willie Nelson and performed by Beverly D&#x27;Angelo
* &quot;Daydream&quot;, written by John Sebastian and performed by the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful
* &quot;Jessica&quot;, written by Dickey Betts and performed by the Allman Brothers Band
* &quot;China Grove&quot;, written by Tom Johnston and performed by the Doobie Brothers
* &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot;, written by Billy Strayhorn and performed by Duke Ellington

==Historical connections==
The character played by Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley, Archibald &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, is based on an actual baseball player with the same name. His character is largely true to life except for a few factual liberties taken for artistic reasons. For instance, the real Graham&#x27;s lone major league game occurred in June 1905, rather than on the final day of the 1922 season. The real Graham died in 1965, as opposed to 1972 as the film depicts. In the film, Terence Mann interviews a number of people about Graham. The DVD special points out that the facts they gave him were taken from articles written about the real man.

==Release==
Universal scheduled &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; to open in the U.S. on April 21, 1989. The film debuted in just a few theaters and was gradually released to more screens so that it would have a spot among the summer blockbusters. It ended up playing until December. The film was released in the Philippines by Eastern Films on November 1, 1989.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is sentimental, but in the best way; it&#x27;s a mix of fairy tale, baseball, and family togetherness.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert awarded the film a perfect four stars, admiring its ambition: &quot;This is the kind of movie Frank Capra might have directed, and James Stewart might have starred in—a movie about dreams.&quot; Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;A work so smartly written, so beautifully filmed, so perfectly acted, that it does the almost impossible trick of turning sentimentality into true emotion.&quot; Duane Byrge of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Costner for his performance, writing that it was his &quot;eye-on-the-ball exuberance that carries &quot;Dreams&quot; past its often mechanical aesthetic paces.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mixed review: &quot;In spite of a script hobbled with cloying aphorisms and shameless sentimentality, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; sustains a dreamy mood in which the idea of baseball is distilled to its purest essence.&quot;

Peter Travers at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; panned the film, and wrote: &quot;To be honest, I started hearing things, too. Just when Jones was delivering an inexcusably sappy speech about baseball being &quot;a symbol of all that was once good in America,&quot; I heard the words &quot;If he keeps talking, I&#x27;m walking.&quot;&quot;

Former U.S. president George W. Bush named the film as his favorite, saying that it made him cry because it reminded him of playing catch with his father.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1990: Best Picture (Gordon &amp; Gordon), Best Adapted Screenplay (Robinson), and Best Original Score (Horner). It did not win in any category.

In 2017, the US Library of Congress selected &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; as one of its 25 annual additions to the National Film Registry. The announcement quotes film critic Leonard Maltin, who called the film &quot;a story of redemption and faith, in the tradition of the best Hollywood fantasies with moments of pure magic.&quot;

In June 2008, after having polled over 1,500 people in the creative community, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot; — the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres. The film was acknowledged as the sixth best one in the fantasy genre.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS in 1989. It was later released on DVD on April 29, 1998. It was released on Blu-ray on March 13, 2011. It was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on May 14, 2019, for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Legacy==

The ballpark that was built for the movie is maintained as a tourist attraction.

The first year after shooting the film, farm owner Al Ameskamp again grew corn on his property, but then restored his portion of the field the next year and added a souvenir shop. Farmer Don Lansing maintained his property as a tourist destination. He did not charge for admission or parking, deriving revenue solely from his own souvenir shop. By the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, approximately 65,000 people visited annually. In July 2010, the farm containing the &quot;Field&quot; was listed for sale. It was sold on October 31, 2011, to Go The Distance Baseball, LLC for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around $5.4 million. In 2021, MLB veteran and Hall of Fame member Frank Thomas became the majority owner.

===MLB at Field of Dreams===

In 2019, Major League Baseball announced that it would hold a neutral-site regular season game between the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees at the Dyersville site on August 13, 2020, playing on an 8,000-seat field constructed adjacent to the original, with a pathway connecting the two. The field would be modeled after the White Sox&#x27;s former field, Comiskey Park (1910–1990). In July 2020, because of the shortened 2020 Major League Baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the White Sox would be playing the St. Louis Cardinals instead of the Yankees. On August 3, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that the 2020 game was cancelled due to logistics.

The game was finally held on the field on August 12, 2021, with the originally announced matchup of the White Sox and Yankees. In the pre-game show, Kevin Costner emerged from the cornfield onto the outfield, followed by the players and managers from both teams. At the old-fashioned microphone in the diamond, Costner said, &quot;Is this heaven? Yes, it is.&quot; The White Sox beat the Yankees 9–8, following a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning by Tim Anderson, after the Yankees had scored four runs in the top of the inning to take an 8–7 lead.

A second Field of Dreams game was played during the 2022 season on August 11 with the Cincinnati Reds – who beat the White Sox in the 1919 World Series that was marred by the Black Sox Scandal – facing the Chicago Cubs, with the Cubs winning 4–2. This time, the movie was referenced in the pregame ceremonies by Ken Griffey Jr. asking his father Ken Griffey Sr. if he wanted to play catch. Both Griffeys – who played for the Reds and also played together for the Seattle Mariners – were joined first by fathers and sons (and daughters) also playing catch. The Cubs and Reds then also entered from the cornfield beyond centerfield along with multiple National Baseball Hall of Fame members representing both teams – catcher Johnny Bench and shortstop Barry Larkin for the Reds along with second baseman Ryne Sandberg, outfielder Andre Dawson, pitcher Ferguson Jenkins and left fielder Billy Williams for the Cubs. Jenkins also threw the ceremonial first pitch to Bench.

===Television series proposal===
In August 2021, plans were announced to remake the film as a television series, produced by Lawrence Gordon and written by Michael Schur, for Peacock. In June 2022, it was revealed it was no longer moving forward as Peacock and Universal Television had begun shopping the project elsewhere. Chris Pratt had reportedly agreed to star in the series before dropping out, with the series said to have had a budget of $15 million per episode.

<text>Bellefontaine ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Logan County, Ohio, United States, located 48 miles (77 km) northwest of Columbus. The population was 14,115 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Bellefontaine micropolitan area, which includes all of Logan County. The highest point in Ohio, Campbell Hill, is within the city limits.

==History==
The name Bellefontaine means &quot;beautiful spring&quot; in French, and is purported to refer to several springs in the area. However, locally, the original French pronunciation is not used, and it is pronounced &quot;bell fountain.&quot;

===Blue Jacket&#x27;s Town===
Around 1777, the Shawnee war chief Blue Jacket (&quot;Weyapiersenwah&quot;) built a settlement here, known as &quot;Blue Jacket&#x27;s Town&quot;. Blue Jacket and his band had previously occupied a village along the Scioto River, but the American Revolutionary War had reached the Ohio Country. Blue Jacket and other American Indians who took up arms against the American revolutionaries relocated in order to be closer to their British allies at Detroit.

After the United States gained independence, its forces continued warfare against former Indian allies of the British. Blue Jacket&#x27;s Town was destroyed in Logan&#x27;s Raid, conducted by Kentucky militia in 1786 at the outset of the Northwest Indian War. The expedition was led by Benjamin Logan, namesake of Logan County. Blue Jacket and his followers relocated further northwest to the Maumee River.

Beginning in the 1800s, American Revolutionary War veterans and others from Virginia and elsewhere began settling in the area of Blue Jacket&#x27;s Town. Bellefontaine is on or near the edge of the Virginia Military District, where the cash-poor government granted tracts of land to veterans in payment for their services during the war. The Treaty of Greenville defined lands to be held by European Americans as separate from those to be held by natives but it was poorly administered in the area and whites frequently encroached on native lands.

===Railroads===
Bellefontaine was platted by European Americans in 1820 and incorporated by the legislature in 1835.
In 1837, the Mad River &amp; Lake Erie Railroad built the first railroad to Bellefontaine. This began its reputation as a railroading town. In the 1890s the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (also called the Big Four Railroad) built a main terminal in the city. This terminal boasted the largest roundhouse between New York and St. Louis.

Though railroading hit hard times and the industry went through radical restructuring in the late 20th century, and the Big Four terminal ceased operations in 1983, Bellefontaine remains a landmark on America&#x27;s railways. The city is now just a thoroughfare for CSX.

===Automotive transportation===

In 1891, Bellefontaine became the location of the first concrete street in America. George Bartholomew invented a process for paving using Portland cement, which until then had been used in stone construction. A small section of Main Street, on the west side of the Logan County Courthouse, was the first to be paved using that process. When that proved successful, Court Avenue, which runs along the south side of the courthouse, was paved with concrete. While Main Street is now paved with asphalt, Court Avenue has retained its original concrete pavement for more than 100 years. At its centennial, the street was closed to vehicular traffic and a statue of Bartholomew placed at its Main Street end; it became a pedestrian way. Since then one lane has been reopened for eastbound traffic.

In 1979, Honda began manufacturing motorcycles in the nearby city of Marysville, Ohio. Since that time, Honda&#x27;s operations in the Bellefontaine area have greatly expanded. Bellefontaine is a central location among Honda operations in Marysville, East Liberty, Russells Point, Anna, and Troy, Ohio. Honda is Bellefontaine&#x27;s largest employer in the early 21st century.

U.S. Route 68 intersects with State Routes 47 and 540 in Bellefontaine. U.S. Route 33, a freeway that has interchanges with US 68 and SR 540, skirts the northern edge of the city.

===Campbell Hill===

To European settlers, Campbell Hill was first known as Hogue&#x27;s Hill, perhaps a misspelling of Solomon Hoge&#x27;s surname, the person who first deeded the land in 1830. In 1898, the land was sold to Charles D. Campbell, in whose name Campbell Hill is now known. Campbell sold the hill and surrounding land to August Wagner.

In 1950, the family of August Wagner deeded Campbell Hill and the surrounding 57.5 acres to the U.S. government. The government stationed the 664th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron on the hill in 1951. This military unit was responsible for monitoring for possible aerospace attacks from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The 664th AC&amp;WS and similar military units were eventually superseded by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (or NORAD). The base in Bellefontaine was closed in 1969.

The Ohio Hi-Point Vocational-Technical District opened a school atop the hill in 1974. The school is now known as the Ohio Hi-Point Career Center.

=== Revitalization ===
In 2012 local real estate developer Small Nation purchased and renovated the former J.C. Penney building. Since then, the organization invested over $33 million in renovating over 56 downtown buildings and attracting new businesses to the area. The investment into the properties created roughly 200 jobs in the city. In 2018, Bellefontaine was classified as an Opportunity Zone to further attract investors to the area. Neighboring areas have begun using Bellefontaine as a model to attract more investment in their own towns.

In 2022, Bellefontaine was named one of Ohio&#x27;s Best Hometowns by Ohio Magazine for its downtown redevelopment efforts, thriving sense of community and appreciation for preserving local history.

In 2022, Bellefontaine&#x27;s Christmas parade included a drag queen and over 60 residents opposed their appearance at a City Council meeting, prompting drag queens and supporters attending a later council meeting in support. In 2023, the opposing residents began pushing for a city ordinance that would classify drag performances as ‘adult entertainment,&#x27; making it one of the first municipalities in Ohio to do so. The Ohio Supreme Court unanimously ruled to remove the measure from the ballot when petitioners changed the ballot language after circulating petitions.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The city of Bellefontaine is at the convergence of the humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) and humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) climate zones according to the Köppen climate map. The region is characterized by four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold with mild periods, and summers are generally hot and muggy, with significant precipitation year-round. The city is too far south to experience lake effect snow from the Great Lakes region, however it does experience more snow than surrounding areas due to the city&#x27;s elevation. Traditionally, Bellefontaine&#x27;s elevation excludes it from tornadoes and floods that affect the majority of the Miami Valley.

* McKinley Street — Whether or not this is the shortest street in the world is a point of contention. The sign at the street&#x27;s south end (at the intersection of Columbus Ave.) once made such a claim, although Ebenezer Place, in Wick, Scotland, has held the official record since November 2006. The City of Bellefontaine&#x27;s website places the length of McKinley Street at &quot;about 20 feet&quot;, and while the city&#x27;s website does not make the claim of the world&#x27;s shortest street, it does cite McKinley Street as &quot;the shortest street in America&quot;. The street sign&#x27;s undersign reads &quot;Shortest Street In America&quot; as of May 2, 2020.
* Court Avenue - A small street in downtown, located adjacent to the Logan County Courthouse. It is known for being the first street in the United States to be paved with concrete.
* Holland Theater - This theater is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Logan County Historical Society===
The Logan County Historical Society and museum was first housed in the McBeth School, built in 1919 as the last of the four elementary schools to be built in Bellefontaine at the turn of the century. The building was sold at public auction in 1957 to the Church of God. In 1971 McBeth School was purchased by the Logan County Historical Society for use as the Logan County Historical Museum. The historical society eventually grew out of the 3-story building and moved to its current home closer to Downtown. McBeth School has been adapted for use as an apartment building.

Today the museum includes the Orr mansion, former home of the local Orr family; as well as an extension to the mansion that includes history exhibits from around the county. The Mansion portion of the building has been completely restored by the historical society. Day-to-day operations in the museum and The Logan County Historical Society are supported by a Logan County tax levy and donations received from visitors to the museum.
