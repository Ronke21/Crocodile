<text>Albion is a town in the northeastern part of Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 2,009 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Prior to 1788, Native Americans would come to the area to hunt and fish for salmon during the spawning season. They called it Alkineaur, meaning &quot;sand bank.&quot; The territory was annexed to the state of New York on March 1, 1788.

Then, in 1791, two brothers, John and Nicholas Roosevelt bought a tract of land from the state, part of which would later become the town of Albion. They sold the land to George Scriba, a Dutchman, on April 7, 1792. In December 1794, Scriba received a patent from the state. The land was now referred to as &quot;Scriba&#x27;s Patent.&quot;

In January, the subdivision of the land started. On March 24, 1804, the Town of Williamstown was formed from Oneida County. On February 20, 1807, the Town of Richland was formed from Oneida County. Part of this would later become the Town of Albion.

In 1812, the first settler arrived. A fur trader by the name of Cary Burdick bought a parcel of land on the Williamstown road, about two miles (3 km) south of present-day Altmar. In 1813, the Lilly brothers, David, Luther and Benjamin, settled near Burdick, and built the first sawmill. This is where Luther Lilly&#x27;s first son was born.

The first settler of the present-day village of Altmar arrived. Peter Henderson, from Scotland, bought of land bordering the Salmon River, and began clearing it for farmland. In 1814, Dr. Brace, a physician, opened a tavern in the village of Sand Bank. In 1816, the first schoolhouse in the town was built, with Sylvia Breed as the first teacher. In 1819, the first marriage, between H.B. Baker of Albany and Lucy Burdick (Cary Burdick&#x27;s daughter), took place. Moses Rich arrived in Sand Bank in 1822, and built the first Grist Mill. On March 24, 1825, the Town of Albion was set apart from the Town of Richland. On the original survey map of Scriba&#x27;s Patent, this was known as Township 22. George Scriba called it Alkmaar after a town in his home country of Holland. The first town meeting was held in Albion on May 3 that same year. Local officials were chosen for various offices. In 1828, a native of Oneida county, Ammi Hinckley, arrived in Sand Bank and opened a general store. Another tavern, kept by William Abbott, was in business around the same time.

On January 27, 1829, the First Presbyterian Church was established. Services were held in the schoolhouse. This later became the First Congregational Church. The Union Church was established on January 8, 1834, in Sand Bank. It was shared by Presbyterians and Methodists. Also in 1837, the Albion Baptist Church was organized. The Pineville Methodist-Episcopal Church was built. The foundation was made with stones picked from the shores of Lake Ontario, and transported to Salmon River (now called Pineville) by wagon. In 1856, the Dugway Union Church was organized and a building was erected. The village of Sand Bank was incorporated on February 21, 1876. On October 13, 1885, the village was almost completely destroyed by fire. All that remained of the business district was the Congregational Church and the Episcopal Church, which was under construction. On February 17, 1895, the Methodist congregation constructed a new church. About a month later, on March 18, 1895, Sand Bank was changed to Altmar.

During the summer of 1837, Albion&#x27;s first post office was established. William Abbott became the first Postmaster, and William Worden became the first mail carrier. He delivered mail between Oswego, Utica and Albion. A building was erected in 1852 at Albion Center (on a corner of Tinker Tavern Road and County Route 22). This later became known as Grange Hall, and still stands today, although not in use. In the 1840s to 1850s, there was an influx of settlers to Albion that caused a demand for lumber which became the predominant industry because of the new construction. In 1850, a &quot;plank road&quot; was constructed between Albion and Constantia, which is now Route 13. Two toll gates at the village limits of Sand Bank were constructed.

In 1851, the construction through Albion of the R. W. &amp; O. Railroad (Rome, Watertown &amp; Oswego Railroad) began. The station at Sand Bank was completed in May. In 1852, the Chapman brothers, James, Irving and George, built the first of many tanneries in the township. Many Irish immigrants, escaping from the Great Famine in the 1840s, found work here. On March 21, 1853, the Sand Bank Cemetery Association was established. In the 1860s, 350 men from Albion enlisted in the Union Army and Navy. Fifty-six of these men lost their lives, and many more were permanently injured.

On June 14, 1911, the Civil War Monument was unveiled in the Riverside Cemetery in Altmar. In 1918, twenty-two men from Albion served in World War I. On June 15, that same year, Delbert Russel was killed in action. On April 24, 1936, a brick school was built in Altmar, with Elston Ecker as the first principal. It is now called the Altmar Elementary School, and will be closed in 2012 due to lack of students enrolling. In the 1940s, twenty men from Albion served in World War II. On October 4, 1944, Edgar Tryon was killed in action. He is interred in Edinburgh, Netherlands. On April 28, 1959, the Altmar-Parish-Williamstown School District built a new high school in Parish. It opened in the fall of 1960. The first graduating class, in 1961, included Nancy Virginia Hess and her sister Dorothy Ann Hess. Dorothy Hess died in 1963 of hepatitis. Her grave can be found in the Riverside Cemetery in Altmar. In 1979, the Salmon River Fish Hatchery began construction in Altmar. Also, Charles William August Hess, a resident of Altmar, died of cancer. He was buried next to his daughter, Dorothy, in an unmarked grave. In 1989, the Altmar-Parish-Williamstown School District built a new middle school, across the road from the high school.

<text>Amboy is a town in Oswego County, New York, United States. It should not be confused with a populated place of the same name in Onondaga County. The population was 1,263 at the 2010 census. The town is named after a location in New Jersey.

The Town of Amboy is in the southeastern part of the county.

== History ==
The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1805. The Town of Amboy was created in 1830 from part of the Town of Williamstown.
With the exception of the towns of Palermo and Schroeppel, both of which were organized in 1832, Amboy is the latest town in point of formation in the county. Settlement within its borders did not begin until several years after other localities had become the home of pioneers. Amboy was organized on March 25, 1830, when it was taken from Williamstown. It lies on the east border of the county, a little south of the center. The soil of this town is a rich loam; has been productive of excellent crops of grain, and is now giving encouraging returns in dairying. The town is principally drained by small streams which are tributary to Oneida Lake. There is a series of ponds in the western part, locally known as Upper and Lower Ponds and North and South Ponds Panther Lake extends into the southeastern corner of the town from Constantia. Fish Creek flows east across the corner of the town into Oneida county. Little River rises in the central part and flows southeasterly out of the county. The north half of the town is within the gray limestone region and the southern half is a part of the red sandstone region. The town is township number six of Scriba&#x27;s patent, by which it was called” Middleburgh,” and it has an area of 22,866 acres.

The first settler in this town was Joseph Perkins, who came from Connecticut in 1805; settled on the east half of lot 14; and sometime in that year opened a public house where John Jacobs now lives. He lived there until his death, being accidentally killed while working in the woods. He left a family of two sons and three daughters, but no one of his descendants is now a resident.

What has been known as the “Five Corners,” where the first settlements in the town were made, is situated about two miles north-east of Amboy Center. Settlements were slow for several years David Smith came in 1815 and located at the site of the village, near the present burial ground, where he lived until 1828, and then moved away. Isaac Claxton came in 1818 and was followed a few years later by his brother William. They purchased a large tract of land in the northeastern part of the town, where they made somewhat extensive improvements, afterwards selling out to Richard Carter and removing elsewhere in the town. They both reared families, but their descendants have mostly left this locality. John Drought came also in 1818 and settled on the east half of lot No. 139, where he lived until 1828, when he sold to Julian and Richard Carter and removed to Camden, Oneida county, and died there. The settlement known as “Carteryule,” took its name from the Carter families mentioned. At one time the place enjoyed the benefits of a post-office. It also contained a tannery, saw mill, and store, all of which were destroyed by fire in July 1883, entailing a loss of about $6,000. Isaac and John Drought, who now (1894) live there, are sons of the pioneer John.

Sage Parks came to the town in 1821 and settled on lots 14 and 29. He soon afterward sold out to John Moore and purchased lot 105, where he lived until shortly before his death, which occurred at Amboy Center. His son, John Parks, is still a resident of the town. Sage Parks was a prominent citizen; was the first supervisor; and held the office in 1830-31. He also built the first grist mill in the town in 1824; it had one run of stones and was used only for coarse grinding; it stood about three-fourths of a mile east of Amboy Center. John Hasselkus married a daughter of Sage Parks.

The first saw mill in the town was not built until 1822, seventeen years after the pioneer settlement. It was located at Carterville, and was built by Joseph Murphy.

The first school house was built in the winter of 1822—3 about two miles east of the present village of Amboy Center. A school had been taught the previous summer by Cynthia Stoddard, who was the first teacher in the town.

The few settlers prior to 1822 made such improvements as their circumstances permitted, and waited patiently for the arrival of more neighbors. They dwelt in a forest, off from the main line of travel, and were forced to depend almost wholly on themselves

Among the settlers who came in between 1821 and 1825 were John G. Howard and William Henry from Rhode Island, Horace Foote from Clinton, Gilbert Albee, Asa Brown, and Archibald Chapman. Ephraim Mowrey came to the town before 1822 and in that year opened the first regular hotel at the Five Corners, on lot 26, in a double log house. Some years later he built a large frame structure on lot No. 11 and kept the hotel there in the building which is still standing. Mr. Mowrey has no descendants in the town.

In 1824 the first religious organization was effected by Freewill Baptists, with Rev. Truman Gillett pastor, who continued until 1842. Services were held mostly in private dwellings. A small church was built largely by the pastor, just before he left.

Some other settlers prior to 1830 were Frederick Ambrose, who was the first town clerk; Anson Abels, one of the first assessors; Ephraim and Joshua L. Smith; and John Jamison, who became a prominent citizen, and died about 1885, leaving four sons and two daughters. One son, F. G. Jamison, is still a resident in the town, on the old homestead, Mr. Jamison was one of the first school inspectors and held the office of supervisor at least seven terms. Nathaniel Williams, Dorastus Green (supervisor in 1832—4), Alvin Cranson, Daniel Whitlock, Sylvanus Coon, G. W. Sergeant (born here in 1828, father of G. W. Sergeant, a prominent citizen, and still living), John Hess, Esick Look, Levi and Garrett Nichols, and others, all performed their part in subduing the wilderness, administering public affairs, and making substantial homes for themselves and their children.

Down to 1830, as before noted, township No. 6, in Scriba&#x27;s Patent, was a part of Williamstown; but now the inhabitants felt that their convenience as well as the importance of their community demanded a separate town organization. A meeting was called, the necessary steps determined upon, and all went well until the question was suggested of a name for the new town. Discussion followed until a late hour without a decision, and another meeting was held for the purpose, and still a conclusion was not reached. Three other meetings were held and the question argued when finally Frederick Ambrose suggested “Amboy,” from the town of that name in New Jersey. It met with general approval and the town was organized by act of legislature dated March 25, 1830. Five days later the first town meeting was held and the following officers elected:

Sage Parks, supervisor; Frederick Ambrose, town clerk; Anson Abels, Sylvanus Coon, P. A. Kidelle, assessors; Josima L. Smith, Truman M. Kinne, Dorastus Green, commissioners of highways; Alvin Cranson, collector; Sage Parks, Ephraim Smith, James Edmonds, commissioners of schools; John Jamison, Nathaniel Williams, Frederick Ambrose, inspectors of common schools; Anson Abels, John G. Woodward, overseers of the poor; Alvin Cranson, John Edmonds, John J. Wheeler, constables; Daniel Whitlock, Julian Carter, Sylvanus Coon, justices of the peace.

Samuel Whaley settled near Amboy Center about 1848 and died in town at the age of eighty-three. His brother George came in several years before and died here in 1892, aged ninety, one. A number of their descendants still reside in Amboy.

John Garber located on the old Mexico road at an early day and kept hotel there many years, and also manufactured potash. He died here in 1871, aged eighty nine. He was the father of the late Henry Garber, a lawyer of Cleveland.

The population of Amboy at the various periods noted was as follows: In 1830, 699; 1835, 766; 1840, 1,084; 1845, 988; 1850, 1,132; 1855, 1,172; 1860, 1,402; 1865, 1,423; 1870, 1,431; 1875, 1,277; 1880, 1,244; 1890, 969.

The breaking out of the Rebellion found a responsive spirit of patriotism in Amboy, as in most other towns. More than 150 volunteers responded to the several calls for troops, and many of them offered up their lives for the preservation of the Union. Several of these died in Southern prison pens; nearly a score were killed in battle or died of wounds; while many more fell victims to disease. The town authorities were prompt and liberal in voting the large bounties that were paid to volunteers and in other ways gave support and encouragement to the soldiers in the field.

Amboy is essentially a farming community. Here the character of agriculture has changed considerably since the early years, when crop raising was largely the dependence of the farmers. Hops were formerly raised to some extent, but in later years dairying has largely taken the place of other pursuits; cheese-making forming the chief part of the industry. There are at present two cheese factories in the town. Following the close of the war and while there were still extensive timber forests in and near the town, quite a number of mills were built and put in operation. At one period there were ten running and producing large quantities of lumber. Now (1894) there are only two or three in operation.

The town contains seven school districts with a school house in each, which employed in 1892-3 seven teachers and were attended by 185 scholars. The school buildings and sites are valued at $2,615; assessed valuation of districts, $159,586; public money received from the State, $832.36; raised by local tax, $513.52. The school districts are designated as follows: No. 1, Carterville; 2, East Amboy; 3, North Amboy; 4, Amboy Center; 5, West Amboy; 6, Stone Hill; and 7, Mud Hill.

Supervisor&#x27;s statistics of 1894. - Acres of resident lands, 21,947; non- resident, 1,644; assessed valuation of real estate, $167,935; equalized, $175,116; personal property, $4,050; value of railroads, $5,000; town tax, $1,099.27; county tax, $1,003.33; total tax levy, $2,476.40; dog tax, $62.50; rate of tax on $100, $1.44. The town constitutes one election district and in November 1894, 251 votes were polled.

The village of West Amboy is pleasantly situated in the western part of the town. It has no manufactures of consequence, and comprises the hotel kept by Philip Hess, which was burned and rebuilt in 1884, and the cheese factory by the same proprietor; the grist mill operated by Henry Bliss; and Stanton &amp; Joslyn and Stanton &amp; Garber, merchants. Nelson Jennings and Seeley Wakefield have blacksmith shops, and William Hall carries on a saw mill, cheese box factory, and planing mill which he built in 1885. The postmaster is Alonzo Joslyn. Among his predecessors were Nelson Cromwell, Dr. Joseph Pero, D. W. Crandall, and William Sheldon. Here was formerly an extensive tannery, which was built by Youngs &amp; Cromwell about 1852. It passed into the hands of H. J. Brooks and was discontinued some twenty years ago. F. H. Berry was long its superintendent. A little south of the village, near what is called the &quot;hogsback,&quot; a log hotel was early kept for a time by a Mr. Preston. Arthur Simmons at an early period had a saw mill here, while Alfred, his brother, carried on for a few years an extensive general business.

The small village of Amboy Center is situated as its name indicates, in the central part of the town. Among those formerly in mercantile business here were F. M. Tousley, that store now being conducted by David Spoon &amp; Son; Stephen Williams; and J. N. Short &amp; Son, whose former store is now conducted by W. E. Lewis &amp; Co. The hotel that had been kept by J. J. O&#x27;Gara was burned in February 1892. The cheese factory here is carried on by Robert Foils. Among the postmasters have been Clay Short, F. M. Tousley, George W. Sergeant, David Wilson, Seymour Spoon, William E. Lewis, and John W. Whaley, present incumbent.

Churches. - The earliest church in Amboy was the Freewill Baptist, organized in 1824, which has been previously mentioned. This society finally ceased to exist and the church building was converted into a town hail in 1892.

The Methodist church of Amboy was organized early in the history of the town, the date not being definitely known. It was a part of the Salmon River Conference, but in 1836 became a part of the Black River Conference. The pastor at the time of the change was Rev. W. H. Gaylord. The church has always been prosperous. The church edifice was erected prior to 1850. A Methodist society was organized at Carterville about 1870, and the edifice erected in 1871. The first trustees were N. H. Adams, Charles H. Jeliff, and Daniel T. Morton. Both Methodist churches are now served by Rev. William Ashford, and have a combined membership of about 112. The entire property, including a parsonage, is valued at $2,400.

<text>:&quot;There is also a Town of Fulton in Schoharie County, and a Fulton County in New York.&quot;

Fulton is a city in the western part of Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 11,389 as of the 2020 census. The city is named after Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat.

== History ==
The city of Fulton is a community in two parts. The area on the west side of the Oswego River was formerly known as &quot;Oswego Falls&quot; recognizing the nearby rapids on the river. (The name &quot;Oswego&quot; is from the Iroquois word meaning &quot;the outpouring.&quot;) It was one of the first regions settled in the original Town of Granby. Settlements took place in two west-side locations, the &quot;Upper Landing&quot; and the &quot;Lower Landing.&quot; The community was incorporated as a village in 1835. In 1902, the Village of Fulton and the Village of Oswego Falls merged, and the resulting community was chartered as the City of Fulton. The two sides of the river have long been connected by two bridges-one known locally as the &quot;upper bridge&quot; (Broadway/NY State Route 3) and the other more commonly known as the &quot;lower bridge&quot; (Oneida St.) Both bridges have been rebuilt or refurbished a number of times during the history of the villages and city.

On August 6, 1931, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, pitching for the House of David semi-pro team, defeated the Byrne Sieberlings 5–3 in a game played in Fulton, NY. The contest was played before only 2,000 people. The Byrne Sieberlings, sponsored by the J. P. Byrne Tire Company, featured some of Central New York&#x27;s greatest semi-pro ball players.

The industrial nature of the small city led to a very stable workforce for many years. In fact, during the Great Depression of the early 1930s, the New York Sun newspaper (NYC) wrote a lengthy article describing Fulton, its residents and the strong local economy. It was headlined as, &quot;Fulton, the City the Great Depression Missed.&quot;

In 1942, Caroline Speare Rohland won a WPA commission to paint a post office mural for the town. &quot;Father LeMoyne Trying to Convert the Indians on Pathfinder Island&quot; was an oil on canvas depicting local Indians interacting with Europeans. The post office was placed on the National Register of Historic Places for Oswego County, New York in 1989.

At a May 2009 Common Council meeting, it was disclosed that the City of Fulton was exploring the possibility of merging with the neighboring towns of Granby and Volney to create one larger city. This idea has been floated several times before and has yet to come to fruition.

The Oak Street School, Mount Adnah Cemetery, Fulton Public Library, Chancellor (tugboat), John Wells Pratt House, State Street Methodist Episcopal Church, David Van Buren House, John Van Buren Tavern, Volkert Van Buren House, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Oswego Canal, which passes through Fulton, is included in the New York State Barge Canal Historic District. The West Broadway Commercial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.

==Industrial and commercial history==

American Woolen Mills, a large textile firm located on the west bank of the Oswego River, provided uniforms and other cloth-related supplies for the US Army in both World Wars. Many early Italian and Polish immigrants lived in simple wood-framed company housing and shopped at the company store during this time period. The factory-owned housing was eventually sold to the employee-occupants. Joining the woolen mills was the adjacent &quot;Silk Mill.&quot; The American Woolen Mills closed their Fulton operations in the early 1950s. The largest buildings were demolished in the summer of 1962. Another industry located on the west side of the river bank and using the force of the river water to power manufacturing equipment was the Foster Brothers&#x27; Knife Works, which produced cutlery. Besides Poles, the west side of the river was also settled with a sizable community of Italian immigrants as well as Czechoslovakians, Ukrainians, Syrians, and other, mostly Eastern European nationalities.
The area on the east side of the Oswego River was originally a part of the Township of Volney. Over time the east-side grew in industry, commerce, and residential development. In its prime, the east-side had a significant (several square blocks) downtown area (the primary retail business area was once known as &quot;The Dizzy Block&quot;) with nearly one hundred stores and shops.

Several factories were located north and the south of the downtown area along the Oswego River to make use of the rapids and fast-flowing water for power. Some of the industries located here over the years included Hunter Arms, Hunter Bicycle, Hunter Fan, Sealright-Oswego Falls Corporation (later, Phillips 66 Corporation and more recently, Huhtamäki Consumer Packaging) making paper and plastic coated packaging, Dilts, (later, Black-Clawson), a paper and plastic machine manufacturer.

When Peter Cailer Kohler (later Nestlé, S.A.) began chocolate production in the United States, Fulton became home to the first U.S. chocolate manufacturing facility, notably producing milk chocolate invented by Peter. Many Swiss, skilled in the art of making chocolate, followed the company to Fulton and settled here. Many of their descendants still live in the area. In 1938, the Nestle Crunch bar was invented at the facility. However, in 2003, after more than 100 years, citing the high cost of restoring and updating the aging plant, Nestle closed the factory, leaving four hundred local employees jobless. Factory employees hung the Nestlé company flag outside the factory upside down the day the closing was announced by company officials.

Subsequent to the closing of the Nestlé plant, investors from Ivory Coast purchased the chocolate factory and attempted to reopen it as &quot;New York Chocolate and Confections Company&quot;. The company filed for bankruptcy and local Oswego County officials tried to find an appropriate buyer for the property so that it could continue to work toward a reopening. On June 30, 2010, the plant and its assets were sold again. Subsequently, the facility was demolished to allow for redevelopment. Facilities currently operating on the site include an Aldi supermarket and a Technical Operations facility for Spectrum.

The Miller Brewing Company operated a plant in the Town of Volney, (just outside Fulton city limits) from the mid-1970s until its closure in 1994. The former plant was partially retrofitted and was used for a short time as an ethanol production facility with only limited production. In 2008, the owners filed for bankruptcy and in May, 2009, the facility was sold at auction to Sunoco. A retrofit was completed and the facility returned to production of biofuels on June 21, 2010. At full production rate, the renovated plant was able to produce in excess of 85 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year, along with 400 million pounds of animal feed annually.

In September 2019, Attis Ethanol LLC. purchased the facility from Sunoco, which included a 10 year offtake agreement for the sale of ethanol. In March 21, 2019, the ethanol plant was shuttered and the facility was fully idled in August 2019. The facility continued to sit vacant and in October 2021, the smoke from burning corn in one of the facility&#x27;s two silos began to overtake the nearby townships. The fire was extinguished in October 2022.

==Government==

Fulton is governed by an elected mayor and common-council form of government. Administratively and politically, the city is divided into six wards. City hall is located on South First Street near Academy Street and faces a small park and military memorial which overlooks the Oswego River. Fulton supports both a small professional police force and a fire department with two fire stations. The police station and the east-side fire station are included in the city hall complex.

==Geography and weather==

==Recreation==

Fulton has a number of parks and areas of interest. Recreation Park, a city-owned facility on the banks of Lake Neatahwanta once hosted an amusement park, indoor skating/dancing rink as well as the county fair grounds. In its earlier years, the American Woolen Mills contributed greatly to the development and upkeep of Recreation Park. Today there are both football and softball fields, a waterfront area, pier, sheltered picnic tables, grills, and other outdoor leisure facilities. The Fulton War Memorial, a multipurpose group of buildings housing an exhibition hall/gymnasium and related ante-rooms as well as an adjacent covered arena used for ice skating and related sports in the winter and other events during warmer weather. The city-owned park adjoins the property owned by the Fulton City School District and occupied by G. Ray Bodley High School. The park facilities are sometimes used by the students for selected athletic and social events. On the northwest side of the park is a city-owned campground known as Bullhead Bay that hosts tents and recreational camper units throughout the late spring, summer and early fall. Included in the park and campground is a short hiking and conservation-nature trail. Concerts are held during the summer months featuring traditional and diverse styles of music and related entertainment. Also on the west side of the River and adjacent to the lower bridge (to the north) there is a park and athletic field complex known as Foster Park. On the east side of the River one finds Voorhees Park, a city block bordered by South Fourth Street, South Third Street, Buffalo Street and Academy Street. Long ago a small bandstand connected by diagonal sidewalks to opposing corners of the park was located near the center of the acreage. Such bandstands were common in small rural towns. A new bandstand was erected in the &quot;old downtown&quot; area of Fulton overlooking the Oswego River and one of two locks in the &quot;New York State Barge Canal&quot; portion of the waterway. This bandstand, known as &quot;The Gazebo&quot; plays host to a variety of musical concerts in the summer season. At &quot;Sharp&#x27;s Pond,&quot; Rowlee Beach is a small beach and swimming area near State Route #3 and Emery Street.

==Education==
Fulton was long-known as the home of the Falley Seminary, a preparatory school attended by both locals and out-of-area boarding students. This institution offered traditional classical education courses as well as some more practical coursework.

Over the years there have been a number of public schools built in neighborhoods of Fulton and surrounding towns. These include Fulton High School and its descendant institution, G. Ray Bodley High School, Fulton Junior High School, Fourth Street School (in the former Fulton High School building), Fairgreve School, James Lanigan Elementary School, Erie Street School, State Street School, Oak Street School, Phillips Street School, Pine Woods School, Walradt Street School, and Granby Elementary School. For many years there were also two Catholic schools: St. Mary&#x27;s School (also known as Fulton Catholic School) on the east side and Holy Family School on the west side of town.

A branch of Cayuga Community College (CCC) is located in the retrofitted shell of a grocery store and other former retail spaces.

==Business==
Spring 2008, a Wal-Mart Supercenter opened just outside the Fulton city limits in Granby. Construction of the store was temporarily halted in early 2007 after the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation refused access to the area to preserve nesting bald eagles during the spring mating season.

==Media==
Radio station B104.7, which is currently the top ranked radio outlet in Central New York, is licensed to Fulton. A local newspaper known as &quot;The Valley News&quot; is published in Fulton twice each week.

== November 2023 Town Board Meeting Controversy ==

On November 21, 2023, Michelle Allan Gregory, the vice president of the New York Coalition for Open Government, attended a town board meeting in New Haven, New York. During the meeting, the board moved into an executive session, prompting Gregory to ask if minutes would be taken. Her question, made out of turn, led Town Supervisor Dan Barney to ask her to leave the meeting. When Gregory refused, law enforcement was called, and she was later arrested by Deputy Caitlyn Gregory of the Oswego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The charges against her included criminal trespass, obstruction of governmental administration, and, later, disorderly conduct.

In April 2024, charges against Gregory and a companion, who was also cited for trespassing, were dismissed due to speedy trial violations. Following the dismissal, both women pursued civil legal action against the town of New Haven. The incident raised significant concerns about the interpretation and enforcement of public meeting laws and the training of law enforcement officers in constitutional rights.

The incident sparked great controversy within the community, many outraged citizens who viewed police-worn body cam footage strongly condemned the Deputy for incorrectly asserting that Gregory was required to provide physical identification, even though New York law does not mandate this unless there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The incident drew significant public outcry, with critics accusing Barney of abusing his power and targeting Gregory for personal reasons. Many called for his removal from office, describing his actions as petty and undemocratic. Online reactions also raised concerns about transparency and accountability in local government, with the New York Coalition for Open Government placing Barney on its &quot;naughty list&quot; for the second consecutive year. The incident was featured on the November 25, 2024 episode of &quot;Audit The Audit&quot;, a popular Civil Rights Podcast with over 3 million subscribers where it was announced Gregory filed a civil lawsuit against the city of New Haven.

Oswego Canal Lock 1 is located beside Culvert Street, off Main Street (County Road 57). It was built around 1911, and has a lift of 10.2 ft (3.11 m) to the south. Just north of the canal lock is a heel trunnion single-leaf bascule bridge carrying Culvert Street which raises up when the downstream gates of the lock are opened in order to provide adequate clearance for passing marine vessels. Built in 1986, it has a span of 67 ft (20 m). Another heel trunnion single-leaf bascule bridge is located along the canal lock, constructed in 1912, which was used to access the lockhouse and factories on Mill Island (now called Lock Island) from nearby Bridge Street. It was taken out of service when a driveway was routed to the site from Culvert Street. The bridge is currently locked in the raised position.

On April 20, 2002, around 6:50 am, many residents of Phoenix were shaken awake by a magnitude 5.2 earthquake centered near Plattsburgh, New York. No damage or injuries were reported in the area.

<text>Pulaski () is a village in Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 2,365 at the 2010 census. The village is within the town of Richland, and lies between the eastern shore of Lake Ontario and the Tug Hill region. The village is located on U.S. Route 11 and is adjacent to Interstate 81. Pulaski lies in the Snowbelt, which is characterized by heavy amounts of lake-effect snow. It has a regional reputation for its heavy snow accumulations and adverse traveling conditions in winter, and for the long duration of winter conditions, often from mid-November through mid-April.

Although the village takes its name after General Casimir Pulaski ( ), area residents have traditionally pronounced it with a long &quot;i&quot; ( ). The historic core of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as the Pulaski Village Historic District.

==History==
Pulaski history shows that during the early years before incorporation on April 26, 1832, the village was known by various other names. It was once called “Fishville” and sometimes it was called “Salmon River”. It was also stated that the name “Pulaski” was often spelled “Polaski”. It was also used for years with the spelling of Polaski from &quot;The Palladium Times&quot; to official state documents.
Mary Parker, the local historian, offered two possible theories regarding the selection of the town&#x27;s name in an article titled &quot;Name Selection is a Mystery.&quot; According to Parker, the most credible theory is that in 1829, three years before the town&#x27;s incorporation, the prominent lawyer and abolitionist Thomas C. Baker proposed the name at a meeting. Another story indicates that the name was chosen when Revolutionary War heroes put names in a hat and pulled the name of Casimir Pulaski. As Mary Parker says, one or both may not be true but local historians are researching how the name was picked.

In October 1816 the first court of Oswego County was held in Oswego, when a number of people presented themselves and were admitted to the bar, thus being the only business transacted. However, in February 1817 the first jury was selected for court was convened in Pulaski. It was only three years after the first court was held in Oswego County was there a court house erected in Pulaski.
A few miles to the west from the village of Pulaski at the mouth of the Salmon River a lighthouse was built. In the 1830s the government engineers determined that the mouth had sufficient depth that it could harbor thirty ships. So in August 1838 the lighthouse was inaugurated. The lamp originally ran on whale oil. The harbor was deactivated in 1858. In 1989 a Coast Guard Class II navigation aid was installed. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1979.

“In 1853 the citizens of the village became interested in the education of their children and youth. An act of legislature was passed to consolidate parts of three school districts within the village into one”. It was called the “Pulaski school district” and the school was named “Pulaski Academy”. Pulaski Academy and Central Schools currently occupy two buildings: Lura Sharp Elementary School (built in 1939 and originally housed grades K-12 until 1969) and the Pulaski Middle-Senior High School (built in 1969, originally housing grades 7-12 as Pulaski Jr.-Sr. High School, grade 6 was moved into the facility in 2007). Other elementary school buildings in the hamlets of Richland and Fernwood were closed in the late 1960s or early 1970s, with the Richland school being used as the Headquarters of the Half-Shire Historical Society since 1973.

In the early hours of October 6, 1881, in a bakery in the back of M.L. Hollis store a fire started. In just over three hours the whole business portion of Pulaski was destroyed by the fire. The reason it took so little time to burn was because of the buildings structure being built of wood and the fire stations facilities inability to hold the fire in check.

From the 1840s to the present there have been many factories located in and around the village. With the village lying on the banks of the Salmon River it was a major asset in its development. “There have been at least hundred and twenty factories” come and go. From wood mills to iron works, there have been many different factories located in Pulaski. Only a small number of industrial companies now remain, including Fulton Companies, Healthway, and Schoeller Technical Paper.

The Pulaski Village Historic District and Selkirk Lighthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demographics==

== Transportation ==
Nearby Interstate 81 allows local residents access to the nearby cities of Syracuse and Watertown. This proximity promotes the Pulaski area as a primary access point for the Lake Ontario and Tug Hill recreational tourism.
Pulaski is served by Trailways Bus Lines as well as three Oswego County Public Transit Lines.

== Commerce ==
Commerce in Pulaski revolves heavily around fishing tourism. It is located on the Salmon River, which is named for the salmon which return to the river each fall during the salmon run. The area is a major draw for sportfishing, as is Lake Ontario, the shore of which is three miles to the west of the village. The fishing season culminates in the fall with the Salmon River Festival, held each year at the site of the farmers&#x27; market.

In addition to the massive influx of visitors to the area they also bring an increase in tourism revenue for the area. In the article &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Fishy About the Salmon Industry&quot; written in 1987, the mayor at the time Dan Briggs is quoted saying &quot;Our community cash flow ranges between $3 to $5 million a year just in the village because of salmon season&quot;. Since then it is likely that that price has only gone up in relation to economic growth in the past 32 years. This has tremendous impact on all of the local businesses as they thrive on the salmon fever. Fishermen and women can find a fishing report to get a good idea the best time is to hit the steams.

Pulaski is also located on an extensive snowmobile trail system which connects to other trail systems throughout central and northern New York. This results in a growing amount of winter tourism as the trail system grows in reputation; this is helped by the reliable snowfall in the area, particularly throughout the Tug Hill region.

Summer tourism is also strong in the Pulaski area because of its proximity to Lake Ontario and its numerous seasonal activities which include white water rafting, residences, parks, and resorts where thousands of people around NY camp every year. However, the town lost some of its touristic luster with the loss of their &#x27;Ringgold Fireman&#x27;s Field Days&#x27; that occurred annually on the first weekend of August.

<text>The sarrusophones are a family of metal double reed conical bore woodwind instruments patented and first manufactured by French instrument maker in 1856. Gautrot named the sarrusophone after French bandmaster Pierre-Auguste Sarrus (1813–1876), whom he credited with the concept of the instrument, though it is not clear whether Sarrus benefited financially. The instruments were intended for military bands, to serve as replacements for oboes and bassoons which at the time lacked the carrying power required for outdoor marching music. Although originally designed as double-reed instruments, single-reed mouthpieces were later developed for use with the larger bass and contrabass sarrusophones.

==Sizes and ranges==
The sarrusophone was manufactured in the following sizes and had the following theoretical ranges:
* E-flat Sopranino B♭-G (Sounding D♭-B♭)
* B-flat Soprano B♭-G (Sounding A♭-F)
* E-flat Alto G-G (Sounding B♭-B♭)
* B-flat Tenor B♭-G (Sounding A♭-F)
* E-flat Baritone G-G (Sounding B♭-B♭)
* B-flat Bass B♭-G (Sounding A♭-F)
* EE-flat Contrabass B♭-G (Sounding D♭-B♭)
* CC Contrabass B♭-G (Sounding B♭-G)
* BB-flat Contrabass B♭-G (Sounding A♭-F)

All sarrusophones are transposing instruments notated in treble clef, except the CC contrabass which is notated in bass clef and sounds an octave lower, like the contrabassoon.
The sarrusophone has a very similar written range to saxophone; the lowest note is the same written B♭ below middle C (some have extra keys to go to a low G), and the key work usually allows a practical range to high G.

Until the turn of the 21st century, the BB♭ contrabass had the distinguishing feature of being the lowest pitched reed instrument ever placed in production, since it is capable of producing a low A♭, one semitone below A, the lowest note of both the piano and a contrabassoon with a low A key. Both the B♭ subcontrabass saxophone, first built in 2010, and the Eppelsheim B♭ tubax, a similar hybrid saxophone introduced ten years earlier, also have A♭ as their lowest pitch. Leblanc also made prototype subcontrabass clarinets in the 1930s that could go even lower—the E♭ &quot;octocontralto&quot; to E♭ and the B♭ &quot;octocontrabass&quot; to C—but neither model went into production, and the prototypes reside at the Leblanc in France.

==Construction==
All members of the sarrusophone family are made of metal, with a conical bore, and the larger members of the family resemble the ophicleide in shape. Like the oboe and bassoon, all sizes of sarrusophone were originally designed to be played with a double reed. Later, single reed mouthpieces were developed which resemble alto or soprano saxophone mouthpieces. It is unclear if these were available for all sizes of the sarrusophone family, the most common examples being for the E♭ contrabass. Approximate reed measurements (mm) for certain sarrusophones, expressed as (tip width, distance from tip to first wire, overall length), are as follows:

*Soprano (9, 20, 50)
*Alto (13, 25, 55)
*Tenor (15, 27, 60)
*Baritone (17, 32, 70)
*Bass (19, 40, 80)
*Contrabass in Eb or C (22, 44, 85)

The fingering of the sarrusophone is nearly identical to that of the saxophone. This similarity caused Adolphe Sax to file and lose at least one lawsuit against Gautrot, claiming infringement upon his patent for the saxophone. Sax lost on the grounds that the tone produced by the two families of instruments is markedly different, despite their mechanical similarities. However, because the sarrusophone never gained wide acceptance, makers were not inclined to develop its mechanism to the same extent as that of the saxophone.

Features of the sarrusophone&#x27;s mechanism generally include:
* Non-automatic octave keys (necessary to produce the &quot;standard&quot; top 4th of its range). From sopranino through bass, 2 octave keys. The contra basses (and perhaps some basses) have 3, the 3rd key being used for the notes D and E♭ directly above the octave break, only
* No articulated G, bis B♭, F trill keys or 1/1 and 1/2 B♭ as found on the saxophone. The top and bottom key stacks are not linked. Surprisingly though, a B to C trill key as found on the saxophone did more or less become standard
* The key for low B♭ is activated by the left thumb as opposed to the left little finger as on the saxophone
* A key for rapid alternation across the C-D break. This key can also be used to play high D as well. This may be taken to be an equivalent of the high D palm key of a saxophone, although on the sarrusophone the location of the touchpiece varied.
* No palm keys for playing the top range. Using the non-automatic register keys, 3rd harmonics are easily available, rendering palm keys unnecessary. The relatively narrow bore of the sarrusophone also aids in the rendering of these 3rd harmonics

On earlier instruments, the use of rollers on the low E♭ and C natural keys seems to have been more common than having them on the G, low C and B natural keys. Additionally on some (all?) instruments made by Buffet in the early 20th century, the G♯ key is &quot;semi-articulated&quot; so that a G natural to G trill can be made by an additional touchpiece for the right hand. Saxophones of this time period also have this mechanism. Additionally, there is no connection from G to low C or low B natural, which is also identical to how saxophones were constructed at that time.

==Musical style==

===Classical orchestra===

The sarrusophone is rarely called for in orchestral music. However, around the turn of the 20th century, the contrabass sarrusophones in EE♭ and CC enjoyed a vogue, the latter as a substitute for the contrabassoon (the French model patterned after the German Heckel model, having been introduced later around 1906 by Buffet et al.) so that it is called for in, for example, Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; (1889), &quot;Visions&quot; (1891) and &quot;Suite parnassienne&quot; (1912); Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Shéhérazade&quot; overture (1898), &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot; (1907) and &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (1907–09); Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s Symphony in B minor &quot;Polonia&quot; (1903–08; 3 sarrusophones are called for); Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (1913–16) and &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot; (1906–07); Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Jeux&quot; (1913), Lili Boulanger&#x27;s Psalm 129 (1916) and Psalm 130 (1917) and Arrigo Boito&#x27;s &quot;Nerone&quot; (1924). Igor Stravinsky included a part for contrabass sarrusophone in &quot;Threni&quot;. The composer Paul Dukas used the contrabass sarrusophone to great effect in 1897 in his &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;.

These parts are now normally played on the contrabassoon, although there are early 20th century recordings of at least some of these pieces where sarrusophones can be heard. In general, the term &quot;sarrusophone&quot; usually refers to the EE♭ contrabass which appears to have been made in larger numbers than any other size. Although the CC contrabass sarrusophone, with its range down to B♭ identical to the contrabassoon, was perhaps envisioned for these and other orchestral works, only relatively few instruments were ever made and were most likely to become the property of orchestras or opera companies. The EE♭ contrabass with D♭ as its lowest note lacks the lowest three notes of the contrabassoon.

The EE♭ contrabass has also been used as an alternative to the EE♭ contrabass saxophone, which due to its large size is impractical in many musical situations, especially marching bands.

The English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji used the contrabass sarrusophone in various of his orchestral works.

===Concert band===
In the concert band literature, Percy Grainger used the EE♭ contrabass in the original scoring of his piece &quot;Children&#x27;s March: Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;. In early 20th century Italian band scores, parts for the B♭ tenor, E♭ baritone, and B♭ bass sarrusophones as well as the contrabass are common. It appears that higher members of the sarrusophone family were not as popular as the lower members, with the sopranino in E♭ along with its distant cousin, the high E♭ oboe, being particularly rare. For the most part, the use of the sarrusophone was primarily in France, Italy and Spain. During or after World War I, US Military personnel noted the use of the contrabass sarrusophone in French military bands and thereafter, commissioned the U.S. firm C. G. Conn to manufacture the EE♭ contrabass for use in U.S. military bands beginning in approximately 1921, as per Conn&#x27;s advertising of the time. The instrument was offered for sale to the general public as well, but production appears to have ceased in the 1930s. Conns as late as 1936 are known to exist. Beginning in 1921, the John Philip Sousa band used the Conn sarrusophone for an unknown period of time. In 1908 when Sir Thomas Beecham wished to perform the work &quot;Apollo and the Seaman&quot; by the British composer Josef Holbrooke (who had included parts for several sizes of sarrusophones), the sarrusophone parts had to be played by performers brought over from France. Paderewski included three E♭ contrabass sarrusophones in his Symphony in B Minor (&quot;Polonia&quot;).

Frank Zappa used the E♭ contrabass sarrusophone in his scores for &quot;Think It Over&quot;, &quot;Big Swifty&quot;, &quot;Ulterior Motive&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Greggery Peccary&quot;, &quot;For Calvin&quot;, &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;, and many others. These pieces can be found on his albums &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;, &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot;, &amp; &quot;Zappa/Wazoo&quot;. The sarrusophone was played by Earl Dumler. In 2013, Franklin Stover composed a Concerto Breve for E♭ contrabass sarrusophone and winds.

===Jazz===
A very unusual example of the sarrusophone in jazz is on the 1924 recording by the Clarence Williams Blue 5 of &quot;Mandy, Make Up Your Mind,&quot; with the sarrusophone played by the jazz soprano saxophone and clarinet virtuoso Sidney Bechet. One can conjecture that the sarrusophone played was most likely a contrabass with a single reed mouthpiece, as Bechet was not a trained double reed player. Bechet later denied having ever played the sarrusophone. According to the biography by Chilton, Sidney &quot;pulled a face&quot; when asked about the solo on &quot;Mandy&quot;, though he did not deny playing it.

A soprano sarrusophone is seen and heard in the song &quot;Humpty-Dumpty Heart&quot; played by Kay Kyser&#x27;s band in the 1941 film &quot;Playmates&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s the American jazz musician Gerald Oshita (based in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area and associated with Roscoe Mitchell) played avant-garde jazz on an EE♭ contrabass manufactured by Conn. More recently (1990–2006), recordings using sarrusophone have been released by saxophonists Scott Robinson, Lenny Pickett, James Carter, and Paul Winter.

===Rock and Roll===
In rock music, They Might Be Giants used sarrusophone in their song &quot;Older&quot;, on their album Mink Car.

==Present status==

Today, the sarrusophone is used in a handful of symphonic wind ensembles and as a novelty instrument on occasions. There appears to be a resurgence of interest in the instrument and there are amateur players (mostly of the EE♭ contrabass). Bruce Broughton made extensive use of a contrabass sarrusophone in his score for the film &quot;Tombstone&quot;.

The tone of the sarrusophone is less clear but much reedier than that of the saxophone. In humorous terms, the sarrusophone can be said to sound rather &quot;industrial&quot; or perhaps &quot;unrefined.&quot; Historically, the Orsi Instrument Company, Rampone (later Rampone &amp; Cazzani), Buffet (under the ownership of Evette &amp; Schaeffer), Conn (E♭ contrabass only), Gautrot and Couesnon (Gautrot&#x27;s successor) were the best known and possibly, only makers that produced in quantity.

The somewhat harsh tone quality of the sarrusophone and the need for a double reed may have contributed to it not becoming a standard member of the wind band. Additionally, although originally intended to replace the oboe and the bassoon, the practical ranges of the corresponding sarrusophones, the soprano and bass, as per famed band conductor Edwin Franko Goldman and organologist Anthony Baines, did not lend themselves to proper playing of oboe and bassoon parts, especially in orchestra transcriptions for wind band.

The need for a contrabass pitched woodwind has existed since at least the 19th century. During the 19th century and into the 20th there were sporadic attempts by Sax, Buffet, Besson and others to build a successful contrabass clarinet in either E♭ or B♭. In the early 1930s, upon the suggestion of the American Bandmaster&#x27;s Association, the French firm Selmer succeeded when they introduced their E♭ contrabass model (the popular E♭ and B♭ contrabass models by the French firm LeBlanc not being placed into production until the late 1940s, although invented earlier). It can be conjectured that the compactness and musical qualities of these instruments may have contributed to the non-use of the sarrusophone, as they are now very common in musical circles ranging from junior high school through professional.

==Rothphone==
The rothphone, also known as the rothophone or saxarrusophone, is a sarrusophone hybrid that is rewrapped into the shape of a saxophone. It was introduced in Italy around 1900 and intended to replace the oboes and bassoons in military bands, but found little acceptance, and remained unknown outside Italy. They were built in sizes from soprano to bass, with narrower, less tapered conical bores than either saxophones or sarrusophones.

As per advertising of the time, the well-known American saxophone manufacturer, Buescher imported a number of these instruments into the United States during the late 1920s or early 1930s, perhaps as an answer to C.G. Conn&#x27;s production of the contrabass sarrusophone. Per advertisements for this instrument and photos that have appeared in books, the lowest note on the Rothphone is a low B natural, not low B♭ as with the saxophone and sarrusophone. In the 1930s the band at the University of Illinois under Austin Harding had a full sarrusophone section from soprano to E♭ contrabass that included at least the tenor rothphone. However, this appears to have been an isolated use of the instrument.

After the Revolutionary War, Williamstown did not exist until plans were made to settle west of the Hudson River. In 1791 Nicholas and John Roosevelt purchased 525,000 that covered most of Oswego, Oneida, and a small chunk of Herkimer counties known as the Roosevelt purchase. In 1794 it was then purchased by George Scriba, which then became the Scriba Patent. Scriba then broke up most of the land that he purchased into townships and given what is now Williamstown the name Franklin, Township No.5. Ichabod Comstock was the first to settle in Franklin in 1801. Judge Henry Williams relocated to Franklin from Camden, New York in 1802 and shortly after Williams came to Franklin the people renamed the town Williamstown in Williams’s honor. Williamstown became an official town after separating from Mexico, part of Oneida County at the time on March 24, 1804. Oswego County wasn’t formed until 1816.

== Communities and locations in Williamstown ==
*Checkered House – A location in the western part of the town on Route 13.
*Happy Valley – A hamlet on the western town line, which was founded in the 1860s. Happy Valley was cleared out in the 1930s after the government decided it would be better used as a nature reserve.
*Kasoag – A hamlet in the center of the town. Kasoag was originally an old Oneida Indian trail from Oneida Castle to the Salmon River, and many relics of the Oneida are still found in Kasoag to this day. In 1810 the first settlement of Kasoag was built by William Hamilton and the original dam he built for his saw mill still stands to this very day.
*Maple Hill – A hamlet north of Williamstown village, Maple Hill came to be in 1860. It was created by Calvert Comstock, a prominent business man from Rome who owned a number of timber and saw mills. Between 1862 and 1863 a store, a school, and a post office were constructed on Maple Hill. From 1862 to 1970 Comstock had more track for the Williamstown &amp; Redfield Railroad placed in, those tracks were known in that area as the “Maple Hill Railroad.” Comstock did this to support his timber contract with Rome to the Central. Eventually all the valuable timber was used up and Maple Hill was abandoned except a few farmers in the year 1876.
*Ricard – A hamlet in the northern part of the town.
*Williamstown – The hamlet of Williamstown is in the southeastern section of the town on Route 13.
*Case Wall – The Case Wall, two miles north of the Town of Williamstown, was built by Jonathan Case Jr. from 1838-1880. Case Wall is a famous and historical sight. Case originally built the wall to keep travelers and passerby out of his award-winning apple orchards. Most of the stones for the Case Wall were either pulled from the roads of that day or plowed out of fields. Some of the amazing feats for this time are that the wall has no mortar or cement to hold it together; all the rocks were hand-picked and leveled off with only a chisel and a maul. Some of the stones on the Case Wall weigh as much as 300 pounds and in some places it is seven feet tall by five feet wide and in some areas it was wide enough to ride a horse and buggy on. Case Wall is also two miles long. Officials in Williamstown are working on getting the Case Wall on a national registry which would make it illegal for people to steal the flat stones of the wall which is common at this sight.
==Notable people==

* George F. Comstock (1811–1892), judge, federal official

Butternut Creek and Wharton Creek are important waterways in the town.

==History==


Early settlers came from New England. Township named after Burlington, New Jersey by William Cooper and Andrew Craig, early land patent owners. At an early time the Butternut Creek was dubbed &quot;Burlington Creek&quot; as well but the name did not stick.

Burlington was formed from the Town of Otsego, April 10, 1792. It retained its original dimensions until 1797, when Pittsfield (and what would come to be New Lisbon) was set off. It was further diminished in area by the creation of Edmeston, in 1808.

The 1878 history describes the community of Burlington Green as having two churches, an inn that was a stage coach stop on the Cayuga Turnpike, a doctor, a general store, lawyer office, hotel, gristmill, creamery, cheese factory, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, a cooper and shoe shop and photography studio, but &quot;This village at one time was a place of much more mercantile and manufacturing interest than at present, having a comb-factory, a hattery, two tanneries, an iron-foundry, a furniture-factory, three stores, two hotels, a cloth-dressing and wool carding-factory, and a card factory.&quot; The heavily textile based economy of the Butternut Valley was an influence in the number of sheep and immigrants that arrived from Scotland and established the United Presbyterian Church at Burlington Green June 8, 1835.

==Notable people==
*Benjamin F. Angel, (1815–1894), born in Burlington, former ambassador of the United States

CT natives to pioneer in this town, Revolutionary War soldier, millwright, surveyor, essayist, first town supervisor and member NY State assembly, he promoted the establishment of public schools, and the abolishment of debtors&#x27; prison in NY state. Arguing in favor of rule by commoners rather than elitists he wrote: &quot;The people can never mean to do anything that will not advance the public good, and it is only under momentary delusion that they can act wrong.&quot; Antagonist of Federalist everywhere he gathered petition signatures against the Alien and Sedition Acts, which led to his arrest by Judge Cooper and transport in open wagon in the fall of 1799, to New York City for trial. It is claimed sympathy at the sight of him convinced the weight of the New York electoral votes to be cast in favor of Thomas Jefferson. Today there are several state historical markers for Peck, one at his grave on route 80 east of Burlington Green, and two on route 20 in Richfield, commemorating his work as a millwright.

<text>Butternuts is a town located in Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,786. The Town of Butternuts is located in the southwestern part of the county, and is west of Oneonta.

==History==

Butternuts is generally believed to be named for three butternut (a.k.a. white walnut) trees growing from one stump that originally marked the corner of the townships of what is now New Lisbon, Pittsfield and Morris when this entire section of the county was surveyed by Richard Smith before the Revolution. Said tree was depicted as the corporate logo of the Butternuts Woolen &amp; Cotton textile firm but was cut down by the Lull family to build their log cabin.

In 1787, Abijah Gilbert and Jacob Morris, early owners of land in the county, were among the first who settled the town, Morris giving Gilbert land of his choice as payment for his services. Ample waterpower sites allowed for many industries in addition to agriculture that benefitted by the wide fertile valley floor along the Butternut and Unadilla.

The town was established from part of the Town of Unadilla in 1796. The north part of Butternuts was annexed to form the Town of Morris in 1849, and additional territory was taken from the Town of Unadilla in 1857.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and 0.02% is water.

Butternuts Creek is an important stream flowing through the town. It was named by early settlers, who noted some unusual butternut trees growing near it.

New York State Route 51 is a north-south highway in Butternuts, and was one of the first concrete-paved highways in Upstate New York, starting from Mt. Upton northwards &quot;circa&quot; 1919.

The Butternut Creek flows diagonally through the town, from Morris to the creek&#x27;s confluence with the Unadilla River in the southwestern corner of the town.

<text>Cooperstown is a village in and the county seat of Otsego County, New York, United States. Most of the village lies within the town of Otsego, but some of the eastern part is in the town of Middlefield. Located at the foot of Otsego Lake in the Central New York Region, Cooperstown is approximately west of Albany, southeast of Syracuse and northwest of New York City. The population of the village was 1,794 as of the 2020 census.

Cooperstown is the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The Farmers&#x27; Museum in the village opened in 1944 on farmland that had once belonged to James Fenimore Cooper. The Fenimore Art Museum and Glimmerglass Opera are also based here. Most of the historic pre-1900s core of the village is included in the Cooperstown Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980; its boundaries were increased in 1997 and more contributing properties were identified.

== History ==
===Native American use===

Before European colonization, Iroquois Indians inhabited the area around the village and Otsego Lake. The name &quot;Otsego&quot; is from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning &quot;place of the rock&quot;, referring to the large boulder near the lake&#x27;s outlet, today known as &quot;Council Rock&quot;. It is a large boulder whose top is above the water&#x27;s surface and can be seen from shore. It is believed to have been a meeting place for Native Americans prior to the American Revolutionary War. A small parcel of land near Council Rock was presented to the Village of Cooperstown in 1957, on the condition that it remain open to the public as a park.

===Settlement===
The village was developed within part of the Cooper Patent, which William Cooper – who later became a county judge – purchased in 1785 from Colonel George Croghan, former Deputy to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Northern District. The land amounted to . William Cooper founded a village on Otsego Lake. His son, James Fenimore Cooper, grew up in the frontier town. He later became a noted American author with &quot;The Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, a series of novels that includes &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;.

Cooper established the village of Cooperstown in 1786, laid out by surveyor William Ellison. At the time, the area was part of Montgomery County. It was incorporated as the &quot;Village of Otsego&quot; on April 3, 1807. The name was changed to &quot;Village of Cooperstown&quot; June 12, 1812, after the founder. William Cooper was appointed as a county judge in the late 18th century and was elected to the state assembly from Otsego County.

Cooperstown is one of only twelve villages in New York still incorporated under a charter, the other villages having incorporated or re-incorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

=== Cooperstown today ===
Cooperstown is best known as the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, which was founded in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark. According to an interview conducted in 1906 by the Mills Commission, nearby resident Abner Graves attributed the game&#x27;s invention to his deceased friend, Abner Doubleday. Graves stated that Doubleday invented baseball on a cow pasture within the village in 1839, the present site of Doubleday Field, but this claim is universally discounted by baseball historians.

Once known as the &quot;Village of Museums&quot;, until the 1970s Cooperstown also boasted the Indian Museum (adjacent to Lakefront Park), The Carriage and Harness Museum (displaying a world-class collection primarily from F. Ambrose Clark&#x27;s estate; now the Bassett Hospital offices on Elk Street), and The Woodland Museum near Three Mile Point. The latter, opened in 1962 by heirs to the Anheuser-Busch company, folded in 1974. It ran a close third in annual attendance to the Hall of Fame and Farmers&#x27; Museum.

The Cooperstown Historic District, Glimmerglass Historic District, Middlefield District No. 1 School, Fly Creek Historic District, Otsego County Courthouse, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Business district ===

Superficially, the downtown commercial district looks not unlike it did in the 1970s. It has undergone significant change since the late 20th century.

Through the 1970s, Main Street was still home to at least five grocery stores, including an A&amp;P. Western Auto had a branch on Main Street and J.J. Newberry&#x27;s had built, in 1960, a two-story five-and-dime with a fountain and lunch counter. Smalley&#x27;s, a stage theater converted into a movie theater, had a single screen across from a Farm &amp; Home store. With its post office, library, and the Baseball Hall of Fame, Main Street resembled a true village square.

Today, the village has fewer traditional services for year-round and seasonal residents. Once boasting half a dozen gas stations, the village now has two. Traditional grocers have been reduced to one, and in 1977 Great American was built on the outskirts of town, replacing the town&#x27;s bowling alley. Most Main Street shops now cater to the tourist trade and feature gifts and souvenirs.

The Cooperstown Chamber of Commerce, established in 1917, looks to develop business and trade in the Cooperstown region. Serving also as a visitor center in its main office, the Chamber also manages a seasonal kiosk on the corner of Main and Pioneer St for tourists.

Cooperstown was formerly served by the Cooperstown Municipal Airport, which was a two-runway facility fewer than two miles to the northwest of town center. That field closed in the 1960s. The village is now served by a small grass field in nearby Westville and a larger paved one-runway facility in Oneonta.

==Sister city==
The sister city of Cooperstown is Windsor, Nova Scotia. This is due to Windsor&#x27;s claiming to be the birthplace of ice hockey and Cooperstown at one time being considered to be the birthplace of baseball.

== Geography and climate ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (2.53%) is water.

The source of the Susquehanna River is in Cooperstown at the outlet of Otsego Lake. Blackbird Bay of Otsego Lake is north of the village.

The junction of New York State Route 28 and New York State Route 80 was constructed at Cooperstown. The village is also served by County Routes 31 and 33.

==Climate==

Cooperstown has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with cold, very snowy winters, warm summers, and abundant precipitation year-round. Freezing temperatures have been observed in every month of the year, except for July. The record low temperature is , set on February 9, 1934, and the record high temperature is , set on July 9–10, 1936.

About 5.0% of families and 10.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.5% of those under age 18 and 5.4% of those age 65 or over.

== Arts and culture ==

=== Annual cultural events ===
The Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony is a yearly ceremony where inductees are officially added to the Hall of Fame. In 2020, the ceremony was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The internationally noted Glimmerglass Festival is closely associated with Cooperstown. Founded in 1975, the company originally performed in the Cooperstown Junior/Senior High School auditorium. In 1987, the company relocated to farmland donated by Tom Goodyear of the Cary Mede Estate north of the village, where the Alice Busch Opera Theater was built, the first new opera-specific hall in the United States built since 1966. It has a popular summer season with a reputation for producing high quality opera and commissioning new works.

=== Tourism ===
The Baseball Hall of Fame is the main site of the village, and has been attracting baseball fans since 1939. According to the Hall of Fame, 260,000 tourists visit the museum each year, with over 17 million total visits.

Other attractions include the Farmers&#x27; Museum, the Fenimore Art Museum and its library, and the Clark Sports Center, a large fitness facility, where the annual Hall of Fame Induction is held. Also close by to the village is the Fly Creek Cider Mill and Orchard located in the hamlet of Fly Creek, and the Brewery Ommegang located south of Cooperstown.

== Sports ==
The Clark Sports Center is an recreational center with of outdoor fields established in 1986. The Hall of Fame induction is held annually at the center. The facility was renovated and expanded in 2013.

Cooperstown retains a close connection with the baseball world, and &quot;Cooperstown&quot; has become synonymous with the Hall of Fame. Several nationally recognized tournaments are held in the area. Cooperstown Dreams Park in nearby Hartwick Seminary hosts 104 level U12 teams for weekly tournaments in the summer. Several professionals, including David Price and Matt Garza, have attended CDP. In 2010, Cooperstown got an official baseball team of its own, the Cooperstown Hawkeyes, a Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League team who play against many other teams from the northeast during the summer, with home games played at historic Doubleday Field. In 2014 the team was voluntarily suspended from the league.

=== Cooperstown writers ===
Aside from James Fenimore Cooper, noted Cooperstown authors include his daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper, the author of &quot;Rural Hours&quot;, and his great-great-grandson Paul Fenimore Cooper, author of &quot;&quot; (1929, 1957, 2001).

Other writers include modern author Lauren Groff, who has written extensively about her hometown, notably in &quot;The Monsters of Templeton&quot;, a story that brings several Cooperstown legends to life.

The work of Cooperstown-based novelist and poet Marly Youmans has referred to the area, notably in her epic poem &quot;Thaliad&quot; (2012), in which a group of child survivors of an apocalypse travel north and make their new home in an abandoned village on the shore of Glimmerglass Lake.&#x27;

=== The Clark family ===
The Clark family, whose fortune originated with a half-ownership of the patent for Singer Sewing Machine, have lived in Cooperstown since the mid-19th century. The family&#x27;s holdings include interests assembled over a century and a half, which are now held through trusts and foundations. Their dominance is reflected in Clark ownership of more than of largely undeveloped land in and around greater Cooperstown.

In the village, the Otesaga, the Cooper Inn, Clark Estates, and the Clara Welch Thanksgiving Home are all Clark properties. In addition, the Clarks were founding partners of, and retain an interest in, the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital.

Cooperstown still receives support from the Clark Foundation, which has donated to a variety of causes including various scholarships, non-profit organizations, and village services. The family has also donated land for the Cooperstown Central School District&#x27;s new high school location − formerly horse stables − as well as for parks such as Fairy Springs and Council Rock, and recently, for a new Little League baseball field.

Jane Forbes Clark, the primary family heir today, has continued this commitment. She has purchased strategic land to ensure the preservation of village entry points, as well as overseeing the expansion of the various Clark holdings.

In late November 2013, Clark discussed her family&#x27;s continued support for the community during a meeting of The Women&#x27;s Club of Cooperstown. The Clark Foundation supports a variety of Cooperstown and Otsego County organizations and causes with donations of $7.5 million to charitable organizations every year. The family&#x27;s Scriven Foundation, formed in 1975, donates to only Otsego County nonprofit organizations, such as the Cooperstown Village Library. The Scriven Foundation donates $1.5 million every year. According to Clark&#x27;s presentation, the family&#x27;s businesses employ 4,198 people, with 3,100 of those positions being full-time jobs.

== Schools ==

The Cooperstown Central School District has two buildings located in the town. The Elementary School is located at 21 Walnut Street. It was built in the 1950s and was designed with a bomb shelter in the basement. The Cooperstown Junior/Senior High School was built in 1970 at 39 Linden Avenue, on land donated by the Clark family. The school district offices are located in the high school building.

== Architecture ==
There are, and were, significant residential, commercial, and religious structures in Cooperstown. Original residences related to the founding Cooper family, such as Edgewater and Heathcote, are still standing. Otsego Hall, James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s residence which once stood in what is now Cooper Park, has been lost, along with his chalet. Byberry, the cottage built for his daughter, remains on River Street, albeit in altered form.

&quot;Fynmere&quot;, a grand stone manor from the early 20th century, erected by Cooper heirs on the eastern edge of town, was designed by noted architect Charles A. Platt. Later donated to the Presbyterian Church as a retirement home, the property was razed in 1979. Both its grounds and those of neighboring property Heathcote (extant today), built for Katherine Guy Cooper (1895–1988), daughter-in-law of James Fenimore Cooper III, were laid out by noted landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman.

Residences, business, and properties related to the Clark family abound within the village. From the original family seat of &quot;Fernleigh&quot; to the 1928 Georgian manor of &quot;West Hill&quot;, the properties are exceptionally well cared for. Fernleigh is a Second Empire stone mansion designed by New Jersey architect James Van Dyke and built in 1869. The original garden at Fernleigh, located to the south of the mansion, included a servants&#x27; house and Turkish bath; both details have since been lost. In 1923, Stephen C. Clark, Sr. commissioned Marcus T. Reynolds and Bryant Fleming, a landscape design professor at Cornell University, to design new gardens for Fernleigh.

The manor home of Robert Sterling Clark, Red Creek Farm, remains on the outskirts of the Village. His brother F. Ambrose Clark&#x27;s &quot;Iroquois Farm&quot; manor house was razed in the early 1980s. Also razed in 1979 was the Mohican Farms manor house, owned by the Clark Estates, in Springfield Center, New York. It was formerly the summer home of the Spaulding sporting good family from Buffalo.

Edward Severin Clark built a farm complex at Fenimore Farm in 1918, which has been adapted as the Farmers Museum. His stone manor, built in 1931, was bequeathed to the New York State Historical Association and today serves as the Fenimore Art Museum.

Other structures, such as the Baseball Hall of Fame, The Otesaga Hotel, Clark Estate Office, Kingfisher Tower, which lies on the east side of Otsego Lake, Bassett Hospital, and The Clara Welch Thanksgiving Home, exemplify Cooperstown&#x27;s architectural wealth.

The Bowers family &quot;Lakelands&quot; manor, neighboring &quot;Mohican Lodge&quot;, and their former estate of &quot;Willowbrook&quot; (1818; presently the Cooper Inn) serve as further examples of grand homes erected by affluent residents. The Bowers family received the land patent extending from current-day Bowerstown to very near Cherry Valley, New York, upon which Congressman John Myer Bowers built Lakelands in 1804. Woodside Hall, on the eastern edge of the village proper, was built c. 1829 by Eben B. Morehouse and was subsequently owned by several prominent individuals, including, in 1895, financier Walter C. Stokes of New York City. Prior to the Stokes&#x27; ownership, the home was visited by Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States.

The village offices and Cooperstown Art Association are housed in a neo-classical building designed by Ernest Flagg. He is famed for Manhattan&#x27;s 47-story Singer Building and the Boldt Castle on the St. Lawrence River. The Cooperstown building was originally commissioned by Elizabeth Scriven Clark in 1898 as a YMCA. Her son Robert Sterling Clark gave it to the village in 1932 during the Great Depression.

Several prominent buildings in town were designed or updated by noted architect Frank P. Whiting, who originally worked under Ernest Flagg. A resident of New York City and Cooperstown, Whiting was also a noted artist. He designed the Farmers Museum farm buildings and the shingle-style manor at &quot;Leatherstocking Falls Farm&quot;, the residence of Dorothy Stokes Bostwick Smith Campbell, the landscaping for which was done by the all-female firm of Wodell &amp; Cottrell in the 1930s. Whiting also designed 56 Lake Street. In 1932 Whiting designed and built his residence, &quot;Westerly&quot;, on a half-acre lot at the north end of Nelson Avenue. The home is in the Colonial style and today retains many interior and exterior features of the original home. In June 1923 Whiting wrote a featured monograph &quot;Cooperstown in The Times of Our Forefathers&quot; for volume IX of the White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs containing several sketches and measured drawings of homes in Cooperstown.

In 1916, financier William T. Hyde acquired &quot;Glimmerglen&quot;, a lakeside property north of Fenimore Farm, from the Constable family. The house burned to the ground shortly thereafter and was rebuilt by society architect Alfred Hopkins, who also designed a new farm complex, gate house, and assorted dependencies. The estate was featured in a multipage advertisement in &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine in late 1922 when the property was put up for sale. The manor and greenhouses were razed in the late 1960s after their acquisition by the Clark family. The stone gatehouse, featured in the &quot;Architectural Record&quot; is extant today and owned by the Clark Foundation, as is the boathouse and the distinctive cottage known as &quot;Winter House&quot;.

<text>Edmeston is a town located in Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 1,826.

The Town of Edmeston is at the western county line. Edmeston is also the name of the largest hamlet in the town. The town is south of Utica.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 0.11% water. The major water features are:
* The Unadilla River, which forms the entire western border of the town,
* Wharton Creek, which meanders to the south and west through the southeastern corner of the town,
* Mill Creek, which flows from north to south from the northern border of Edmeston to the Wharton Creek at the Edmeston hamlet.
* Summit Lake in the northeastern corner of the town.

The elevation of the town varies by approximately : from just under above sea level at the Unadilla River in the southwestern corner of the town, to just over at peaks near Taylor Hill and Summit Lake in the northeastern corner.

New York State Route 80 passes through the southeastern part of the town.

== History ==
The town of Edmeston, in Otsego County, extends to the west as far as the Unadilla River, a line that was established by the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix between the British and the Iroquois, negotiated by Sir William Johnson. The town&#x27;s name came from the brothers, Robert and William Edmeston, who had been granted of land in what is now the northwest corner of the town. The hamlets of West Edmeston and South Edmeston are situated in the Unadilla Valley, while the hamlet of Edmeston lies in the Wharton Valley. Earlier settlers came from New England; for most of the settlers, it was planned as a stopover on their way west. A strong Baptist influence came with the settlers. Universalists, Methodists and Roman Catholics soon arrived.

The town was established from the Town of Burlington in 1808.

Dairy farming has historically been the main business of the area. Cheese factories, creameries, livery stables, blacksmith shops, and tanneries were created to support the dairy industry. One room schoolhouses were scattered throughout the town. By damming the creeks, power was created for foundries and mills. Hop growing and maple syrup production were seasonal occupations. Each of the town&#x27;s communities developed business districts and became self-sufficient. 

The last spike of the Edmeston branch of the New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railroad from New Berlin was driven at Edmeston in January 1889, but a rumored extension to Richfield Springs was never built. Then cars, buses and trucks arrived on the scene. The branch line was sold to the Unadilla Valley Railway in 1941 which operated it until abandonment in 1960.

Dams were washed out and electricity became available. The hamlets evolved into bedroom communities. The one room schoolhouses closed and the Central School was developed in the hamlet of Edmeston.

Today residents go in all four directions for employment. NYCM Insurance not only provides positions for many of the locals but also for hundreds that commute into the community each day. On the eastern side of the town is the Pathfinder Village (home for Down syndrome residents) that provides more employment.

The population of the town has not increased much through the years. It still remains largely rural. Organizations like the local Rotary Club, American Legion and Fire and Emergency Squads have active volunteers that provide community needs in lieu of governments in the hamlets. Edmeston Central School is the center of activities.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The village was the first settlement in the town, named after landowner Abijah Gilbert of Nuneaton, England, father of the United States Senator from Florida, also named Abijah Gilbert.

=== Disputes about damming Butternut Creek ===
According to the article &quot;Goliath Met David on the Banks of the Butternut Creek,&quot; by Leigh C. Eckmair, for much of the 20th century, the Village of Gilbertsville lived under threat of destruction by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ flood control project. A dam of the Upper Susquehanna Rivershed Project was to be built on the lower Butternut Creek at a spot called Cope&#x27;s Corners. This dam was to flood the valley behind it, including the village of Gilbertsville, to create a three-mile long lake. Residents had been watching in horror over the years as communities in the nearby Catskills had become victims of similar projects and had vowed not to let it happen to their small village.

The dam project, originally proposed prior to World War I, met with very strong local opposition every time it was reintroduced. Delayed due to World War I and the Great Depression, the project was reintroduced in 1935 following a flood which did millions of dollars of damage to communities in eight southern tier counties in upstate New York. Funding was appropriated, but the project was delayed because of World War II.

In the early 1950s, the Village of Gilbertsville was again endangered when the U.S. Congress reauthorized funding for the project. A locally-organized protest began to call attention to the negative aspects of the project on a state and federal level. The protest was very active from the 1950s through the 1970s.

During this time, several important studies of Gilbertsville and Butternut Valley architecture were compiled. These studies called attention to the fact that a number of well known architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had been responsible for the design, building and renovation of many attractive village structures. As a result, a number of architectural scholars became involved in protesting the dam project which would destroy this legacy. From that effort came the suggestion that several structures in the center of the village be nominated to the new Department of the Interior&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places. It was hoped that National Register recognition would afford some protection for the village, on the state and federal level, from the proposed dams.

The Committee for the Historic Preservation of Gilbertsville was formed to work with the N.Y. State Office of Parks and Recreation and to prepare nominations, documentation and photographs. Consultants came to inspect the nominated properties and saw that other structures and sites in the village were equally worthy of nomination. The suggestion was made that the entire village be inventoried as a complete Historic District and that the recognition of the entire village as an Historic District would be even more powerful protection from the dams.

The committee called on the community for help with the expanded project and was not disappointed. Over seven years the full committee of 19 volunteer researchers, typists, &#x27;gofers&#x27;,&quot; and photographers prepared a total of 194 individual structural inventory reports plus reports for each cemetery, park, bridge and five additional structures just outside the village incorporation.

The committee wrote a sixteen-page pamphlet describing the importance of the Historic District, its setting and architecture, including photographs, and presented it to the congressional committee considering funding of the project.

The same committee analyzed a century&#x27;s worth of weather history in the Upper Susquehanna Rivershed, documenting flooding on the lower Susquehanna River. The study found that no significant flooding occurred in the areas drained by the Butternut Creek and the Unadilla River during times of damaging floods on the lower Susquehanna River.

The combination of all these efforts was rewarded when deauthorization of funding for the complete Upper Susquehanna River Shed Project was proposed to Congress in 1979, and the threat of the construction of the dams was removed.

The National Register of Historic Places recognition of the entire village of Gilbertsville as a Historic District was awarded in May 1983.

In September 2003, a weathervane of a standing aboriginal American, Uncas, from 1902 created by J.L. Mott Company of New York City, which stood atop the Butternut Valley Grange was sold for $205,000 to Raymond and Susan Egan of Princeton, New Jersey. While replaced with a copy, the sale resulted in significant disputes on its ownership and who had the authority to sell the valuable weathervane.

== Architecture ==
Some of the more noteworthy pieces of architecture that can be found in Gilbertsville include the following:
* Gilbertsville Historic District – a national historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and increased to approximately the incorporated village borders in 1982.
* Overlook Park – This 100-year-old park sits next to a stone arch bridge surrounded by stone buildings.
* Gilbertsville Academy &amp; Collegiate Institute – Built in Greek Revival style in 1839, served as a school until 1935.

* Gilbert Block – This Neo-Tudor Style structure built 1893 – 1895, hosts shops and artists&#x27; studios. It was designed by Boston architect Henry Forbes Bigelow
* The Gilbertsville Free Library – Built in 1818 as a school/academy, it was converted to a library by St. Louis architects Eames and Young in 1888. It was the first Free Association Library in Otsego County.
* The Major&#x27;s Inn – Started in 1896 and finished in 1917 on the site of the original Gilbert homstead which burned in 1895. The medieval English Tudor and Gothic building was commissioned by Major James L. Gilbert employing Augustus Nicholas Allen to construct it. Today it serves as a cultural center.
* Gilbertsville Water Works – listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

<text>Hartwick is a town located in Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 2,110. The Town of Hartwick is located in the middle of the county, southwest of the Village of Cooperstown.

==History==
The town was named for Lutheran minister John Christopher Hartwick (1714–1796), an early landowner of the town. He bought the area (the Hartwick Patent, granted 1761) that now constitutes the township from the Mohawk Indians in 1763. Discontented with the sparsely settled communities of Palatine Germans in the Mohawk Valley to the north, which Hartwick believed made people immoral, he bought the original Hartwick Patent with the intent to build a &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;. Hartwick tried to control development, stipulating that residents look to him as their religious superior. By the 1790s the shrewd land speculator William Cooper had sold most of Hartwick&#x27;s land against his wishes.

Hartwick requested in his will that a Lutheran seminary be opened with his estate. Upon Hartwick&#x27;s death in 1797, efforts to do this started but were complicated by the fact that Hartwick left his estate to Jesus Christ. The Lutheran seminary established at Hartwick in 1797 was incorporated in 1816. It moved to Oneonta after 1931 and in 1947 merged with the Hartwick College, established in 1927. The town was established in 1802 from the Town of Otsego. In 1803, the north town line was altered.

The largest commercial enterprise to occur in Hartwick was probably the Southern New York Railroad which was constructed to the town in 1901. It was supported by extensive shops, a car barn and yards on the southeast side of the village. Many of the hamlets and crossings still show architectural signs related to the trolley line nearly a century after the last passenger service. 

The Hartwick Historic District, Mathewson–Bice Farmhouse and Mathewson Family Cemetery, Old Hartwick Village Cemetery, and The White House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>New Lisbon is a town in Otsego County, New York, United States. The population was 1,114 at the 2010 census.

The Town of New Lisbon is in the west-central part of the county. It is north of the City of Oneonta.

== History ==

The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1773, but most pioneers did not enter the area until after the Revolutionary War. It is mentioned that a cultivated apple orchard was found by early settlers on the west side of the Butternut Creek near Noblesville, presumably planted by Native Americans.

The town was formed from part of Pittsfield in 1806, but was then called &quot;Lisbon.&quot; The name was changed to &quot;New Lisbon&quot; in 1808. Spafford&#x27;s 1810 &quot;Gazetteer&quot; says &quot;There are in all four or five grain-mills, seven saw-mills, a fulling-mill, and carding machine. There is one baptist meeting house and seven schoolhouses. The inhabitants are principally farmers, and their household manufactures supply the most of their common clothing. In 1810 the whole population was 1982.&quot; In 1878, the town is listed as having 26,899 acres, 21,619 of it improved, 5822 woodland, and 200 &quot;other&quot;. Valuation $586,250 and equalized $459,973.

In 1878, Garrattsville contained two churches, three general stores, a hardware stores, saw and gristmill, hotel, wagon shop, and five blacksmiths. For a few years there was an annual fair held on the flat along the Butternut Creek at the south end of the hamlet before merging with the group holding one at Morris about 1886.

Noblesville in 1878 had one church, store, hotel, mill and blacksmith.

New Lisbon Centre listed as only having a church.

Stetsonville previously had a doctor, store, brickyard and wagon shop.

*One of the notable industries was the Victor J. Warren hammer factory on the Butternut at Coles Rd., Garrattsville, of which it is said it once employed a hundred persons and every house in the hamlet was occupied by two families. Supplies were drawn in by oxcart from the Erie Canal to the north, and finished goods shipped out the same way. An employee named Anthony Slater was credited with a process for tempering cast steel, which was later sold by creditors along with all contents and machinery to the Maydole Hammer Co. of Norwich, New York. At least two Warren hammers exist, one of which is on display at the town hall.
*Martin and Robert L. George built stationary steam engines at Noblesville/New Lisbon hamlet in the 1890s, only one of which is known to survive.
*Artemas Holdredge, cheese manufacturer in Garrattsville, invented the concept of putting cheese in rectangular instead of round &quot;wheel&quot; boxes for easier shipping and shelf storage.
*Emmons L. Peck of Carbondale, PA, built a wooden tramway around Gilbert Lake 1906–1909, moving nine million feet of logs using a homebuilt geared steam locomotive later reputed to have been dragged out on the lake ice and sunk by employees when the land was purchased for the state present park about 1927. (Lending evidence to the tale is the fact Peck abandoned a similar engine when through with operations on his next logging job on South Hill, Maryland, New York about 1912, later hauled out during war scrap metal drives).
*The Persian Lamb Co. was an unsuccessful cooperative venture during World War I utilizing about a thousand acres of abandoned grazing land in the Welcome area to raise sheep imported for their skins, after the sheep died from pneumonia they switched to raising vegetables and beef but the stock shares ultimately became worthless.

<text>Pittsfield is a town in Otsego County, New York, United States. The population was 1,366 at the 2010 census.

The Town of Pittsfield is on the western border of the county, northwest of the City of Oneonta.

== History ==
The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1793.

The Town of Pittsfield was formed from part of the Town of Burlington in 1797. The territory of Pittsfield was reduced two times, in 1806 to form Town of New Lisbon, and in 1859 to form part of the Town of Morris. It was named by the Noble family from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, for their old home, who settled in the Pittsfield Centre vicinity.

The hamlet of Pittsfield, or &quot;Pittsfield Centre&quot;, had an unmanned whistle stop station and siding on the Ontario &amp; Western RR branch to Edmeston from New Berlin, later purchased by the Unadilla Valley RR. During World War I Richard Freeman and Charles Walton shipped lumber by the carload from here, milled over in Ketchum.

Ketchum takes its name from the Rev. Orvib Ketchum who founded a congregational church on the headwaters of Aldrich Creek in the east part of town, the church was later sold by the Wyoming Conference to the Americana Village near Hamilton, NY. A schoolhouse, store, several steam sawmills and cemetery also existed here. The Ball family operated several &quot;rope walks&quot; nearby, where hemp was wound into twine and then rope.

County Route 13 between Morris and New Berlin is referred to as &quot;the turnpike&quot; by locals, originally constructed in 1832, it was the last section to operate a tollgate due to being the most expensive to build.

Ebenezer Chapel, near the southwest border, was coincidentally named after a nearby resident, and was a small settlement originally known as &quot;Hayti&quot; at one time. In 1956, a nearby house made statewide news when a moonshine still was busted up.

The Beardslee Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

<text>Richfield is a town located in Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 2,065. The Town of Richfield is located at the northern border of the county.

==History==
Richfield Springs was called &quot;Big Medicine Waters&quot; by the local natives.

From the &quot;Gazetteer of the State of New York&quot; by J. H. French, Published by R. Pearsall Smith, Syracuse, N. Y. 1860:
:Richfield was formed from the Town of Otsego, New York on April 10, 1792. The towns of Exeter and Plainfield were taken off in 1799. It is the extreme northern town of the county. Its surface is rolling and moderately hilly, with a mean elevation of 150 to 200 ft. above Schuyler Lake (now Canadarago Lake), which lies in the southeast corner of the town and occupies a deep valley, into which flow several small streams from the north and west. The soil is of a diversified character, consisting of gravel, slate, clay, and sandy loam, well cultivated and productive. About 500,000 pounds of cheese are made in the town annually, — being more than double that made in any other town in the county. Richfield Springs (p.v.), near the head of Schuyler Lake, in the northeast corner of the town, contains 3 churches, a flouring mill, and 368 inhabitants.1 Monticello, (Richfield p.o.,) near the center, contains a church and 139 inhabitants. Mayflower is a post office. Brighton contains about 15 houses. Settlements were made prior to the Revolution; but they were broken up during the war. The first settlers after the war were John Kimball, Richard and Wm. Pray, John Beardsley, Joseph Coats, and Seth Allen, in 1787.2 The first church (Prot. E.) was formed at Monticello, May 20, 1799; Rev. Daniel Nash was the first preacher.3

:1 Richfield Springs — from which the village derives its name — are celebrated for their medicinal properties in the cure of cutaneous disorders and large numbers of invalids are annually attracted here. Professor Reid has given the following as the result of an analysis of a wine gallon of the water of these springs:
:*Grains. Bicarbonate of magnesia 20
:*Bicarbonate of lime 10
:*Chloride of sodium and magnesia 1.05
:*Sulphate of magnesia 30
:*Hydrosulfate of magnesia and lime 2
:*Sulphate of lime 20
:*Solid matter 153.05
:*Total Grains 236.10
:*Sulphurated hydrogen gas, 26.9 inches.

:2 Willam Tunnicliff, Dan&#x27;l Hawks, John Hatch, Ebenezor Eaton, and Jos. Rockwell settled at or near Richfield Springs in 1789; Obadiah Beardsley and his son Obadiah, jr., the father and grandfather of the late Levi Beardsley, and Hon. Samuel Beardsley, of Utica settled near Schuylers Lake in 1790. The first birth was that of Jos. Beardsley; and the first marriage, that of Ebenezer Russell and Mrs. Moore. James S. Palmer taught the first school at Richfield Springs; Israel Rawson kept the first inn, and Cyrus Robinson the first store, at the Springs; William Tunnicliff erected the first mill, at the same place.

<text>Brewster is a village and the principal settlement within the town of Southeast in Putnam County, New York, United States. The population was 2,508 at the 2020 census. The village, which is the most densely populated portion of the county, was named for two early farmer landowners, Walter and James Brewster, who donated land for the Brewster railroad station in 1848.

== History ==
The village of Brewster derives its name from that of the landowner, Walter Brewster, who invited the New York and Harlem Railroad to build a depot on his property in 1848. Brewster&#x27;s Station, New York (sometimes just &quot;Brewster&#x27;s&quot;), appeared on maps, on postcards, and in directories of Putnam County throughout the second half of the 19th century. It was officially incorporated as the Village of Brewster, New York, in 1894.

In 1886, historian William Smith Pelletreau published &quot;The History of Putnam County, New York&quot;. In his second chapter on the town of Southeast, he wrote: &quot;The land now [1886] embraced within the limits of the village of Brewster consists of a farm which was sold by the commissioners of forfeiture to Peleg Bailey, in 1781. A portion of it afterward passed into the possession of Bailey Howes, his grandson, who sold 98 acres to Gilbert Bailey on April 1, 1833. Two other tracts containing 39 acres were sold to Gilbert Bailey, by William P. Downs and Frederick Parks in 1838. On February 17, 1848, Gilbert Bailey sold the whole tracts, estimated at 134 acres, to James and Walter F. Brewster, for the sum of $8,000.&quot;
&quot;At the time of the purchase, the New York and Harlem Railroad was finished and trains were running as far as Croton Falls. The road was surveyed as far as Pawling, and the prospect of its being continued to that point seemed certain, and to the new purchasers of the farm it seemed just the place for a station.&quot;

&quot;The New York and Harlem Railroad was finished to this place and the depot was built in that year, and what is now [1886] the Main street was opened, for the purpose of allowing the stages from Danbury to come to the station. Previous to this the firm of Crosby and DeForest had run a line of four horse stages to Croton Falls, from Danbury. The first new house in the place was built by Walter F. Brewster, in 1850 and stood in front of the present [1886] Methodist church.&quot; That house, now listed as the Walter Brewster House on the New York State and national historic registers, is owned by the Landmark Preservation Society of Southeast.

&quot;The Harlem Railroad&#x27;s extension of its mileage in 1849 proved advantageous to Mr. Brewster, who needed all sorts of materials in his building activities. Large shipments were billed simply to &#x27;Brewster&#x27;s Station&#x27; for lack of better designation. This is the apparent origin of the village&#x27;s name, which many years ago was shortened to Brewster.&quot;

=== Post offices ===
Jonathan F. Frost was the first Postmaster of the Brewster&#x27;s Station post office, which operated from October 25, 1850, through April 28, 1883.

During this period in American history, post offices were frequently located in the stores or businesses owned by the individuals who served as postmasters. This held true in the village of Brewster for the next century.

In 1863, the Brewster Station post office relocated to the A.F. Lobdell General Store, across from the railroad station, the present location of the Avery Building at 12–18 Main Street. Alexander F. Lobdell, the store&#x27;s proprietor, was appointed postmaster by President Abraham Lincoln and was reappointed by Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield and Arthur, continuing as Brewster&#x27;s postmaster until 1887. The Brewster post office began operation on April 28, 1883, removing the word &quot;Station&quot; in its identity and postmarks.

In 1887, the post office relocated to the Brewster Standard building, the present location of the Sprague Building at 31 Main Street. In 1886, Emerson W. Addis, publisher of the &quot;Brewster Standard&quot; weekly newspaper, became the postmaster and held that position until 1916.

In 1916, the post office moved to new quarters on Park Street, between Main Street and Marvin Avenue, into the Rundall Building, and John Thorp became the new postmaster.

In 1923, Ralph Diehl, proprietor of the Brewster Bakery, became postmaster, and the post office was moved to his baking plant on Progress Street in 1927. Howard Tuttle later became the postmaster, holding the position until 1934 when Seth Howes was appointed. In 1936, the post office relocated to the building now occupied by the Eagle Eye Thrift Shop at 65 Main Street.

Mr. Howes held the office until 1958 when John F. Larkin Jr. was made acting postmaster. He was later promoted to the full title of postmaster.

On July 17, 1966, the post office relocated to a new brick building on Main Street, where it remained for the next three decades. Mr. Larkin retired in 1972 and was succeeded by Earl Tuttle, who became the last Southeast resident to hold the position of postmaster since that time. Mr. Tuttle retired in 1985.

The new facility was the first Brewster post office to occupy a space that was specifically designed for the purpose, rather than being retrofitted from some previous use. It had a separate lobby to house post office boxes, a loading dock at the rear of the building and a postal inspector&#x27;s separate entrance and hallway with one-way glass for observing postal workers and the public.

In the mid-1990s, the Main Street facility closed and a new post office opened at its present location at 3 Mount Ebo Road North outside the village limits in the town of Southeast. Although the new facility is more than from the center of Brewster, it still retains the designation and postmark &quot;Brewster 10509&quot;.

=== &quot;Brewster&quot; vs. &quot;Southeast&quot; ===

Before 1962, there were several local post offices throughout the town of Southeast, located near larger concentrations of residences and businesses. The last of these, Southeast&#x27;s Putnam Lake post office, closed in 1968. When a new post office opened at 16 Main Street in Brewster on July 17, 1966, even before Interstate 84 and Interstate 684 were constructed, it was named Brewster and given the zip code 10509.

==Brewster Crossing==

Urban renewal plans for the Village of Brewster have been in the works for well over a decade. In 2011, a blight determination study was conducted to identify primary contributors to the community&#x27;s decline and determine potential redevelopment strategies. The study revealed that 15% of the properties in the surveyed area were considered blighted. These findings prompted a transit-focused redevelopment plan, targeting five distinct subareas in need of improvement. The primary objectives of the plan are to transform underused and/or deteriorating properties into spaces for retail and housing, thereby generating economic activity and supporting the use of the Metro-North Brewster train station. The project, officially dubbed &quot;Brewster Crossing&quot;, has garnered support from many local residents. However, it has also been met with resistance from others, as it requires the acquisition &amp; clearance of properties that are neither underused nor deteriorating. Long-standing food establishment, Bob&#x27;s Diner, is one of many businesses slated for demolition. Other notable properties impacted include the Jack &amp; Jill Pool Hall and A.F. Lobdell estate (c. 1860), in addition to other Victorian-era buildings. The anticipated completion date is set for 2027.

==Geography==

Brewster is located along the East Branch of the Croton River at (41.396050, −73.615954), near the center of the town of Southeast.

U.S. Route 6 runs through the village as its Main Street. U.S. Route 202 and New York State Route 22 run concurrently along the southern boundary of the village, and Interstate 84 passes just east of the village, intersecting Interstate 684. The Brewster train station is on the Harlem Line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 2,508 people residing in Brewster. There were 701 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 55.98% Hispanic or Latino, 36.61% non-Hispanic white, 2.59% African American, .42% Native American, 3.22% Asian, .04% from other races, and 1.13% from two or more races.

<text>Carmel (pronounced ) is a town in Putnam County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the town had a population of 33,576. 

The Town of Carmel is on the southern border of Putnam County, abutting Westchester County, approximately north of New York City and west of Danbury, Connecticut. It has no incorporated villages, although the hamlets of Carmel and Mahopac each have populations sizable enough to be considered villages.

==History==

The town of Carmel was originally inhabited by Indians of the Wappinger people, who, in 1691, sold the property to Dutch traders. In 1697, a wealthy New York merchant, Adolphus Philipse, purchased their deed and was granted a patent from King William III of England for the entire tract of land which is now Putnam County. The town was settled around 1740 by George Hughson. On the night of April 26, 1777, after learning the news that the British had begun burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, sixteen-year-old Sybil Ludington rode the entire night through the hamlets of Carmel, Mahopac, Kent Cliffs and Farmers Mills, warning those along the way that the British were coming before returning home at dawn. A statue memorializing the ride sits alongside Lake Gleneida.

Carmel was formed with Franklin town from part of Frederick town on March 17, 1795, while still a part of Dutchess County. (Franklin was renamed Patterson April 6, 1808. Frederick changed its name to Kent April 15, 1817.) Carmel was transferred to Putnam County when Dutchess County was split to form Putnam County in 1812 and Carmel was designated the county seat. In 1861, a small part of Carmel was taken to be added to the town of Putnam Valley.

===Putnam County Courthouse===
The Putnam County Courthouse was built in 1814. It is the second oldest working courthouse in New York State. General James Townsend, of Carmel, was the architect. A landmark on Gleneida Avenue in Carmel, the building has a classical front facade. There was one hanging there in 1844. A jail was added in 1855. A new Putnam County Courthouse was completed in early 2008, located nearby on Gleneida Avenue.

<doc id="127032" wikidata="Q1016615" url="?curid=127032" title="Cold Spring, New York">
<text>Cold Spring is a village in the town of Philipstown in Putnam County, New York, United States. The population was 1,986 at the 2020 census. It borders the smaller village of Nelsonville and the hamlets of Garrison and North Highlands. The central area of the village is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Cold Spring Historic District due to its many well-preserved 19th-century buildings, constructed to accommodate workers at the nearby West Point Foundry (itself a Registered Historic Place today). The town is the birthplace of General Gouverneur K. Warren, who was an important figure in the Union Army during the Civil War. The village, located in the Hudson Highlands, sits at the deepest point of the Hudson River, directly across from West Point. Cold Spring serves as a weekend getaway for many residents of New York City.

Commuter service to New York City is available via the Cold Spring train station, served by Metro-North Railroad. The train journey is approximately one hour, ten minutes to Grand Central Terminal.

==History==
=== Early history ===
On July 15, 1691, Dortlandt and Sybrant secured a deed to the tract from Wappinger leaders, totaling as much as much as 17,480 acres (according to recent historical analysis) along the eastern bank of the Hudson River from the peak on Anthony&#x27;s Nose to (and including) Pollepel Island, and east to a marked tree which would establish the tract&#x27;s eastern border. This tract contained a large portion of modern-day Phillipstown, NY, including the entire the Village of Cold Spring.

While many land transactions in colonial America were disputed by settlers and natives, the original lands deeded to Dortlandt and Sybrant (containing the Village of Cold Spring) appear to have been legitimately obtained with the consent of the Wappinger. This is evidenced by testimony from Wappinger leader Daniel Nimham, who, in 1765, sought the assistance of the New York Common Council (and eventually the British Crown) in resolving land disputes over land claimed both by the heirs of Adolph Philipse and Wappinger natives. In this testimony, Nimham states that Wappinger ancestors had sold a tract of &quot;Low Lands on that Part of the Peeks kill [north of modern-day Annsville Creek]... and also a pine swamp containing... a few Acres called Kichtondacongh and a piece of low Land lying Southeasterly from Kichtondacongh called Paukeminshingh.&quot; Nimham goes on to contest the sale of any land beyond this initial tract deeded by the Wappinger to Dortlandt and Sybrant, however, recognizes the initial transaction of land (including present-day Cold Spring) as legitimately ceded by the Wappinger to the Dutch.

=== Permanent settlements ===
The first permanent settler in the village of Cold Spring was Merrick Williams in 1730. In 1772, a highway master was chosen for the road from Cold Spring to the Post Road from New York to Albany. Prior to Williams presence, the land was woodlands. A small trading hamlet grew alongside the river by the early 1800s. A couple of sloops made regular weekly trips from Cold Spring to New York, carrying wood and some country produce, which came over this model road from the east. Those trips by sloop usually took a week.

In 1818, Gouverneur Kemble established the West Point Foundry opposite West Point to produce artillery pieces for the United States Government. The nearby mountains contained veins of ore, and were covered with timber for fuel. A brook provided hydropower, and the Hudson a ready shipping outlet. In 1843, the Foundry built the &quot;USS Spencer&quot;, the first iron ship built in the U.S. With the influx of workers at the Foundry, local housing, businesses and churches increased, and Cold Spring was incorporated as a village in 1846. The first President of the Village was Joshua Haight. The Foundry became famous for its production of Parrott rifles and other munitions during the Civil War, when the foundry grew to a sprawling 100-acre complex employing 1,400. It also manufactured cast iron steam engines for locomotives, gears, and produced much of the pipework for New York&#x27;s water system. The rise of steel making and the declining demand for cast iron after the Civil War caused the Foundry to cease operations in 1911. Many artifacts from the Foundry&#x27;s history can be viewed at the Putnam History Museum on Chestnut Street. Built in 1830, the building was originally a one-room schoolhouse for the Foundry&#x27;s teenage apprentices and the children of employees.

On January 22, 1896, local businessmen of Cold Spring formed a fire brigade known as the Cold Spring Hose Company, No.1. A horse-drawn hook and ladder was donated in 1899. The Municipal Building, designed by Louis Mekeel, was constructed in 1926 to house the company&#x27;s first firetruck, an American LaFrance. The company, renamed Cold Spring Fire Company No.1 in 1900, serves the Villages of Cold Spring, Nelsonville and a district in the Town of Philipstown.

Mr. Willis Buckner, a former slave from the South, was a driver and groom for Susan and Anna Bartlett Warner at their farm on Constitution Island. Mr. Buckner taught Sunday School at the Methodist Church. In the early decades of the 20th century, blacks who stayed in this part of New York state migrated away from rural towns to nearby cities with waterfront manufacturing such as Peekskill, Beacon, Newburgh and Ossining. During the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had a presence in Cold Spring as well as Fishkill and Nelsonville.

Pete Seeger formed the Clearwater organization, an environmental group dedicated to advances in sewer treatment, industrial waste disposal, and addressing the discharge of major pollutants into the Hudson.
In 1970, the sloop &quot;Clearwater&quot; docked for a songfest at Cold Spring. As Seeger appeared on stage to thank the audience for coming, fifteen drunks stood up waving little American flags, yelling “Throw the Commies out.” That night someone cut the sloop&#x27;s moorings and there were threats to torch the boat. All of this created tension within the Clearwater organization.
===Country estates===
Towards the latter part of the nineteenth century artists, writers and prominent families came to Cold Spring, and mansions were built along Morris Avenue, including &quot;Undercliff,&quot; the home of publisher George Pope Morris, and &quot;Craigside,&quot; the home of Julia and General Daniel Butterfield. To the south, West Point Foundry employees Dr. Frederick Lente built &quot;The Grove,&quot; Robert Parker Parrott built &quot;Plumbush,&quot; and Hudson River School painter Thomas P. Rossiter built &quot;Fair Lawn.&quot;

==Geography==
The village is bordered by the Hudson River to the west, and is bound by the Hudson Highlands State Park to the north, where Mount Taurus and Breakneck Ridge rise out of the banks of the Hudson and form two basically parallel ridges that track each other inland. The valley between them has an abandoned dairy farm, two lakes, and a camp.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.91%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 1,986 people, 834 households, and 834 families residing in the village. The population density was . The racial makeup of the village was 94% White, 0.49% African American, 0.44% Native American, 3.05% Asian, 2.12% from other races, and 0.08% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.07% of the population.

Out of the 834 households, 25.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.9% were married couples living together. The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 3.0.

The median income for a household in the village was $98,056 (an increase of 83.7% from 2010), and the median income for a family was $135,500 (an increase of 78.2% from 2010). About 8.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.8% of those under age 18 and 4.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
===Attractions===
The Foundry Preserve Trail is located here.

The Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library was established in Cold Spring in 1913.

Magazzino Italian Art is a museum focused on Postwar and Contemporary Italian Art and features a herd of Sardinian donkeys.

===Churches===
In 1826, Union Church was built. By mutual agreement the Presbyterians used the building in the morning and the other religious groups in the afternoon. In 1830, the Baptists constructed a church on land donated by Samuel L. Gouverneur. The first Methodist church was built in 1833. The building was sold in 1870, and a new brick Italianate structure was built in 1868. The Dutch Reformed Church was built around 1855 in Neoclassical style. The building was later replaced by the Julia L. Butterfield Library.

Many of the workers at the Foundry were Irish immigrants. Our Lady of Loretto church was constructed in 1833 of locally made red brick covered with stucco. The church was abandoned in 1906 and fell into disrepair. It was repaired and re-dedicated in 1977.

Saint Mary&#x27;s in the Highlands church was incorporated in 1840. A second larger church was built in 1867, designed in the Victorian Gothic style by architect and vestry member George Edward Harney.

==Education==
Cold Spring is home to the Haldane Central School District. The school is located at 15 Craigside Drive and teaches students grades K-12. The school received a blue ribbon award in 2017 from the U.S. Department of Education.

==History==
Kent was part of the Philipse Patent of 1697, when it was still populated by the Wappinger tribe. Daniel Nimham (1724–1778) was the last chief of the Wappingers and was the most prominent Native American of his time in the Hudson Valley.

The town was first settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century by Zachariah Merritt and others, from New England, Westchester County, or the Fishkill area. Elisha Cole and his wife Hannah Smalley built Coles Mills in 1748, having moved to that location the previous year from Cape Cod. Coles Mill operated until 1895, when it was submerged under West Branch Reservoir. Around this same time the northeastern part of the county was settled by the Kent, Townsend, and Ludington families, among others. The father of Hannah Smalley and his family moved to Kent about two years before Elisha Cole and his family.

Kent was a part of the Frederickstown Precinct which was chartered in 1772, the rest of Frederickstown consisting of the future town of Carmel and the western parts of the future towns of Patterson and Southeast. Other early family names were Townsend, Smalley, Kent, Dykeman, Barrett, Cole, Boyd, Wixon, Farrington, Burton, Carter, and Ludington.

The present-day intersection of Interstate 84 and Ludingtonville Road was the home of Col. Henry Ludington and his daughter Sybil, who was said to have ridden one night in 1777 to call up her father&#x27;s militia during the American Revolutionary War. A statue of her stands on the shores of Lake Gleneida across from the Putnam County Courthouse.

When the towns of Carmel and Patterson were split from Frederickstown in 1795, the remnant, constituting the current Kent, was established as the &quot;Town of Frederick&quot;. Until 1812 it was part of Dutchess County. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Kent&quot; in 1817. A small portion of the town of Philipstown was transferred to Kent in 1877.

The major population center of the township is Lake Carmel, a settlement around an artificial lake of the same name developed in the 1920s. Historically the population centers had been Farmer&#x27;s Mills and Luddingtonville, little of which remain, and Cole&#x27;s Mills, none of which remains.

Much of early Kent&#x27;s economy was based on dairy farming for the New York City market, but with many reservoirs being constructed in the late 19th century for drinking water for the same city, most of the farms were submerged, and the dairy industry was all but abandoned by the 1920s. At that point, and because of the advent of the automobile, Kent started to attract new residents from the city.

The town is served by the Carmel Central School District and, for the majority of residents, by the Carmel Post Office. Kent is home to the Nimham Mountain Fire Tower, located in the Taconic Hills. Built by the State of New York and the CCC in 1940, it is the tallest remaining fire tower in New York state and appears on the National Historic Lookout Register. The Chuang Yen Monastery which is home to the largest indoor statue of Buddha in the Western Hemisphere is also located in Kent.

==Geography==
Kent is rugged and hilly, sitting atop the interior ridges of the Hudson Highlands some north of New York City in the north central portion of Putnam County. It borders the towns of Philipstown and Putnam Valley to the west and southwest; Patterson to the east, and Carmel to the south. The northern town line is the border of the Dutchess County towns of East Fishkill and Pawling. Two state parks, Wonder Lake in the east and Fahnestock in the west, a portion of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and thousands of acres of open space under the permanent protection of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, offer recreational opportunities.

The town is home to a number of lakes, which were once popular with summer residents but now have become year-round communities, including Sagamore Lake, Kentwood Lake, Lake Tibet, China Lake, Palmer Lake, and White Pond. Kent is also home to two reservoirs that are part of the New York City water supply system, with much adjacent land purchased by it for conservation through the Watershed Preservation Program. These include Boyds Corner and West Branch, with the latter being the east-of-Hudson terminus of the important Catskill/Delaware supply.

Interstate 84 and the Taconic State Parkway pass through the town.

<doc id="127035" wikidata="Q3460520" url="?curid=127035" title="Mahopac, New York">
<text>Mahopac ( or ) is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in the town of Carmel in Putnam County, New York, United States. Also known as Lake Mahopac, the exurb is located some north of New York City, on U.S. Route 6 at the county&#x27;s southern central border with Westchester County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,933.

==History==
Mahopac was originally inhabited by the Wappinger people, an Algonquian tribe. The hamlet&#x27;s land was part of a huge tract encompassing all of today&#x27;s Putnam County patented in 1697 by Adolphus Philipse, son of a wealthy Anglo-Dutch gentryman, known as the Philipse Patent. During the French and Indian War, Wappingers throughout Putnam County traveled north to Massachusetts to fight for the British.

When the British Crown refused to return their land after the war, most Wappingers abandoned the area, concentrating in Stockbridge, Massachusetts before relocating with other displaced Native Americans elsewhere. Farmers and their families migrated to Mahopac from as far away as Cape Cod and rented land from the Philipse family. Wheelwrights and blacksmiths set up shops to assist the tenant farmers.

Although no battles were fought in Mahopac during the American Revolution, the area was strategically important due to its location. With troop encampments in nearby Patterson, Yorktown, West Point, and Danbury, Connecticut, it was a cross-roads between key Colonial garrisons. Soldiers were stationed in Mahopac Falls to guard the Red Mills, an important center for grinding grain and storing flour for the American troops.

Upon Colonial victory in the Revolution, the Tory-sympathizing Philipse family lost its claim to the land, which was then resold to farmers and speculators by New York State. After the incorporation of Putnam County in 1812 the Mahopac area grew steadily. By the middle-19th century the hamlet had become a summer resort community. The New York and Harlem Railroad brought vacationers north from New York City to Croton Falls. Hotels would often have competing races of decorated horse-drawn coaches bringing passengers from the train to Lake Mahopac. After the Civil War a direct rail spur was laid, creating boom times for the village.

The locale remained primarily a summer resort until after World War II, when nearby highways such as the Taconic State and Saw Mill River parkways began to make travel by automobile convenient. With the passing of the New York Central Putnam Division&#x27;s last passenger service to Mahopac in 1959, the hamlet evolved into a year-round community, many of its residents making the commute to New York City.

==Lake Mahopac==
The hamlet of Mahopac encircles Lake Mahopac. It contains three islands, Fairy, Petre, and Canopus, all privately owned. Fairy Island sports multiple homes accessible via a short causeway; Petre Island boasts the Massaro House, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired residence, and a Wright-designed bungalo, the A. K. Chahroudi Cottage; Canopus is undeveloped. Boating, fishing and other water sports are permitted on the lake. Slips and support services are provided by two marinas.

The world record brown bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus nebulosus&quot;), which weighed , was caught in Lake Mahopac on August 1, 2009 by angler Glenn Collacuro.

Besides Lake Mahopac, other lakes within the Mahopac CDP include Kirk Lake, Lake Casse, Lake Secor, Teakettle Spout Lake, and Long Pond. Lake Mahopac is within the Croton River watershed yet not a part of the New York City water supply system&#x27;s Croton Watershed. Kirk Lake, a controlled lake in that system, is in both.

==Pronunciation==
The name &quot;Mahopac&quot; is believed to be an indigenous word meaning &quot;Great Lake&quot; or &quot;Lake of the Great Serpent&quot;. Long-time area residents affirm that the pronunciation &quot;Ma-HO-pac&quot; – consistent with other Native American named local communities such as Mohegan and Mohansic – was used by residents until the hamlet&#x27;s large population expansion and demographic shift in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. 

In spite of a 3–2 vote by the Carmel Town Board in favor of the traditional pronunciation, the modern-day first-syllable-inflected &quot;MAY-o-pac&quot; is used by a large number of residents today. Stressing the similar pronunciation of other Native American communities nearby, lifelong Mahopac resident and retired Putnam County legislator and assistant to the Putnam County Executive Regina Morini affirmed, &quot;Mohegan, Mohansic, Mahopac. The accent is on the second syllable&quot;.

<doc id="127037" wikidata="Q3709168" url="?curid=127037" title="Patterson, New York">
<text>Patterson is a town in Putnam County, New York, United States. The town is in the northeastern part of the county. Interstate 84 passes through the southwestern section of the town. The population was 11,541 at the 2020 census. The town is named after early farmer Matthew Paterson. The town was spelled with two &quot;t&quot;s because of the looseness with which Paterson spelled his own last name.

==History==
The town was first settled around 1720 in The Oblong, which was a disputed area in southeastern Province of New York also claimed by the Connecticut Colony. The Oblong was a strip of land approximately 1.81 miles wide (2.91 km) between Dutchess County, New York, and Connecticut, ceded to New York in the 1731 Treaty of Dover. Between 1720 and 1776 a large number of mostly Connecticut families settled in the southern Oblong. They could not settle west of it because that land was privately owned by the Philipse family. It had been granted a patent for virtually all of the remainder of the area of the future Putnam County.

The first such settlers in the Oblong were the Hayt family, who built a house at The Elm in 1720. Another early settler was Jacob Haviland, who settled Haviland Hollow in 1731. The first village in Putnam County, the hamlet of Patterson, was originally called Frederickstown. The eastern part of the future Putnam County was called Southeast Precinct (not the same as the current town of Southeast).

The Philipses were Loyalists during the Revolution and left the area. The state confiscated their land, selling it off. In 1788, the former Philipse portion of the Oblong was chartered as the Town of Southeast; the remainder of the region was chartered as the Town of Fredericktown in Dutchess County, New York. In 1795, Fredericktown township was split into four parts: 1. the Town of Carmel, 2. a part which was combined with the northern half of Southeast and became the Town of Franklin, which was renamed the Town of Patterson in 1808, 3. a part which was combined with the southern half of Southeast and became the new, much larger town of Southeast, and 4. the remnant of the town, which was the Town of Frederick for a while. It was renamed as the Town of Kent in 1817.

<text>Philipstown is a town located in the western part of Putnam County, New York, United States. The population was 9,831 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
In 1697 Adolphus Philipse, a wealthy Province of New York landowner and merchant, purchased a tract from Dutch traders which received British Royal sanction as the &quot;Highland Patent&quot;. Comprising roughly 250 square miles, it extended approximately 13 miles along the eastern shore of the Hudson River, from Annsville Creek to the Fishkill Creek, and eastward some 20 or so miles to the border of the Colony of Connecticut.

Philipstown was first settled in the westernmost of this parcel &quot;circa&quot; 1715. In 1754 the Highland Patent, subsequently known as the Philipse Patent, was divided among Philipse heirs into nine parcels. In 1788, Philipstown was established out of the three river lots and part of a fourth inland to the north, becoming one of the three original towns in what is now Putnam County. In 1806 a very small portion north of the Hudson Highlands by the mouth of Fishkill Creek was split off from Philipstown and given to the Town of Fishkill.

Philipstown&#x27;s main population centers are the village of Cold Spring, the hamlet of Garrison, and the village of Nelsonville. In 1806, part of the town was used to form the town of Fishkill. Putnam Valley was part of Philipstown until 1839, and a small portion of the town north of Putnam Valley was transferred to Kent in 1877.

==History==
Up until the end of World War I, Putnam Lake was a small rural hamlet called Valleyville, consisting mainly of dairy farms. In the years leading into the Great Depression, failing farms were bought by developers McGolrick Realty Co. in association with Warren and Arthur Smadbeck, to create a recreational community for New York City citizens.

In 1930, the State Line Golf and Country Club in association with the Smadbecks&#x27; New York Daily Mirror Holding Co. bought five farms, totaling of land in Patterson, encroaching New Fairfield, Connecticut. Morlock Brook was dammed, flooding the area of Valleyville, creating the lake.

The area around Putnam Lake was divided into 11,000 plots, each , which were to be occupied by summer cottages, general stores, restaurants, gas stations, dance pavilions, and taverns. The &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; first published advertisements for the community in 1931, and 75 percent of the lots were sold in the first year. Some 2000 homes were built by 1932, which made Putnam Lake the most densely populated community in Patterson, if only for the summer. Some families made Putnam Lake their year-round residence, and a school house was constructed where the Veterans of Foreign Wars building now stands on Fairfield Drive.

The Putnam Lake Property Owners Association, now known as the Putnam Lake Community Council, was formed in the 1930s, with Herbert M. Holton as its first president. The PLCC was, and still is, a volunteer organization which collected dues from families living in Putnam Lake. The PLCC once provided paved roads, electricity, and fire protection, as well as social and recreational activities for Putnam Lake families including the community swimming pool, clubhouse, and tennis court. The PLCC now owns and is responsible for the beaches, parks, Memorial Field, and the boat house.

In May 1952, Memorial Field, to be dedicated to the Putnam Lake casualties of World War II, was proposed to replace the swimming pool, which had not been used since the early 1930s because it was contaminated with seepage and infested with leeches. Construction proceeded through the leadership of Henry Sherer, and in 1955, Edward Angerola, chairmen of the Memorial Field committee. Tiles were used to divert water running through the ground, and fill was brought in from the land surrounding the firehouse. Memorial Field&#x27;s baseball diamond and field is used in the warmer months.

In 2011 a petition was circulated to create a park district. The petition was certified by the Town of Patterson and the property and assets were transferred to the Town at the end of 2012.

<text>Putnam Valley is a town in Putnam County, New York, United States. The population was 11,762 at the 2020 census. Its location is northeast of New York City, in the southwestern part of Putnam County. Putnam Valley calls itself the &quot;Town of Lakes&quot;.

== History ==
The retreating glaciers of the last ice age did much to shape the landscape of Putnam Valley, including the shearing of hills to expose springs (creating, for example, Bryant Pond) and leaving the glacial deposits of stone and large boulders. The current area of Putnam Valley was occupied by paleo-Indians, followed by the historic Wappinger Indians who lived by the many lakes. Dutch and English farmers moved into the area toward the end of the 17th Century.

In 1697, the Highland Patent was granted to Adolph Philipse. The first settlers arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1740. In 1745, the Smith property was sold to the Bryant family, who renamed their pond Bryant Pond and the nearby hill, Bryant Hill. The Smith family homestead is the oldest house in Putnam Valley, located just east of the Taconic Parkway on Bryant Pond Road.

Putnam Valley incorporated in 1839 as the town of Quincy, when it was separated from the town of Philipstown, and it took the name &quot;Putnam Valley&quot; in 1840, possibly because local inhabitants were not favorably impressed by John Quincy Adams.

In 1861, a small part of the town of Carmel was added to Putnam Valley.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.72%, is water.

The high school is the most recent addition to the district, being built in 2000. It uses geothermal energy for heating and cooling, has three computer labs, a performing arts center and wireless Internet access in all classrooms. Before the high school was built, Putnam Valley students were previously sent to neighboring town high schools including Lakeland High School in Shrub Oak, Peekskill High School or Walter Panas High School, all of which are in Westchester County.

In grades 5 through 12, every student is issued an Apple laptop or Chromebook. Apple laptops are guaranteed to be given to those in 9th grade and above. This is a program that sets the school apart from others in the area.

<doc id="127041" wikidata="Q3708420" url="?curid=127041" title="Southeast, New York">
<text>Southeast is a town in Putnam County, New York, United States, so named for its location in the southeastern corner of the county. The population was 18,058 at the 2020 census. The town as a whole is informally referred to as Brewster, the town&#x27;s principal settlement; the latter is also an incorporated village within the town&#x27;s borders. Interstate 84, Interstate 684, U.S. Route 202, US Route 6, and NY 22 are the primary routes through the town.

==History==

The first settler arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1730. The area first exploited was called &quot;The Oblong,&quot; and was outside of the land claimed by the Philipse Patent. Due to a border dispute between New York and Connecticut, the area between the undisputed border of New York and the undisputed border of Connecticut was an approximately area which ran the full north-south dimension along the state line, in what are now Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, and Columbia Counties. This was called the Oblong. Land was sold in this area, both by the governor of New York and the King of England for Connecticut, with conflicting deeds. The boundary was settled in New York&#x27;s favor by the 1731 Treaty of Dover.

A small portion of the Oblong, namely the portion in the Philipse Patent (now Putnam County), was alternately known as Southeast as it was the southeasternmost town in Dutchess County. It consisted of the four-mile-wide section of land along the Connecticut border, going the full north-south dimension of what is now Putnam County, i.e. the eastern part of the current town of Patterson, and the eastern part of the current town of Southeast. The western parts of those two current towns were part of the large Phillipse Patent which had not yet been divided into towns.

The most heavily settled areas of the &quot;Oblong&quot; version of Southeast were the &quot;city&quot; of Frederickstown, now the hamlet of Patterson, and the area called Sodom. This version of Southeast was founded in 1788, and formed the southeast corner of Dutchess County. In 1795, Frederickstown, the town that had been Southeast&#x27;s neighbor, was divided into the present towns of Carmel, Kent, and Patterson, the latter two known at first as &quot;Frederick&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot;, and at the same time, Southeast lost its northern half to Patterson, and expanded to the west to become the shape it is now. Putnam County split from Dutchess in 1812. The most densely populated area in the town today is the village of Brewster.

==Post offices==

The first &quot;South East&quot; post office was established in 1797, when the town was still a municipality in Dutchess County. On June 12, 1812, the county of Putnam was established from six Dutchess County towns: Carmel, Kent, Patterson, Philipstown, Putnam Valley and Southeast. These two dates provide a frame of reference for the dates of operation of each Southeast post office.

Before the establishment of centralized post offices, local offices were established in general stores, railroad depots and other public venues in densely populated areas. In Southeast, there were nine individual post offices, each with distinctive postmarks:
* Brewster&#x27;s Station from 1850 to 1883
* Brewster from 1883 to date
* Doanesburgh from 1839 to 1855
* Dykman&#x27;s from 1851 to 1894
* Dykemans from 1894 to 1935
* Milltown from 1826 to 1867
* Putnam Lake Branch 1959 to 1968
* South East 1797 to 1812 (Dutchess County)
* South East 1812 to 1857 (Putnam County)
* Tilly Foster 1881 to 1958

By September 1968, the last of these local offices was closed, and the only post office for the town of Southeast and village of Brewster was located at 20 Main Street with the postmark &quot;Brewster, New York 10509&quot;. In the 1990s this USPS branch relocated to 3 Mount Ebo Road in the Doansburgh section of Southeast, no longer in the village of Brewster, but retained the &quot;Brewster 10509&quot; name and ZIP code.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 8.35%, is water. The town contains several reservoirs that supply New York City.

The eastern town line borders Fairfield County, Connecticut, and the southern town boundary borders northern Westchester County.
Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Brewster station and Southeast station serve the town, and are located on the Harlem Line. From Southeast, express trains to Grand Central Terminal take about 80 minutes.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 18,058, 7,058 households, and 6,516 families residing in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 71.95% White, 0.027% African American, 0.69% Native American, 2.65% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 10.3% from other races, and 11.6% from two or more races.

<text>Averill Park is a census-designated place within the town of Sand Lake in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 2,098 at the 2020 census.

The community is named after the local Averill family. It is located on Route 43, south of Crystal Lake and east of West Sand Lake.

The Sand Lake Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

==Demographics==
== History ==

Originally known only as part of greater Sand Lake, the community along with neighboring towns grew with the nineteenth-century development of wool and cotton textile manufacturing by local watermills and knitting factories along the Wynants Kill tributary of the Hudson River. By the 1880s, several independent local mills produced hosiery, undergarments, and knit shirts.

The hamlet was named Averill in 1880 after a local leading family, then in 1882 renamed Averill Park in promotion of local summer-resort development and of the Troy &amp; New England Railway, a never-completed trolley and freight line intended to connect the city of Troy, New York with the mills and summer resorts of Averill Park and its “upstate Coney Island” recreational Crystal Lake Beach, and with the mills of the neighboring town of West Sand Lake.
The local mills declined after the increasing efficiency of steam and electrical power improved competition from regional factories, and were then destroyed by a 1891 river flood. The Faith Knitting Company (later Faith Mills), founded in 1897, restored local industry by buying and re-equipping the old mills and rehiring local labor. Other late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century firms included Jake Warger’s Dry Goods Store; Gilbert Beebe’s blacksmith shop; Stout’s Hardware; and Park Pharmacy, where Jerry Lewis worked as a soda jerk in 1942 when his father was a superintendent at Faith Mills.

Mid-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century seasonal hotels included Al’s Place, Hilke’s Averill Park Hotel (previously housing Scram’s Collegiate Institute), Traveler’s Rest (aka Sand Lake House, Tillotson’s Hotel, and Wagner’s Hotel), the Lake View Hotel (aka Blake’s and the Gabler Hotel, later housing the Averill Park Female Seminary), and Clum’s. For mill workers and townspeople, Faith Mills’s Clubhouse was “the entertainment center of the town for many years,” complete with dance hall, motion picture parlor, cafeteria, bowling alleys, pocket billiard room, and shower room.

Faith Mills’s decline, and with it that of Averill Park, began in the Great Depression, during which local textile mills did not regain business till 1932. During World War II, manufacture of wool blankets and long woolen underwear for the military earned Faith Mills four rare “excellence in production” Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Awards.

From 1955 to 1962, Faith Mills, by then one of only three remaining U.S. manufacturers of woolen long underwear “considered obsolete by most persons” as the market shifted to cotton undergarments, was sold to holding companies and downsized to one factory in Averill Park employing as few as 54 workers, finally closing in 1962. In 1965, the factory was to manufacture a “floor-sweeping compound” and become a warehouse for corrugated shipping containers, employing 15 workers.

The town of Berlin is located on the eastern border of the county and is often pronounced with an emphasis on the first half of the name.

==History==

The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1765. It was named a town in 1806 and formed from the town of Petersburgh, one of the many New York towns with a German name. 
On July 25, 1962, Berlin was a site to the 1962 Berlin Explosion, Where a Semi-Truck full of 7000 gallons of propane crashed and blew up in the town killing 10 including the truck driver.

The highest point is Berlin Mountain, 2,818 feet (859 m) above sea level, near the Massachusetts border in the Taconic Mountains. The Taconic Mountains form a barrier in the eastern part of the town so that no existing road connects the town to Massachusetts. The western portion of the town is part of the Rensselaer Plateau.

<text>Brunswick is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The municipality was originally settled in the early 18th century. During its history, it had been part of Albany County, Rensselaerswyck, and Troy, before its incorporation in 1807. It is bordered on the west by the city of Troy; on the north by Schaghticoke and Pittstown; on the east by Grafton; and on the south by Poestenkill and North Greenbush. The population was 12,581 at the 2020 census. The source of the town&#x27;s name is not certain, though some claim it comes from the source of its first inhabitants from the province of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Germany.

The town was historically agricultural, but began experiencing suburban sprawl in the later decades of the 20th century, which continues currently. Historically, most of the developments have occurred around the town&#x27;s two major thoroughfares: New York Route 7 and New York Route 2, known locally as Hoosick Road and Brunswick Road, respectively. Brunswick became a popular place to settle in upon the completion of the local highway system in the Capital District, especially the upgrade of Route 7 into a four-lane highway in the 1980s.

==History==

===Colonial era===
The first settlement in Brunswick dates to 1711 to 1715 at Haynersville. Since Haynersville is located just at the current town line with Pittstown, it is currently impossible to be more specific about dates without knowing on which side of the town line various individual farms were.

In the records, Haynersville was first called simply &quot;Hosek Road&quot;. This is in reference to the public manor road that went north from the manor along the east side of the Hudson to where Troy now is, and then turned east across the area to Hoosick on the Vermont border, (the latter half of the road is basically today&#x27;s Route 7, and is still known as Hoosick Road).

The Hoosick Road was a vital link to the then frontier settlement at Hoosick, (settled in 1688), and which formed a link to both Bennington, Vermont and Williamstown. Until the 1790s, the government at Albany claimed Vermont, and its only practical connection to Vermont was by the Hoosick Road.

German Palatines had settled in Livingston&#x27;s Manor, south of Rensselaer&#x27;s Manor. Many of these were volunteers during Queen Anne&#x27;s War in an expedition against Canada in 1711, led locally by Peter Schuyler, &quot;and several finding the country north of them pleasant and desirable, determined, so soon as convenient after their return and discharge, to locate there&quot;. Johannes Jung, Job. Adam Freiderich, Georg Shaffer, Phillip Kelmer, Stephen Froelich, Andreas Bergman, Ludowig W. Schmidt, Job. Schneider, were in an initial group prior to 1715, and Coenraet Ham, Jans Witbeck and Hans Jury Kolemer, came in 1715. The last named individual settled within the manor and therefore within the town.

In 1724, there was another campaign against Canada, and which produced a similar exodus of discontented veterans from the Livingston Manor to Brunswick, including Johannes Heener (Hayner), Peter Phillips, Peter Lamp-Man, Johannes Heinrich Conrad, and Olrig and Philip Barnet. Paul Dirk (Derrick) and Peter Ham were the first settlers of Center Brunswick. Paul Derrick&#x27;s manor farm still stands as the rear section of the farmhouse at 936 Hoosick Road.

Of the earliest church records for the Gilead Lutheran Church, consisting of several dated receipts, the earliest is from 1746. Their first minister, Peter Nicholas Sommer, began his ministry at Haynersville and adjoining areas in 1743.

In the 1740s and 1750s, van Rensselaer as patroon of the manor gave land for the erection of a church, and for the support of a minister at Hosek Road, (Haynersville). Barnett also gives the text of a document from 1769 in the records of the Gilead Lutheran Church: When it had pleased the Almighty and Merciful God in His goodness to plant the Evangelical Lutheran Church in this American part of the world also, and especially in the State of New York, during the reign of Queen Anna, and also in this neighborhood and district called Hosek Road, in Rensselaerwyck, Albany County, then more than twenty years ago, a small body of adherents of the above said Lutheran church, disposed to that end did build and erect a prayer and church House to the Honor of God, and for their convenience, upon that lot of ground which our most worthy Patroon generously gave to promote and perpetuate the service of God and for the better maintenance of our preacher, for which purpose he presented us with a Deed of Gift which We acknowledge with heartfelt thanks towards our Good Lord in Heaven, and that in addition He grants us all hereabouts by His grace that we through the permission of the Government are allowed to carry on our pure Lutheran church service free and without hindrance. Barnett concludes that &#x27;more than twenty years&#x27; before 1769 roughly corresponds to Sommer&#x27;s appointment as minister, and that sometime between 1743 and 1749, the first church in Brunswick was built. It was referred to as the log church, and was probably a simple structure.

From this beginning there was an increase, but not without conflict. &quot;During the wars of 1745 and 1754 between the English and French, all this region north of Albany was marked by frequent atrocities perpetrated by the Savage allies of the French, and twice at least the majority of the settlers fled from their homes in terror, retiring to Livingston Manor and other points down the river, some of whom never returned.&quot; One particularly notorious incident was the burning of Hoosick, outside Brunswick, by the French in August 1754. Matters did not settle until the collapse of the French at Quebec in 1760. &quot;When these troubles were finally at an end, the inducements offered to settlers by the lord of the Manor attracted many emigrants, not only Germans, but Dutch, English, Scotch, Irish and French as well.&quot;

Peace also brought the first tavern in the area, run by a John Tillman, followed by a second tavern in 1772, run by Johannes Hayner, Jr., from which Haynersville, (Hayner&#x27;s Tavern), eventually got its name.

The first store was opened by Conrad Hayner and Peter Loose at Tamarack, and the first grist mill was built by Johann Heinrich Gross, in 1772, on the Quackenkill.

On the map of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, drawn in 1767 by John R. Bleecker, there are many names associated with leased parcels, especially in the western part of the town and in Haynersville. The map shows that settlement had mostly been as far east as present day Center Brunswick and Eagle Mills.

By the 1770s, the original log church became inadequate to the needs of the community, as is made clear in this 1789 public plea. It is about fourteen Years ago, that the said Members of the (Gilead Lutheran) Congregation, whilst the Number of them did increase, so that the Block Meeting House, where they used to serve the Lord, was too small for them, and the said Meeting house was not fit for any Worship, for fear it might brake down and kill them, so that the took a Notion of building a Church, and they begone it in the year 1775. But the disturbance of the War put soon a Stop to it, so that a great many of the said Members were ruin&#x27;d &amp; brought to great Distress and Poverty, so that they was oblig&#x27;d to leave of building: but now last Year they have begun again, and did their utmost Endeavour to finish the said Church. It was not their Intention in the least at that Time to molest their Neighbours and Fellow Christians with Collections, for it has the appearance last Fall, as if they should have a promising Crop this Harvest, but that Hope is all lost for the most part of the Grane is kill&#x27;d with the Frost, and the Rest is destroy&#x27;d by the Insects, and now they have such a heavy Debt to pay, which they are not able to discharge out of their own Pokets: So they are obliged to implore all good-minded Christians who has it in their Hearts to promote the kingdom of Christ to assist them and lay some mite for the said Building of the said Church in the Hands of their Fellow Brothers wiiich they have send for that purpose Namely Albertus Simon and Jacob Weager.

===Revolutionary War period===
For Town of Brunswick in the Revolutionary War, the excerpts from Barnett cover the history &quot;Situated, as it was, near the head of navigation on the Hudson, and on the line traversed by the contending forces between New York City and Canada, (the people of Brunswick) naturally suffered many and grievous annoyances from both sides, but principally from the tories. From the first shock of conflict, east of them, in and around Boston, to the battle of Bennington, in sight from high ground and a few miles on the north-east; and the battles just across the river, between the patriot army and that of Burgoyne; and later, they were in constant dread and danger, many abandoning their homes, where all farm work was virtually given up.&quot;

&quot;Emmissaries of the British government came among them, who easily persuaded many of the simple people to side with the royalists, but the majority, principally Germans, espoused the cause of freedom, which made it necessary for such as had joined with the tories to flee the country. This gave rise to the separation of families, the disruption of the harmony hitherto existing in the Church and community, and a deadly enmity which led to acts of violence... When Burgoyne&#x27;s army approached, and General Schuyler with his forces fell back from Fort Edward to the Islands at the mouth of the Mohawk, the people on this side of the Hudson took refuge in Lansingburgh. Abner Roberts, a member of Gilead and an officer of the Continental army, anxious to visit his home... and, not apprehending any serious danger, crossed to Lansingburgh and alone rode leisurely away, he had barely leached the top of the hill... when he was ambushed by a band of tories, killed and scalped. Several days afterwards his mutilated remains were found where he had fallen. ... Bald Mountain... was a favorite resort or rallying point for these predatory bands. From its summit they not only had the advantage of a wide view of the surrounding country, but the valley of the Hudson for miles north and south lay open to observation, the importance of
which, in carrying out their nefarious schemes, they fully appreciated and employed.&quot;

===Town incorporation===
The present territory of Brunswick was initially a part of the town of Troy. Troy had been organized as a town in 1791. The growing importance of the prospective city, and its requirements led to a separation of Troy from its rural parts: today&#x27;s Brunswick and Grafton.

The first town meeting was held at the house of Nathan Betts, a local innkeeper, and continued taking place there for another year. The first town supervisor was Flores Bancker, who held the office from 1807 until 1809. The first town clerk was Daniel Wager, who served for one year. The first three justices of the peace were Robert McChesney, Daniel Wagar, and John McManus. In pursuance of laws enacted under the constitution of 1821, justices of the peace were chosen at the general elections or were appointed by the courts. The election of justices at town meetings began in 1831.

The town did not develop quickly under the manorial system. Although agriculturally productive, since residents did not own the land, there was little incentive to develop properties. That changed after the collapse of Rensselaerswyck in the 1840s.

One short term historical figure was Herman Melville, who in 1840 had been residing with his mother in Lansingburgh, but who taught for a half year at a one room schoolhouse in Brunswick.

Little documentation exists on who took part in the War of 1812. There was significantly more interest in fighting during the Civil War, Brunswick having sent more than 125 men to fight during various times of the war.

The main recreational facility of the town is Vanderhyden Lake, an old reservoir for the city of Troy now used for swimming.

===Industrial Revolution===

The area of Eagle Mills was a significant industrial area during the mid to late 19th century. Many factories sprung up along the banks of the Poesten Kill due to rapids and a waterfall being located in the area. One such enterprise was the Eagle flour mills, which eventually gave the area its name. The building would change hands multiple times before ending up as Millville Manufacturing Company making augers and then Planters&#x27; Hoe Company making hoes. Both companies were under the direction of Joseph H. Allen, who was also supervisor of Brunswick from 1856 to 1857 and a justice of the peace in 1861. Allen closed down Planters&#x27; in 1862 to serve in the Civil War. He came out of the war a lieutenant colonel, a position that was awarded to him specifically by President Lincoln. Planters&#x27; opened up again after his return to the town. He lived in a house on today&#x27;s Brunswick Road, which still stands.

===Late 20th and 21st centuries===
The Brunswick Historical Society (BHS) began operations in 1974 and was recognized with a state charter in 1981. It has been housed in the Garfield School since 1988.

Brunswick remained mostly rural into the mid and late 20th century. The 1990s brought about expansion along Hoosick Road, with the addition of a Wal-Mart and Price Chopper, along with subsequent strip malls, in 1996. These openings led to interest by developers to build more housing options within the town, which offers quick access to Troy and, subsequently, Interstate 787 and the greater Capital District. With the new commercial developments, residents wouldn&#x27;t be required to travel to Troy or other places to shop, offering more reasons to move to the town.

====Expanding development and Brunswick Smart Growth====
In early 2005, Wal-Mart indicated intentions to build a Supercenter near its current site on Hoosick Road (Route 7), which sparked outcry from a significant portion of the town population. Additionally, in late 2006, the town saw proposals for five large housing developments that would have added 1387 new homes to a town that was only seeing an average of 43 new homes per year. These proposals, along with other development plans, brought about much opposition, mainly from an organization called Brunswick Smart Growth, Inc., which began a campaign against rapid and excessive development.

One of the main issues coming from Brunswick Smart Growth and town residents was concerns regarding overdevelopment of the town in a short period of time; their argument was for &quot;sustainable and positive growth&quot;. Many cited the arguable overdevelopment of Clifton Park, a town located roughly to the northeast. Brunswick Smart Growth became noticeable after many residents placed signs on their lawns.

All of these proposed developments were planned to be rezoned to waive the usual requirement that each house sit on at least of land. Additionally, some town residents were upset about the fact that one of the developments, Highland Creek, was made possible by the sale of of land by town supervisor Philip Herrington and his brother Kenneth, a Rensselaer County legislator. It is notable that the Herrington brothers are successful dairy farmers; they own the largest dairy farm in Rensselaer County, and they also own a significant amount of farmland in the town. The land of the proposed Highland Creek development sits on former farmland.

The issue went so far as two lawsuits against the town. The first was brought about in October 2006 by Brunswick Smart Growth and a few individual town residents. It claimed that one, the town did not offer enough hearings regarding the planned Highland Creek development, and two, that the land on which Highland Creek would be built had not been properly rezoned for the development (it was zoned for agriculture and never rezoned to allow a residential development). The suit was eventually dismissed by Rensselaer County Supreme Court Judge Christian F. Hummel.

A second suit was filed, this time in the State Supreme Court, in November 2007, again by Brunswick Smart Growth and a few individuals. This time, the suit focused on insufficiencies in the town&#x27;s comprehensive plan. If the comprehensive plan were deemed inadequate, two proposed developments that had already received approval would lose their approval. This suit was dismissed in August 2009. The town reportedly spent more than $38,000 in legal fees during the two lawsuits.

The planned Wal-mart Supercenter was scrapped in 2007, instead the current Wal-mart received an upgrade; and none of the planned developments have yet been built, though this could have much to do with the late-2000s recession.

==Geography==

The town has gently rolling hills, which rise to the east, and some ridges of the Petersburg range are visible to the east. The most conspicuous height in Brunswick is Bald Mountain, also called Mount Rafinesque, which has a commanding view down the Hudson Valley. Bald Mountain also has television and radio broadcast towers.

The Poesten Kill winds across Brunswick, and empties into the Hudson in Troy. Its descent in Troy was the site of important water power.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.25%) is water.

===Communities===
Brunswick has a number of unincorporated villages or hamlets in the town.

*Center Brunswick was a point of early settlement and is a little north of the center of the town. It was located upon the well-known Hoosick Road (today, New York State Route 7). Although called Center Brunswick by inhabitants, the New York State highway department has always insisted that the proper name is Brunswick Center, and that inverted name has also followed into the databases of the digital age.
*Haynersville is situated in the north part of the town. It is adjacent to the old Cooksborough neighborhood in Pittstown and was the post office for that area in 1880. It derives its name from the Hayner families, who operated a tavern there after the French and Indian War. It is also located on the Hoosick Road and was a stopping point for stages that formed an important line between Troy and Bennington. It also is sometimes listed as Haynerville.
*Tamarac, or Tamarack, also known as Platestown, was near a point of quite early business, but much of this died by 1880. It is on a route of considerable former travel from Eagle Mills to Boyntonville, in Pittstown.
*Eagle Mills, in 1880, was the largest and most important business place in the town of Brunswick. In the mid to late 19th century, it was also known as Millville due to its mill work along the Poestenkill Creek. It is located along the former Mud Turnpike, much of which is the present New York State Route 2 to Grafton and Williamstown. Water power from the Postenkill was an important source of power for the mills. Hosting this type of industry led to other businesses opening up as well, such as a hotel, a foundry, blacksmiths, shoe shops, a wagon shop, and a vinegar establishment just east of the center of the hamlet. Those have all passed, and now Eagle Mills is mostly a residential community.
*Cropseyville is located along present day Route 2 near its intersection with New York State Route 351. It was known for its businesses relating to wagons, including a wagon shop and a blacksmith. It has its own post office. Cropseyville once depended on water power from the nearby Quackenkill Creek.
*East Brunswick, also known as Rock Hollow, is located above Cropseyville, on the old Troy and Williamstown Turnpike. It too depended on the Quackenkill for water power. Its most important business was the Lawton twine factory, which was long closed by 1880.
*Clum&#x27;s Corners was a well-known point of early times. It was on the road from Eagle Mills northeast to Boyntonville in Pittstown. The area is named for O. Clum, a blacksmith in the area. The area was known for wagon work, hosting a wagon shop, blacksmith, and hotel. It was known for fertile flats and fine farming. It is now the site of the regional high school, and has some expanding development and is becoming a retail center.

===Landmarks===
The town contains three listings on the National Register of Historic Places, two are schoolhouses and one farmstead: Garfield School; the Little Red Schoolhouse; and the Marsh–Link–Pollock Farm. In addition, it is home to a well-known cemetery, Forest Park Cemetery, currently under the jurisdiction of the town. It is known by urban legend as being one of the most haunted cemeteries in the United States. A very small portion of the historic Oakwood Cemetery, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and burial place of Samuel Wilson, a possible namesake of Uncle Sam, resides within the northwestern part of the town.

==Government==

===Local government===

Like all towns of the first class in New York, Brunswick has an elected town supervisor, town board, two town justices, town clerk and receiver of taxes. Unlike most towns, Brunswick&#x27;s highway superintendent has been made an appointed position. The current supervisor is Philip H. Herrington (R), who was elected to the position in 1997. The town board is made up of four members, each serving four-year terms, with two seats up for election every odd year. The current members are Mark J. Balistreri (R), Gordon Christian (R), James Sullivan (R), and Mark Cipperly (R). The first two members sit in seats that are up for election in November 2025; the latter are up for election in November 2027. The current town justices are Gary Gordon (D) and Terrance Buchanan (R). The town clerk is Rebecca DelGaizo (R). The entirety of town government is housed in Brunswick Town Hall, on the corner of Town Office Road and Hoosick Road.

===Federal, state and county representation===
Being in the state of New York, Brunswick is represented in the United States Senate by Chuck Schumer (D) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D). Brunswick is located in New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district, which is currently represented by Antonio Delgado. The town resides in the 43rd State Senate district, represented by Daphne Jordan (R), and the 107th Assembly district, represented by Jake Ashby (R). For Rensselaer County, the county executive is Steven F. McLaughlin (R). With respect to the County Legislature, the town is in district 3 and is represented by Kenneth Herrington (R), Todd J. Tesman (R), and Dan Casale (R).

==Politics==
Brunswick has both an organized Democratic Committee and Republican Committee. The legislative branch of Brunswick government has been under Republican control since the late 1990s. Republicans have a comfortable majority in the town: as of April 1, 2009, there were 2670 registered Republicans and 2230 registered Democrats residing in the town. Third parties are also represented, though with low populations relative to the main two parties. The third parties represented include the Independence Party, Conservative Party, Working Families Party, Green Party, and Libertarian Party; the Independence Party significantly outnumbers any other third party.

==Services==
The town is served by five volunteer fire departments: Eagle Mills Fire Department on Brunswick Road in Eagle Mills, Center Brunswick Fire Company on Hoosick Road in Center Brunswick, Brunswick Fire Company, No. 1 on Hoosick Road in Sycaway, Mountain View Fire Company near Wynantskill, and Speigletown Fire Company in Speigletown. Brunswick is also the home to a Troop G station of the New York State Police. Additionally, a sub-residency of the New York State Department of Transportation is located on Brick Church Road.

Municipal water service comes from Troy, though a significant portion of the town&#x27;s population gets its water from wells. Similarly, the small portion of the population connected to the local sewer system is serviced by the Rensselaer County Sewer District, though most inhabitants have individual septic systems.

==Culture and recreation==

Brunswick offers a selection of recreation areas for residents and non-residents. Brunswick Town Beach and Park, formerly the Vanderheyden and Brunswick reservoirs, on North Lake Avenue, was bought and developed by the town in 1967 and opened in 1968. Access is free to town residents. The town also hosts a free concert series on Tuesday nights during the summer, located on the lawn of the Brunswick Community Center. Additionally, the Community Center, built on the foundation of the former Lee School, offers tennis courts, a basketball court, a playground, and rental space for special events hosted by town residents.

The town is home to three golf courses: one private, two public. The Country Club of Troy, despite its name, resides completely in Brunswick, near its western border with Troy. Its 18-hole golf course, designed by Walter J. Travis (his last before he died), opened in 1926. The country club is private. Brunswick Greens, located on Hoosick Road, offers a nine-hole course. Additionally, parts of the Frear Park Municipal Golf Course reside in Brunswick, though most of the course is within Troy city limits, and its organization is overseen by the city. Opened in 1931 as a nine-hole course, Frear was expanded to 18 holes in 1964. Frear was designated the Upper Valley winner for best golf course by &quot;Hudson Valley&quot; magazine in 2003.

==Transportation==
The two major thoroughfares in Brunswick are New York Route 2 and New York Route 7, known locally as Brunswick Road and Hoosick Road, respectively. On the west, both originate in Troy, then pass through the town, and continue into neighboring towns on the east: Hoosick Road enters Pittstown and continues into Vermont and Brunswick Road enters Grafton and continues into Massachusetts. New York Route 278, Brick Church Road, connects Routes 2 and 7 near the center of the town. New York Route 142, Grange Road, connects Brunswick with Lansingburgh and New York Route 351, Farm to Market Road, connects Brunswick with Poestenkill. Going west, Route 7 becomes Hoosick Street in Troy and eventually becomes a four-lane highway on the Collar City Bridge, intersecting Interstate 787 and ending with a merge onto Interstate 87, giving Brunswick easy access to the local highway system, and subsequently the greater Capital District.

The closest airport is Rensselaer County Airport in Poestenkill, though it is only for small, private planes. The closest commercial airport is Albany International Airport in Colonie. Bus service is not common outside the very western end of the town, which is essentially an extension of the city of Troy. CDTA&#x27;s bus 87 stops at Wal-Mart on Hoosick Road, which is the only scheduled stop within Brunswick.

==Education==
Most of the town sits within the boundaries of Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District, whose main campus is at Clums Corners. Additionally, Averill Park Central School District, the Enlarged City School District of Troy, Lansingburgh Central School District, and a very small portion Wynantskill Union Free School District are also within the town.

Active public school buildings within the town are Tamarac Secondary School and Tamarac Elementary School on Brunswick Road (Brittonkill). George Washington Elementary School on Menemsha Lane (Averill Park) is scheduled to close at the end of the 2009-2010 school year.

With the help of local BOCES, public high school students have the opportunity to attend vo-tech programs, higher-level learning programs, and Tech Valley High School.

The Capital District is known for its many places of higher leaning, giving residents the opportunity to receive a higher level degree after high school. Hudson Valley Community College and the University at Albany are two of the more popular local colleges to attend. Also available are The College of Saint Rose in Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Russell Sage College in Troy, and Union College in Schenectady, just to name a few.

<text>Castleton-on-Hudson is a village located in the southwestern part of the town of Schodack in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 1,473 at the 2010 census. The village is southeast of Albany.

As of 2019, Castleton-On-Hudson was recognized as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation. Its first Chairman of the Board was local resident Mike Martin. 

== History ==
Castleton gets its name from the exploration of the North (Hudson) River by Henry Hudson. While traveling up the river, he came upon a Mahican Indian village noted for a large structure located on a rise above the river. This structure was a storehouse for foodstuffs, but was of such size that it was thought to be a &quot;castle&quot;. Another theory for the derivation of the name &quot;Castleton&quot; comes from Rutherford Hayner&#x27;s &quot;Troy and Rensselaer County New York: A History&quot; (1925). Hayner states &quot;Although the exact location of this landing of Hudson&#x27;s has been more or less conjectural, the weight of opinion places it at or near the present site of the village of Castleton, for on Castle Hill, back of the village, stood the dwelling of the chief of the Mohicans.&quot;

The area of Castleton was settled in 1792. When the small village was incorporated into Rensselaer County on April 13, 1827, there were about 100 people living in the area, mostly along the banks of the river. Between 1890 and 1920, the village had a booming economy, with small industry, a hotel, and a small port to gain access to river traffic. However, a large flood destroyed much of the business district in 1936, and the industry took the opportunity to relocate. These days the town is a very residential suburb, with some light agriculture.

The name of the village was changed from Castleton to Castleton-on-Hudson in 1927.

The &quot;Gazetteer of the State of New York&quot; of 1860 reports that Castleton was formerly known as Morriches Hastie. (JH French, 1860)

The District School No. 3 and Joachim Staats House and Gerrit Staats Ruin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Grafton is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 2,051 at the 2020 census. It is believed that the town received its name from Grafton, Vermont, where the first town supervisor, Nathaniel Dumbleton, was originally from. The town is an interior town near the north-central part of the county. NY Route 2 passes across the town.

Grafton is notable for having a Peace Pagoda, built by Nipponzan Myohoji buddhist order in 1993.

== History ==
The town of Grafton was originally a part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, and at that time was known as Roxborough. The first settlements are not clear from the ca. 1765-1807 map of the manor. As part of Rennesselaerswyck, the first inhabitants were renters of that estate.

The question of the first settlement of Grafton has never been settled. The names of the first European settlers who built new homes in the wilderness and the date of their coming probably will never be known. In all probability, however, the town was the last in Rensselaer County to be settled. Grafton was formed from the towns of Troy and Petersburgh on March 20, 1807, and even at this comparatively late day it had few inhabitants. Abel Owen is generally believed to have been the first man to enter the rather unattractive mountain wilderness and build himself a home. He was sturdy farmer, an indefatigable laborer, and to encourage further settlement the patroon, Stephen Van Rensselaer III, gave him a grant of or more of what was then thought to be the best land in that section adapted to farming. Owen was not long without neighbors, if indeed there were not one or more families located in that vicinity when he built his log house.

There is nothing to show when Mr. Owen moved to Grafton, but from subsequent settlements and other occurrences it is thought that it could not have been very long after the Revolutionary War. Possibly it was several years later, during that war or at its close. Immediately after the period when the colonists were fighting for independence, or beginning with 1784 or 1785, several families leased land in Grafton from the patroon and began the cultivation of the land there. Abel Owen is recorded as a Revolutionary soldier, so the town likely was not settled until the closing years of the war or later. Circa 1786, Owen had at least two neighbors, families names Coon and Demmon being early lessees of the patroon&#x27;s lands. About 1796 Abel Owen sold his farm to Lemuel Steward and moved with his family to Onondaga County.

Nathaniel Dumbleton, who was first elected to the office of supervisor, moved to the town from Grafton, Vermont, and tradition says that through his influence the town received the name which it has since borne. The first town meeting was held soon after the organization, on the first Tuesday of April 1807 at the house of Nathan Hakes.
Two taverns are mentioned by various authorities as the earliest in town. one was located at East Grafton and was built and maintained by Thomas Scriven; the other was located in the western part of the town and was kept by Elijah Terry. The tavern of S. McChesney was opened about the year 1800. The Grafton House was built about 1838 by Stephen Van Rensselaer. It was the most pretentious affair in the town and for many years one of the most prominent taverns in the central part of the county.

About the year 1800 Josiah Litchfield opened a general store at Quackenkill, erecting a saw mill about the same time. S. McChesney, in addition to his tavern, also kept an early store at Quackenkill. Van Rensselaer built a grist mill in 1836 or 1837. These were for many years the principal business enterprises in Grafton.

The first physician to practice in town of whom there is any knowledge was Dr. Rufus S. Waite, a native of Petersburgh, who came to Grafton Center from Brownsville in 1819. He practiced for about forty years and became widely known throughout Rensselaer County. Dr. Amos Allen, also a native of Petersburgh, settled in Grafton in 1846, immediately after his graduation from the Berkshire Medical School. For many years Dr. Allen was the only physician in the town.

When, in pursuance of the school law of 1812–1813, the town voted its first appropriation for the maintenance of the schools at public expense, Jedediah Wellman, Daniel Mills and Thomas West were chosen school commissioners. In the fall of 1813 the town was divided into ten districts, and soon after a common school was maintained in each district. In common with all other towns in the state, the school system was changed from time to time in accordance with legislative enactment. under the system of supervision by town superintendents, Thomas W. potter served in 1844 and 1845, John C. Potter in 1846, Paul K. Davison in 1847 and 1848, Dr. Amos Allen from 1850 to 1853 and Daniel H. Davison from 1854 to 1856.

December 19, 1845, saw a tragedy in Grafton, one of the many taking place in Rensselaer County during the Anti-Rent War, following the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer III. Elijah Smith was shot by an unknown person during one of the numerous struggles which took place between the anti renters and the authorities of the county.

Some of the earlier industries in Grafton are referred to above. Saw mills were among the earliest enterprises, as they were rendered necessary by the presence of an almost unbroken forest over mountain and valley. These mills also sent out large quantities of tan bark, and vast quantities of the wood were reduced to charcoal and sent to nearby markets. As the timber was cleared away the inhabitants began to pay more attention to agriculture, stock raising, and dairying. The manufacture of shirts was begun about 1855 by Caleb W. Scriven, who introduced the first sewing machine in the town. The work was done by his employees at their homes and the product of their toil was sent to New York City. Others who engaged in the business at the early day were the firm of J.H. &amp; A.H. Scriven, Ford &amp; Bennett and their successors. Many families in town found the industry as a profitable one at the time.

The Dickinson Hill Fire Tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==Geography==
The town of Grafton is located north of the center of Rensselaer County. It is bounded on the north by Pittstown and Hoosick, on the east by Petersburgh, on the south by Berlin and Poestenkill and on the west by Brunswick. Like Stephentown, it is rectangular in shape. Its surface contains more small lakes and ponds than any other town in the county, and these are the headwaters of many streams flowing in every direction. The town may be said to be the center of the watershed of Rensselaer County.

Grafton possesses the most uneven surface of any town in the county. It is located within the limits of the Rensselaer Plateau and the principal peaks in the town reach an altitude of 1800 feet above the level of the sea. A small portion of the land only is arable, but the hillsides afford excellent grazing. Nevertheless, many of the inhabitants of Grafton have farms which, by years of constant care and cultivation, have been rendered almost as productive as any within the county.

As already stated, ponds and small streams are very abundant. Cranberry Lake, or Cranberry Pond, in the southern part, is the source of the Quacken Kill, which flows by a devious course to the western limits of the town, affording numerous excellent mill sites. In the northern part of the town are several creeks flowing towards the Hoosick Valley. The ponds of Grafton are noted for the purity and high quality of their water, and some of them on this account were once considered as available sources of supply for Troy&#x27;s drinking water.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.35%) is water.

The town is mostly a highland, continuing the Taconics north, or the Berkshires west. The scenic beauty of the area is seen at the Grafton Lakes State Park, a park with four lakes among gentle mountain scenery.

<text>Hoosick Falls is a village in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 3,501 at the 2010 census. During its peak, in 1900, the village had a population of approximately 7,000.

The village of Hoosick Falls is near the center of the town of Hoosick on NY 22. The village center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Hoosick Falls Historic District. The village has a thriving early-20th century downtown commercial district, and many of the buildings have been restored. Recent commercial additions include a bakery/sandwich shop, a French restaurant, a coffee roastery, an art gallery and bistro, and a barbecue joint with a live music venue.

Painter Grandma Moses is buried in the village. The site of the British entrenchments at the Battle of Bennington, August 6, 1777, is nearby and is maintained as Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site.

== History ==

Although this has been an issue of considerable debate, it&#x27;s believed the first documented settlers came to Hoosick Falls, on the Hoosic River, around 1746. The French drove the settlers out in 1754 and most of the settlement was burned, but they returned and rebuilt after the French &amp; Indian War ended. Hoosick Falls was incorporated as a village in 1827.

===Walter A. Wood Mowing and Reaping Machine Co.===

In 1852, a blacksmith named Walter A. Wood began manufacturing a reaper in Hoosick Falls. By the 1890s, the Walter A. Wood Mowing &amp; Reaping Company was the largest farm machinery manufacturer in the world, taking up 85 acres (340,000 m2) on the west bank of the river. The Wood Company closed in 1924, mainly due to the introduction of John Deere&#x27;s revolutionary self propelled farm equipment. Most of these facilities were used by the Colasta Corporation from the mid 1920s until the late 1950s. This company manufactured radio parts. Later, parts of this site were used as a lumber yard/hardware store. A rash of arson fires in the mid and late 1970s consumed the entire complex. The only buildings still in use today are outside of the main complex, the Interface Solutions Plant (formerly the Wood-Flong Paper Mill), which was Walter A Wood&#x27;s steel foundry. The original Office Building is still present also.

Along with the Walter Wood plant, Hoosick Falls was a boomtown in the 19th century. Many other businesses came to town, creating growth and prosperity. Hoosick Falls once had factories that made paper, small numbers of appliances, glass, and some nominal soda and beer bottling plants. A large number of rich Victorian homes were built during this period and are still there today, most in good shape. Hoosick Falls also served as a regional center of trade and export. Local farmers and manufacturers would come to town to sell their goods and load them on rail cars bound for New York City or abroad. These goods consisted of manufacturers, grain, milk, livestock, construction materials (mostly slate and brick), paper &amp; pulp, timber and beverages.

=== Historic Sites ===

The Estabrook Octagon House, Hoosick Falls Armory, Hoosick Falls Historic District, St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== The arts ==
Hoosick Falls and the region has long been a landing place for artists of various interests. Grandma Moses, the American folk artists who rose to fame after her work was discovered in Thorpe&#x27;s Pharmacy in downtown Hoosick Falls by a passing New York City art dealer, was born close by and is buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery. Jose De Creeft, the Spanish-born artist and sculptor best known for his sculpture of Alice in Wonderland in New York&#x27;s Central Park kept a home in the village and is buried there. Jenny Holzer, the American conceptual artist, has lived just outside of the Village for years. Yucel Erdogan, the NYC artist and photographer, operates the 3rd Eye Gallery in a renovated department store in the downtown commercial district.

=== Murals ===
Hoosick Falls is noted for its murals and outdoors art displays. The downtown hosts two significant murals, one by local artist Roger Weeden, that depicts the Grandma Moses painting, &quot;Wagon Repair Shop&quot;. The second is by regional artist Katie May Erskine, depicting an owl, reflecting the indigenous people&#x27;s name for the location of the village: The Valley of the Owl.

== Industry and manufacturing ==

=== Plastics Industry ===
A local company, Dodge Fibers Corporation, started producing Teflon-based products in 1955. This business was quite successful and later sold to larger companies. However, the industry generated chemical pollution, especially PFOA. Concern developed locally in 2014, and in December 2015, the Village advised residents to use bottled water provided for free by Saint-Gobain, the current owner of the plastics facilities. In 2017, the Village constructed a reverse-osmosis carbon filtration water treatment system, and has since provided PFOA-free water to all residents, The NYSDEC unveiled a proposal on December 3, 2021, to construct two new water wells for the town at an estimated cost of $9.7 million. These wells will be located to the south of the town and connected to the existing water treatment plant.

== PFOA crisis ==
The contamination of Hoosick Falls’ water was originally discovered by resident Michael Hickey following the death of his father from an aggressive kidney cancer, which was diagnosed after his retirement from the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant. Hickey noted the elevated rate of cancer diagnoses and deaths in their village, and began looking into the effects of the chemicals used in local manufacturing plants.

Over the years, several manufacturing plants in the area released waste containing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) into the surrounding environment. PFOA, which belongs to a group of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used to make household and commercial products, has been shown to cause reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and immunological effects in laboratory animals. Much of the focus of investigation and litigation has been on the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics facility, which is located next to the village water treatment plant and began manufacturing with PFOA in 1999.

Hickey tested water samples from his kitchen sink and businesses in the village, and discovered a PFOA level of 540 parts per trillion, exceeding the existing EPA guideline at the time of 400 ppt by 35%. In 2016, the EPA guideline was updated to 70 ppt following updated studies of the effects on animals and exposed human populations, the amounts in Hoosick exceeded this by 671%. As of June 2022, the EPA lowered the advised levels for PFOA to .004 ppt. The levels of PFOA present in Hoosick Falls’ water in 2014 exceeded this level by almost 135,000%.

The Village Board, which had allegedly denied requests from Hickey to test the water, did not issue a warning to the citizens of Hoosick Falls about the water until 16 months after Hickey’s findings. The EPA issued an advisory against drinking or cooking with the public water supply in November 2015. In December 2015, the Village advised residents to use bottled water provided for free by Saint-Gobain, the current owner of the plastics facilities and the party responsible for the pollution mitigation. 

In February 2016 New York State added the Saint-Gobain facility to their Registry of Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites as a Class 2 site. In July 2017, the EPA added the site to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL), which lists priority sites in the United States in need of long-term cleanup efforts.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) is leading the investigation and cleanup of the McCaffrey Street site, with support from the EPA. In June 2016 Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International were deemed “potentially responsible parties” for the contamination, and entered into a consent order with the NYSDEC. As an interim remedial measure to address the contamination, the two companies installed a granulated activated carbon (GAC) filtration system on the public water supply wells to treat the water in 2016. In 2019, they built a groundwater interceptor trench at the McCaffrey Street site to prevent contaminated groundwater from reaching public water wells.

In order to address the contamination to over 800 private wells, the state installed point-of-entry treatment systems (POET), which treat the water entering the building, reducing contaminants for safe drinking.

While the interim remedial measures addressed the immediate concerns of contaminated water, the corporations were also required to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) at the site in order to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and identify and evaluate cleanup alternatives. The NYSDEC reviewed a study submitted by the companies, which proposed five potential long-term water supplies, and opened up the proposal to public comment in the fall of 2019 through email, letters, and two public meetings. On December 3, 2021, the NYSDEC published their decision regarding the long-term water replacement, with two new groundwater supply wells to be developed and existing test wells south of Hoosick Falls to be converted to production wells at an estimated cost of $9.7 million.

In addition to the consent order, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell, with 3M and DuPont Co. later being accused as well. In July 2021 a preliminary settlement of $65.25 million was reached with Saint-Gobain, which provides current and former residents with compensation for potential health impacts due to exposure, compensation for the loss of property value following the addition of the area to the Superfund National Priorities List, compensation to those who had a private well contaminated ($7.7 million, 12% of total), case expenses and attorney fees ($13.4 million, 20% of total), compensation for the ten main plaintiffs that contributed significantly to the case ($250,000, .4% of total), and establishes a 10-year medical monitoring program ($23 million, 35% of total).

Throughout the court proceedings attorneys for Saint-Gobain and Honeywell moved for the case to be dismissed, claiming that “mere accumulation of elevated levels of PFOA in the blood did not constitute physical injury” and that “in the absence of physical damage, 532 Madison, 96 N.Y.2d 280, 727 9 N.Y.S.2d 49, precludes recovery in tort for harm that is exclusively economic, and that because ‘groundwater is not private property,’ plaintiffs could not base property damage claims on ‘alleged injury to groundwater’. Defendants also urged dismissal of all property claims of plaintiffs who rented their homes, on the theory that they lacked ownership interest, and dismissal of all claims of nuisance, on the theory that private nuisance is by definition a tort that threatens one or a few persons, not one that impacts the whole community”. These motions were denied by U.S. District Senior Judge Lawrence E. Kahn, when the defendants appealed, the denials were upheld by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

Following the settlement, Lia T. LoBello, as spokesperson for the company, submitted the following statement:&quot;Saint-Gobain is pleased to have reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the New York class action lawsuit. Since first learning about the issue of PFAS in Hoosick Falls, the company took a leadership position on this issue and we believe this agreement is indicative of that commitment. The health, safety and wellbeing of both our employees and the communities in which we operate are important to us, and we take that responsibility very seriously.&quot;

<text>North Greenbush is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. North Greenbush is located in the western part of the county. The population was 13,292 at the 2020 census.

The town has three main hamlets, Wynantskill in the northeastern corner, Defreestville in the southern portion of the town, and Snyder&#x27;s Lake which occupies the majority of the town&#x27;s eastern end. Each have strong identities and hinder efforts by the town to have a centralized identity. Also hindering a unified town image is that North Greenbush consists of parts of four different school districts, only one of which (a one-room schoolhouse) carries the town&#x27;s name; two fire departments (Wynantskill and Defreestville); and three ZIP Codes (City of Troy, City of Rensselaer, and Wynantskill). North Greenbush is home to the southern part of the Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) campus, including the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium, home to the Tri-City ValleyCats minor league baseball team; the RPI Tech Park; the La Salle Institute; the New York State National Guard Armory, headquarters for the Rainbow Division; and various Rensselaer County government institutions.

== History ==
North Greenbush was part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, and Albany County prior to Rensselaer County&#x27;s creation in 1791. North Greenbush was created on February 23, 1855, from the town of Greenbush at the same time as the town of Clinton (today East Greenbush). At this time, North Greenbush occupied more than what it does today; it also covered what is now the northern section of the city of Rensselaer and the southern section of the city of Troy.

The earliest settlers, in the early 1620s settled in Bath, a part of the town annexed to Rensselaer in 1902. Some settlement in what is today North Greenbush may have taken place in the 17th century as well, but most significant early settlement occurred just prior to the Revolutionary War. Early settlements in the town were at Bath, Wynantskill, and Defreestville. In 1874 Bath became incorporated as a village, and in 1902 it was annexed to Rensselaer. Wynantskill, in the northeastern corner of the town, was first settled around the end of the 18th century with a Dutch Reformed Church established &quot;circa&quot; 1794, and a post office was established in 1820. Defreestville was originally called Blooming Grove until approximately 1830, when it was changed due to confusion with another Blooming Grove, in Orange County, it was named Defreestville for David M. De Freest and family who owned a tavern there. Defreestville and Wynantskill continue to be important hamlets in the town. Snyders Lake would, in the 20th century, also become an important community. Snyders Lake was developed as summer residences and continues to lack a central business district.

During the 20th century, North Greenbush would begin to see more development due to an improved transportation infrastructure which led to increased suburban residential, office, and retail growth based on the automobile. In 1931, the road between Troy and East Greenbush was widened and the right-of-way straightened as US Route 4. The older, narrower, winding residential parts of the road were bypassed and is today&#x27;s Bloomingrove Drive. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, suburban growth along Route 4 would begin to displace farms and local businesses with national chains with an automobile oriented pattern of growth. This suburban growth would be encouraged by the construction of Interstate 90 (I-90) and the Patroon Island Bridge in the 1960s, making North Greenbush an easy commute to Albany. I-90 would not have a direct exit to North Greenbush until 1996 though, when Exit 8 was constructed connecting US 4 and NY Route 43 to the interstate. In the 1970s Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) began developing the RPI Tech Park on Route 4 as a business incubator, today it has over of office space. A connector highway will eventually also go from Exit 8 parallel to US 4 north through the RPI Tech Park and meet US 4 near Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) at the Troy city line.

Not all suburban growth has been well received in the town, however. In the late 1990s, the RPI Tech Park became the focus of regional and statewide push to get a chip fabrication factory (chip fab plant) built. The RPI Tech Park site originally met little opposition from the town. But as time progressed, opposition grew in response to concerns about potential impacts on traffic and the environment. The RPI Tech Park site, which by October 1999 had become one of only nine sites still being marketed by the state, was terminated when the North Greenbush town council voted to terminate the review process. Another instance of NIMBY opposition to development occurred after the construction of I-90&#x27;s Exit 8 when that location became well-primed for commercial development. Local developer Frank Nigro, with Nigro Company, proposed a high-end shopping center for the northeastern corner of the intersection of routes 4 and 43. This led to lawsuits and a failed push by residents of Defreestville to incorporate as a village in order to stop the development; and a counter-move by the developer and certain landowners to attempt annexation to the neighboring city of Rensselaer where the development would be better received.

The Defreest Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.74%) is water. The western section of the town is steeply sloped and cut by various ravines; the clay bluffs rise between 100 and above the river with little to no flood plain. The central and eastern parts consist of more gently rolling hills and valleys. The Hudson River is the river of the town, though it is inaccessible to the public at this time; the Wynants Kill in the northeastern section is a creek of some respectable size. Snyder&#x27;s Lake near the eastern border is the largest lake in the town and is accessible to the public.

The west town line is marked by the Hudson River with Albany County on the opposite shore. The city of Albany shares a brief common border with the town, the rest of the western boundary in the Hudson River is shared with the village of Menands within the town of Colonie. To the north is Troy and the town of Brunswick with the towns of Poestenkill and Sand Lake to the east. Most of the southern border is shared with East Greenbush, while the city of Rensselaer&#x27;s northern section is partially surrounded by North Greenbush in the town&#x27;s southwestern corner.

<text>Rensselaer is a city in Rensselaer County, New York, United States, and is located on the east side of the Hudson River, opposite Albany and on the western border of Rensselaer County. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 9,210. 

The area now known as the City of Rensselaer was settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, who called it t&#x27;Greyn Bos, which became Greenbush in English. Rensselaer was an early center of the U.S. dye industry in the United States and home to the country&#x27;s first aspirin factory. The city became a railroad hub in the 19th century; in 2020, Albany-Rensselaer was the ninth-busiest Amtrak station in the country and the second-busiest in New York State. 

== History ==
===Early settlement and growth===
The natives of the area called it Petuquapoern and Juscum catick, and the Dutch claimed the land in 1609 based on Henry Hudson&#x27;s exploration of the Hudson River on board the Dutch ship, Halve Maen. Later the area was called &quot;De Laet&#x27;s Burg&quot; in honor of one of the directors of the Dutch West India Co. Settlement occurred at least as early as 1628. By 1642, there was a brewery and many farms, also a ferry was established by Hendrick Albertsen running from the mouth of Beaver Creek in Beverwyck (Albany) to the future Rensselaer. Greenbush (originally t&#x27;Greyn Bos in Dutch) was the earliest settlement from Dutch times. The hamlet of East Albany was part of the village of Greenbush. The second hamlet that was incorporated was Bath (also Bath-on-Hudson), which was laid out in 1795 and incorporated as a village prior to 1874.
The Van Rensselaer family, who were the feudal landholders of the entire future Rensselaer County, built a residence in the future city of Rensselaer. This property was inherited by Hendrick van Rensselaer, Kiliaen van Rensselaer&#x27;s grandson, who built Fort Crailo in approximately 1712. It was built on the site of where Dominie Megapolensis built his own house in 1642. Crailo was expanded in 1762–1768. At various times, the grounds were used as a campground for British and colonial troops. It is reportedly the place where, in 1755, British Army surgeon Richard Shuckburgh, quartered in the home, wrote the ditty &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; to mock the colonial troops who fought with the British in the French and Indian Wars. Fort Crailo was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

The hamlet of Greenbush was a tract of land about one square mile in size, and is that portion of the city between Partition and Mill Street. This was purchased in May 1810 by William Akin, Titus Goodman and John Dickinson from Stephen Van Rensselaer and Stephen N. Bayard, assignees of John J. Van Rensselaer. The village was later incorporated in 1815. A new charter was granted in 1828, which was amended in 1854, and again in 1863, and a new charter in 1871. In 1897, Greenbush was chartered as a city, and its name was changed to Rensselaer. Its limits were extended in 1902 by the annexation of the village of Bath and the western part of the town of East Greenbush.

===Industrialization and modernization===
In the 19th century, Rensselaer became the site of the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad&#x27;s (B&amp;A) passenger depot, shops, freight houses, roundhouse, and coach yard. It was the site of transfers between trains of the New York Central Railroad and the B&amp;A. A ferry transported people to and from the Van Rensselaer Island and downtown Albany at Maiden Lane. In 1871, the Maiden Lane Bridge was built replacing the ferry. In 1903, the channel that separated the island from the mainland was filled in with sand dredged from the bottom of the Hudson River. When the NY Central and the B&amp;A merged in 1900 the island&#x27;s activities became less important, though a new roundhouse and coach yard was built even as many buildings were demolished.
In 1881, the Hudson Riverfront Art Park in Rensselaer was the site of the first recorded major league Grand Slam in baseball history.
In 1882, the Hudson River Aniline and Color Works built their first plant in Rensselaer (building 61), however it burned 13 years later. In 1895, Building 61 was rebuilt and at the same time Building 71 was built as well. It was acquired by the Bayer Corporation in 1903, which then built one of the largest and most up-to-date factories of its time in the US and the Rensselaer plant became the American home for the production of brand-name Aspirin. The US government seized the property in 1917 during World War I as enemy property, Bayer being a German company. It would later be owned by the General Aniline and Film Company, and then BASF. In 1927, it was the first plant to produce solid diazo salts in the United States. The plant went through 12 separate owners or subsidiaries in its lifetime, in the 1990s it was the oldest dye plant in continuous operation and also produced more dye than any other plant in the United States. According to a promotional brochure issued around 1993 by the BASF Corporation the Rensselaer plant was the largest North American dyestuffs production facility. The plant was shut down for good on December 28, 2000.

In 1932, next to the BASF plant, the Port of Albany-Rensselaer was built, mostly in neighboring Albany, but also with in the southern part of Rensselaer. The docks on the Rensselaer side were built in the 1970s.

The 1960s were a major time of change for the city of Rensselaer. In 1967 the current Dunn Memorial Bridge was built between Albany and Rensselaer. Though the bridge was to continue east through Rensselaer, with the South Mall Arterial connecting with Interstate 90 at Exit 8, this extension never materialized. In 1968, the Amtrak station in Albany (Union Station) was relocated to Rensselaer; the Maiden Lane Bridge and all the railroad associated buildings were demolished when in 1969 the Rensselaer City School high/middle school campus was built north of Quackenderry Creek.

In the 2000s, another wave of development has been occurring in Rensselaer. In 2007, U.W. Marx Construction built a brand new campus for the Rensselaer City School District in the Northern section of the city in exchange for waterfront property that the Rensselaer Middle High School had occupied. The new school replaced the Rensselaer Middle High School and Van Rensselaer Elementary, formerly Van Rensselaer High. Doane Stuart occupies the former elementary school. The redevelopment of the waterfront property is named DeLaet&#x27;s Landing in honor of Johan de Laet. The first $20 million, 96 unit apartment building opened in 2019. Construction began on a second luxury apartment building on the site in September 2021. The former Van Rensselaer High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

In January 2023, final approvals were issued to advance the Barnet Mills Apartments redevelopment at the former site of Hilton Center. The project is an undertaking by BBL Construction to revitalize the property along the Hudson River that sits adjacent to the city boat launch and park. It was once home to Barnet Mills, producing wool products for many years. The buildings were last occupied for various artists and specialty businesses.

The City is also currently planning for the construction of a riverfront trail system that spans from the City&#x27;s Boat Launch to the Hudson Riverfront Art Park over more than a mile of riverfront properties. The grant-funded trail will have multi-modal connections to the Livingston Avenue Bridge, which is a reconstruction project valued at over $400 million that has received state and federal funds.

==Library==

The Rensselaer Public Library is a member of the Upper Hudson Library System, a resource-sharing consortium consisting of twenty-nine public libraries in the counties of Albany and Rensselaer. In 2009, the library moved from Broadway to its current location on East Street.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9.61%) is water. The city is flat along the western and southern areas but the center and northern areas slope steeply to the east.

The city lies next to the Hudson River with Albany County and the city of Albany on the opposite shore. The town of North Greenbush borders the city to the north, and the town of East Greenbush is on the southern border; both towns border the city on the east, with the dividing line between the two towns meeting Rensselaer in the middle section of the city&#x27;s eastern boundary. Rensselaer&#x27;s southern border is even with the city of Albany&#x27;s southern border; however, the northern border of Rensselaer is slightly south of Albany&#x27;s corresponding northern border.

==Transportation==
===Roads===

Interstate 90 (I-90), a trans-continental Interstate Highway running from Seattle to Boston, is the most prominent highway serving Rensselaer, passing across the northern fringe of the city. I-90 crosses the Hudson River on the Patroon Island Bridge, providing a local connection to Albany. Other prominent highways serving the city include U.S. Route 9 and U.S. Route 20.

===Rail===
The Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak station is the primary passenger rail station for the Rensselaer, Albany and Troy area. Six &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains run from Albany-Rensselaer to New York City on weekday mornings and several depart for New York in the evening, returning and terminating at Albany-Rensselaer in the afternoon and late evening. The &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;, a train supported by Vermont and New York, runs north from New York City through Rensselaer to Rutland, Vermont. The &quot;Adirondack&quot; runs from New York City through Rensselaer to Montreal. Two &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains run through Rensselaer to Buffalo and Niagara Falls. The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; runs from New York City through Rensselaer to Buffalo and Toronto.

 it was Amtrak&#x27;s ninth-busiest station, as well as the busiest to serve a metro area with a population smaller than 2 million– a distinction it has held since at least 2010. This is primarily due to the large number of passengers who commute to and from New York City. The station is the second busiest in New York State behind Pennsylvania Station (New York City).

One section of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; long-distance train originates in New York City and one section originates in Boston. The two sections are joined at Albany-Rensselaer and travel on to Chicago as a single train. The eastbound &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; reverses the process at Albany-Rensselaer and splits into two trains for onward travel.
==Electric power facilities==
===Independent system operator===
Although not technically located within the bounds of the city, the New York Independent System Operator&#x27;s (NYISO) headquarters shares the same zip code. The NYISO, formerly the New York Power Pool, operates and balances energy flows on the state&#x27;s electric transmission system, administers the electric wholesale market in New York, and develops wholesale market policy with the assistance of stakeholders.

===Empire Generating Co===

Pursuant to Article X of the Public Service Law, BesiCorp-Empire Development Company LLC. (now operating as Empire Generating Co, LLC) was granted a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need for a 505-megawatt (MW) combined cycle cogeneration plant in 2004. After additional filings, the project became a 670-MW (nameplate) combined cycle natural gas powered plant that went into service in September 2010. There are two combustion turbines whose exhaust creates steam to drive a steam turbine. All of the turbines are manufactured by General Electric. It uses an air-cooled condenser to reduce water draw. It is located on an 88-acre former industrial area that was owned by BASF Corporation between Riverside Avenue and the Hudson River on the west, and the Port Access Highway on the east and south. In 2017, it injected 2,357 GWh of electric energy into the electric transmission system. This is equivalent to operating at full capacity for approximately 40.9% of the year. For comparison, the capital region consumed 11,823 GWh of electric energy in 2017. Its power is sold into the electric wholesale market administered by the NYISO.

A greenway/bikeway path was included in the final plan and was built near the plant. A decommission fund was established in the original order in the amount of $7 million at start of commercial operation. The company argued for a reduction in 2013 based upon overlooked metal salvage values, but the reduction was not granted, nor was an increase in the security amount a month later. In 2017, a 26-ton fan from the air cooled condenser fell on a worker and killed him during routine maintenance. In its 2018-2019 adopted budget, the City of Rensselaer notes a revenue of about $1.1 million from payments in lieu of taxes most of which can be assumed to come from Empire Genering LLC. For comparison, the City of Rensselaer notes a total budget of about $15 million for 2018–2019.

==Government==

Rensselaer has a mayor-council form of government. The mayor, who is elected every four years, heads the executive branch of city government.

Michael E. Stammel won the mayoral election in November 2019, defeating incumbent Richard Mooney. He was re-elected to a four-year term as mayor on November 2, 2021, after a re-challenge by Richard Mooney.

Rensselaer is in the 20th Congressional district, represented by Paul Tonko (D) in the United States House of Representatives. The city is represented by Chuck Schumer (D) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D) in the United States Senate. On the state level, the city is in the 44th district in the New York Senate, represented by Neil Breslin (D). In the New York Assembly, Rensselaer is in the 108th district, represented by John T. McDonald III (D).

<text>Sand Lake is a town in south-central part of Rensselaer County, New York, United States. Sand Lake is about 13 miles east of Albany, New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,348. Within the town are four hamlets: West Sand Lake, Averill Park, Glass Lake and the hamlet of Sand Lake. Its four lakes are a source of recreation. Many commercial enterprises of the 19th century and into the 20th century relied on power generated from the Wynants Kill Creek and Burden Lake mills. The area is known for its fertile soil for grazing and agriculture.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Sand Lake was first home to Native Americans. In 1629, Kiliaen van Rensselaer acquired a 700,000-acre land grant to establish a Dutch colony, encompassing what later became Sand Lake. Called the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, it was 48 miles across and 24 miles long. In 1664, it became a colony of England and was called the Province of New York. It flipped back to the Dutch in 1672, and returned to the English in 1674.

In the 1750s, Dutch settlers moved into what is now Sand Lake, followed by German pioneers. By 1772, present day Sand Lake was in the Rensselaerwyck District of Albany County. It was held by the English until the Revolutionary War (1775–1783). In 1792, when the town of Rensselaerwyck was divided into two towns, Greenbush and Stephentown. Present day Sand Lake extended into both towns.

In 1805, the Union Meetinghouse was built for worship by Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians. It was the town&#x27;s oldest public building and was a station on the Underground Railroad.

=== Town of Sand Lake ===
The town of Sand Lake was formed from Greenbush and Berlin from an act of the legislature on March 21, 1812, and it was officially made a town on March 1, 1813. Municipal positions were established to be responsible to its citizens, including town clerk, assessors, and more. Calvin Thompson became the first Supervisor. The first postmaster, in 1815, was Daniel M. Gregory. The soil, especially on the eastern lowlands, is fertile for grazing and agriculture, particularly small fruit, strawberries, and other berrys.

A new church building was established for the Trinity Lutheran Church in 1816. The Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church opened in 1816 at the West Sand Lake site. There were a number of changes in the churches and its membership around the 1830s. The present town borders were established on March 2, 1848, when the town of Sand Lake was divided into towns, Sand Lake and Poestenkill. The town was governed by a supervisor, town clerk and four justices of the peace. Town business was conducted in homes and inns for decades.


There were a number of public and private schools established between 1825 and the early 20th century. A one-room schoolhouse operated in Sand Lake from 1895 until 1929.

In 1866, the Wynantskill Improvement Association created three Burden Lakes from Wynantskill Creek. The lake water turned the Burden water wheel that powered commercial enterprises, like mills, of the Industrial Revolution.

The Troy and New England Railway provided electric trolley service into Sand Lake from 1895 to 1925. The nine-mile route ran from Albia (of Troy) east to Averill Park. The town&#x27;s economy grew with tourism and people who became residents during the summer.

Municipal Home Rule Law was enacted in 1964 by the State Legislature, which gave towns greater powers. In 1968, Rensselaer County revised its form of government, replacing the Board of Supervisors with a County Executive and a County Legislature. In 1972, a town hall was established in the former Presbyterian Church.

The Albert R. Fox House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

==Electric power facilities==
===Stephentown Spindle===
Pursuant to Section 68 of the Public Service Law, Stephentown Regulating Services LLC (SRS) (now operating as Stephentown Spindle LLC (SS)) was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for a 20-megawatt (MW) flywheel-based energy storage facility in 2009. It went in-service in 2010. There are 200 flywheels set within 20 pods on 5-acres that spin at high rates of speed (8,000 rpm to 16,000 rpm) storing energy as rotational energy. Each flywheel weighs 5 tons. The flywheels are energized by and discharge their energy into the New York State transmission system.

The project was initially financed in 2010 with a $43 million loan from the federal Department of Energy, however, this amount was reduced to $25 million in 2012 when SS acquired the SRS assets. The company does not sell energy into the NYISO&#x27;s electric wholesale market or capacity market, however, it does receive revenue from the ancillary services market for providing frequency regulation service. The stakeholder-driven policy at the NYISO excludes the facility from providing power into the NYISO&#x27;s wholesale electric and capacity markets because it does not meet minimum criteria - a minimum of 5 minutes or 1 hour - for sustained energy delivery. The regulation service market in the NYISO provides revenue via two streams, a main regulation capacity price ($/MWh over a five-minute interval in the real-time market) based on a day-ahead and real-time market price, and a movement (performance) award ($/MW). For example, if the facility were able to provide its 20 MW output for 12 hours of the day at an average regulation price of $11 per MWh the facility would receive $963,600 a year. Revenue received from the performance fee, which averaged about $2.30 per MW in Q2 of 2018, is a much smaller proportion of annual revenue.

It is the first commercial flywheel project in the United States to provide frequency regulation service. The only other comparable utility-scale energy storage facilities in New York are NYPA&#x27;s 1,100 MW pumped storage facility at Blenheim-Gilboa and NYPA&#x27;s 240 MW Lewiston pumped storage facility at Niagara Falls. For a power comparison, the capital region&#x27;s peak summer demand was 2,032 MW in 2017.

<text>Troy is the county seat of Rensselaer County, New York, United States. It is located on the western edge of the county, on the eastern bank of the Hudson River just northeast of the capital city of Albany. At the 2020 census, the population of Troy was 51,401. Troy has close ties to Albany and nearby Schenectady, forming a region called the Capital District, which has a population of 1.24 million. 

The area long had been occupied by the Mohican Indian tribe, but Dutch settlement began in the mid-17th century. The Dutch colony was conquered by the English in 1664, renamed Troy in 1789 and was incorporated as a town in 1791. Due to the confluence of major waterways and a geography that supported water power, the American Industrial Revolution took hold in this area, making Troy reputedly the fourth-wealthiest city in America around the turn of the 20th century. As a result, Troy is noted for its Victorian architecture. Troy is home to a number of institutions of higher learning, including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Hudson Valley Community College and Russell Sage College.

== History ==
=== 1500 to 1700: the Mohican and the Skiwia Native Americans ===

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Mohican Indians had a number of settlements along the Hudson River near its confluence with the Mohawk River. The land comprising the Poesten Kill and Wynants Kill areas -- &quot;kill&quot; being the Dutch word for &quot;creek&quot; or small stream—were owned by two Mohican groups. The land around the Poesten Kill was owned by Skiwias and was called Panhooseck. The area around the Wynants Kill, known as Paanpack, was owned by Peyhaunet. The land between the creeks, which makes up most of today&#x27;s downtown and South Troy neighborhood along the Hudson River, was owned by Annape. South of the Wynants Kill and into present-day Town of North Greenbush, the land was owned by Pachquolapiet. These parcels of land were sold to the Dutch between 1630 and 1657, and each purchase was overseen and signed by Skiwias, the &quot;sachem&quot;—the political leader of the indigenous people—at the time. In total, more than 75 individual Mohicans were involved in deed signings in the 17th Century.

=== 1700: The Dutch and the British ===
The site of the city was a part of Rensselaerswyck, a patroonship created by Kiliaen van Rensselaer. Dirck Van der Heyden was one of the first settlers. In 1707, he purchased a farm of , which in 1787 was laid out as a village.

=== The 1800s: Canals, shipping, early industrialization ===
The name Troy, after the legendary Greek city of Troy made famous in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; was adopted in 1789, before which the tiny community had been known as Ashley&#x27;s Ferry. The area was formed into the Town of Troy in 1791 from part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. The township included today&#x27;s towns of Brunswick and Grafton. Troy became a village in 1801 then was chartered as a city in 1816. In the post–Revolutionary War years, as Central New York was first settled, a strong trend to classical names existed, and Troy&#x27;s naming fits the same pattern as the New York cities of Syracuse, Rome, Utica, Ithaca, and the towns of Sempronius and Manlius, and dozens of other similarly named towns to the west of Troy. Troy&#x27;s Latin motto is &quot;Ilium fuit, Troja est&quot;, which means &quot;Ilium was, Troy is&quot;.

Northern and Western New York was a theater of the War of 1812, and militia and regular army forces were led by Stephen Van Rensselaer of Troy. Quartermaster supplies were shipped through Troy. A local butcher and meatpacker named Samuel Wilson supplied the military, and according to local lore, stamped the meat barrels &quot;U.S.&quot; which alternately was interpreted as &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; meaning Wilson. Troy has since claimed to be the historical home of Uncle Sam, who is buried in the historic Oakwood Cemetery located on the northern outskirts of the city and the burial site of numerous local luminaries. The iconic Uncle Sam caricature was created by political newspaper cartoonist Thomas Nast.

On December 23, 1823, &quot;The Troy Sentinel&quot; newspaper was the first publisher of the world-famous Christmas poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; (also known as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; or Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;). The poem was published anonymously. Its author has long been believed to have been Clement Clarke Moore, but now is regarded by some as having been Henry Livingston Jr.

Scientific and technical proficiency was supported by the presence of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), one of the highest-ranked engineering schools in the country. RPI originally was sponsored by Stephen Van Rensselaer, one of the most prominent members of that family of Dutch colonial origins. RPI was founded in 1824, and eventually absorbed the campus of the short-lived liberal arts-based Troy University, which closed in 1862 during the Civil War. Rensselaer founded RPI for the &quot;application of science to the common purposes of life,&quot; and it is the oldest technological university in the English-speaking world. The institute is known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace.

====Financial success and flaming destruction====

Through much of the 19th and into the early 20th centuries, Troy was one of the most prosperous cities in the United States. Prior to its rise as an industrial center, it was the transshipment point for meat and vegetables from Vermont and New York, which were sent by the Hudson River to New York City. The trade was vastly increased after the construction of the Erie Canal, with its eastern terminus directly across the Hudson River from Troy at Cohoes in 1825. Another artery constructed was the Champlain Canal. In 1916, Troy Federal Lock opened as one of the first modern locks along the present-day canal system.

Troy has nearly been destroyed by fire three times. What was known as the Great Troy Fire of 1862 burned down the W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Company factory, which later that year was replaced by the new W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Building, now a National Historic Landmark: Gurley &amp; Sons remains a worldwide leader in precision instrumentation to this day.

Troy&#x27;s one-time great wealth was produced in the steel industry, with the first American Bessemer converter erected on the Wynantskill Creek, a stream with falls in a small valley at the south end of the city. The industry first used charcoal and iron ore from the nearby Adirondack Mountains. Later, ore and coal from the Midwest were shipped via the Erie Canal to Troy and were processed before being sent down the Hudson River to New York City. The iron and steel also were used by the extensive federal arsenal located—as it is today—across the Hudson at Watervliet, a community then called West Troy. After the Civil War, the steel production industry moved west to be closer to raw materials. The presence of iron and steel also made it possible for Troy to be an early site in the development of iron storefronts and steel structural supports in architecture, and some significant early examples remain in the city.

====Pioneering in the world of sports====

Troy was an early home of professional baseball and was the host of two major league teams. The first team to call Troy home was the Troy Haymakers, a National Association team operating in 1871–72. One of its major players was Williams H. Craver, a Civil War veteran who was a noted catcher and also managed the team. Its last manager was Jimmy Wood, recognized as the first Canadian to play professional baseball. The Troy Haymakers team folded, and the city subsequently had no team for seven seasons. Then, from 1879 to 1882, Troy rebounded as home to the National League&#x27;s Troy Trojans. They not only were competitive in the league, they fielded a young Dan Brouthers who went on to become baseball&#x27;s first great slugger.

Today&#x27;s sports scene is quite different.The Tri-City ValleyCats, a minor league professional baseball team, calls the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium at Hudson Valley Community College home. The RPI Engineers are an NCAA Division III sports participant except in ice hockey where it plays at the Division I level and won various championships including the national title in 1954 and 1985.

The Hudson Valley CC Vikings participate in Region III of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and in the Mountain Valley Athletic Conference. Russell Sage College&#x27;s Gators compete at the NCAA Division III level in numerous sports and in, among various conferences, the Empire 8 Conference.

====Politics, commerce and growth abound====

In 1892, poll watcher Robert Ross was shot dead and his brother was wounded by operatives of Mayor Edward Murphy, later a U.S. senator, after uncovering a man committing voter fraud. The convicted murderer, Bartholomew &quot;Bat&quot; Shea, was executed in 1896, although another man, John McGough, later admitted he had been the shooter.

The initial emphasis on heavier industry later spawned a wide variety of highly engineered mechanical and scientific equipment. Troy was the home of W. &amp; L. E. Gurley, Co., makers of precision instruments. Gurley&#x27;s theodolites were used to survey much of the American West after the Civil War and were highly regarded until laser and digital technology eclipsed the telescope and compass technology in the 1970s. Bells manufactured by Troy&#x27;s Meneely Bell Company ring all over the world. Troy also was home to a manufacturer of racing shells that used impregnated paper in a process that presaged the later use of fiberglass, Kevlar, and carbon-fiber composites.

In 1900, Troy annexed Lansingburgh, a former town and village whose standing dates back prior to the War of Independence, in Rensselaer County. Lansingburgh is thus often referred to as &quot;North Troy.&quot; However, prior to the annexation that portion of Troy north of Division Street was called North Troy and the neighborhood south of Washington Park was referred to as South Troy. To avoid confusion with streets in Troy following the annexation, Lansingburgh&#x27;s numbered streets were renamed: its 1st Street, 2nd Street, 3rd Street, etc., became North Troy&#x27;s 101st Street, 102nd Street, 103rd Street, etc. Lansingburgh was home to the Lansingburgh Academy.

In the early 1900s, the New York Central Railroad was formed from earlier railroads and established its &quot;Water Level Route&quot; from New York City to Chicago, via Albany. A Beaux-Arts station was constructed . A short New York Central branch from Rensselaer connected at Troy. Also serving the station was the Boston and Maine Railroad to/from Boston and the Delaware and Hudson Railroad to/from Canada. The railroads quickly made obsolete the 1800s-constructed canals along the Mohawk. The former NYC operates today as CSX for freight service and Amtrak for passenger service, the latter operating from Albany–Rensselaer station, directly opposite downtown Albany on the east side of the Hudson River. The end of rail passenger service to Troy occurred when the Boston and Maine dropped its Boston–Troy run in January 1958. The Troy Union Station was demolished in 1958.

In addition to the strong presence of the early American steel industry, Troy also was a manufacturing center for shirts, shirtwaists, detachable collars and cuffs. In 1825, local resident Hannah Lord Montague was tired of cleaning her blacksmith-husband&#x27;s shirts. She cut off the collars of his shirts since only the collar was soiled, bound the edges and attached strings to hold the false collars in place. This also allowed the collars and cuffs to be starched separately. Montague&#x27;s idea caught on and changed the fashion for American men&#x27;s dress for a century. Her patented collars and cuffs first were manufactured by Maullin &amp; Blanchard, which eventually was absorbed by Cluett, Peabody &amp; Company. Cluett&#x27;s Arrow brand shirts still are worn by men across the country. The large labor force required by the shirt manufacturing industry also produced in 1864 the nation&#x27;s first female labor union, the Collar Laundry Union, founded in Troy by Kate Mullany. On February 23, 1864, 300 members of the union went on strike. After six days, the laundry owners gave in to their demands and raised wages 25%. Further developments arose in the industry when, in 1933, Sanford Cluett invented a process he called Sanforization, a process that shrinks cotton fabrics thoroughly and permanently. Cluett, Peabody&#x27;s last main plant in Troy, was closed in the 1980s, but the industrial output of the plant had long been transferred to facilities in the South.

In 1906, the city supplied itself with water from a 33-inch riveted-steel main from the Tomhannock Reservoir. A 30-inch cast-iron main was added in 1914. In 2023, the city completed the first phase of installation of two 36-inch pipes totaling approximately 8 miles between the reservoir and the city&#x27;s Water Treatment Plant as part of a multi-year project to fully replace the existing century-old transmission line. The project began in 2021. 

When the iron and steel industry moved westward to Pennsylvania around Pittsburgh to be closer to iron ore from Lake Erie and nearby coal and coke needed for the Bessemer process, and with a similar downturn in the collar industry, Troy&#x27;s prosperity began to fade. After the passage of Prohibition, and given the strict control of Albany by the O&#x27;Connell political machine, Troy became a way station for an illegal alcohol trade from Canada to New York City. Likewise, the stricter control of morality laws in the neighboring New England states encouraged the development of openly operating speakeasies and brothels in Troy. Gangsters such as &quot;Legs Diamond&quot; conducted their business in Troy, giving the city a somewhat colorful reputation through World War II. A few of the buildings from that era have since been converted into restaurants, such as the former Old Daly Inn.

Kurt Vonnegut lived in Troy and the area, and many of his novels include mentions of &quot;Ilium&quot; (an alternate name for Troy) or surrounding locations. Vonnegut wrote &quot;Player Piano&quot; in 1952, based on his experiences working as a public relations writer at nearby General Electric. His 1963 novel, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, was written in the city and is set in Ilium. His recurring main character, Kilgore Trout, is a resident of Cohoes, just across the Hudson River from Troy.

=== 2000 to today ===
Like many old industrial cities, Troy has had to deal with the loss of its manufacturing base, loss of population and wealth to the suburbs, and to other parts of the country. This led to dilapidation and disinvestment until later efforts were made to preserve Troy&#x27;s architectural and cultural past.

, Troy is updating its citywide comprehensive plan for the first time in more than 50 years. The two-year process is known as &quot;Realize Troy&quot; and was initiated by the Troy Redevelopment Foundation (with members from the Emma Willard School, RPI, Russell Sage College, and St. Peter&#x27;s Health Partners). Urban Strategies Inc. (Toronto) is planning Troy&#x27;s redevelopment.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (5.44%) is covered by water.

Troy is located several miles north of Albany near the junction of the Erie and Champlain canals, via the Hudson River, and is the terminus of the New York Barge Canal. It is the distributing center for a large area.

The city is on the central part of the western border of Rensselaer County. The Hudson River makes up the western border of the city and the county&#x27;s border with Albany County. The city borders within Rensselaer County, Schaghticoke to the north, Brunswick to the east, and North Greenbush to the south; to the west, the city borders the Albany County town of Colonie, the villages of Menands and Green Island, and the cities of Watervliet and Cohoes. To the northwest, Troy borders the Saratoga County village of Waterford within the town of Waterford.

The western edge of the city is flat along the river, and then steeply slopes to higher terrain to the east. The average elevation is 50 feet, with the highest elevation being 500 feet in the eastern part of the city. The city is longer than it is wide, with the southern part wider than the northern section of the city (the formerly separate city of Lansingburgh). Several kills (Dutch for creek) pass through Troy and empty into the Hudson. The Poesten Kill and Wynants Kill are the two largest, and both have several small lakes and waterfalls along their routes in the city. Several lakes and reservoirs are within the city, including Ida Lake, Burden Pond, Lansingburgh Reservoir, Bradley Lake, Smarts Pond, and Wright Lake.

=== Climate ===
Troy has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). The average temperature throughout the year is , with the highest average temperature in July being , and January being the coldest month with an average temperature of . The annual precipitation is .

The highest temperature in New York State was recorded in Troy on July 22, 1926, when it reached 108 °F (42.2 °C).

=== Religion ===
The city is also home to numerous churches (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant), three synagogues, and one mosque.

== Economy ==

Troy is known as the &quot;Collar City&quot; due to its history in shirt, collar, and other textile production. Until the early 1990s, Troy was home to several textile manufacturers, including Cluett, Peabody, a subsidiary of the nation&#x27;s largest publicly held textile manufacturer West Point-Pepperell Inc. The detachable collar was first established in Troy in 1820 by a Mrs. Montague. Her husband was a prominent blacksmith who complained to his wife that after coming home from work he had no clean white shirts for the next day. Mrs. Montague solved this problem by cutting collars off of her husbands shirts, and reattaching clean ones for him to wear when needed. This created the important industry of detachable collars and shirts in Troy. It also created the need for buttons, as a detachable collar often left gaps between the shirt and the collar, and buttons were used to snap collars in place. Other types of apparel invented in this time were Bishop collars, which were an upright modification of the turn-down collar, dickeys, detached shirt bosoms, and separate cuffs. This industry also gave rise to the laundry industry, when the first laundry store Troy Laundry was opened at 66 North Second St (Fifth Avenue today), and later on, the laundry industry in Troy would spark the creation of the first female union in the country. For close to a hundred years, Cluett, Peabody &amp; Company was the largest industry in town, with a variety of products including detachable collars, arrow shirts, and other apparel. Around the early 20th century, Troy was responsible for making 90% of the collars worn in America. This was also the birthplace of the &quot;white collar&quot; social class, which was a more upscale working class community and the &quot;blue collar&quot; social class, which consisted of mostly factory workers. The industry had mostly died out by the 1960s, when most business had either gone out of business or moved south for cheaper land and labor costs.
At one point, Troy was also the second-largest producer of iron in the country, surpassed only by the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Troy, like many older industrial cities, has been battered by industrial decline and the migration of jobs to the suburbs. Nevertheless, the presence of RPI is helping Troy develop a small high-technology sector, particularly in video game development. The downtown core also has a smattering of advertising and architecture firms, and other creative businesses attracted by the area&#x27;s distinctive architecture. Uncle Sam Atrium is an enclosed urban shopping mall, office space, and parking garage in downtown Troy. RPI is the city&#x27;s largest private employer.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Architecture ===

Troy is home to Victorian and Belle Époque architecture.

The Hudson and Mohawk Rivers play their part, as does the Erie Canal and its lesser tributary canal systems, and later the railroads that linked Troy to the rest of the Empire State, New York City to the south, and Utica, New York, Syracuse, New York, Rochester, New York, Buffalo, New York, and the myriad of emergent Great Lakes&#x27; cities in the burgeoning United States.
=== Notable buildings ===
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
* The Emma Willard School for Girls aka Emma Willard School
* The Hart-Cluett Mansion
* Paine Mansion
* Russell Sage College
* Troy Public Library
* Hudson Valley Community College

Natives of Troy expressed their passion for building, using the following materials, for an array of building features:
* Iron: cast and structural iron works (facades, gates, railings, banisters, stairwells, rooftop crenellation, window grilles, etc.)
* Stone: carved hard and soft stone foundations, facades and decorative elements
* Glass: as well as in the vast array of ornate stained and etched glass works;
* Wood: fine wood work in found in many of Troy&#x27;s buildings.

Tiffany and La Farge created magnificent stained-glass windows, transoms and other decorative stained-glass treatments for their customers in Troy. With many examples of intact 19th-century architecture, particularly in its Central Troy Historic District, this has helped to lure several major movies to film in Troy, including &quot;Ironweed&quot;, &quot;The Age of Innocence (filmed partially in the Paine mansion)&quot;, &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, &quot;The Bostonians&quot;, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Club&quot;, and &quot;The Time Machine.&quot; In addition, the television series &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; filmed in Troy. There are many buildings in a state of disrepair, but community groups and investors are restoring many of them.

Troy&#x27;s downtown historic landmarks include Frear&#x27;s Troy Cash Bazaar, constructed on a steel infrastructure clad in ornately carved white marble; the Corinthian Courthouse constructed of gray granite; the Troy Public Library, built in an elaborate Venetian palazzo style with high-relief carved white marble; the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, designed in the Second Empire style, with a recital hall with highly regarded acoustic properties. There is a rich collection of Colonial, Federal, Italianate, Second Empire, Greek Revival, Egyptian Revival, Gothic Revival and other Romantic period townhouses surrounding the immediate downtown. The Hart-Cluett Mansion displays a Federal facade executed in white marble, quarried in Tuckahoe, New York. Often with foundations of rusticated granite block. Medina sandstone, a deep mud-red color, from Medina, New York, was also used.

As with many American cities, several city blocks in downtown Troy were razed during the 1970s as a part of an attempted urban renewal plan, which was never successfully executed, leaving still vacant areas in the vicinity of Federal Street. Today, however, there have since been much more successful efforts to save the remaining historic downtown structures.

Part of this effort has been the arrival of the &quot;Antique District&quot; on River Street downtown. Cafes and art galleries are calling the area home. Residents and visitors can access the area via boat and utilize the Troy Downtown Marina. As home to many art, literature, and music lovers, the city hosts many free shows during the summer, on River Street, in parks, and in cafes and coffee shops.

== Education ==
The Rensselaer School, which later became RPI, was founded in 1824 with funding from Stephen Van Rensselaer, a descendant of the founding patroon, Kiliaen. In 1821, Emma Willard founded the Troy Female Seminary. It was renamed Emma Willard School (America&#x27;s first girls&#x27; high school and a high-academic boarding and day school) in 1895. The former Female Seminary was later reopened in 1916 as Russell Sage College (a comprehensive college for women). All of these institutions still exist today. 

In addition, Troy is home to the 10,000-student Hudson Valley Community College (part of the State University of New York system); two public school districts (Troy and Lansingburgh); three private high schools: La Salle Institute (Catholic military-style), Emma Willard School, Catholic Central High School (a regional Catholic high school in Lansingburgh section), and one K-12 charter school system, Troy Prep.

<text>Valley Falls is a village in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 466 at the 2010 census. The village lies on the boundary of the towns of Pittstown and Schaghticoke, but is mostly in the northwestern part of Pittstown.

== History ==

In 1871, industrialist James Thompson built a textile mill in the village. Nearly all village residents worked in the mill and schoolchildren ran home when the mill&#x27;s lunch whistle sounded. After its height of operation in the 1970s, it entered a decade of decline. The mill had been vacant for at least 10 years when it went up in flames in the early morning hours on April 22, 2009.
By 1863, Valley Falls had established itself as a mini-industrial center. In addition to the aforementioned Thompson textile mill, the village also had a blacksmith shop, farrier shop, foundry, wainwright shop, cooperage, vineyard, three general stores, and two hotels. At this time only a single rail line (Troy &amp; Boston RR) from Troy passed through the southern limit of the village, heading to Johnsonville. Later, a second rail line from Schaghticoke would follow the Hoosic River past Thompson&#x27;s Mill, also heading to Johnsonville. By the early 1970s, the southern rail line was completely abandoned and had been largely dismantled; the northern line still functions to this day. However, with the closing of the Thompson mill, the train no longer stops in Valley Falls.
Valley Falls in the hometown of Allan C. Balch, public utilities executive and namesake for Cornell&#x27;s Balch Hall.

The Adams–Myers–Bryan Farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.
