===Flooding history===
Several major floods have occurred in the area. An earth levee along the Chenango River and Phelps Creek and the channel excavation of Phelps Creek in 1943 by the US Army Corps of Engineers helped reduce the devastation that was brought on by earlier floods of the Susquehanna River basin. These floods included ones in 1810, 1865, 1889, 1894, 1935, 1936, 2006, and most recently, 2011. In 1949, the US Army Corps of Engineers excavated a pilot channel and removed foundation pilings along the Chenango River. Minor floods have occurred since then about once every 10 years, although the average length between floods is 20 years for the Chenango River in general.

<text>Union is a town in Broome County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 56,346. The name derives from the town having served as a rendezvous for the Sullivan Expedition.

The town is in the south-central part of the county, west of Binghamton. The communities of Union form the western suburbs of Binghamton. Two communities, the villages of Johnson City and Endicott, along with Binghamton, make up the &quot;Triple Cities.&quot;

== History ==

The region was first settled by Americans/Europeans &quot;circa&quot; 1782.

During the American Revolution, detachments of soldiers were sent through this region with the intent of attacking natives who were friendly to the British. Documented attacks on native villages in present-day Binghamton, Vestal, and Choconut Township, Pennsylvania, indicate that many natives were killed in these incursions in 1779. Of particular note are the advances of General Poor and General Sullivan, each leading troops on separate fronts. Their soldiers reunited at the site of Union, hence the name.

The town of Union was established in 1791, while in Tioga County before the creation of Broome County. The town, a &quot;mother town&quot; of the county, was later reduced in size by the formation of other towns, the first being the town of Owego (then called the &quot;Town of Tioga&quot;) in 1800, followed by Lisle (1801), Greene (1808, now in Chenango County), Vestal (1823), and Maine (1848).

<text>Vestal is a town within Broome County in the Southern Tier of New York, United States, and lies between the Susquehanna River and the Pennsylvania border. As of the 2020 census, the population was 29,110. Vestal is on the southern border of the county, and serves as a western suburb of the city of Binghamton. The town is home to the main campus of Binghamton University.

== History ==
The first European settlers arrived in Vestal around 1785.

The central area of Vestal, near Route 26 at Choconut Creek, was the site of an indigenous village of the Ochugnut tribe of the Tuscarora people. During the American Revolution, a squad of soldiers from the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, under the command of Lt. William McKendry were sent to engage the tribes, when possible, and destroy their homes and crops. During the summer of 1779, the squad did burn at least two villages without encountering resistance, including one situated in what is now nearby downtown Binghamton (the Chenango, at the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna rivers), and the Ochugnut (Choconut) at the site of Choconut Creek near present-day Vestal High School.

This campaign during the American Revolution was initiated following Indigenous predations against settlers, presumed to have been carried out by tribes forming part of the Iroqouis alliance. This hostile activity against settlers was encouraged by the British. However, some evidence indicates that at least some of the indigenous people were actually Tuscarora— who fled from North Carolina after wars in 1711 and the War of 1763. This community was actually sympathetic to the American cause, siding against the rest of the Iroquois confederation. See Sullivan Expedition or external links for more information on the role of Upstate New York in this conflict.

Following the war, several European families settled in the area near the town of Union. The town of Vestal was formed from the southern half of Union in 1823.

In 1901, on June 8, Vestal was the location of a huge explosion of dynamite aboard a train of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. A second train crashed into that train from behind while it was taking on water. The trains were destroyed and twelve trainmen were killed and injured. So many curiosity seekers came to view the scene that extra trains had to be run to bring them to it.

The history of the town is closely related to its neighbors, Binghamton, Endicott, and Johnson City. During the 20th century, Vestal served as a residential suburb to emerging industries in its area, such as Endicott Johnson Corporation, IBM, and Lockheed Martin. In 1954, the state of New York broke ground on a new campus for Harpur College in Vestal. The college, part of the SUNY system, moved from Endicott to Vestal by 1961, and has since grown significantly and been renamed Binghamton University.

The Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center is a public observatory in Vestal opened to the public on June 16, 1974, by the Kopernik Society of Broome County to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus () in 1973. It is one of the best-sited and best equipped public observatories in the Northeast United States.

During the 1990s, Vestal became the major retail center of the Southern Tier region of New York, with many large shopping centers such as the Town Square Mall, Parkway Plaza, Shoppes at Vestal, and Campus Plaza being built along the Vestal Parkway (NY Route 434), which became one of the busiest roads in the area. Vestal&#x27;s historic central business district is located along three blocks of Front Street, still lined with small shops.

The Drovers Inn and Round Family Residence and Vestal Central School were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

After serious flooding in 1935 and 1936, work began on a dam north of the village on the Otselic River. It was completed in 1942 and — after decisions were later made to impound water on a year-round basis for recreational purposes — formed the Whitney Point Lake (Reservoir).

The village has been the site of the Broome County Fair since 1874.

The Whitney automobile was briefly manufactured in this village around 1902.

<text>Cattaraugus is a village in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 996 at the 2020 census. The village lies in the northeast part of the town of New Albion, north of Salamanca.

== History ==

In 1828, the brothers Calvin and Arad Rich settled in the hills surrounding the area. Cattaraugus developed most after the arrival of the Erie Railroad in 1851. Shortly after, the village became a boomtown growing to 1,500 inhabitants and even being visited by US President Millard Fillmore. By 1860 the township boasted 305 dwellings, 1557 oxen, 383 horses, and 8 school districts with 649 children in school. In the same year, it is well documented Abraham Lincoln had come to visit. Other prominent visitors include US Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. As well as Mark Twain who then named his housecat “Cattaraugus&quot; The village was incorporated in 1882. Its name derives from Cattaraugus Creek.

NY Route 353 and Skinner Hollow pass through the village. Cattaraugus County Route 12 (which follows the briefly designated NY 264 of the 1930s), the only county route in the county to enter a village, enters the village from the northeast and terminates within the village. The village is built primarily on a hillside; the southwestern portion of the village (around Route 353) is on the highest ground, while a series of side streets run downhill from Route 353 heading northeast. Only two of the village&#x27;s streets run uphill from Route 353: Rumsey Street (the easternmost tip of Waite Hollow Road) on the village&#x27;s southern boundary and West Street at the peak of the hill.

Since 2013, the Seneca Transit System has provided public bus service to the village.

The New York and Lake Erie Railroad terminates at a Setterstix plant in Cattaraugus after the portion of the railway southeast of Cattaraugus was decommissioned in the early 1990s.

<text>Coldspring is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 661. It is located in the southwest part of the county, west of the city of Salamanca.

== History ==
The first settler arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1818. The Town of Coldspring was established in 1837 from a part of the town of Napoli. In 1847 and 1848, part of the town was added to the town of South Valley.

In 1965, the town of Coldspring voted 45–0 to annex the former town of Elko (also known as Quaker Bridge) after it was flooded in the Allegheny Reservoir and dissolved. Elko had been formed in 1890 from part of the town of South Valley and is now the south part of Coldspring. Elko had first been settled by Quakers, acting as missionaries to the local natives in 1798 at the invitation of Cornplanter, a local Seneca diplomat. It currently has no permanent population, as virtually all of Elko&#x27;s territory is now either under the reservoir or within the bounds of Allegany State Park. The absorption of Elko and relocation of former residents in the Reservoir&#x27;s floodplain (including a 160-acre resettlement area for the Seneca) helped boost the town&#x27;s population.

<text>Farmersville is a town located in the eastern border of Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 1,081 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The area was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1805, but no permanent settlement was made until approximately 1817. Farmersville became a town in 1821 from part of the &quot;Town of Ischua&quot; (now Franklinville).

The town gained notoriety because of the &quot;Farmersville Garbage Scandal&quot; during the 2000 New York State senatorial race between Rudy Giuliani (who later dropped out in favor of Rick Lazio) and Hillary Clinton. Giuliani had made a statement during a campaign press conference that any community that wanted to refuse taking garbage from New York City was free to do so. The town, eager to get out of a contract that they believed was harmful to them, took Giuliani up on his offer. Giuliani then claimed that he never made the statement and threatened the town with legal action in retaliation. The area where the landfill would have been placed has been the subject of significant controversy and numerous failed attempts to sell the property (Cattaraugus County, owners of the site, have put the parcel of land up for auction at its property auction every year, but the county&#x27;s insistence on numerous restrictions on the land and its refusal to lower its minimum asking price have ensured it has gone unsold every year) since that time.

<text>Hinsdale is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 2,119 at the 2020 census. The town was named after Hinsdale in New Hampshire.

Hinsdale is at the eastern border of Cattaraugus County, north-northeast of Olean.

== History ==
Hinsdale was formed in 1820, bordering the town of Olean. It was named after the town of Hinsdale, New Hampshire. The town of Ischua was created in 1846, as separate from Hinsdale, although the two towns share a zip code.

In 1820, the local community congregated and came to the decision that they no longer wanted to be part of the town known as Hamilton (now Olean). They contacted their representative in Albany, Elial Todd Foote, a resident of Jamestown. They asked Foote to deliver to the legislature in Albany a resolution that would allow them to form their own community, which they would attempt to name &quot;Fayette&quot;. Because of conflicting names (Fayette and Fayetteville) the resolution ultimately failed. The legislature informed Foote that he would be given until the next day to decide on a new name, or be forced to wait until the legislature&#x27;s next session in the fall of that year. With no way to communicate with the locals back in Hamilton, who sought to create a new town, it was up to Foote to submit a new name. After spending a sleepless night attempting to derive a new name for the town, Foote decided to settle on Hinsdale, New Hampshire, the birthplace of his mother, Debbie Doolittle Foote. Thus, on April 14, 1820, the town of Hinsdale, New York, was born.

In 1846, those who resided in the present town of Ischua decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the Hinsdale community, thus creating their own town.

The chapel remains in operation to the present day, albeit in a reduced schedule since 2007 since the death of its longtime priest and cutbacks in the Catholic Church.
*Humphrey Center – A hamlet in the northern part of the town on County Road 18. The community is locally called &quot;Tickletown&quot;; more about Tickletown can be found here.
*Wrights Creek – A stream flowing past Humphrey and Humphrey Center. It is named after early settler Richard Wright.
*Pumpkinville – An autumn theme park, pumpkin patch and apple cider mill based in the western part of the town.

<doc id="126165" wikidata="Q3708749" url="?curid=126165" title="Ischua, New York">
<text>Ischua ( ) is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 736 at the 2020 census. Ischua is also the name of a hamlet in the town. The town is on the eastern border of the county, north of Olean.

== History ==
The area that would become Ischua was first visited around 1808 by Seymore Buton and also visited around 1812 by Abram Farwell, who would return with his wife Lydia Farwell and their family. Lydia Jackson Farwell was the daughter of Revolutionary war soldier Thaddeus Jackson, builder of the Thaddeus Jackson House, the historic -story wood-frame house known as one of the oldest surviving homes in Brookline, Massachusetts, where Lydia was from. In 1814, Lydia Farwell inherited money through her father&#x27;s family and bought the first tract of land in what is now the town of Ischua to build the Farwell sawmill on. The community of Ischua has had continuous settlement ever since that date, and the founding mother Lydia Farwell&#x27;s family have been a part of the history of Ischua for generations since.

The town of Ischua was established in 1846 from a division of the town of Hinsdale. There was previously another &quot;Town of Ischua&quot; in the county, which has now been succeeded by the town of Franklinville and the rest of the northern part of Cattaraugus County. When first formed, on February 7, 1846, the present Ischua was known as the &quot;Town of Rice&quot;. The first town meeting was held at the residence of E. Densmore, February 24, 1846. The first town officers were Frederick Carpenter, Supervisor; Isaac N. Fuller, Town Clerk; Philo Burlingame, Superintendent of Common Schools; Wm. S. Pitcher, Simon C. Mallory and A. L. Barnard, Assessors; and Morgan I. Titus, F. Carpenter, C.C. Hatch and Hiram L. Seavy, Justices of the Peace. Its name was changed March 27, 1855, from Rice to Ischua.

Cuba Creamery, situated in the southeast corner of the town, about from Cuba, was established in 1869, by Gardner &amp; I.N. Sheldon, and made about of cheese and of butter at its height. Quarries of good building stone existed within the borders of the town to aid the early settlers in construction. After the Genesee Valley Canal failed, the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railroad traversed the town in the valley of Ischua Creek.

The town had several telephone prefixes during the party line days shared with nearby communities such as Franklinville, Allegany and Cuba and including 557- that it shared with Hinsdale. The town had its own post office, in the early days known as West Hinsdale, then Rice, and finally Ischua (ZIP code 14746) until the early 1990s, when the ZIP code was abandoned and postal services merged with Hinsdale&#x27;s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.06%, is water.

The east town line is the border of Allegany County. The surface of the town is a broken and hilly upland, the highest summits reaching above sea level, about above the valleys. Ischua Creek, which flows south through the center, is the principal stream, having formed the Ischua Valley. The head waters of Five Mile Run are in the south-west part. The soil is chiefly clay, with a thin surface of mold and some gravelly loam.

New York State Route 16 is a major north–south highway in the town, and it parallels Ischua Creek through most of the town.

=== Communities and locations ===
*Abbotts – A hamlet in the northeastern corner of the town on County Roads 24 and 87, located about 4/5 of a mile east of Cuba Lake on Abbotts Road centered at (42° 15&#x27; 25&quot; N · 78° 19&#x27; 7&quot; W; 42.25701,-78.31863).
*Cuba Lake – A small part of the lake is at the northeastern town line.
*Fitch – A hamlet in the northwestern corner of the town, south of NY Route 16 on County Road 19.
*Ischua – The hamlet of Ischua is at the convergence of NY Route 16 and County Roads 48 and 81 in the northern part of the town.
*Oil Springs Reservation – Part of the Oil Springs Reservation, Cattaraugus County is in the northeastern part of the town, a reservation of the Seneca at the eastern town line.
*Cattaraugus County-Olean Airport (OLE) – Ischua&#x27;s Municipal Airport is located east of the hamlet of Ischua on County Road 81. This is a general aviation airport.
*Dutch Hill – Also known as Maple Hill and located in the southwestern portion of the town; settled in a large part by German speakers from the eastern Pennsylvania region.

=== Adjacent towns and areas ===
Part of the Seneca Indian Reservation is in the town of Ischua. The town of Cuba in Allegany County is on the eastern town line of Ischua. Ischua shares its southern town boundary with the town of Hinsdale and the western town line with the town of Humphrey. The towns of Franklinville and Lyndon are to the north.

==Genesee Valley Canal==
On May 6, 1836, an act was passed in the New York Legislature authorizing the construction of the Genesee Valley Canal. According to New York State archives, the reservoir supplying the summit level impounded 68,000,000 cubic feet of water. A non-navigable feeder creek carried water to the summit at Hinsdale after crossing Oil Creek on an aqueduct.

Because Ischua Creek runs north to south to the Allegheny River and the still waters of the Ischua run deep, the town of Ischua was the perfect area to build a dam and utilize the water-way. Routing the canal through the Ischua-Hinsdale area enabled merchants to transport commerce from Rochester to Pittsburgh. Thirteen feeder creeks fed the canal. The contract for the culverts on the Ischua feeder, as well as on lock sections 98 through 101, in Maplehurst, was awarded to Joseph T. Lyman and Dauphin Murray on October 11, 1839. The Ischua Dam creating the Farwell reservoir for the Genesee Valley Canal was completed in 1856.

The town of Ischua bought the Ischua Dam area, the property located on Route 16 and Farwell Road, that houses the spillway and dam, from Cattaraugus County, for the purpose of development of this site as an educational area, because of its historical aspect and the possibility of creating a recreation area. Also on the property is one of Ischua&#x27;s one-room schoolhouses, built in 1881, that houses the Town of Ischua Historical Society.
For many decades there was an A-framed house that stood next to it, the town tore it down in 2015, disrupting the historic canal site with heavy equipment and causing destruction to the remains of the Dam&#x27;s earthen structure.

Additionally, the town would receive $750,000 in state aid. The village&#x27;s incorporation was dissolved following the successful passage of a referendum on October 13, 2009; the dissolution took effect January 1, 2011. Of the village&#x27;s 229 registered voters, 97 voted, 71 of them in favor of dissolution.

(Within the 147 prefix, Little Valley and Mansfield are adjacent to each other alphabetically and geographically.) The ZIP Code Tabulation Area for 14755, the ZIP Code for Little Valley, shows a clear 8 shape illustrating the territory each office covered.

The town is primarily served by county roads. Cattaraugus County Route 14 (Toad Hollow Road) runs from south to north through the town, while Cattaraugus County Route 13 (Maples Road) runs west to east in the northern part of the town, and County Route 15 (Dublin Road) runs along the southern part of the town. New York State Route 242 passes across the southeast corner of the town and New York State Route 353 through a small portion of the southwest corner.

Mansfield Creek flows across the north part of the town, and Little Valley Creek crosses the southwest corner. The two creeks follow a similar path in opposite directions, separated by the Saint Lawrence River Divide.

The town&#x27;s name presumably comes from &quot;Napoli&quot;, the Italian name of Naples, but is pronounced with a non-Italian pronunciation: , with a long &quot;i&quot; sound at the end (much like communities named Pulaski and Chili in other parts of the state).

== History ==
The first permanent settler arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1819. The town of Napoli was formed in 1823 from part of the town of Little Valley. In 1828, a division of Napoli was made, forming the new town of Coldspring to the south.

Continental Charters Flight 44-2 crashed in Napoli on December 26, 1951.

The now-dismantled Gladden Windmill is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Attractions==
Napoli, like much of western Cattaraugus County, has a sizable Amish community, particularly to the north and west of the hamlet of Napoli. The presence of the Amish and their corresponding large families and high birth rates has ensured that Napoli is one of the few communities in the region that has consistently risen in population since the late 20th century.

Despite a comparable population to other towns and villages in the area, Napoli has a relatively small number of businesses and attractions other than those operated from the Amish farms, with most town residents going to Little Valley or Randolph for their needs. The only church in Napoli is a United Methodist Church in the hamlet.

Public school residents attend either Randolph Central School or Cattaraugus-Little Valley Central School. The Amish operate a small one-room elementary school on Hoxie Hill in the western part of town.

<text>New Albion is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 1,990 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Albion in Orleans County, the source of some early settlers. New Albion is in the northwest quadrant of the county, northwest of the city of Salamanca.

== History ==
From approximately the 1640s, the area was in the domain of the Seneca tribe and was first settled by outsiders around 1818. The town of New Albion was established in 1830 from part of the town of Little Valley. The oldest business community in the town was New Albion with its first store opening in 1833. (New Albion, while maintaining a cluster of residences, no longer has any businesses.) Later the village of Cattaraugus surpassed New Albion.

New York State Route 353 is an important north-south highway in the town, as is Cattaraugus County Route 5, which parallels Route 353 to the southwest. County Route 6 enters the town from the west, while County Route 12 enters from the northeast and County Route 10 enters from the south. County Route 76 (Lovers Lane Road) bypasses the village of Cattaraugus en route to Otto, but unstable ground makes that road unsuitable as a major thoroughfare.

<text>Red House () is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 30, making it the least populous town in the state. The town is on the south edge of Cattaraugus County, south of the city of Salamanca.

==History==
The area that would become the town was first settled by outsiders after 1827. The town of Red House was formed in 1869 from part of the town of Salamanca. It was named for its famous landmark, the Red House, a Civil War-era domicile located at the confluence of a small creek (later named Red House Creek) with the Allegheny River. The house was remarkable for its strange, dark crimson coloring and was originally constructed as a resting house for those traveling along the river.

Locals have expressed skepticism about claims that the house was haunted by members of the Frecks family (the Internet rumor claimed a number of the wealthy family&#x27;s members died in an affair that involved fraternal adultery, exile, suicides, and the mysterious death of the family patriarch) has any historical basis, and a 1965 description of Red House&#x27;s name origin lists the original owner of the house as being &quot;unknown.&quot; Of the numerous ghost stories that are reputed in Red House, the Frecks story is not one of them, and the names and locations of the Frecks story do not match the historical record, which states that H. B. Freck never lived in nor near the titular red house, residing in a different part of the town. The house was a restaurant and hotel in its last years and, like most others in the town, was demolished in the early 1990s. A 1953 column in &quot;The Bradford Era&quot; made note of a legend that the house was originally owned by a native American at the time logging began in the area; a variant of the story, printed in another newspaper in 1962 and reprinted in 1972, states that only the door of the house was painted red.

Harvesting trees for lumber and other products was a major early industry; a chemical plant was built in the town to process the felled trees. The town&#x27;s population peaked in the 1890s, the only time the town ever had more than 1,000 residents, and declined near-continuously from that point onward. In the mid-20th century, Red House was also an early center of the region&#x27;s ski country industry, with two ski areas, the state-operated Bova ski resort and jumps (named after the Beauvais family who donated the land for the purpose) that ran from the 1930s until 1980, and the privately operated Big Basin ski area, which operated from 1951 to 1972.

The reason that Red House is so sparsely populated is because the vast majority of the town&#x27;s land was used for the creation of Allegany State Park, which has no permanent population. Beginning in 1967, coinciding with the construction of the Kinzua Dam, the state began an eminent domain campaign to buy out the remainder of the town; at the time, the path of the Southern Tier Expressway (then &quot;new Route 17,&quot; now Interstate 86) was routed directly through the core of the hamlet of Red House, allowing the state to seize and destroy most of the town residents&#x27; property. In 1973, the state tried but failed to claim the remaining privately held land in the town for park expansion. The eminent domain campaign has mostly gone quiet since the late 1990s; the state still has a standing offer to purchase any property that is either abandoned or put up for sale in the town. A small northwest corner remains outside the park&#x27;s bounds, about half of which is on the Allegany Indian Reservation and much of the rest of which is occupied by Camp Li-Lo-Li, a Christian camp. The few residents remaining in the town are concentrated on a single road, Bay State Road (named after a lumber company from Massachusetts that built and used the road), sandwiched between the reservation and the park and southwest of the original hamlet. A local church was forcibly moved to Jimerson Town; another, a Roman Catholic chapel, remains standing but abandoned.

Red House was assigned the ZIP Code 14773. The United States Postal Service closed the office, which was located within the town&#x27;s grocery store (the owner of the store doubled as the town postmaster), on June 30, 1964. Mail service from that point to the present day has been handled by a rural free delivery route through the Salamanca post office. William R. Costello, owner of the grocery store and the last postmaster for Red House, would later be reassigned to Limestone.

Red House is served by the Randolph Central School district, after that district annexed the Red House Consolidated School District (and its various one-room schools). In the wake of the Kinzua Dam construction, the residents petitioned to be transferred to the closer Salamanca City Central School District, but the Randolph district refused to do so, unwilling to give up the property tax revenues. Native Americans attended a separate school in the area, which was moved to Salamanca in 1965.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.34%, is water.

The south town line is the border of Pennsylvania, and the northwest part of the town borders/includes the Allegany Reservation, defined by the Allegheny River.

Interstate 86 passes through the town, with access from Exit 19. There are also some mostly decommissioned portions of what used to be Route 17 and New York State Route 382. Allegany State Park Routes 1, 2 and 3 are the main routes serving the park and town. The northwest corner of Red House is detached from the rest of the town&#x27;s roadways and is served by only one road, Sunfish Road, which can only be accessed by a detour of several miles through Coldspring.

<text>South Valley is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 250 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the town&#x27;s geographical attributes.

South Valley is in the southwest corner of the county and is east of the city of Jamestown.

== History ==
The town was first settled in 1798 by Quaker missionaries, who attempted to teach the local Indians agriculture and skills needed to cooperate with non-native settlers. The Quakers started a school in 1803 and erected a sawmill in 1812, but the mill caused dissension in the tribe and, at the request of Seneca leaders Cornplanter and Handsome Lake, was pulled down. Cornplanter (who spent his last years on a tract of land just south of South Valley) maintained respectful relations with the Quakers in his later life, despite differences with the group in regard to cultural assimilation. In 1838 the Quakers intervened to prevent the Ogden Land Company from acquiring the Senecas&#x27; land (as had been agreed to in the Treaty of Buffalo Creek), and in 1842 a new Treaty of Buffalo Creek allowed the Senecas to keep their land. The town of South Valley was formed in 1847 from the south part of the town of Randolph.

Much like the then-adjacent town of Red House, South Valley depended heavily on lumber for its early economy, and the town&#x27;s population peaked in 1890, when over 1,000 residents lived there. The spin-off of Elko and the Panic of 1893 cut the town&#x27;s population by more than half, starting a decline that would last several decades. Much of the town was evacuated and razed in 1965 when the Kinzua Dam was constructed, as many small communities that once inhabited the town along the Allegheny River were flooded; by 1970, South Valley&#x27;s population bottomed out at 164 people, a number that has since modestly rebounded. Maps of Cattaraugus County produced today will sometimes make note of the now-mostly abandoned hamlet of Onoville (still marked on I-86 and on navigation signs). A marina was constructed where Onoville used to be. Onoville&#x27;s name was reputedly the result of objections to the original town&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Jugville&quot;; after residents exclaimed &quot;oh, no&quot; to using the Jugville name, a fellow resident flippantly suggested &quot;Onoville&quot; instead, which was accepted.

If Onoville had ever been assigned a ZIP Code, it would have likely been 14764, as gaps in the United States Postal Service&#x27;s online database have ZIP codes 14761 to 14764 missing, with a town name somewhere alphabetically between Olean and Oramel; as Olean is substantially larger and ZIP Codes 14761 through 14763 were likely reserved for it but never used, it is unknown whether 14764 was reserved for Olean or Onoville). If the ZIP Code had been assigned, it likely was never used, since by the time ZIP Codes were rolled out outside the cities in 1963, the Kinzua Dam was already being built. The Onoville post office closed June 30, 1964.

<text>Auburn is a city in Cayuga County, New York, United States. Located at the north end of Owasco Lake, one of the Finger Lakes in Central New York, the city had a population of 26,866 at the 2020 census. It is the largest city of Cayuga County, the county seat, and the site of the maximum-security Auburn Correctional Facility, as well as the William H. Seward House Museum and the house of abolitionist Harriet Tubman.

== History ==


The region around Auburn had been Haudenosaunee territory for centuries before European contact and historical records. 

Auburn was founded in 1793, during the post-Revolutionary period of settlement of western New York. The founder, John L. Hardenbergh, was a veteran of the Sullivan-Clinton campaign against the Iroquois during the American Revolution. Members of the Haudenosaunee allied with the British during the American Revolution, and the Sullivan Campaign, ordered by the American military general George Washington, aimed to crush Haudenosaunee forces in the area. According to historian Robin Bernstein, the Sullivan Campaign and its soldiers destroyed &quot;at least forty Native communities.&quot; After the war, Hardenbergh was granted a tract of land, Military Tract 47, from the very territory he fought to remove the Haudenosaunee from. Hardenbergh settled in the vicinity of the Owasco River on Military Tract 47 with his infant daughter and two enslaved African-Americans, Harry and Kate Freeman. After his death in 1806, Hardenbergh was buried in Auburn&#x27;s North Street Cemetery, and was re-interred in 1852 in Fort Hill Cemetery – the first burial in the city&#x27;s newly opened burial ground. The community grew up around Hardenbergh&#x27;s gristmill and sawmill. Harry and Kate Freeman were eventually released by the Hardenbergh family, with Kate freed in 1805 before John Hardenbergh&#x27;s death, and Harry seven months later by Hardenbergh&#x27;s heirs. 

Originally known as Hardenbergh&#x27;s Corners in the town of Aurelius, the settlement was renamed Auburn in 1805 when it became the county seat. It became an incorporated village in 1815, and was chartered as a city in 1848. It was only a few miles from the Erie Canal, which opened in 1825 and allowed local factories to inexpensively ship goods north or south. In 1871, the Southern Central Railroad, financed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, completed a line primarily to carry anthracite coal from Athens, Pennsylvania through Auburn to wharves on Lake Ontario at Fair Haven.

From 1818 to 1939, Auburn was home to Auburn Theological Seminary, one of the preeminent theological seminaries in the United States. In 1939, facing financial difficulties as a result of the Great Depression, the seminary moved to the campus of Union Theological Seminary in New York City. The only building from the Auburn Theological Seminary that stands today is Willard Memorial Chapel and the adjacent Welch Memorial Hall on Nelson Street, designed by Andrew Jackson Warner of Rochester, with stained-glass windows and interior decoration by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It is the only complete and unaltered Tiffany chapel interior known to exist.

In 1816, Auburn Prison (now the Auburn Correctional Facility) was founded as a model for the contemporary ideas about treating prisoners, known now as the Auburn system. Visitors were charged a fee for viewing the facility and its inmates. On August 6, 1890, the first execution by the electric chair was carried out at Auburn Prison. In 1901 Leon Czolgosz, assassin of President William McKinley, was executed there. Although the ideas of the Auburn System have been abandoned, the prison continues to serve as a maximum security facility, and is one of the most secure prisons in the continental United States.

==Geography==
Auburn is located at 42.9317° N, 76.5661° W at the north end of Owasco Lake, one of the Finger Lakes, which is drained by the Owasco Outlet – also known as the Owasco River – which runs north through the city on its way to the Seneca River. A dam, owned and operated by the city, controls the outflow of the lake, which is used for drinking water and recreation. The city is required to keep a sufficient amount of water in the river to deal with the effluent from its waste disposal treatment facility.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.89%, is water.

US 20 is an important east-west highway passing through the city, and New York State Route 34 and New York State Route 38 are north-south highways that intersect US-20 in Auburn. Seneca Falls is west on US 20, and Syracuse is to the northeast via New York State Route 5.

==Climate==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Auburn has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

The only college in Auburn is Cayuga Community College, a two-year school. C.C.C., as it is known locally, is located on Franklin Street. The city had been the home of Auburn Theological Seminary, a Presbyterian institution established in 1818, which relocated to New York City in 1939.

== Sports ==
=== Professional baseball ===
Auburn has had a long association with professional baseball. The Auburn Cayugas and other early Auburn teams played as members of the League Alliance (1877), Central New York League (1888), New York State League (1889, 1897–1899), Empire State League (1906–1907), Canadian–American League (1938, 1940) and Border League (1946–1951). Auburn was an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox (1948).

Today, Auburn is home to the Auburn Doubledays, members of the collegiate wooden bat Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League.

==== National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues ====
In late 1901, Auburn became the headquarters of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL), which is now known simply as Minor League Baseball and based in St. Petersburg, Florida. John H. Farrell, who served as secretary-treasurer of the league for many years, was a local resident, and the league&#x27;s offices remained in the city while he remained in that role.

==== Auburn Community Baseball ====
Auburn Community Baseball, which is owned by the City of Auburn, is the parent organization of the Auburn Doubledays and its predecessor Auburn entries in the Class A short-season New York–Penn League dating back to 1958. The team plays its home games at Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park. Until 2020 they were members of the New York-Penn League.

=== The Great Race ===
Since 1978, on the second Sunday of every August, Auburn has hosted &quot;The Great Race&quot;, a three- or four-person relay race involving running, cycling, and canoeing (or kayaking). The race begins and ends in the area of Owasco Lake on the southern outskirts of Auburn. With between 2,000 and 2,500 people participating in an average year, it is one of the largest relay races in the United States.

== Media ==

The daily newspaper published in Auburn is &quot;The Citizen&quot;, which dates back to 1816, and had previously been published as &quot;The Daily Advertiser&quot; and &quot;The Citizen-Advertiser&quot;. It serves Auburn and Cayuga County, as well as other parts of Central New York. A morning paper, published seven days a week, it has a circulation of 10,000 for the daily and Saturday editions, and 12,000 on Sunday. It is owned by Lee Enterprises.

== Notable people ==



Possibly the two best-known historical figures associated with Auburn are Harriet Tubman and William H. Seward.

Seward, who served as a New York state senator, the governor of New York, a U.S. senator, a presidential candidate, and then Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, in which role he negotiated the 1867 purchase from Russia of Alaska, which became known as &quot;Seward&#x27;s Folly&quot; – lived in Auburn from 1823 until his death in 1872, and was opposed to slavery. Seward&#x27;s wife, Frances Adeline Seward, was deeply committed to the abolitionist movement, which was strongly supported in Auburn. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. In 1859 Seward sold a plot of land to abolitionist Tubman, who used it to create a safe haven for her family and friends and other black Americans seeking a better life in the north. Seward&#x27;s house is now a historical museum, and both it and Tubman&#x27;s house are on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Aurelius is a town in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 2,610 at the 2020 census. The town was named after the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. It is at the western edge of the county and borders the city of Auburn.

== History ==
The Sullivan Expedition passed through to destroy the Cayuga villages in 1779. This region became part of the Central New York Military Tract, used to compensate New York soldiers for service in the military during the War for Independence. The first European-American settler of record arrived in the area in 1789. It is likely that others had made their homes in the vicinity on lands belonging to the native Iroquois. The town of Aurelius, formed in 1789, was already an existing township when Cayuga County was carved out of Onondaga County in 1799. The town of Auburn was established from a portion of Aurelius. (Auburn was incorporated as a village in 1815 and received a city charter in 1848; the west line of the city abuts the town of Aurelius.)

Among the most prominent of the native sons of Aurelius were inventor Birdsill Holley and Miriam Angeline Works, first wife of Brigham Young, who led the &quot;Latter-Day Saints&quot; into the Great Salt Lake Valley in 1847.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Aurelius has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.47%, is water.

The western town line is defined by Cayuga Lake, one of the larger Finger Lakes. The town is bordered to the east by the city of Auburn. To the north are the towns of Montezuma and Throop, and to the south are the towns of Springport and Fleming.

Conjoined US 20 and NY 5 is a major east–west highway. New York State Route 90 is a north–south highway along the shore of Cayuga Lake. New York State Route 326 passes across the southeastern part of the town.

<doc id="126184" wikidata="Q3460948" url="?curid=126184" title="Aurora, Cayuga County, New York">
<text>Aurora, or Aurora-on-Cayuga, is a village and former college town in the town of Ledyard, Cayuga County, New York, United States, on the shore of Cayuga Lake. The village had a population of 724 at the 2010 census.

Wells College, an institution of higher education for women founded by Henry Wells in 1868, was located in Aurora. It became coeducational in 2005, and closed in 2024.

In 1980, its Aurora Village-Wells College Historic District, with more than 50 contributing properties, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From 2001 to 2007, redevelopment of historic properties in the village by entrepreneur Pleasant Rowland and the Aurora Foundation earned compliments, as well as provoking citizen concern, a lawsuit joined by state and national preservation organizations, and national media attention.

==History==
Indigenous peoples occupied the lakeshore and riverways in present-day New York for thousands of years. Prior to European-American settlement, a major Cayuga Indian village, &quot;Chonodote&quot;, stood near the present-day site of Aurora village. It had permanent dwellings and the people cultivated fields for their staple crops of varieties of corn, beans and squash. &quot;Chonodote&quot; was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition in 1779 during the Revolutionary War, when the Cayuga were allies of the British army, in retaliation for raids by Joseph Brant and his Mohawk and Loyalist forces mostly in the eastern Mohawk Valley. Most of the Cayuga went with other Iroquois nations to Canada, where their descendants are enrolled in the Six Nations Reserve. Some members of the Cayuga tribe returned to the area after the war, but the tribe had been forced to cede its land to New York. They were left landless and shared space with the Seneca on their reservation that once included the north end of Cayuga Lake.

Part of the village was within the Central New York Military Tract. The United States reserved this portion to pay off veterans with deeds to land after the Revolutionary War. The tract was part of the five million acres (20,000 km2) of lands which the Iroquois were forced to cede in the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. Many veterans from New England settled in the Finger Lakes area, as did some migrants from the Mohawk and Hudson valleys.

During the 19th century, Aurora developed as a minor center for manufacturing. A stopping point for canal traffic after the Cayuga–Seneca Canal opened, the village was incorporated in 1837. It became a port, shipping produce from farmers in the region up Cayuga Lake, then by the Erie Canal to other major markets. Academies and seminaries for basic education were established in 1800. Notable schools include Cayuga Lake Academy, which was founded in 1797 and chartered by the New York State Regents in 1801. Its second structure, built in 1835, remained until it was destroyed by fire on April 19, 1945. Many prominent graduates attended the school, including President Millard Fillmore, William Brookfield, the founder of the Bushwick Glass Works; and William E. Leffingwell (1855–1927), State Assemblyman and founder of the Glen Springs Sanitarium. In 1868 Henry Wells founded Wells College for the education of women.

With changes in transportation, development of the Midwest, and other economic shifts, local agriculture declined in importance. The village is a local center with well-preserved buildings composing the Aurora Village–Wells College Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has come to rely on Wells College as the major employer. During the school year, nearly half the population of the village is made up of students. Since the renovations in the town and the college&#x27;s 2005 decision to enroll men and become co-educational, enrollment has increased. The student body, with enrollment of 567 in 2007, had increased by a third since a few years ago.

Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Aurora Steam Grist Mill (1976) and Mosher Farmstead (2003).

In December 2005, the S.H.A.R.E. (Strengthening Haudenosaunee-American Relations through Education) Farm was signed over to the Cayuga Nation of New York by US citizens who had purchased and developed the farm in Aurora, New York. This is the first substantial property which the Cayuga Nation has owned since after being forced to cede its lands after the Revolutionary War. Settlement here has meant their first chance to live within the borders of their ancestral homeland in more than 200 years.

==Changes and controversies since 2000==
In 2000, the board of Wells College endorsed a master plan that proposed two new buildings, demolition of some existing modern buildings and moving some historic brick buildings. They also voted to close the historic Aurora Inn on Main Street and look for a private developer to redevelop and manage it. The college&#x27;s proposed changes raised concerns, especially as some of the properties and master plan were within the historic district.

In 2001, entrepreneur Pleasant Rowland together with Wells College founded the Aurora Foundation and teamed up to renovate the Aurora Inn. They acquired additional properties to renovate, including the E. B. Morgan House. In press accounts, Rowland expressed her vision of enhancing the historic character and attractiveness of the community, and of improving the local economy. Founder of the enormously successful &quot;American Girl&quot; dolls, she was a 1962 alumna of Wells College.

Rowland&#x27;s and the Aurora Foundation&#x27;s projects have drawn some criticism and concern. Because the village is so small, its fate and governance are already intertwined with Wells College, which owns half the land in the village. Critics felt that the foundation was too quick to renovate some historic structures and did not follow necessary review procedures, including that required by the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA).

The critics founded the Aurora Coalition and brought suit to stop the renovation of the inn and demolition of a neighboring grocery. The National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Preservation League of New York joined the suit because of concerns that local government was not paying enough attention to state laws requiring thorough review of projects in historic districts. The controversy continued as the foundation and proposed renovation projects gained national attention. Because some affected buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, interested parties outside the community needed to review the renovations, which increased interest in the projects.

Critics were concerned about Rowland&#x27;s not being a native to the area, despite her time there while attending Wells College from 1958 to 1962. They complained that she had not been accessible for consultation with the community. There was an underlying concern that Rowland&#x27;s wealth allowed her to impose a vision on the community.

The State Supreme Court ruled against the Aurora Coalition and allowed the renovation of the Aurora Inn to proceed. The Appeals Court allowed the lower court&#x27;s decision to stand.

Continuing economic problems in central New York and residents&#x27; differing ideas about the village kept the controversy alive. The issues served as inspiration for the satirical novel &quot;Happyland&quot;, by author J. Robert Lennon. It began running in serial form in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in July 2006.

In May 2007, Rowland ended her association with Wells College and shut down the Aurora Foundation. Spokespeople said redevelopment of the village was substantially completed. Although Rowland put the local home decor firm MacKenzie-Childs up for sale, she also purchased an additional building in the village and set up a new limited liability corporation to operate her properties.

In October 2013, Rowland took personal ownership of all the properties that she renovated for Wells College and purchased several other properties to the degree that she currently owns the entire village business district along with other commercial properties.

<doc id="126188" wikidata="Q3452851" url="?curid=126188" title="Fair Haven, New York">
<text>Fair Haven is a village located on the southern shore of Lake Ontario in Cayuga County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 760. Fair Haven is within the town of Sterling and is northwest of Syracuse. The village is on Little Sodus Bay, an arm of Lake Ontario.

== History ==
The village first gained prominence as a port on the south shore of Lake Ontario. The openings in the sand bars on Little Sodus Bay were widened and protected by jetties in the middle of the 19th century, thus improving the shipping capabilities of Fair Haven. The west pier was later marked with a wooden outer lighthouse with a fourth order Fresnel lens and in 1873 a light keepers house was built on shore which still stands. Sometime later an inner lighthouse was added.

The Southern Central Railroad served Fair Haven, from 1872 until 1887 when it was absorbed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Summer tourists arrived by rail from Auburn and other inland towns to enjoy the parks on the waterfront.which were known for having the very best sand beaches on Lake Ontario. The railroad also carried coal up from Athens, Pennsylvania to a 1500 foot wooden trestle built on the east shore of Little Sodus Bay. The coal was then loaded and shipped by sail freighter to Canada and Ice was harvested from the bay and shipped back by rail to New York City. The trestle was torn down in 1937, a year after the spur was abandoned. When its use as a port waned, the village continued to flourish as a prime recreational destination thanks to the new State Park.

The Presbyterian church, whose brick building of 1882 replaced a former building destroyed by fire, was united with the local Methodist church in 1928. It is now the Fair Haven Community Church.

In the late 1920s land acquisitions had begun for creation of Fair Haven Beach State Park with construction starting around 1930 using labor provided by the Civilian Conservation Corps.

The Little Red School House Museum located at 1294 State Route 104A, Sterling, New York preserves Fair Haven&#x27;s Railroad heritage with two floors of exhibits and a functioning railroad hand pump car that visitors are welcome to ride.

Camping, swimming, fishing and recreational boating are popular now, and the bay is ringed with cottages and year-round residences. There has been an active yacht club on the west shore for over a century, and many sailboats are seen during the summer. The Pleasant Beach Hotel, located on the east shore, opened in 1910 and is still in operation today.

The history of Fair Haven has been well documented by photographer Edna Williams (1883-1967) and several writers, most recently Robert Kolsters who has two books, &quot;Looking Back at Fair Haven&quot; (), loaded with historic pictures and other information. There is an active historical association in nearby Sterling that operates a museum in the Red Schoolhouse. Susan Peterson Gately (&quot;Passages on Inland Waters&quot; ) has a section devoted to the work of Edna Williams containing a biography by June MacArthur, curator for the Edna Williams photographic collection.

Cottage Farm, on Richmond Avenue next to the Community Church, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

<text>One-nation conservatism, also known as one-nationism or Tory democracy, is a form of British political conservatism. It advocates the &quot;preservation of established institutions and traditional principles within a political democracy, in combination with social and economic programmes designed to benefit the ordinary person&quot;. According to this political philosophy, society should be allowed to develop in an organic way, rather than being engineered. It argues that members of society have obligations towards each other and particularly emphasises paternalism, meaning that those who are privileged and wealthy should pass on their benefits. It argues that this elite should work to reconcile the interests of all social classes, including labour and management, rather than identifying the good of society solely with the interests of the business class.

The descriptive phrase &#x27;one-nation Tory&#x27; originated with Benjamin Disraeli (1804–1881), who served as the chief Conservative spokesman and became Prime Minister in February 1868. He devised it to appeal to working-class people, who he hoped would see it as a way to improve their lives via factory and health acts as well as greater protection for workers. The ideology featured heavily during Disraeli&#x27;s two terms in government, during which considerable social reforms were passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Conservative Party moved away from paternalism in favour of free market capitalism. In the first half of the 20th century, fears of extremism saw a revival of one-nation Conservatism. The Conservative Party continued to espouse the philosophy throughout the post-war consensus from 1945. One-nation thinking influenced their tolerance of the Labour government&#x27;s Keynesian intervention in the economy, formation of a welfare state and the National Health Service. Thanks to Iain Macleod, Edward Heath and Enoch Powell, special attention after 1950 was paid to one-nation conservatism that promised support for the poorer and working class elements in the Party coalition.

Later years saw the rise of the New Right, espoused by leaders such as Margaret Thatcher. This strand of conservatism rejected one-nation thinking and attributed the country&#x27;s social and economic troubles to the welfare state and Keynesian policies. In the 21st century, leaders of the Conservative Party revived the one-nation approach including David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson - although Johnson&#x27;s position as a one-nation conservative has been heavily disputed.

== Political philosophy ==
One-nation conservatism was conceived by the Conservative British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who outlines his political philosophy in two of his novels: &quot;Coningsby&quot; (1844), and &quot;Sybil&quot; (1845). Disraeli&#x27;s conservatism proposed a paternalistic society with the social classes intact, but with the working class receiving support from the establishment. He emphasised the importance of social obligation rather than individualism. The phrase was coined because Disraeli feared a Britain divided into two nations, one of the rich and one of the poor, as a result of increased industrialisation and inequality. One-nation conservatism was his solution to this division, namely a system of measures to improve the lives of the people, provide social support and protect the working classes.

Disraeli justified his ideas by his belief in an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligations of those at the top to those below. This was a continuation of the feudal concept of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, which asserted that the aristocracy had an obligation to be generous and honourable. To Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right of the late 20th century, one-nation conservatism identifies its approach as pragmatic and non-ideological. Its proponents would say that it accepts the need for flexible policies and as such one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.

== History ==

One-nation conservatism has its origins in the repercussions of the Industrial Revolution, which had caused widespread inequality, poverty and social discontent in Britain. Tory politicians such as Richard Oastler, Michael Thomas Sadler and Lord Shaftesbury combined their elitist responsibility and a strong humanitarian element with their involvement in the Factory Acts. They were critical of individualism and classical economics, they also disliked the 1834 New Poor Law and believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing decent housing, working conditions, wages and treatment of the poor.

Disraeli adopted one-nation conservatism for both ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became leader of the Conservative Party, he persuaded his cabinet colleagues to introduce the Reform Act 1867 which enfranchised much of the skilled male working-class. Disraeli argued that the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success with this new constituency. He felt that one-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists.

While in government, Disraeli presided over a series of social reforms which supported his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees. As a result, Richard Cross was moved to pass the Employers and Workmen Act 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before the law and the breach of contract became a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act in the same year which enshrined the worker&#x27;s right to strike by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers&#x27; group could not be indicted as conspiracy.

By the end of the 19th century, the Conservatives had moved away from their one-nation ideology and were increasingly supportive of unrestricted capitalism and free enterprise. During the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, public fear of Bolshevism restored the Conservative Party to one-nationism. It defined itself as the party of national unity and began to support moderate reform. As the effects of the Great Depression were felt in Britain, the party was drawn to even greater levels of state intervention. Conservative prime ministers Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin pursued an interventionist, one-nation approach which won support because of its wide electoral appeal. Throughout the post-war consensus of the 1950s and 1960s, the Conservative Party continued to be dominated by one-nation conservatives whose ideas were inspired by Disraeli. The philosophy was updated and developed by the new conservatism movement led by Rab Butler. New conservatism attempted to distinguish itself from the socialism of Anthony Crosland by concentrating welfare on those in need and encouraging people to help themselves, rather than foster dependency on the state.

Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party was mostly controlled by one-nation conservatives. The rise of the New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism. The New Right thinkers contended that Keynesianism and the welfare state had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–1979 in which trades unions took industrial action with a wide impact on daily life was portrayed by the New Right as illustrative of the over-extension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline it was necessary to revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture which they felt had been created by the welfare state. One-nation conservatives such as Edward Heath continued to criticise Thatcher&#x27;s premiership during the early 1980s recession, but they lost influence after the party won the 1983 general election.

The Conservative Party&#x27;s 2010 general election manifesto contained a section on &quot;One World Conservatism&quot;, including a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on well-targeted aid. In 2006, Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew Tyrie published a pamphlet which claimed that party leader David Cameron was following the one-nationist path of Disraeli. Phillip Blond, a British political theorist who has had past connections with the Conservative Party, has proposed a renewed version of one-nation conservatism.

Theresa May promoted &quot;One Nation&quot; ideas during her successful bid for the Tory leadership in 2016. Previously in 2002 she had highlighted that the party was known as the &quot;Nasty Party&quot;.

Also in 2010, the then London Mayor and prominent Conservative (and later prime minister) Boris Johnson explained his political philosophy as such:
In 2019, a One Nation Conservative caucus was formed in Parliament.

Contemporary British one-nation conservative think tanks include Bright Blue, Onward, Centre for Policy Studies, and the Centre for Social Justice.

<text>Mentz is a town in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 2,114 at the 2020 census. The town is in the central part of the county, 7 miles north of Auburn.The town&#x27;s name has never been determined, but it is locally believed that it derived from Mainz, in Germany.

== History ==
The town was formed in 1802 as the &quot;Town of Jefferson&quot; from the town of Aurelius while still part of Onondaga County. On March 30, 1808, the town was renamed to Mentz, as too many towns, villages, and a county had taken the name of Jefferson to honor the past president. The town is part of the Military Tract, and much of the land was given to soldiers who had served in the Revolutionary War. The first settlers built their homes around the Owasco Outlet, which is the outflow of Owasco Lake, one of the smaller Finger Lakes. The Owasco Outlet flows to the Seneca River, which serves as the northern border of the town. The settlers used the Outlet for transportation and for milling.

The Erie Canal was built through the town in 1819 and was opened to traffic in 1820, with service between Montezuma and Utica. The new Erie Canal fostered rapid growth and the settlement that had built up around the Outlet was given the name of Bucksville. The post office was given the name of Port Byron to honor the late poet Lord Byron, and soon Bucksville was renamed as Port Byron. On March 2, 1837, the community of Port Byron set itself apart from Mentz by incorporating as a village.

The town also had a number of smaller communities.

In 1859 the town of Mentz was divided into Mentz, Montezuma and Throop.

Today, the town serves mostly as a bedroom community for the cities of Auburn, Syracuse and Rochester.

== Transportation ==
In 1853, the New York Central Railroad was constructed through the northern lands of the town, about one mile north of the village. A depot and hotel were built along the tracks and the area was given the name of North Port Byron.

in 1884, the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway was built through the town, closely following the route of its competitor, the New York Central. The &quot;West Shore&quot; built a depot on the northern border of the village. Service ended on the West Shore in the 1950s.

The Rochester, Syracuse and Eastern Interurban was built through the town in 1907. The company went out of business in 1931.

The towpath version of the Erie Canal was enlarged in 1857 and again in 1896. In 1917, the Erie Canal was moved to the canalized Seneca River, where it remains today.

The east-west NY Route 31, which was the old Montezuma Turnpike, passes through the center of the town and village of Port Byron. The north-south NY Route 38 passes through the town and village.

The New York State Thruway was constructed in the 1950s and passes through the town on an east-west alignment, closely following the route of the Erie Canal. The nearest access exit, Exit 40, is 4 miles to the east in Weedsport. The Port Byron Service Plaza is located two miles west of the village near the Mentz/Montezuma border. The Old Erie Canal Heritage Park was built as an attraction on the Thruway and lies on the western border of the village.

<text>Montezuma is a town in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,277 at the 2010 census.

Located along the Seneca River, the Town is at the western border of Cayuga County and is northwest of Auburn. The Erie Canal was built through here, bringing new commerce, as did the railroad. National and state historic districts have been designated as related to the canal period, as well as national and state wildlife areas to preserve natural resources of the remaining areas of the Montezuma Swamp. Once one of the largest wetlands areas in the Northeast, it extended between the northern end of Cayuga Lake and almost reached the southern end of Lake Ontario.

== History ==
This was part of the large territory occupied and controlled by the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy as well established before any European colonization. Most Europeans during the colonial period did not penetrate this far west but had relations with the Mohawk nation to the East for trading.

During the American Revolutionary War, there was extensive warfare on the frontier; Joseph Brant, a Mohawk chief, led Iroquois and some Loyalist forces against patriot villages. In retaliation, General George Washington assigned the Sullivan Expedition to punish the Iroquois; they attacked the Seneca and Cayuga villages in the western part of New York, destroying more than 50, plus their winter stores and crops. Many of the Iroquois fled to Canada and fatalities were high that winter from starvation.

After the war, the area of the town was part of a reservation set aside for the members of the Cayuga tribe when the Central New York Military Tract was established. European-American settlers began to arrive around 1798, some migrating from the Mohawk Valley and others from New England. The Mentz Church was founded by early settlers. New York sold off much of the reservation, and the Cayuga were forced to share land with the Seneca on the latter&#x27;s reservation. The federally recognized Cayuga Nation of New York were landless until the early 21st century.

The new settlers made salt production an important early industry, developed from salt springs long used by the Iroquois. The Erie Canal was constructed along the Mohawk River in the 1820s and passed through the town. It was so popular with passengers and commercial traffic that the state quickly made plans to enlarge it. During redevelopment to enlarge the canal, part of the canal was carried over the Seneca River via construction of the massive Richmond Aqueduct (1849-1856). This had 31 stone arches, and was 11 feet high and 22 feet wide. It was the second-largest aqueduct built on the Enlarged Erie and cost $125,000 to build.

The Town of Montezuma was established from the town of Mentz in 1859. The Mentz Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Seneca River Crossing Canals Historic District was listed in the NRHP in 2005.

Montezuma Heritage Park was established in the early 21st century to preserve natural and cultural resources in the canal and river area. The site is to be interpreted to tell the dynamic story of the four separate canals built in Montezuma that were developed into the current Canal System.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Montezuma has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.53%, is water.

Most of the west town line, partly marked by the Seneca River and the Cayuga–Seneca Canal, is the border of Seneca County. The northwest town line is the border of Wayne County, also marked by the Seneca River along with the Erie Canal.

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) crosses the town. Conjoined US 20 and New York State Route 5 pass through the southwest corner of the town. New York State Route 90 is a north-south highway that intersects east-west New York State Route 31 north of Montezuma village.

The eastern part of the large and important Montezuma Swamp is in the Town; it is part of the Atlantic Flyway for migratory birds. Although 70 percent of the swamp&#x27;s original 40,000 acres were drained for agricultural cultivation in the 19th and 20th centuries, the remaining portions are critical habitat to migratory birds and many animals.

<text>Port Byron is a village in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,290 at the 2010 census. It is in the town of Mentz and is north of Auburn.

== History ==
Settlers began arriving around 1797. Originally known as &quot;King&#x27;s Settlement&quot;, then Bucksville, finally, the name was changed to Port Byron in 1825 as it became a port on the Erie Canal. It has been suggested that the new name may have been chosen in reference to Lord Byron, the English romantic poet who had died the previous year, however there is no definitive proof of this. Later, when the canal route was changed in 1856, the village was a railroad town. The village was incorporated in 1837.

The Erie Canal Lock 52 Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
The New York Central Railroad named a Sleeper car after the town.

Sculptor Byron Pickett lived here in the 1840s, and his family is buried in the local cemetery. Clara Barrus trained in Boston to become a doctor. She is better known as the aid and biographer of naturalist John Burroughs. She also wrote a book about her childhood, titled &quot;A Life Unveiled&quot;, written under the name &quot;A Child of the Drumlins&quot;. Actress Kittie Rhoades was raised here, and she kept a summer house nearby. She is buried in the local cemetery. Opera singer Richard Bonelli was born here as Jacob Bunn. Physicist Dr. Francis Eugene Nipher, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, is well known for his early work on the effect of electrical charges on attractive and repulsive forces. Mel Hall played baseball at Port Byron prior to his MLB career; he was drafted in the 1978 draft by the Cubs. Edward G.

<doc id="126206" wikidata="Q329534" url="?curid=126206" title="Battle of Lützen (1813)">
<text>In the Battle of Lützen (German: &quot;Schlacht von Großgörschen&quot;, 2 May 1813), Napoleon I of France defeated an allied army of the Sixth Coalition. 

The Russian commander, Prince Peter Wittgenstein, attempting to forestall Napoleon&#x27;s capture of Leipzig, attacked the French right wing near Lützen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, surprising Napoleon. Recovering quickly, Napoleon ordered a double envelopment of the allies. After a day of heavy fighting, the imminent encirclement of his army prompted Wittgenstein to retreat. Due to a shortage of cavalry, the French did not pursue. 

The two armies would clash again in the Battle of Bautzen three weeks later.

==Prelude==
Following the disaster of French invasion of Russia in 1812, a new coalition consisting of Britain, Sweden, Prussia and Russia formed against France. In response to this, Napoleon hastily assembled an army of just over 200,000 which included inexperienced recruits, troops from Spain and garrison battalions but was severely short of horses (a consequence of the Russian invasion, where most of his veteran troops and horses had perished). He crossed the Rhine into Germany to link up with remnants of his old under the command of Prince Eugène de Beauharnais, and to quickly defeat this new alliance before it became too strong.

On the 30 April, Napoleon crossed the river Saale, advancing on Leipzig from the west and southwest in three columns led by the V Corps under General Jacques Lauriston. His intention was to work his way into the Coalition&#x27;s interior lines, dividing their forces and defeating them in detail before they could combine. But due to the lack of cavalrymen and faulty reconnaissance, he was unaware of the Russo-Prussian army under Wittgenstein and Graf (Count) von Blücher concentrating on his right flank to the southeast. Prussian scouts reported that the French army was stretched between Naumberg and Leipzig. Wittgenstein&#x27;s plan was to attack towards Lützen and split Napoleon&#x27;s forces in two. He was hoping to inflict serious casualties on Napoleon and score a victory that could possibly be used to bring Austria into the Coalition. On the eve of the battle, one of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals, Jean-Baptiste Bessières, was killed by a stray cannonball while reconnoitering near Rippach.

Marshal Ney&#x27;s III Corps was to hold the right flank around Lützen in support of the forces marching towards Leipzig and was caught by surprise. The III Corps consisted of five infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade. Three of these divisions were situated around Lützen, one division in the four villages to the southeast (Kaja, Kleingörschen, Großgörschen and Rahna) and one division a mile to the west of these in Starsiedel. The French VI Corps under Marshal Marmont was at Rippach to the west, Bertrand&#x27;s IV Corps was south of Weissenfels (Weißenfels) where the Imperial Guard was also located. Macdonald&#x27;s XI Corps and the I Cavalry Corps were situated to the north of Lützen.

==Battle==
The Prussian attack started off late with Blücher leading with his corps about 11:30am. As they approached Großgörschen, he was only expecting a couple thousand French instead of the full division that he found. Blücher paused the attack, called up his artillery and started an artillery bombardment at about noon. Marmont to the west heard the sound of the cannon and moved his corps towards Starsiedel. After a 40 minute bombardment, Blücher sent in one brigade that drove the French out of Großgörschen then followed up with another brigade and cavalry that captured Kleingörschen and Rahna. Ney put himself at the head of one of his divisions moving south from Lützen and counterattacked, retaking Kleingörschen and Rahna. Blücher committed his last brigade about 2:00pm, which forced the French out of Kleingörschen and then advanced to Kaja. Blücher was wounded, leaving the Prussian forces to the command of General von Yorck.

Napoleon was visiting the 1632 battlefield, playing tour guide with his staff by pointing to the sites and describing the events of 1632, in detail from memory, when he heard the sound of cannon. He immediately cut the tour short and rode off towards the direction of the artillery fire. Arriving on the scene about 2:00pm, he quickly sized up the situation and sent orders to concentrate his forces. He sent Ney a steady stream of reinforcements which would take up positions in and around the villages south of Lützen. Yorck committed the recently arrived Prussian reserves about 4:00pm. Wittgenstein and Yorck continued to press Ney in the center; control of the villages switched hands multiple times as troops were committed from both sides. The King of Prussia personally led a charge of the Prussian Guard that took the village of Rahna. By 5:30pm, the Coalition held all of the villages except for Kaja, which was still contested. Once Bertrand&#x27;s IV Corps approached the battlefield from his right and Macdonald&#x27;s XI Corps from his left, Napoleon no longer needed to worry about his flanks.

Once the Coalition&#x27;s advance had been halted, with perfect timing, Napoleon struck back. While he had been reinforcing Ney, he had also reinforced the guns of the III Corps and VI Corps located between Starsiedel and Rahna with the Guard&#x27;s cannons. General Drouot concentrated these into a great mass of artillery of about 100 guns (&quot;Grande Batterie&quot;) that unleashed a devastating barrage on Wittgenstein&#x27;s center. Napoleon had collected his Imperial Guard behind these guns and sent them in a counter assault led by Marshal Mortier into the allied center at about 6:00pm, which cleared the Coalition forces from the villages. A Prussian cavalry attack, and encroaching darkness, slowed the French offensive, allowing the main Coalition army to retreat in good order to regroup south of the villages. The lack of French cavalry prevented pursuit.

Napoleon lost 19,655 men, including 2,757 killed and 16,898 wounded, including one of his marshals, while the Prussians lost at least 8,500 men killed or wounded and the Russians lost 3,500 men killed, wounded or missing, although casualties may have been much higher. By nightfall, the Tsar and Wittgenstein were hardly convinced that they had lost the battle. They retreated, however, after hearing that Leipzig had fallen, leaving Napoleon in control of Lützen and the field.

==Aftermath==

Napoleon demonstrated his usual prowess in driving back the Russo-Prussian force at Lützen, but the costliness of his victory had a major impact on the war. Lützen was followed by the Battle of Bautzen eighteen days later, where Napoleon was again victorious but with the loss of another 22,000 men, twice as many as the Russo-Prussian army. The ferocity of these two battles prompted Napoleon to accept a temporary armistice on June 4 with Tsar Alexander and King Frederick William III. This agreement provided the allies the respite to organise and re-equip their armies and, perhaps more importantly, encouraged Britain to provide Russia and Prussia with war subsidies totalling seven million pounds. The financial security offered by this agreement was a major boon to the war effort against Napoleon. Another important result of the battle was that it encouraged Austria to join the allied Coalition upon the armistice&#x27;s expiration, shifting the balance of power dramatically in the Coalition&#x27;s favor. Due to these developments, Napoleon later regarded the June 4 truce, bought at Lützen and Bautzen, as the undoing of his power in Germany.

During the battle of Lützen, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, one of the brightest and most able Prussian generals, was wounded while serving as Wittgenstein&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Although his wound was minor, the hasty retreat prevented proper treatment, allowing a fatal infection to set in.

<text>Springport is a town in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 2,367 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from the local springs and lakeports. Springport is on the western border of the county and is southwest of Auburn.

== History ==
The town lies in the former territory of the Cayuga tribe. A mission to the tribe by the Jesuits was established in 1688. The Sullivan Expedition destroyed the Cayuga villages in 1779.

The town was excluded from the Central New York Military Tract and set apart as a reservation for the Cayugas who returned after the American Revolution. In 1789, they gave up this land to New York, thus opening it to settlers. The first settlers were occasionally asked to leave due to disputes with the tribal members, but eventually the population of outsiders grew. By 1799, most of the Cayuga, including a few Tuscarora, had sold out and departed the area.

The town of Springport was formed in 1823 from parts of the towns of Scipio and Aurelius. The presence of mineral springs and gypsum proved important in the early economy of Springport.

The village of Union Springs was incorporated in 1848.

<text>Sterling is a town in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 3,040 at the 2010 census. Located on the shore of Lake Ontario, the town is named after William Alexander, Lord Stirling, an American general of the Revolutionary War. Sterling is the most northerly town in the county and lies northwest of Syracuse.

== History ==
The region was formerly part of the territory of the Onondaga, one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. However, as allies of the British, who were defeated, they were forced to cede most of their lands in New York to the state after the Revolutionary War. This land was made part of the Central New York Military Tract, which was divided and granted as pay to veteran soldiers of the Revolution.

The first European-American settler, Pierre Dumas (also recorded as Peter DeMass), arrived in 1805. The Town of Sterling was formed in 1812 from the Town of Cato.

Improvements made to Little Sodus Bay of Lake Ontario in the early 19th century enabled the town to have port facilities and take part in the Great Lakes trade. Since commercial use of the port declined in the late 19th century with changes in transportation and development of western cities, the town has developed as a destination for vacations and recreation. The Sterling Renaissance Festival, held annually during the summer for over forty years, also attracts tourists to the town.

The Sterling District No. 5 Schoolhouse and Sterling Grist Mill Complex were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.53%, is water.

The north boundary of Sterling is Lake Ontario, one of the Great Lakes. Sterling is the only town in Cayuga County with access to the Great Lakes.

<text>Union Springs is a village in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,197 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from the mineral springs near the village. Union Springs is in the western part of the town of Springport and is southwest of Auburn.

== History ==
The village is south of the current village of Cayuga and north of the former Cayuga Nation village of &quot;Gwau-gwah&quot; (Cayuga Castle), which became a Jesuit mission. The native village was a target of the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. After the war, a reservation was established for the Cayuga who returned, but they gave up their land rights before 1800. The village was incorporated in 1848.

Mineral springs near the village made the village an important health spa.

In 2023 the mayor of Union Springs was Bud Shattuck. His term expired in March 2023. Robert Thurston Jr. ran unopposed for a two-year term, and was elected in March that year.

Union Springs is the location of Union Springs Academy - a Seventh-day Adventist boarding school.

<doc id="126216" wikidata="Q3453054" url="?curid=126216" title="Bemus Point, New York">
<text>Bemus Point is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The village is within the town of Ellery and is located along the eastern shore of Chautauqua Lake. The population was 312 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Bemus Point is located along the southwestern edge of the town of Ellery, on the eastern shore of Chautauqua Lake at (42.162886, -79.391230). The village is immediately north of the location where Interstate 86 crosses Chautauqua Lake. Access to the village is from exits 9 and 10.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The area currently known as Bemus Point was once part of the territory of the Erielhonan or Erie People Indigenous tribe, first colonized by William Bemus in 1806. Bemus had purchased land on both sides of Chautauqua Lake from the Holland Land Company in 1805 for $1.50. He moved his family to the east side of the lake (in the area now known as Bemus Point) on March 9, 1806. The Bemus family lived in a log cabin approximately northeast of the current ferry landing site. Bemus descendants still reside on original family property along Lakeside Drive north of Bemus Street.

The village of Bemus Point was incorporated in 1911.

A ferry connecting Bemus Point and Stow was founded in 1811 by Thomas Bemus. The original ferry was a raft built by Thomas and had to be poled across the lake. Today, a cable-drawn ferry exists in its place and is operated by the Sea Lion Project. Until the nearby bridge (now part of I-86) opened October 30, 1982, the Bemus-Stow Ferry was the only way to cross Chautauqua Lake. When closed for the winter months, motorists had to travel northwest to Mayville or southeast to Jamestown to reach Stow. Either way was a round trip. Residents often purchased a seasonal pass to use the ferry, commuting to Lakewood, Sherman, or other areas west of the lake.

Throughout the 1800s, Bemus Point gained popularity as a tourist destination, which promoted its growth and development. By the early 1900s, a dance hall known as the Village Casino, which still exists under the same name, became a well-known venue for entertainment, particularly big band music.

Bemus Point hosted the &quot;Bemus Bay Pops&quot; concert, which involved many local musicians, and was also host to the &quot;Chautauqua Lake Voices&quot;, similar to &quot;American Idol&quot;.

The village volunteer fire department was chartered in 1920 and began its operations with a Model T fire truck. Today, the Bemus Point Volunteer Fire Department continues to serve the village&#x27;s residents and the surrounding community.

<text>Cassadaga (a Seneca Indian word meaning &quot;water beneath the rocks&quot;) is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The village is located within the northeast corner of the town of Stockton, east of the hamlet of Stockton, south of and immediately adjacent to Lily Dale in the town of Pomfret, and north of the village of Sinclairville. As of the 2020 census, the population of Cassadaga was 569.

== History ==
&quot;Cassadaga&quot; is a Seneca name meaning &quot;water under the rocks&quot;, descriptive of the natural springs of the area flowing from glacial moraines. In dry weather, many of the local streams would &quot;disappear&quot;, and the spring-fed water runs wholly within the gravelly bottoms of the stream beds draining from the surrounding hills.

Cassadaga was settled by European Americans in 1848 at the headwaters of the technically navigable Cassadaga Creek. Practically, the upper few miles of it are not navigable in the 21st century, due to numerous shallows and beaver activity along its course. Many of the settlers had migrated from New England and eastern New York after the American Revolutionary War. They gradually migrated westward as this territory was opened up for settlement after the Seneca people and other Iroquois League tribes had been forced out of the state after the war.

The village was formally incorporated in 1921.

Early settlers harvested the abundant and large trees (some exceeding in diameter) as a primary source of income. They shipped them downstream to markets via log rafts and flatboats on the creek as timber, charcoal and pearl ash, the latter two products in demand in the early Industrial Age.

The Dunkirk, Allegheny Valley and Pittsburgh Railroad, which laid track from Dunkirk, New York, and eventually to Warren, Pennsylvania, was constructed on the west side of the Cassadaga Lakes in the spring of 1871. It also ran through the then adjoining hamlet of Burnhams, which was later annexed by the village. The railroad contributed greatly to the economy of the area, both as a source of population growth and visitors to the lakes and rolling hills for recreation, and for transportation of the forest and farm products of the area to urban centers.

Workers harvested ice from the lakes in winter for refrigeration, shipping it to other cities. The Webster Citizens Company ice house stood on the west shore of the Upper Lake, with a three-car rail siding to serve it, and was listed as a railroad business as late as 1931. The Cassadaga Spring Water Company had a siding on the Middle Lake where it bottled water from a leased spring on the north side of the Glenn Halladay farm for shipment by rail to city customers, primarily in Buffalo. It ceased operations by the late 1920s as municipal water supply systems improved. The rail line was abandoned after extensive flood damage near Sinclairville from Hurricane Agnes in 1972, and subsequently removed.

==Geography==
Cassadaga is located on the northwestern edge of the Allegheny Plateau in western New York at 42°20&#x27;29&quot; north, 79°18&#x27;56&quot; west (42.341343, -79.315653) at an elevation of approximately above sea level. The village is located at the south end of Lower Cassadaga Lake, Lily Dale being located on the east shore of Upper Cassadaga Lake, with a narrow &quot;Middle Lake&quot; connecting them. The mainly spring-fed lakes drain into Cassadaga Creek, running south and connecting to Conewango Creek, the Allegheny River, the Ohio River, and the Mississippi River flowing to the Gulf of Mexico, despite getting their start just south and east of Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes, which drain via the Saint Lawrence River east to the Atlantic Ocean. The watershed divide is located less than north of the village.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Cassadaga has a total area of , of which is land and , or 20.59%, is water.

The soils are glacial in nature, ranging from deep gravel loams in the valleys to heavy clays on the hill tops. Springs are fairly common, though somewhat high in mineral content (calcium, sulphur and iron, depending greatly on location).

New York State Route 60, the principal north-south route through Chautauqua County, runs through the village and intersects with U.S. Route 20, to the north at Fredonia, the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) to the north at Dunkirk, and Interstate 86 to the south at Jamestown.

The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.04.

The ages of population are well spread out, with 22.8% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 25.1% from 45 to 64, and 17.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.2 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $43,359, and the median income for a family was $52,500. Males had a median income of $32,083 versus $21,500 for females. The per capita income for the village was $20,361. About 1.6% of families and 2.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.3% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 634 (a decrease of 42 people or 6.21%) and there was 267 households (a decrease of 10 households or 3.61%). The population density of the village was 704.4 people per square mile (275.7/km2). The racial makeup of the village was: 98.27% (623 people) white; 0.16% (1 person) African-American; 0.32% (2 people) Asian; 0.16% (1 person) Native American/Alaskan; and 1.10% (7 people) of two or more races. Out of the whole population, 0.79% (5 people) were of Hispanic/Latino origin.

The ages of the population are 21.92% (139 people) under the age of 18; 2.37% (15 people) ages 18 and 19; 4.89% (31 people) ages 20–24; 7.73% (49 people) ages 25–34; 19.24% (122 people) ages 35–49; 24.13% (153 people) ages 50–64; and 19.72% (125 people) over the age of 65. Of the population, 50.16% (318 people) were male and 49.84% (316 people) were female.

There are two churches in the village proper, one Catholic and the other Baptist, reflecting the religious heritages of the early area settlers, though there are Amish and Mennonites in the immediate area and those of other beliefs as well. The Catholic church has reduced its services, now being used rarely.

The village and environs are served by a volunteer fire department and ambulance squad, and are part of the County Mutual Aid Plan.

==Recreation==
The Cassadaga Lakes contain a variety of fish including bass, carp, crappie, muskellunge, northern pike, perch, trout and walleye. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) regular and special regulations apply, and with very few exceptions, a New York fishing license is required. As of 2007, live bait must not be transported to or from other areas, and when State certified and sold for local use, they are to be used or disposed of locally to prevent the potential spread of diseases.

Hunting both small and large game is a popular activity for visitors and area residents, partially as evidenced by the Fire Department&#x27;s annual gun raffle held in April, which has on average raffled about 250 firearms each year for the past 14 years (as of 2007). State laws apply for firearm possession and transfers, and again, DEC regulations apply and licenses are required for hunting.

There is a free public boat launch maintained by the DEC on the north end of the middle lake with parking for vehicles and trailers, though the lakes are small enough to be paddled or rowed, and motor boat speed through much of the middle lake is limited to .

There is a walking / jogging path around the lower and middle lakes (on the road shoulders) that is about in length.

There is a public beach on the southeast side of the lower lake off Park Avenue in the village that is generally open from mid June (when the water warms sufficiently) until Labor Day, that has a lifeguard on duty and is free for all. There is a basketball court adjoining the beach that is open approximately dawn to dusk when weather allows.

Cassadaga is along the route of two snowmobile trails that connect with over of marked and groomed trails in the county for winter riding. State Department of Motor Vehicles regulations apply.

<doc id="126232" wikidata="Q601447" url="?curid=126232" title="Chautauqua, New York">
<text>Chautauqua ( ) is a town and lake resort community in Chautauqua County, New York. The population was 4,009 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Chautauqua Lake. It is the home of the Chautauqua Institution and the birthplace of the Chautauqua movement.

==History==
===19th century===
Chautauqua was formed on April 11, 1805, from the town of Batavia, while still part of Genesee County. The first settler arrived the year before, near the current village of Mayville. When Chautauqua County was created on March 11, 1808, the town&#x27;s territory was increased to include the eastern tier of townships, so that the town and the new county were coextensive. The town is the &quot;mother of towns&quot; in Chautauqua County since all other towns in the county towns were once part of it. The town is still one of the largest in the county.

The meaning of the name Chautauqua remains unknown and a source of speculation, with two longstanding folk translations being “bag tied in the middle” and “place where fish are taken out,” the latter having some support based on similar words in other Iroquoian languages. In Seneca it is known as Dza’dáhgwëh.

===20th century===
In the years of the Chautauqua Institution&#x27;s heyday, rail transport was the chief mechanism by which long distance travelers accessed the town. To 1926, the Chautauqua Traction interurban operated several interurbans a day from Chautauqua to Mayville, and then to Westfield; to the opposite direction the interurban went to Lakewood and Jamestown. To the latter 1940s, Pennsylvania Railroad offered service at nearby Mayville, on a Pittsburgh-Buffalo route. From prior to the interurbans to the waning years of interurbans, steamboats provided access to different parts of the lake from Mayville and Jamestown.

The Lewis Miller Cottage of the Chautauqua Institution was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The Chautauqua Institution Historic District was listed in 1974.

<text>Ellington is a town in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 1,493 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The town of Ellington was formed on April 1, 1824, from the town of Gerry, and Cherry Creek was taken off on May 4, 1829. The first real settlement in the area was towards the northeast part of the town. The first settler to this area was Joshua Bentley, who purchased part of lot 7 in 1814, and part of lot 6 in 1815. Once the town was officially formed in 1824, the first town meeting was held on March 1, 1825, at the house of Lucretia French, in the north part of town. The first religious services were held at the house of James Bates in 1817 by Rev. Daniel Hadley.

In Ellington&#x27;s early years there were a few saw-mills in the town, in which most of the townsfolk that didn&#x27;t have other jobs worked. Most notably was the saw-mill at the dead-end of the aptly named Mill St, which was originally named Willow St. It is notable because it was operational from the 1800s to the early 2000s. Ellington also had a high school on Main Street at one point, built in 1910 and constructed directly in front of the former school house which was built in 1852. The school was known as The Ellington Academy, and operated as a high school until 1948. The building is now a private residence. The original School House built in 1852 was known as &quot;The Box of Knowledge&quot; and reportedly started as a teachers college. During Prohibition bootlegging was common all over the country. Reportedly there were moonshine stills hidden in an old root cellar on 28th Creek Rd known as &quot;The Hide Out&quot; and &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, however it is unknown if this is true or not.

The Floods of Ellington

On September 8, 1865, a storm caused Twenty-eighth Creek, which runs through the southern part of the town, to turn into a terrifying river of logs and wreckage. Homes, stores, the Hotel, and the Baptist Church were all reportedly destroyed or washed away. On August 2, 1979, another terrible flood from Twenty-eighth Creek ravaged the town. One resident of 28th Creek Rd is reported as yelling, &quot;Move out as many people as you can! There&#x27;s a wall of water headed towards Ellington!&quot;. The flood destroyed a trailer park above the town before sending flood waters through the town proper. The Baptist Church sustained damage as well as the former town hall and around 40 homes. Town records washed out of the town hall were recovered a third of a mile away. The damage to the entire town was determined to be around one million dollars. On September 14, 1979, there was another flood although this one was much less damaging than the one just a month prior in August.

Town Picnic History:
Arriving to the town square by horse and buggy with a dish to pass, the Ellington community gathered for the first official Town Picnic in 1905. As electricity came to Ellington the event expanded from a one day get-together to the three day event it is now. For a few years early on political speakers were asked to orate at the event, but this was quickly dropped. This picnic has been going year after year except during the World Wars since 1912 to present day making it the oldest small town picnic in America.

<text>Falconer is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 2,284 at the 2020 census. Falconer is within the town of Ellicott and is on the eastern edge of the city of Jamestown.

== History ==
The area now known as Falconer was inhabited by the Erie People until the mid-1600s. Five years of war with the Seneca Nation led to the Erie Nation&#x27;s decimation; their people migrated and were absorbed into the Seneca community, who then inhabited this land. During the Revolutionary War, the thriving Seneca Nation sided with the losing British. In 1779, George Washington organized the Sullivan Expedition, a military campaign intended to weaken Loyalist and Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) communities. The Seneca signed the Treaty at Big Tree in 1797, surrendering most of their lands to the United States government.

By White settlers, Falconer was originally called Worksburg, after Edward Work, who purchased the land from the Holland Land Company in August 1807. The first Falconer to own the land was Robert Falconer, who bought it from Edward Work in 1836. His son, Patrick, later consolidated his land holdings in the future village. In 1874 the community received its present name, after either William T. Falconer (1850–1915) or his father Patrick, who was on the board of directors of the Allegheny &amp; Pittsburg Railroad and donated a large tract of land through town to the railroad concern. This resulted in the railroad line being routed through the middle of the community. Route 380 in the village retains the name &quot;Work Street&quot; after the town&#x27;s founder (it also now serves as a double entendre as the village&#x27;s various industrial sites are on the same road and thus many people &quot;work&quot; there).

The village of Falconer was incorporated in 1891.

John Cheever selected the village as the location for the fictional Falconer State Prison in his novel &quot;Falconer&quot;.

==Geography==
Falconer is located in the eastern part of the town of Ellicott at (42.118908, -79.200207). It is bordered to the west by the city of Jamestown, while its eastern tip touches the border of the town of Poland.

New York State Route 394 (east-to-west) and Chautauqua County Route 380 (north-to-south) are the primary routes through Falconer. Access to and from Interstate 86 is available via exit 13, just east of the village. County Route 65 enters the village from the southeast. Falconer is unusual among villages in the area in that its speed limit is 25 miles per hour, the lowest of any village or town in Chautauqua County; Route 394 has a 35 mile-per-hour posted speed limit.

<text>Fredonia is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 9,871 as of the 2020 census. Fredonia is in the town of Pomfret south of Lake Erie. The village is the home of the State University of New York at Fredonia (in the northwest part of the village).

Fredonia is one of only twelve villages in New York still incorporated under a charter, the other villages having incorporated or re-incorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

==History==
The village that is now Fredonia was most likely first occupied by early Mound Builders, then the Erie people (13th to 17th centuries), then the Iroquois (specifically, the Seneca). In 1791, Robert Morris purchased the Fredonia land from Massachusetts and sold it to the Holland Land Company. Parcels were sold to pioneers around 1800, and the first settlers came around 1803 or 1804. Among the first settlers included Zattu Cushing, the county&#x27;s first judge, and David Eason, the county&#x27;s first sheriff.

In 1821, William Hart dug the first well specifically to produce natural gas in the United States on the banks of Canadaway Creek in Fredonia. It was deep, excavated with shovels by hand, and its gas pipeline was hollowed out logs sealed with tar and rags. It supplied enough natural gas for lights in two stores, two shops and a gristmill (currently the village&#x27;s fire station) by 1825. Expanding on Hart&#x27;s work, the Fredonia Gas Light Company was formed in 1858, becoming the first American natural gas company. A stone monument in downtown Fredonia marks the site of the first gas well.

The village of Fredonia was incorporated in 1829. The area&#x27;s original name was Canadaway (from the Indian word &quot;Ganadawao&quot;, meaning &quot;among the hemlocks&quot;). The name &quot;Fredonia&quot; was coined by Samuel Latham Mitchill, coupling the English word &quot;freedom&quot; with a Latin ending. Mitchill proposed it as a replacement name for the United States. It failed in that regard, but became the name of many towns and cities.

Established within 20 years of the founding of Fredonia, the Fredonia Academy was the first higher educational institution in Chautauqua County. It was started in 1824 and opened in 1826. The academy became a State Normal School in 1866. On August 8, 1867, the cornerstone of the Fredonia Normal School was laid on a site where the Old Main building stands today. The Normal School used the academy&#x27;s building, which stood on the site of the present village hall, until the Old Normal was completed in 1868. The Fredonia Normal School is now One Temple Square and Association, a 91-unit, NY HUD housing project for the disabled and the elderly that was started by Henry F. Sysol Jr. in the late 1970s. Thereafter the academy building was used for some time as fire department headquarters.

Today the building houses the village offices and includes the 1891 Fredonia Opera House, a former vaudeville theater that fell into disrepair in the 1970s while being operated as a movie house. The theater underwent a complete nine-year restoration in the 1980s by the Fredonia Preservation Society and a cadre of volunteers. It now serves as a year-round performing arts center. In 1930 under the director of the Normal School, Hermann Cooper, of land west of Central Avenue were bought with the dream that one day it would become a campus. The construction of a music building took place in 1939, and in 1942 the Feinberg Law converted the Normal School into a teachers college. In 1948 the college became a vital part of the new State University of New York (SUNY) system.

In the mid-19th century Fredonia became the home of the first dues-paying Grange. The United States&#x27; first Grange Hall was erected in Fredonia in 1868, and the original building (Grange Hall #1) still stands on Main Street. Fredonia was also host to the first meeting of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, which was held at the Fredonia Baptist Church in 1873.

===Italian Immigration===

Beginning in the late 1880s, Fredonia began seeing a large number of Sicilian immigrants from Valledolmo, Sicily. Subsequent the unification of the Kingdom of Italy many immigrants moved to the lush grape growing region to have a better life and seeking the ability to purchase land their ancestors were denied for centuries by the despotic Bourbon Kings of Sicily. You can still see the impact these immigrants made in growth of the town. Most predominantly, Saint Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church, originally San Antonio&#x27;s, named after the patron saint of Valledolmo, Italy. You can also see the strong Italian influence in the arts, music and culinary traditions which remain similar to foods and traditions back in Italy.

During the Olympic torch&#x27;s trip in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games, sixth-grade teacher Kate Leary from Fredonia Middle School carried the torch as it went through the town on U.S. Route 20.

The Fredonia State campus was the location of training camps for two major professional sports teams: the Buffalo Bills of the NFL, and the Buffalo Braves of the NBA. The Braves relocated to San Diego (as the renamed San Diego Clippers) in 1978, and the Bills moved their training camp in 2000 to St. John Fisher College near Rochester, New York.

Samuel L. Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, had connections to Fredonia, via relatives.

The Fredonia Commons Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The U.S. Post Office was listed in 1988.

On January 28, 2020, Fredonia was named the winner of the 2020 Small Business Revolution reality show, which aired on Hulu and Amazon Prime. The show began filming in March 2020 just before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

== Communities and locations in the Town of Harmony ==
*Blockville – A hamlet near the north town line by the junction of County Road 35 and NY-474.
*Brokenstraw Creek – A stream which rises on the west side of the town; a tributary of the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania.
*Cherry Hill – A hamlet in the southeast corner of the town by the junction of County Roads 12 and 35.
*Kings Corners – A location at the west town line, west of Panama village on County Road 10.
*Little Brokenstraw Creek – A stream flowing southward through the west side of the town, joining Brokenstraw Creek in Pennsylvania.
*Niobe – A location in the southeast part of the town and west of Cherry Hill on County Road 12. This little hamlet was once serviced by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Mailbags were left twice daily by train slowing, while passing through, if not stopping for passengers, leaving mailbag (twice daily) hanging from the extended iron hook on the corner of the depot. The depot, named by the Pennsylvania Railroad, was Grant Station, New York. Around 1907/08, Postmaster J. Ray Barker decided to hold a contest to name the community. He wanted to stop the confusion caused by the PRR mistakenly leaving mailbags meant for Grant Station, Ohio (another depot on the same rail-line), and mailbags meant for Grant Station, NY left in Ohio. When Postmaster J. Ray Barker reported the contest results, it was Niobe to be the community&#x27;s name. As told to Walter S. Barker, nephew of the postmaster, family members suspected that Uncle Ray was influenced by the Greek mythology he had been studying, as that subject was not likely studied by people in this remote rural area. The Barker family were early settlers of Harmony Township, with Postmaster&#x27;s father having served in the Union Army of the Civil War [Private in T Company, 9th Regiment NY Cavalry, enlisted on August 10, 1864].
*North East Junction – A hamlet in the southeast part of the town
*Panama – The village of Panama is in the northwest part of the town on Route 474 and County Roads 10 and 33.

<text>Jamestown is a city in southern Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 28,712 at the 2020 census. Situated between Lake Erie to the north and the Allegheny National Forest to the south, Jamestown is the largest city in the county. Nearby Chautauqua Lake is a freshwater resource used by fishermen, boaters, and naturalists.

In the 20th century, Jamestown was a thriving industrial area, noted for producing several well-known products. They include the crescent wrench, produced by Karl Peterson&#x27;s the Crescent Tool Company in Jamestown beginning in 1907. and the automatic lever voting machine, manufactured by the Automatic Voting Machine Company, which dominated the lever voting machine industry from its location on Jones and Gifford Avenue in Jamestown until its bankruptcy in 1983. Jamestown was also once called the &quot;Furniture Capital of the World&quot; because of the once-thriving furniture industry. People visited from all over the country to attend furniture expositions at the Furniture Mart, a building that still stands in the city and houses offices for a variety of companies. For most of the 20th century, Blackstone Corporation, led by Reginald Lenna, was Jamestown&#x27;s largest employer and one of the driving cores of the local economy, manufacturing washing machines and automobile components.

Notable people from Jamestown include legendary comedienne Lucille Ball, U.S. Supreme Court justice and Nuremberg chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson, musician Natalie Merchant, musician Dennis Drew, musician John Lombardo, naturalist Roger Tory Peterson, NFL head coach Nick Sirianni, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

===Bus===
Bus service is provided by Coach USA of Erie. Connections are available to the Greyhound service in Buffalo. There is also a county-wide bus service (CARTS) and taxi service through various companies including Rainbow Cab and Uber.

===Rail===
Present-day Jamestown is on the mainline of the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad which provides freight service. A proposal to connect the WNYP to the New York and Lake Erie Railroad would allow for excursion rail service; to do so, the NYLE would need to undergo extensive rehabilitation of the rail lines near the junction between the two rail lines at Waterboro, several miles east of Jamestown. Amtrak does not serve the area, except through contract with Coach USA to provide Amtrak Thruway service along Coach USA&#x27;s existing bus route to bus Amtrak passengers to and from the Exchange Street station in Buffalo.

Until 1950, two railroad companies traveled through Jamestown: 
*Erie Railroad – mainline passing through Jamestown (New York to Chicago), whose last trains were the &quot;Atlantic Express/Pacific Express&quot; (discontinued, 1965) and the &quot;Lake Cities&quot; (discontinued, 1970).
*Jamestown, Westfield and Northwestern Railroad - freight and passenger interurban train company, which went defunct in 1950.

In 1976, the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad was absorbed into Conrail, and then ultimately, by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation in 1998.

The Erie Railroad&#x27;s former Jamestown Station still exists and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It is now home to a portion of the National Comedy Center which opened in Summer of 2018.

An electric interurban railroad—Jamestown, Westfield and Northwestern Railroad (JW&amp;NW)—connected all three above towns (Jamestown-Mayville-Westfield) and ran along the north side of Lake Chautauqua. The JW&amp;NW ended passenger operation in 1947, continued with freight, then quit entirely in 1950. Its rails and right-of-way have slowly disappeared.

===Highways===
The Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86/Route 17) passes to the north and east of Jamestown, with direct access to the city from Exits 12 and 13. New York State Routes 60 (Foote Avenue) and 394 (Fairmount Avenue on the west side, Second Street on the east) pass through the city north-to-south and east-to-west, respectively; Route 430 (Fluvanna Avenue) begins in Jamestown and follows a westward path.

<text>Mayville is a village in the town of Chautauqua, New York. It is the county seat of Chautauqua County. The population was 1,477 at the 2020 census, 13.7% less than in the 2010 census. The village and town offices share a building on Main Street, directly across from the Chautauqua County courthouse.
== History ==
The Holland Land Company anticipated establishing a village located at the eastern end of the Old Portage Road between Lake Erie and Chautauqua Lake. In 1804, the area was surveyed by William Peacock. In 1805, the village was named Mayville in honor of Elisabeth Busti (&quot;née&quot; May), wife of Paul Busti, &quot;Agent General&quot; of the Holland Land Company. 

The 1808 legislation establishing the formation of Chautauqua County required the appointment of a committee to locate the county seat. Gov. Daniel D. Tompkins selected Jonas Williams (Batavia), Isaac Sutherland (Batavia) and Asa Ransom (Clarence) based on the recommendations of Joseph Ellicott, Resident Land Agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia. The committee designated Mayville as the county seat, rubberstamping the Holland Land Company plan.

In 1804, Alexander McIntyre of Meadville, Pennsylvania became the first land owner in the future village. The Holland Land Company established a sales office in Mayville in 1810 with William Peacock as sub-agent.
The village of Mayville was incorporated in 1830. In 1836, local residents rioted against the Holland Land Company and broke into its office, destroying furniture and papers.

The Pennsylvania Railroad built a train station and pier on the shores of Chautauqua Lake at Mayville. This station was on a PRR route from Pittsburgh to Dunkirk to Buffalo route. The Mayville station, along with the Jamestown boat landing at the south end of the lake, was the main mode of transportation to the rest of the communities around Chautauqua Lake via the large fleet of steamboats operating before the interurban lines were constructed. The Chautauqua Traction Company served the communities on the western side of the lake; and the Jamestown, Westfield and Northwestern Railroad was the interurban serving the east side of the lake. In modern times the steamboat &quot;Chautauqua Belle&quot; still operates out of Mayville, running between Point Chautauqua, Chautauqua Institution, and the vessel&#x27;s home port in Mayville.

The Pennsylvania Railroad Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The Point Chautauqua Historic District was listed in 1996.

<text>Panama is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 465 at the 2020 census. Panama is in the northwest part of the town of Harmony, at the junction of State Route 474 (Main Street) and County Route 33.

The village is named after Panama Rocks, a large rock formation south of the village. Paleozoic fossils are visible in the outcrops. This site has become a tourist attraction, and the owners charge admission at the gate.

== History ==

The village of Panama was incorporated in 1861.

Among many early settlers was George Hawkins, who purchased Lot 50 in 1825. He was born in 1802 in Oneida County, New York. About 1827 he married Rhoda Powers (born 1806). Together they cleared land to make a living. George died in 1883 and Rhoda in 1900. Rhoda&#x27;s father was Simeon Powers, who established a Baptist church in the area. George&#x27;s parents are unknown. Both are buried in Panama Union cemetery under one headstone.

The U.S. Post Office at Panama was established in 1826. That was the first, officially recorded, use of the name &quot;Panama&quot;. The traditional story is that Panama got its name from someone who had been across the Isthmus of Panama, and said local rock formations reminded him of Panama&#x27;s rocks. It is possible that this person was Moses Cushman Marsh, who operated a trading company in Panama, and was Panama&#x27;s first postmaster. He had previously had a business in Cuba, and he may have been across the Isthmus of Panama. His daughter was the educator and writer, Mary Louise Nash (1826-1896).

<text>Silver Creek is a village in the town of Hanover in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 2,637. Silver Creek is named after a small creek which runs through the village. It is on the shore of Lake Erie.

== History ==
The community was first settled circa 1803, and the first school house was erected in approximately 1823. In 1822 a well-known black walnut tree, measuring about in diameter, was blown over in a storm. The village of Silver Creek was incorporated in 1848, and was an important port on Lake Erie until railroads reduced shipping. The village is home to a skew arch railroad bridge, one of the few bridges in the country built on an angle. In September 1886, two trains collided near this location, killing approximately 15 and injuring roughly the same number.

== Geography ==
Silver Creek is located at 42°32&#x27;39&quot; north, 79°10&#x27;2&quot; west (42.544083, -79.167088). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.0 km2); all land. Silver Creek is part of the Lake Erie Basin. The two creeks in the village, Silver Creek and Walnut Creek, drain into the lake. Silver Creek is at the junction of New York State Route 5 (Central Avenue) and US Route 20 (Main Street), north of New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) Exit 58.

Silver Creek is on the New York-to-Chicago main line of CSX Transportation and the New York-Buffalo-Chicago main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway. The CSXT line through Silver Creek was formerly operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), which succeeded the Penn Central (which succeeded the New York Central Railroad, which succeeded the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, which succeeded the Lake Shore Railroad, which succeeded the Buffalo &amp; Erie Railway, the original line). The Norfolk Southern line through Silver Creek was formerly operated by the Norfolk and Western Railway, successor to the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road [NKP]), the original line.

The Penn Central&#x27;s (formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad, or PRR) Buffalo-Corry (PA)-Pittsburgh line formerly operated through Silver Creek. The single-track lines of the NKP and PRR were jointly operated to form a double-track line which was used by the trains of both railroads. The former PRR line was abandoned around 1976 by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in favor of highway transportation. From approximately 1907 to 1933 Silver Creek was on the Buffalo-to-Erie main line of the Buffalo &amp; Erie Railway (successor to the Buffalo &amp; Lake Erie Traction Company), a high-speed electric interurban railway. It was abandoned by order of the New York Public Service Commission to promote highway transportation.

== Health care and law enforcement ==
Silver Creek is served by Brooks Memorial Hospital in Dunkirk, NY.

Trauma cases are treated at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo and UPMC Hamot in Erie, Pennsylvania. In August 2009 a flash flood affected Silver Creek, Sunset Bay and Gowanda. As a result of the flood, the New York State Department of Health closed Tri-County Memorial Hospital. The Village of Silver Creek dissolved the Police Department and contracted with the Chautauqua County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for patrols along with assistance from the New York State Police when needed.

The village has a volunteer fire department with 50–60 active volunteers and junior firefighters, operating in tandem with the Silver Creek Emergency Squad. They are trained by the New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control and the New York State Department of Health&#x27;s Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. On August 9, 2009, the emergency-squad building, the village fire hall and its vehicles sustained extensive damage in a flash flood; the public works department on North Main Street was destroyed (it has since moved to a new building in the former Bentges distributing plant on Routes 5 and 20 in the Town of Hanover. Several homes along Walnut Creek were badly damaged or destroyed, and the Silver Village Trailer Park was leveled by flooding from Silver Creek. Some village streets were badly damaged or washed away by the flood waters. A funeral home, church and school were also badly damaged.

Both Mercy Flight, a nonprofit medivac service based in Buffalo and LifeStar, a medivac service affiliated with UPMC Hamot in Erie, serve the Silver Creek area.

== Grape Festival ==
Every third weekend in September Silver Creek hosts a Festival of Grapes to honor Concord grapes, an important agricultural product. The festival began in 1968 and features a parade, live music, a midway, a wine tent, children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; activities and a grape stomping.

In 2008, the Silver Creek Grape Festival was featured on the nationally televised &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Diane Sawyer, Robin Roberts, Sam Champion and Chris Cuomo visited a farm to stomp grapes on their trip across America; taken during the 2008 election, they visited 50 states in 50 days learning about the country. Diane Sawyer called it &quot;the first and maybe last annual GMA grape stomping contest in honor of Lucille Ball, who was born in the region&quot;. The four participated in a grape-stomping competition.

The festival concludes every year with the grand parade which features the festival of grapes royalty, political figures, high school marching bands from regional high schools, fire apparatus from Silver Creek, Sunset Bay, Forestville, Hanover Center, Irving, Sheridan, Lake Erie Beach, Angola, and Fredonia. Some years the local Shriners club from Gowanda and the Chautauqua County Sheriff&#x27;s Office mounted unit also participate. Several youth organizations march in the parade alongside the local fire departments and veterans.

==School==
In Silver Creek all three schools (elementary, middle and high school) are physically interconnected, to facilitate the transition to the next stage of learning. The elementary school is attached to the middle school which in turn is attached to the high school. Silver Creek maintains its own transportation department, rather than contracting for school-bus service. Its bus drivers have come from all walks of life; many are retirees. The transportation director is responsible for the district&#x27;s 30 buses.

There are separate runs for pre-kindergarten to fifth-grade, and sixth- to twelfth-grade students. Four buses are used on a later run for vocational students returning from the LoGuidice Educational Center in Fredonia and students staying late for any reason. The buses are used for school-sponsored sporting events held at other schools, school-sponsored field trips and the annual Class Night party for the graduating class. In the event of a snow day or an unanticipated need for early dismissal, all local television and radio stations are contacted. If the fire-alarm system is activated apart from state-required fire drills Silver Creek Fire and EMS, Sunset Bay Fire, Battalion 1(County Fire Coordinator), County Fire 1(Director of County Emergency Services) are dispatched as 1st Alarm. Fire Chief or Asst. Fire Chief who takes role as Incident Commander at the school determines if 2nd alarm is needed from Fredonia or Dunkirk for their Tower or Ladder truck, County Rescue 71(Fredonia), Hanover Center, Forestville, Irving, and Sheridan.

There is a SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) chapter at the high school, counseling students against destructive decisions. It has sponsored movie nights for elementary-school students with movies, food and activities. Once every few years Forestville and/or Silver Creek try to hold a mock DWI Drill just before prom weekend in the spring.

=== Athletics ===
The school colors are black and old gold, and its mascot is a black knight. Sports offered are cross-country for boys and girls, football and soccer for boys and soccer, swimming and volleyball for girls. The 2008–2009 boys&#x27; varsity football team played at New Era Field in Orchard Park, home of the Buffalo Bills.
