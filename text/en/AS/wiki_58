<text>Honey Brook is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population of the borough was 1,895 at the 2020 census. The borough is surrounded by Honey Brook Township, and both are referred to locally collectively as Honey Brook.

==History==
Honey Brook Township was divided from Nantmeal Township in 1789. The owner of the surrounding property, Andrew Boyer, established a town plan for the village of Waynesburg (named in honor of Revolutionary War general Mad Anthony Wayne) and began selling lots in June 1813. There is a story that this was done by a schoolmaster named Stinson, but all of the deeds reference Boyer as the owner with no mention of Stinson, and there was nobody named Stinson in the Federal 1810 or 1920 census reports for Chester County. This &quot;myth&quot; seems to have originated in the 19th century.

The residents changed the name to Honey Brook in 1884. Honey Brook is an incorrect English translation of Nantmel, a village in Radnorshire, now part of Powys. The Welsh name actually means &#x27;Maël&#x27;s valley&#x27;, Maël being a tenth-century prince. Honey Brook was incorporated as a borough in 1891.

In 1884 the railroad from Philadelphia-Downingtown-Lancaster was completed and ran along the south side of Horseshoe Pike. The railroad caused a problem for the village: there was another Waynesburg in western Pennsylvania. The freight was being routed to the wrong stations, so the name was changed from Waynesburg to Honey Brook.

As the town grew, a petition was circulated in 1891 for the town to be incorporated into a borough. Almost every homeowner signed. With the incorporation as a borough, the main problems to overcome were: street lighting, sidewalks, and, several years later, water.

The borough accepted public water in September 1896. Electric streetlights were installed after much discussion in 1915. Before that, gas lamps were used to light the streets. Over the years, boardwalks were replaced by bricks, then by concrete sidewalks. There are still two brick sidewalks in the borough. Horseshoe Pike, formerly Main Street, has the only fully paved sidewalks in the borough.

When the borough was incorporated, the census was around 600. As of the census in 2000, the population had doubled.

The oldest organization in Honey Brook Borough is Honey Brook United Methodist Church. The longest continuous business is W.L. White&#x27;s &amp; Sons.

<text>Kennett Square is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Kennett Square had a population of 5,943.

Kennett Square is located in the Delaware Valley and considered a suburb of both Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth largest city as of 2020, and Wilmington, Delaware. The local high school is Kennett High School. The corporate headquarters of Genesis HealthCare, which administers elderly care facilities, is based in Kennett Square.

The borough is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mushroom Capital of the World&quot; because mushroom farming in the region produces over 500 million pounds of mushrooms a year, representing half of the nation&#x27;s mushroom crop production. To celebrate this heritage, Kennett Square holds an annual Mushroom Festival, where the town and its businesses hold a parade, mushroom farm tours, and sells food and other goods.

==History==
The area that became known as Kennett Square was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native American tribe. Once colonized, the town was named Kennet Square, a reference to Kennett, Wiltshire, England, with &quot;Square&quot; referring to the original land grant from William Penn, which was one square mile. In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, Sir William Howe, a British Army general, led troops through Kennett Square on their way to the Battle of Brandywine.

In the 19th century, the borough played an instrumental role in the Underground Railroad, which helped slaves escape the South for freedom. In 1853, a group asked for Kennett Square to be incorporated, and by 1855 it held elections.

Kennett Square&#x27;s founder is credited with introducing mushroom growing to the area. He grew carnations, a popular local commodity beginning in 1885 and wanted to make use of the wasted space under the elevated beds. He imported spawn from Europe and started experimenting with mushroom cultivation.

<doc id="131847" wikidata="Q1187162" url="?curid=131847" title="Lionville, Pennsylvania">
<text>Lionville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Uwchlan Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 6,189 at the 2010 census. Prior to 2010 the CDP was recorded as Lionville-Marchwood. &quot;Marchwood&quot;, however, refers only to the housing development begun in the early 1960s that is located south of the 100-113 intersection.

Lionville is bisected by two major local highways, PA 100 and PA 113. The area contains residential neighborhoods, hotels, restaurants, and other businesses. The original name of the village was Welsh Pool but was changed to Red Lion. When the town asked for a post office the name Red Lion was denied because there were already too many towns with that name in PA. The government assigned them the name Lionville, and they kept it. The area of Lionville along Village Avenue is a protected historic district. The Friends Meeting House was used as a hospital by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

Lionville has an independent ZIP Code and post office, but it has never had mail delivery. Many of the long-term residents who picked up mail at the now-closed general store or fire station locations now use a Downingtown address. Because much of the area also falls under the Exton ZIP code, many Lionville businesses use the Exton name instead, especially if they do not have other locations in the area.

<text>Lower Oxford Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,420 at the 2020 census. Lincoln University, a historically black university, is located in the township.

==History==
The Hopewell Historic District and Pine Grove Covered Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The township is named after Oxford, England.

Part of the township was originally disputed territory between Pennsylvania and Maryland, resolved eventually by the Mason–Dixon line. One third of the township formed part of the northern section of Susquehanna Manor later known as New Connaught, a large settlement tract established by Maryland and named after the western province of Connacht in Ireland that courted Irish settlement into the area.

<text>Malvern is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is west of Philadelphia. The population was 3,419 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area was originally settled in the 17th century by Welsh immigrants who purchased land from William Penn. 

On the evening of September 20, 1777, near Malvern, General Charles Grey and nearly 5,000 British soldiers launched a surprise attack on a Patriot encampment, which became known as the Battle of Paoli. Having intercepted General Washington&#x27;s orders to General Wayne regarding British rearguard actions, Grey directed his troops to assault the small regiment of Americans commanded by Anthony Wayne in an area near his residence. Not wanting to lose the element of surprise, Grey ordered his troops to remove the flint from their muskets and to use only bayonets or swords to launch a surprise sneak attack on the Americans under the cover of darkness.

With the help of a Loyalist spy who provided a secret password, &quot;here we are and there they go&quot; and led them to the camp, General &quot;No-flint&quot; Grey and the British overran several American pickets and launched their successful attack on the Continental Army camp. 201 American soldiers were killed or injured, while 71 were captured. The British suffered only 4 killed and 7 injured in comparison. Wayne&#x27;s reputation was tarnished by the high casualties suffered in the battle, and he demanded a formal court-martial to clear his name. On November 1, a board of 13 officers declared that Wayne had acted with honor. The site of the battle is part of Malvern.

A monument to the Paoli Massacre, the preserved battlefield, and a parade grounds are located in Malvern. Other sites of interest in neighboring townships include the Wharton Esherick Studio, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993.

The church, trains, and a few businesses were the nucleus of this village, which was known for a long period as West Chester Intersection due to its position at the junction of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad and the West Chester Railroad. 

In 1873, the community’s name was changed to Malvern when the Philadelphia and Columbia&#x27;s successor, the Pennsylvania Railroad, straightened its tracks through the village. In 1879, the Malvern Friends Meeting was built at the northwest corner of Woodland Avenue and Roberts Lane, followed by the arrival of the Presbyterians and the Methodists prior to 1900. 

In 1880, the village&#x27;s status as a railroad junction came to an end when the West Chester Railroad&#x27;s northern terminal was moved west to Frazer, Pennsylvania. Malvern Borough has a mix of residential styles and neighborhoods, retail and industrial businesses, dedicated open land, and numerous civic, cultural, and religious organizations.

On August 13, 1889, Malvern was incorporated, and created by separating it from the northern portion of Willistown Township.

<text>Polis (: poleis) means &#x27;city&#x27; in Ancient Greek. The ancient word &quot;polis&quot; had socio-political connotations not possessed by modern usage. For example, today&#x27;s πόλη is located within a (&quot;khôra&quot;), &quot;country&quot;, which is a πατρίδα (patrida) or &quot;native land&quot; for its citizens. In ancient Greece, the polis was the native land; there was no other. It had a constitution and demanded the supreme loyalty of its citizens. χώρα was only the countryside, not a country. Ancient Greece was not a sovereign country, but was a territory occupied by Hellenes, people who claimed as their native language some dialect of Ancient Greek.

Poleis did not only exist within the area of the modern Republic of Greece. A collaborative study carried by the Copenhagen Polis Centre from 1993 to 2003 classified about 1,500 settlements of the Archaic and Classical ancient-Greek-speaking population as poleis. These ranged from the Caucasus to southern Spain, and from southern Russia to northern Egypt, spread over the shores of the Mediterranean and Black Seas. They have been termed a network of micro-states. Many of the settlements still exist; e.g., Marseille, Syracuse, Alexandria, but they are no longer Greek or micro-states, belonging to other countries.

The ancient Greek world was split between homeland regions and colonies. A colony was generally sent out by a single polis to relieve the population or some social crisis or seek out more advantageous country. It was called a metropolis or &quot;mother city&quot;. The Greeks were careful to identify the homeland region and the metropolis of a colony. Typically a metropolis could count on the socio-economic and military support of its colonies, but not always. The homeland regions were located on the Greek mainland. Each gave an ethnic or &quot;racial&quot; name to its population and poleis. Acarnania, for example, was the location of the Acarnanian people and poleis. A colony from there would then be considered Acarnanian, no matter how far away from Acarnania it was. Colonization was thus the main method of spreading Greek poleis and culture.

Ancient Greeks did not reserve the term &quot;polis&quot; solely for Greek-speaking settlements. For example, Aristotle&#x27;s study of the polis names also Carthage, comparing its constitution to that of Sparta. Carthage was a Phoenician-speaking city. Many nominally Greek colonies also included municipalities of non-Greek speakers, such as Syracuse. 

==Definition==
The word &quot;polis&quot; is used in the first known work of Greek literature, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, a maximum of 350 times. The few hundred ancient Greek classical works online at the Perseus Digital Library use the word thousands of times. The most frequent use is Dionysius of Halicarnassus, an ancient historian, with a maximum of 2,943. A study of inscriptions found 1,450 that used polis before 300 BC, 425 Athenian, and 1,025 from the rest of the range of poleis. There was no difference in meaning between literary and inscriptional usages.

Polis became loaded with many incidental meanings. The major meanings are &#x27;state&#x27; and &#x27;community&#x27;. The theoretical study of the polis extends as far back as the beginning of Greek literature, when the works of Homer and Hesiod in places attempt to portray an ideal state. The study took a great leap forward when Plato and the academy in general undertook to define what is meant by the good, or ideal, polis.

Plato analyzes the polis in the &quot;Republic&quot;, the Greek title of which, (), itself derives from the word &quot;polis&quot;. The best form of government of the polis for Plato is the one that leads to the common good. The philosopher king is the best ruler because, as a philosopher, he is acquainted with the Form of the Good. In Plato&#x27;s analogy of the ship of state, the philosopher king steers the polis, as if it were a ship, in the best direction.
Books II–IV of &quot;The Republic&quot; are concerned with Plato addressing the makeup of an ideal polis. In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Socrates is concerned with the two underlying principles of any society: mutual needs and differences in aptitude. Starting from these two principles, Socrates deals with the economic structure of an ideal polis. According to Plato, there are five main economic classes of any polis: producers, merchants, sailors/shipowners, retail traders, and wage earners. Along with the two principles and five economic classes, there are four virtues. The four virtues of a &quot;just city&quot; are wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. With all of these principles, classes, and virtues, it was believed that a &quot;just city&quot; (polis) would exist.

Breaking away from Plato and the academy, a professor there, Aristotle, founded his own school, the Lyceum, a university. One of its strongest curricula was political science, which Aristotle invented. He dispatched students over the world of the polis to study the society and government of individual poleis and bring the information back to the document, placing the document in a political science section of the library. Only two documents have survived, &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;Athenian Constitution&quot;. These are a part of any political science curriculum today.

Both major ancient Greek philosophers were concerned with elucidating an existing aspect of the society in which they lived, the polis. Plato was more interested in the ideal; Aristotle, the real. Both had a certain view of what the polis was; that is, a conceptual model. All models must be tested, by definition. Aristotle, of course, could send direct observers. The only way to know a polis now is through a study of ancient literature (philology), and to some extent archaeology. There are thousands of pages of writing and certainly thousands of sites. The problem is to know what information to select for a model and what to neglect as probably irrelevant.

Classical studies of the last few hundred years have been relatively stable in their views of the polis, relying basically on just a few models: the concept of a city-state, and Fustel de Coulange&#x27;s model of the ancient city. However, no model ever seems to resolve all the paradoxes or provide for every newly considered instance. The question is not whether poleis can be found to fit a particular model (some usually can), but whether the model covers all the poleis, which, apparently, no model ever has, even the ancient ones. The re-defining process continues.

The Copenhagen study rejects either model and proposes instead the microstate. Some few scholars have become totally cynical, rejecting the idea that any solution has been or can be found. This argument places polis in the same category of Plato&#x27;s indefinable abstracts, such as freedom and justice. However, there is a practical freedom and a practical justice, although not theoretically definable, and the ancient authors must mean something consistent when they use the word &quot;polis&quot;. The problem is to find it.

=== Modern usage ===
The Modern Greek word (&quot;polē&quot;) is a direct descendant of the ancient word and roughly means &#x27;city&#x27; or an urban place. However, the Ancient Greek term that specifically meant the totality of &quot;urban&quot; buildings and spaces was &quot;asty&quot; (), rather than polis. 

==Modern models==

===The subjective element of a model===

In modern historiography of the ancient world πόλις is often transliterated to polis without any attempt to translate it into the language of the historiographer. For example, Eric Voegelin wrote a work in English entitled &quot;The World of the Polis&quot;. In works such as this the author intends to define polis himself; i.e., to present a model of society from one or more of a list of ancient Greek cities (poleis) culled from ancient Greek literature and inscriptions.

For example, Voegelin describes a model in which &quot;town settlements&quot; existed in the Aegean for a few thousand years prior to the Dorian invasions, forming an &quot;aggregate, the pre-Doric city&quot;. This type of city is not to be regarded as &quot;the Hellenic type of the polis&quot;. The Greeks set adrift by the Dorian invasions countered by joining (synoecism) to form the Hellenic poleis. The polis can thus be dated to this defensive resettlement period (the Dark Age). Quite a few poleis fit the model, no doubt, which was widely promulgated in the 20th century.

Classical Athens, however, is a paradox in this model, to which Voegelin has no answer. He says, &quot;in the most important instance, that of Athens, the continuity between the Aegean settlement and the later polis seems to have been unbroken.&quot; It seems a matter of simple logic that if Athens was a Hellenic polis in the time of the Hellenic poleis and was continuous with the pre-Doric city phase, then pre-Doric Athens must have been a Hellenic polis even then. The model fails in its chief instance.

A second approach to the modelling of the polis is not to use the word &quot;polis&quot; at all, but to translate it into the language of the historiographer. The model is thus inherent in the translation, which has the disadvantage of incorporating a priori assumptions as though they were substantiated facts and were not the pure speculations they actually are.

===Problems with Coulanges&#x27; ancient city===

One of the most influential of these translative models was the French La Cite antique, translated again into English &quot;the ancient city&quot;, by Coulanges. Only to read the title gives credibility to the idea that there is a model type inclusive of all ancient cities, and that the author need only present it without proving it. This type is based on the ancient practice of translating polis in Greek literature to civitas (early form of city) in Latin literature and vice versa.

Coulanges&#x27; confidence that the Greek and Italic cities were the same model was based on the then newly discovered Indo-European language: &quot;Go back as far as we may in the history of the Indo-European race, of which the Greeks and Italians are branches...&quot; The Greeks had a genos, &quot;family&quot;; the Italics, a gens. Corresponding to Greek phratry, a group of families, was the Italic curia. Corresponding to Greek phyle, a tribe of multiple phratries, was the tribus. The comparison of IE cultures is a solid technique, but it is not enough to develop a solid model of &quot;the ancient city&quot;, which must take historical disparities into consideration.

From the analogy Coulanges weaves a tale of imaginary history. Families, he asserts, originally lived dispersed and alone (a presumption of Aristotle as well). When the population grew to a certain point, families joined into phratries. Further growth caused phratries to join into tribes, and then tribes into a city. In the city the ancient tribes remained sacrosanct. The city was actually a confederacy of ancient tribes.
Coulange&#x27;s tale, based on the fragmentary history of priesthoods, does not much resemble the history of cities such as it survives. For example, there was no familial and tribal development of Rome. Livy (Book I), the grandest of the historians of early Rome, portrays a city formed under competitive duress by a collaboration of warriors, some of whom were from among the neighboring Etruscans, led by Romulus and Remus, the true descendants of the Trojans who with the aborigines had earlier formed the Latin people. They were not welcome among the Latins of Alba Longa, and so they had turned to raiding from their base in their seven hills. The myth supposes they had been nourished by a she-wolf and lived a wild life camping in the country. They were, however, supported by an ally. Evander had led a colony from Arcadia before the Trojan War and had placed a polis (Livy&#x27;s urbs) on one of the hills named Pallantium, later becoming Palatine. He had actually raised the Trojan boys and supported them now. When the band of marauders became populous enough Romulus got them to agree to a synoecism of settlements in the hills to form a new city, Rome, to be walled in immediately. Remus had to be sacrificed because he had set a precedent of jumping over the wall in mockery of it.

There were no families, no phratries, no tribes, except among the already settled Latins, Greeks, and Etruscans. The warriors acquired a social structure by kidnapping the nearby Italic Sabines (&quot;the Rape of the Sabine Women&quot;) and settling the matter by agreeing on a synoecism with the Sabines also, who were Latins. Alba Longa was ignored, later subdued. The first four tribes were not the result of any previous social evolution. They were the first municipal division of the city manufactured for the purpose. They were no sort of confederacy. Rome initially was ruled by Etruscan kings.

===Problems with the city-state===
Coulanges work was followed by the innovation of the English city-state by W. Warde Fowler in 1893. The Germans had already invented the word in their own language: Stadtstaat, &quot;city-state&quot;, referring to the many one-castle principates that abounded at the time. The name was applied to the polis by Herder in 1765. Fowler anglicised it: &quot;It is, then, a city-state that we have to deal with in Greek and Roman history; a state in which the whole life and energy of the people, political, intellectual, religious, is focused at one point, and that point a city.&quot; He applied the word &quot;polis&quot; to it, explaining that, &quot;The Latin race, indeed, never realised the Greek conception ... but this was rather owing to their less vivid mental powers than to the absence of the phenomenon.&quot;
Polis is thus often translated as &#x27;city-state&#x27;. The model, however, fares no better than any other. City-states no doubt existed, but so also did many poleis that were not city-states. The minimum semantic load of this hyphenated neologism is that the referent must be a city and must be a sovereign state. As a strict rule, the definition fails on its exceptions. A polis may not be urban at all, as was pointed out by Thucydides regarding the &quot;polis of the Lacedaemonians&quot;, that it was &quot;composed of villages after the old fashion of Hellas&quot;. Moreover, around the five villages of Lacedaemon, which had been placed in formerly Achaean land, were the villages of the former Achaeans, called the Perioeci (&quot;dwellers round&quot;). They had been left as supposedly free poleis by the invaders, but they were subject to and served the interests of the Dorian poleis. They were not city-states, failing the criterion of sovereignty.

Lacedaemon by the city-state rule thus falls short of being a polis. The earlier Achaean acropolis stood at the edge of the valley and was decrepit and totally unused. Lacedaemon had neither a city nor an acropolis, but all the historiographers referred to it as a polis. The rule of the city-state persisted until late in the 20th century, when the accumulation of mass data and sponsored databases made possible searches and comparisons of multiple sources not previously possible, a few of which are mentioned in this article.

Hansen reports that the Copenhagen Centre found it necessary to &quot;dissociate the concept of polis from the concepts of independence and autonomia&quot;. They were able to define a class of &quot;dependent poleis&quot; to consist of 15 types, all of which the ancient sources call poleis, but were not entirely sovereign, such as cities that had been independent, but were later synoecized into a larger polis, new colonies of other poleis, forts, ports, or trading posts some distance removed from their mother poleis, poleis that had joined a federation with binding membership, etc. The Perioeci were included in this category.

When the models are set aside as primary sources (which they never were) it is clear that historiography must be founded on what the authors and inscriptions say. 
Moreover, there is a time window for the active polis. The fact that polis was used in the Middle Ages to translate civitas does not make these civitates into poleis. The Copenhagen Study uses quite a few evidential indications of a probable polis, in addition to the manuscripts and inscriptions, some of which are victory in the Panhellenic Games, participation in the games, having an official agent, or proxenos, in another polis, presence of civic subdivisions, presence of citizens and a Constitution (Laws).

==Ancient Greek models==

===Aristotle&#x27;s polis===

Modern theorists of the polis are theorizing under a major disadvantage: their topic has not been current for thousands of years. It is not left to the moderns to redefine polis as though it were a living institution. All that remains to ask is how the ancients defined it. It is not to be redefined now; for example, a polis is not a list of architectural features based on ruins. Any community might have those. Moderns can only ask, what did the ancient Greeks think a polis is. Whatever they thought must per force be so, as they invented the term. There were no doubt many ancient experts on the polis, but time has done its work. The one surviving expert, Aristotle, is thus an indispensable resource.
A polis is identified as such by its standing as polis among the community of poleis. Poleis have ambassadors, can join or host the Hellenic Games, etc. According to Aristotle, their most essential characteristics are those that, if changed, would result in a different polis. These are three. A polis has a particular location, population, and constitution (&quot;politeia&quot;). For example, if a polis moves en masse, receives a different form of government, or an influx of new population, it is not the same polis.

Aristotle expresses two main definitions of polis, neither of which is possible as stated. In the second (see below for the first) a polis is &quot;a collection of citizens...&quot; (Book III I 2). If they already are citizens, then there is no need for anyone to collect to create a polis, as it already exists. If they are not citizens then they cannot be defined as a polis and cannot act as such. Aristotle&#x27;s only consistent meaning is that at the moment of collecting together a population creates a polis of which they are now citizens.

This moment of creation, however long it might be, is a logical necessity; otherwise, the citizenship recedes indefinitely into the unknown past. All current citizenships must have had their first moments, typically when the law-maker had gotten his laws ratified, or the colony had broken with the metropolis.

The ancient writers referred to these initial moments under any of several words produced with the same prefix, sunoik- (Latinized synoec-), &quot;same house&quot;, meaning objects that are from now on to be grouped together as being the same or similar. It is a figure of speech, the most general instance being sunoik-eioun, &quot;to be associated with&quot;, its noun being sunoik-eiosis, the act of association.

A second verb, sunoik-ein, &quot;to live together,&quot; can mean individuals, as in marriage, or conjointly, as in a community. The community meaning appears in Herodotus. A closely related meaning, &quot;to colonize jointly with&quot;, is found there also, and in the whole gamut of historical writers, Xenophon, Plato, Strabo, Plutarch; i.e., more or less continuously through all periods from Archaic to Roman. Associated nouns are sunoik-ia, sunoik-esion, sunoik-idion, sunoik-eses, sunoik-isis, a multiplication to be expected over centuries of a single language. These can all mean community in general, but they have two main secondary meanings, to institute a community politically or to enlarge the buildings in which it resides.

Finally in the Classical Period and later, the -z-/-s- extension began to be used, as evidenced in Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch: sunoik-izein, &quot;combine or join into one city&quot;, with its nouns sunoik-isis and sunoik-ismos, &quot;founding a city&quot;, from which the English scholarly term &quot;synoecism&quot; derives. All poleis looked back to a synoecism under any name as their source of &quot;politeia&quot;. Not all settlements were poleis; for example, an emporion, or &quot;market reserved for foreign trade&quot;, might be part of a polis or out on its own.

In any particular synoecism recorded by either ancient or modern epigraphists a major problem has been to fit the model credibly to the instance. For example, Thucydides refers to Spartan lack of urbanity as &quot;not synoecised&quot;, where synoecism is the creation of common living quarters (see above). Here apparently it means only the building of a central urban area. The reader of Plutarch knows that another synoecism existed, one instituted by Lycurgus, founder of the military state. The single overall synoecism is apparently double, one for the facilities, missing in this story, and one for the constitution.

He uses the same word to describe the legal incorporation of the settlements around Athens into the city by King Theseus, although no special building was required. The central polis already existed. In this story also there is a duality of synoecism with an absent change of physical facilities. Apparently a synoecism can be of different types, the selection of which depends on the requirements of the sunoikisteres. Lippman applies two concepts previously current, the political synoecism and the physical synoecism, to events at the polis of Pleuron (Aetolia) described by Strabo. Pleuron, in danger of being sacked by the Macedonians, was officially moved up the slope of a nearby mountain, walled in, and named Newer Pleuron. This act was a physical synoecism. After the Macedonian threat vanished the former location was reinhabited and called Old Pleuron. The old and the Newer were united with a political synoecism.

===The polis as community===
The first sentence of &quot;Politics&quot; asserts that a polis is a community (koinonia). This is Aristotle&#x27;s first definition of polis (for the second, see above). The community is compared to a game of chess. The man without community is like an isolated piece (I.9). Other animals form communities, but those of men are more advantageous because men have the power of speech as well as a sense of right and wrong, and can communicate judgements of good or bad to the community (I.10). A second metaphor compares a community to a human body: no part can function without the whole functioning (I.11). Men belong to communities because they have an instinct to do so (I.12).

The polis is a hierarchy of community. At the most subordinate level is the family (oikia), which has priority of loyalty over the individual. Families are bound by three relationships: husband to wife, owner to slave, and father to children. Thus slaves and women are members of the polis. The proper function of a family is the acquisition and management of wealth. The oikia is the primary land-holder.

The koinonia, then, applied to property, including people. As such it is just as impossible as the collection of citizens mentioned previously, which cannot be both all the citizens and simultaneously a collection of some of the citizens. Similarly property shared by all cannot be shared by men who do not own it. These fictions led to endless conflict between and within poleis as the participants fought for citizenship they did not have and shares they did not own.

A village (kome) is a community of several families (I.2). Aristotle suggests that they came from the splitting (apoikia, &quot;colonization&quot;) of families; that is, one village contains one or more extended families, or clans. A polis is a community of villages, but there must be enough of them to achieve or nearly achieve self-sufficiency. At this point of his theorization, Aristotle turns the &quot;common&quot; noun stem (koino-) into a verb, koinonizein, &quot;to share&quot; or &quot;to own in common&quot;. He says: &quot;A single city occupies a single site, and the single city belongs to its citizens in common.&quot;

Aristotle&#x27;s description fits the landscape archaeology of the poleis in the Copenhagen Study well. The study defines settlement patterns of first-, second-, and third-order. The third, dispersed, is individual oikiai distributed more or less evenly throughout the countryside. The other two orders are nucleated, or clustered. 2nd-order settlements are the komai, while the 1st order is the poleis. Approaching the polis from the outside of an aerial photograph one would pass successivle orders 3, 2, and 1.

By the end of Book I of &quot;Politics&quot; Aristotle (or one of the other unknown authors) finishes defining the polis according to one scheme and spends the next two books trying to tie up loose ends. It is generally agreed that the work is an accumulation of surviving treatises written at different times, and that the main logical break is the end of Book III. Books I, II, and III, dubbed &quot;Theory of the State&quot; by Rackham in the Loeb Edition, each represents an incomplete trial of the &quot;Old Plan&quot;. Books !V, V, and VI, &quot;Practical Politics&quot;, are the &quot;New Plan&quot;. Books VII and VIII, &quot;Ideal Politics&quot;, contains Aristotle&#x27;s replacement of Plato&#x27;s ideology, openly called &quot;communist&quot; by modern translators and theoreticians, of which Aristotle is highly critical.

The Theory of the State is not so much political by today&#x27;s definition. The politics are covered by the New Plan. The topic of the Old Plan is rather society, and is generally presented today in sociology and cultural anthropology. At the end of Book III, however, Aristotle encounters certain problems of definition that he cannot reconcile through theorization and has to abandon the sociology in favor of the New Plan, conclusions resulting from research on real constitutions.

The difficulties with the Old Plan begin with the meaning of koinonizein, &quot;to hold in common&quot;. Typically the authors of the Old Plan use the verb in such expressions as &quot;those holding in common&quot;, &quot;A holding in common&quot;, &quot;the partnership&quot;, and the like, without specifying who is holding what or what the holding relationship implies.

In Book II Aristotle begins to face the problem. The &quot;polis men&quot;, &quot;politai&quot;, translated as &#x27;citizens&#x27;, must logically hold everything there is to hold, nothing, or some things but not others (II.I.2). In this sociological context &quot;politai&quot; can only be all the householders sharing in the polis, free or slave, male or female, child or adult. The sum total of all the specific holdings mentioned in the treatise amount to the anthropological sense of property: land, animals, houses, wives, children, anything to which the right of access or disposition is reserved to the owner. This also happens to be Plato&#x27;s concept of property, not an accident, as Aristotle was a renegade Platonist. The polis, then, is communal property. The theory of its tenancy is where Aristotle and Plato differ sharply.

Plato had argued that the relinquishing of property to form the polis is advantageous, and the maximum advantage is maximum possession of common property by a polis. The principle of advantage is unity. The more united, the more advantageous (compare the action of a lever, which concentrates advantage). The ideal commun-ity would be commun-ism, the possession of all property by the community. Personal property, such as wives and children, are included (II.1).

Aristotle argues that this eminent domain of all property is actually a lessening of unity and would destroy the state. The individual is actually most united and effective; the polis the least. To take away the property and therefore the powers of the individual diminishes the state to nothing, as it is composed of citizens, and those citizens have been rendered null and void by the removal of their effectiveness. As an example Aristotle gives a plot of land, which owned by one man is carefully tended, but owned by the whole community belongs to no one and is untended.

The ideal state therefore is impossible, a mere logical construct accounting for some of the factors, but failing of others, which Aristotle&#x27;s examples suffice to demonstrate. For example, in some hypothetical place of no polis, a buyer would apply to an individual builder for a house. In an ideal polis, he would apply to the state, which would send other members of the united polis to do the work. They would also be sent for any other task: plumbing, farming, herding, etc., as any task could be performed by any member. This view is contrary, as Aristotle points out, to the principle of division of labor. The output of one professional building crew far exceeds the efforts any number of amateur ideal statists, rendering the ideal state incapable of sustaining itself.

Aristotle says, &quot;A collection of persons all alike does not constitute a state.&quot; He means that such a collection is not self-sufficient (II.1.4). He alleges the opposite: &quot;components which are to make up a unity must differ in kind ... Hence reciprocal equality is the preservative of states, as has been said before in &quot;(Nichomachean) Ethics&quot; (1132b, 1133a).&quot; In summary the argument there is &quot;For it is by proportionate requital that the city holds together ... and if they cannot do so there is no exchange, but it is by exchange that they hold together.&quot;

In short Aristotle had stated two systems of property, one in which the polis holds everything, distributing it equally, and one in which some property is held in common but the rest is privately owned. As the former only leads to a bankrupt state, the latter must be the one that prevails. For survival the citizens of each city build a privately owned pool of diverse resources, which they can exchange for mutual (&quot;reciprocal&quot;) benefit. The theory of equal reciprocity is nothing more than a statement that owners of diverse assets must make profitable deals with each other.

In Book III Aristotle begins presentation of the New Plan. The Old Plans had concerned themselves with the sociology of the community, concluding that the family, or house, was the smallest unit of the state, and using the term &quot;citizen&quot; to mean any family members, slave or free, of any age. The discovery of reciprocal equality brought the realization that in the supposedly synoecized polis a large amount of unsynoecized property was a sine qua non of sufficiency and therefore of the polis. The Old Plan was abandoned and the state was defined again in the New Plan.

The presence of private property in the polis meant that it might be owned by foreigners (xenoi), raising questions of whether a single state existed there at all, or if it did, whose was it (III.I.12). Anyone might own the property of the city. The whole purpose of synoecism was to create a single city for the benefit of the owners. These were the tribesmen of the villages. The need exists therefore to distinguish between citizens and others. The citizens can own common property, but the non-citizens, only private.

===The polis as state===
Polis is usually translated as &#x27;state&#x27;. &quot;Politics&quot; is from the adjective &quot;politika&quot; formed on polis. It concerned the affairs of the polis and is approximately equivalent to statesmanship. &quot;Politeia&quot; means what moderns mean by government. There are certain social activities that are generally agreed to be the concern of the whole community, such as justice and the redress of wrongs, public order, soldiering, and leadership of major events. The institutions that accomplish these goals are the government. It demands to be the object of greatest loyalty and the highest authority in the land. To this end laws are enacted to establish the government. Constitution as it is used of poleis signifies the social substructure, the people, and the laws of government.

Like polis, &quot;politeia&quot; has developed into a battery of meanings. This battery reveals the semantic presence of a concept inseparable from any polis; namely, citizenship. The population of a polis must be divided into two types: citizens (&quot;politai&quot;), and non-citizens. The latter are designated by no single term; &quot;non-citizen&quot; is a scholarly classification. The concept of citizenship means more or less what it does today. Citizens are members of the polity and as such have both rights and obligations for which they are held responsible.

According to Aristotle, a citizen is &quot;a person who is entitled to participate in government&quot;. A government that is the hands of its citizens is defined today as a republic, which is one meaning of &quot;politeia&quot;.

However, a republic is not an exclusive form of government; it is a type of many forms; e.g., democracy, aristocracy, and even limited monarchy. If the people have nothing at all to say, then no republic, no polis exists, and they are not citizens. A polis was above all a constitutional republic. Its citizens on coming of age took an oath to uphold the law, according to Xenophon, usually as part of their mandatory military service.
Citizenship was hereditary. Only families could provide young candidates for citizenship, but that did not mean they would be accepted. The government reserved the right to reject applications for citizenship or remove the status later. The &quot;politeia&quot; was a federal agency; there was nothing confederate about it. The duty officers did not have to obtain permissions from municipalities to exercise their sworn duties; they acted directly. If there were any legal consequences of these actions the accusers argued either that the magistrates had exceeded their authority or did not exercise it. The defense was a denial and an assertion of performance of duty.

The Copenhagen Study provides more definitive information about citizenship, and yet, it does not cover all the problems. Every polis once it had become so rejected the authority of all previous authoritative organizations and substituted new civic subdivisions, or municipalities, for them. Only citizens could belong to them, and only one per citizen. They were either regional (the deme) or fraternal (tribe, etc.). Furthermore, foreigners, slaves and women were excluded from them.

Aristotle had said (&quot;Politics&quot; III.I.9): &quot;Citizenship is limited to the child of citizens on both sides; that is, the child of a citizen father or of a citizen mother ...&quot;, which poses a difficulty in the model of the Copenhagen Study: since women cannot be citizens, there can&#x27;t be any citizen mothers. Hansen proposes a dual citizenship, one for males, and one for females: &quot;Female citizens possessed citizen status and transmitted citizen status to their children, but they did not perform the political activities connected with citizenship. They were astai rather than &quot;politai&quot;.&quot;

The use of gyne aste, &quot;female citizen&quot;, is rare, but it does appear in Herodotus with regard to the matrilineal system of Lycia. An astos is a male citizen, an aste, a female. One should therefore expect instances of the feminine of &quot;polites&quot;, which is &quot;politis&quot;, and there are a few instances in major texts. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot; speaks of &quot;politai&quot; (male) and &quot;politides&quot; (female) with reference to a recommendation that compulsory military training be applied to &quot;not only the boys and men in the State, but also the girls and women...&quot;.
In the model slaves also cannot be citizens. Although that seems to be generally true, there may be some exceptions. For example, Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Solon&quot; reports that Solon of Athens was called upon to form a new government in a social crisis, or stasis. The citizenry had been divided into a number of property classes with all the archonships going to the upper class. They had gone into the money-lending business requiring the lower-class borrowers to put up their persons or those of their families for collateral. Defaulters were sold into slavery at home and abroad. Now the lower classes had united and were pushing through a redistribution of property. In a panic, the upper class called on Solon to write a new constitution allowing them to keep their lands.

Solon took the reins as chief archon. Invalidating the previous laws he cancelled the debts, starting with the large one owed him, made debt-slavery illegal, and set free the debt-slaves, going so far as to buy back Athenian citizens enslaved abroad. The price the rebels had to pay was that the upper class kept their land. The classes were re-defined. Now even the propertyless could attend the assemblies and sit on the juries. Apparently for that period in Athens citizens could be slaves, unless the whole story has not been told.

Aristotle notes (II IV 12) that to maintain its population early Sparta &quot;used to admit foreigners to their citizenship&quot;. A foreigner here is any person from any polis not under Spartan jurisdiction. Whether the practice implies double citizenship is not stated. If it does not, then a change of citizenship, or successful immigration, must be presumed. Otherwise there might be a conflict of interest.
A polis is a binding and irrevocable agreement between formerly separate populations to form a united and indissoluable commonwealth. Once the agreement takes effect all previous social arrangements become null and void. The polis demands first loyalty and exercises the power of life or death over its constituents. Its subdivisions and its laws must prevail.

The organization of the government and the behavior of the constituents is governed by a constitution, or &quot;laws&quot;. The constitution further defines which of the constituents are empowered to conduct government (citizens) and which not (non-citizens). Citizenship is not construed to mean constituency in the polis but is only a status within it. The laws of the polis are binding on all members, regardless of citizenship. The polis is therefore a commonwealth. The type of government, however, may vary.

City-states, therefore, are not necessarily poleis. There must be another, unifying element that made both Athens, Sparta, and the hundreds of other known settlements poleis. The answer is, so to speak, hiding in plain sight: the demonyms. Athens could not be a polis without the Athenians, Lacedaemon without the Lacedaemonians, etc. The general word for these united populations was demos in the Athenian dialect, damos originally and in the Spartan dialect.

Etymologically the demos is not a unification of pre-existing populations, but is a division of a united population into units. The Indo-European root is *dā-, &quot;to divide&quot;, extended to *dā-mo-, &quot;division of society&quot;. Logically the division must be after the unification or there would be nothing to divide. How the whole can be a division is something of a problem. Demos can mean &#x27;the common people&#x27;, but if these are meant to be opposed to the non-common people then the non-commons must be excluded from the polis, an unlikely conclusion, since it is the non-commons who usually have the most to do with the unification to begin with.
The dictionary entry for demos shows that &quot;demos&quot; had a wide range of meanings, including either the whole population of the polis or any municipality of it, but not both for the same polis. The exact use depended on the polis; there was no one, universal way to synoecize into a polis. Athens especially used demos for &quot;deme&quot;, a municipality. After noting &quot;there was a grey area between polis and civic subdivision, be it a demos or a kome or a phyle...&quot;, Hansen remarks, &quot;demos does not mean village but municipality, a territorial division of a people...&quot;

The inventory of poleis published by the Copenhagen Study lists the type of civic subdivisions for each polis for which it could be ascertained (Index 13). Names from a tribal structure are common, such as oikia, gene (&quot;clans&quot;), phratriai (&quot;brotherhoods&quot;), and phylai (&quot;tribes&quot;), never the whole range; i.e., clans without brotherhoods, or tribes withous clans, etc., suggesting that the terminology came from a previous social structure not then active. Only one or two are used; exceptionally, several systems of subdivisions superimposed. Hansen suggests that these units, expressed generally in groups of komoi, were chosen because of their former role in synoecism, which also removed the former structures from service in favor of new municipalities.

In addition to these remnants of an earlier social organization are the demoi. All demoi are post-synoecic. Where the municipalities are demoi, they are the decision-making institution; i.e., the assembly (legislative branch) is of demoi. Those units also staff the boule (council) and the dikasterion (law courts). The fact that small poleis have only one demos suggests a way in which the demos could come to mean the whole population.

<text>Oxford is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. Oxford is the closest town to Lincoln University. The population was 5,733 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The borough was once called Oxford Crossing and Oxford Village during the 1700s.

In 1805, the Oxford post office was established. In 1833, Oxford was officially incorporated as a borough. Its first burgess (now called the mayor) was Thomas Alexander, who operated a general store thought to be the oldest building in Oxford.

The northern half of Oxford was owned by the Dickey family in the 19th century. The Dickeys included the local Presbyterian minister, the Mr O&#x27;Malley of the local bank, a state Representative, and local businessmen. Reverend John Miller Dickey and his wife Sarah Emlen Cresson founded Ashmun Institute in 1854, and which later became Lincoln University. The family played a major role in re-routing the new Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad (P&amp;BC) through Oxford. Track was laid in the 1850s. The railroad reached Oxford in 1860 and later connected to Philadelphia and Baltimore. By the time of the Civil War, Oxford was a bustling community. The business district on Third Street was entirely re-built at this time, including the Oxford Hotel (1858) and Oxford Hall (1862). Oxford became known for its confectionery and candy businesses and was the location of many manufacturing facilities. A second railroad, the Peach Bottom Railway, was built in the 1870s from Oxford to Peach Bottom. It carried farm products and passengers but was not profitable. It struggled through three bankruptcies and reorganized as the Lancaster, Oxford and Southern Railway, finally closing permanently in 1918.

The Pennsylvania Railroad took control of the P&amp;BC on the eve of World War I. Passenger train service on the line ended in 1935. In the late 20th century, transportation changes resulted in Oxford being located off the main roads. A bypass was constructed for U.S. Route 1 in the late 1960s, but the major change was the 1963 opening of Interstate 95, which shifted the bulk of the Philadelphia-Baltimore traffic away from Oxford. The former Pennsylvania Railroad Station is now the borough hall.

The Oxford Historic District and Oxford Hotel were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

<doc id="131860" wikidata="Q1021562" url="?curid=131860" title="Paoli, Pennsylvania">
<text>Paoli ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Chester County near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is situated in portions of two townships: Tredyffrin and Willistown. At the 2020 census, it had a total population of 6,002.

== History ==
Paoli grew around an inn kept in 1769 by Joshua Evans, whose father bought from William Penn in 1719 near the current site of the Paoli Post Office. Evans named his inn after General Pasquale Paoli, a Corsican, after Paoli had received the 45th and final toast at a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration. The inn&#x27;s location on the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, about 20 miles (one day&#x27;s drive for a horse-drawn wagon) from Philadelphia, contributed to its success.

===Battle of Paoli===

On the evening of September 20, 1777, near Paoli, General Charles Grey and nearly 5,000 British soldiers launched a surprise attack on a Patriot encampment, which became known as the Battle of Paoli. Having intercepted General Washington&#x27;s orders to General Wayne regarding British rearguard actions, Grey directed his troops to assault the small regiment of Americans commanded by Anthony Wayne in an area near his residence. Not wanting to lose the element of surprise, Grey ordered his troops to remove the flint from their muskets and to use only bayonets or swords to launch a surprise sneak attack on the Americans under the cover of darkness.

With the help of a Loyalist spy who provided a secret password, &quot;here we are and there they go&quot; and led them to the camp, General &quot;No-flint&quot; Grey and the British overran several American pickets and launched their successful attack on the Continental Army camp. 201 American soldiers were killed or injured, while 71 were captured. The British suffered only 4 killed and 7 injured in comparison. Wayne&#x27;s reputation was tarnished by the high casualties suffered in the battle, and he demanded a formal court-martial to clear his name. On November 1, a board of 13 officers declared that Wayne had acted with honor. The site of the battle is now part of nearby Malvern, Pennsylvania.

===Philadelphia Main Line===

The construction of the Main Line of Public Works across Pennsylvania enhanced the village&#x27;s stature, as the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad passed through it. This became the Pennsylvania Railroad, which built suburban commuter lines out from Philadelphia in the late 19th century, spurring the growth of that city&#x27;s suburbs. The largest and longest of these commuter lines, the &quot;Main Line&quot;, terminated in Paoli.

===Philadelphia Folk Festival===
&quot;The Homestead,&quot; the fifteen-acre farm of Colley Wilson, on the south side of Swedesford Road, was the scene of the first annual Philadelphia Folk Festival in 1962, and remained at that site until 1965. It outgrew the space when an estimated 15,000 people attended the final year. The site has been subdivided.
Gene Shay, a member of the Festival committee, observed after the first Festival, the site &quot;with its spacious grassy valleys, clean running brooks, shaded hillsides and rustic barns, supplied the perfect background for all of the musical activity.&quot;
In those few years Acts such as Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Mississippi John Hurt, Phil Ochs, Bill Monroe, Tom Rush, Tom Paxton, Rev. Gary Davis, Rambling Jack Elliott, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and other performers.

== Education ==
=== Primary and secondary schools ===
The Tredyffrin/Easttown School District serves the portions of Paoli in Tredyffrin Township. The section of Paoli in Willistown Township is served by Great Valley School District.

The portion of Paoli in T/E are divided between the zoned of Beaumont Elementary School in Easttown Township and Hillside Elementary School in Tredyffrin Township. The Great Valley elementary schools, Charlestown, K.D. Markley, Sugartown and General Wayne, all filter into Great Valley Middle School. Tredyffrin/Easttown operates two middle schools, Tredyffrin/Easttown and Valley Forge, and all district students attend Conestoga High School. Great Valley students attend Great Valley High School.

Delaware Valley Friends School is a school for those with learning differences in Paoli located next to Station Square, a business complex.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia operates Catholic schools. St. Norbert School is in Easttown Township, and is outside of the Paoli CDP, but has a Paoli mailing address. The school was established in 1956, with the school building built the following year.

===Public libraries===
Tredyffrin Township Libraries operates the Paoli Library in Paoli. The Paoli Library is part of the Chester County Library System.

==Transportation==
===Roads===

Paoli is served by the U.S. Route 202 freeway, U.S. Route 30 and Pennsylvania Route 252 connecting it to King of Prussia and Philadelphia. Historically, Paoli was on the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, which was later absorbed into the Lincoln Highway, and became US 30 still later. Many locals still call the route &quot;Lancaster Pike&quot;.

===Public transit===
For generations, Paoli was the western terminus of Pennsylvania Railroad commuter trains coming from Philadelphia on the Main Line. The &quot;Paoli Local&quot; became iconic in the western suburbs. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Keystone Service&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; trains stop at Paoli station, but with the decline of long-distance train travel, the stops are now less frequent.

Commuters traveling by rail within Southeastern Pennsylvania use the Paoli station, although most local trains serving Paoli now terminate in Malvern, one stop to the west. SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Paoli/Thorndale Line (formerly R5) commuter rail runs between Thorndale and Philadelphia both ways every 30 minutes during the week. College students and city-working suburbanites take the Paoli/Thorndale Line to school and work. Station-to-station, a trip from Paoli to Center City Philadelphia on the Paoli/Thorndale Line takes approximately 45 minutes, although some rush hour trains run directly between Paoli and 30th Street Station in under 30 minutes.

Paoli is served by multiple SEPTA Suburban Bus routes. Local buses traverse Route 30 along the Main Line, and Paoli Pike is the main artery for buses heading to West Chester. The Route 92 bus connects Paoli to West Chester and the King of Prussia Transit Center at the King of Prussia mall. The Route 106 bus links Paoli to the other Main Line communities and the 69th Street Transportation Center. The Route 204 and Route 206 buses connect the Paoli station to Eagleview and the Great Valley Corporate Center respectively.

In 2016, the majority of Paoli residents were found to drive alone on their way to work, while only 10.97% took public transportation.

<text>Phoenixville is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located northwest of Philadelphia at the junction of French Creek and the Schuylkill River. It is in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. According to a 2022 estimate, the population was 19,354.

For much of its history, Phoenixville was known for being home to the Phoenix Iron Works. Following the company&#x27;s closure in the 1980s and the resulting economic downturn, the town has been noted in recent years for the economic revitalization that has since taken place.

== History ==

The Phoenixville area was originally known as Manavon, after early-Chester County judge and politician David Lloyd bought a tract of land he named &quot;Manavon&quot; (believed to have come from Lloyd&#x27;s home parish of Manafon in Wales) in 1713. The town was originally settled in 1732. In its early years, Manavon developed around a grist mill situated upon the banks of the French Creek. In 1790, the French Creek Nail Works (later the Phoenix Iron Works) opened as the first nail factory in the United States, and would become the economic center of the town for nearly the next two centuries, producing notable products such as the Griffen gun and the Phoenix column.

During the early 19th century, Manavon saw an influx of Irish immigrants, mainly from County Donegal, who would construct a neighborhood on the banks of the Schuylkill River named &quot;Sceilp Level&quot; (an Irish term meaning &quot;water flowing over rock&#x27;s edge&quot;). These immigrants would help in the construction of the Schuylkill Canal in 1827 and the Black Rock Tunnel in 1838, which gave the north side of the town the name &quot;Tunnel Hill&quot;. On March 6, 1849, despite public opposition, Manavon was incorporated as a borough and was renamed &quot;Phoenixville&quot;, officially separating from Schuylkill Township.

In the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, Phoenixville experienced the arrival of a second wave of immigrants, this time mainly Poles, Italians, Ukrainians, and Slovaks. By the early 20th century, other manufacturing and retail industries would arrive in Phoenixville, joining with the Phoenix Iron Company (formerly the Phoenix Iron Works). One notable type of manufacturing in Phoenixville during this time was of the famous (and now highly collectible) Etruscan majolica pottery.

After World War II, the Phoenix Iron Company (now renamed the Phoenix Steel Corporation) began to fail, and by the mid-1980s, the company was no longer producing iron and steel. The company closed permanently in 1987. The closure of the long-time hub of the town&#x27;s economy resulted in an economic downturn, but beginning in the early 21st century, a town revitalization plan was put into effect which resulted in the creation of new businesses such as breweries, restaurants, and other retail outlets. The accompanying growth in population gave rise to an increase in the construction of new housing such as townhomes and apartment buildings.

Much of this history was recognized in 1987 by the creation of the Phoenixville Historic District, the largest National Register of Historic Places site in Chester County. The Black Rock Bridge, Gay Street School, and Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Etymology===
Phoenixville is named after the Phoenix Iron Works, the major employer in the town until its closure in 1987. Originally founded in 1790 as the French Creek Nail Works, in 1813, German engineer Lewis Wernwag bought the Nail Works and renamed it the Phoenix Iron Works after he described seeing a resemblance to the mythical phoenix bird in the heat from the factory furnaces. When the borough was incorporated in 1849, it took the name of the iron works.

==Attractions==
Phoenixville is home to the Colonial Theatre, which opened in 1903. The Colonial hosts events such as concerts and special movie showings year-round. The Colonial is celebrated for being the location of a scene in the 1958 science fiction horror film &quot;The Blob&quot;. &quot;Blobfest&quot; is celebrated every July in Phoenixville, during which attendees have the opportunity to reenact the scene from the film in which moviegoers flee the theatre in terror of the Blob loose inside. In 2017, a major expansion of the theatre incorporating the neighboring historic bank property was completed.

The Phoenixville Dogwood Festival has been celebrated in Phoenixville each May since 1943. The tradition dates back to when former Army Major General Edward C. Shannon planted a dogwood tree in Reeves Park in Phoenixville as a memorial to honor those in the Armed Forces. Each year, the festival features amusement rides, food vendors, the Dogwood Parade, and the crowning of the Dogwood Queen.

Each December since 2004, Phoenixville has held the annual Firebird Festival, a celebration of the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the town with the burning of a large wooden phoenix bird. The bonfire at the festival is used to harden clay birds crafted over the preceding weeks. &quot;Firebird: Built to Burn&quot;, an award-winning documentary that follows a year in the life of Phoenixville and the Firebird Festival, was released on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV in early 2025.

A Whole Lot of LuLu, a biannual vintage and handmade flea market, is held in Phoenixville.

Phoenixville is home to multiple parks and nature trails, including Reeves Park, Reservoir Park, Black Rock Sanctuary, and the Schuylkill River Trail. Phoenixville is also near Valley Forge National Historical Park and the Perkiomen Trail.

==Economy==
For much of its history, Phoenixville&#x27;s economy was centered around the Phoenix Iron Works, as much of the town&#x27;s population was employed by the company. After the company&#x27;s closure in 1987, the town experienced an economic downturn, as many of the former steel workers were left without jobs. Beginning in the early 21st century, plans were made to revitalize the town. Although attempts were unsuccessful at first, by the early 2010s, new restaurants, shops, and apartment buildings were constructed, mainly in the downtown area.

One result of Phoenixville&#x27;s revitalization has been the arrival of several new craft breweries and distilleries. The presence of so many craft breweries has made Phoenixville a &quot;destination-brewery location&quot;.

One impact of Phoenixville&#x27;s economic revitalization has been an increase in the cost of living for residents, partially the result of increased demand for housing caused by the growth of local restaurants, breweries and boutiques in town. As a result of these issues, the Phoenixville Borough Council created the Phoenixville Affordable Housing Task Force in 2017, which then evolved into the Phoenixville Council on Affordable Housing in 2018.

==Transportation==
=== Roads and highways ===
As of 2019, there were of public roads in Phoenixville, of which were maintained by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

Phoenixville is served by three state highways: Pennsylvania Route 23, Pennsylvania Route 113, and Pennsylvania Route 29. PA 23 follows a northwest-to-southeast alignment through western and southern sections of the borough via Nutt Road. PA 23 heads northwest to Elverson and southeast to King of Prussia. PA 113 follows a southwest-to-northeast alignment through western and northern parts of the borough via Kimberton Road, Nutt Road, Bridge Street, Gay Street, Franklin Avenue, Emmett Street, Dayton Street, Freemont Street and Black Rock Road. PA 113 heads southwest to Downingtown, and northeast to Trappe. PA 23 and PA 113 share a short concurrency in the western portion of the borough on Nutt Road. Finally, PA 29 follows a southwest-to-northeast alignment through southern and eastern sections of the borough via Main Street, Manavon Street, Starr Street and Bridge Street. PA 29 heads southwest to Malvern, providing access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and northeast to Collegeville, providing access to U.S. Route 422. Less than a mile northwest of the Phoenixville borough is the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 724 at an intersection with PA 23. Although not within the borders of the borough, PA 724 provides a connection for the Phoenixville area to Pottstown.

=== Public transportation ===
Phoenixville is currently served by two of SEPTA&#x27;s Suburban Division bus routes. The Route 99 bus connects Phoenixville with the Manayunk/Norristown Line Regional Rail service at the Norristown Transportation Center, and the Route 139 bus connects Phoenixville with the King of Prussia Mall and Limerick.
Several major railroads once served Phoenixville. The Reading Company Main Line entered the east side of town via a station above Bridge Street. The line passes under the north side of town in the Black Rock Tunnel, the third railroad tunnel constructed in the United States. Regular commuter trains last stopped at the Phoenixville station in 1981, when SEPTA ceased operating non-electrified commuter lines, and the former station is now used as an event space. Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) currently utilizes the line on a daily basis as part of its Harrisburg Line. Phoenixville was also where the former Pickering Valley Railroad joined the Reading. The Pickering Valley was operated as a subsidiary of the Reading that connected Phoenixville to Byers, near Eagle. In 1906, the railroad was formally merged into the Reading, and became the Pickering Valley Branch of that railroad. The branch was closed in the late 20th century, and most of the track has been removed.The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) Schuylkill Branch also served Phoenixville. The line enters town crossing the Schuylkill River from neighboring Mont Clare on a high bridge, north of French Creek. The line passes along the north side of the former Phoenix Iron Works site. The station southwest of the intersection of Vanderslice and Gay Street, no longer exists. Past the Iron Works, the line splits, with the main fork turning north and passing through the now abandoned Phoenixville Tunnel, which partially collapsed in the 1990s, and continuing northwest of the town toward Reading. The other fork, which served as the former Phoenixville Branch of the PRR, turns southwest, continuing along the Pickering Creek Valley and joining the former PRR Main Line in Frazer. A section of the line remains in place, and is currently known as the Phoenixville Industrial Track (owned by Norfolk Southern). Passenger service on the line had ceased by the end of the 20th century, and regular freight service on the line ceased in 2004. During the 2008 replacement of the Gay Street Bridge, the line was severed at its crossing of Main Street and the rail bridge over Main Street was later raised by 14 inches to allow better access for emergency vehicles.

Beginning in 2000, interest to resume passenger rail service in Phoenixville was spurred by the Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) project, which would have connected Phoenixville to Reading and Philadelphia. However, funding for the project was ultimately rejected in 2006. Shortly after, another project called the Greenline, led by the group Citizens for the Train, was proposed as an alternative to the SVM. It would have utilized the Phoenixville Industrial Track and the former Phoenixville Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad to give Phoenixville a rail connection to Oaks and Paoli, which could then be used to connect to Philadelphia via the Paoli/Thorndale Line of SEPTA Regional Rail. However, no funding was ever allocated to move the project forward.

In mid-2018, Phoenixville began a study to restore SEPTA passenger rail service to connect Phoenixville to Norristown, which would then connect to Philadelphia. In 2020, PennDOT finalized a study to extend passenger rail service from Norristown to Reading, which would include a stop in Phoenixville. In 2021, Amtrak revealed a similar plan that would allow rail service from Reading to New York City, which would also include a stop in Phoenixville.

<text>Thornbury Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,017 at the 2010 census. It is adjacent to, and was once joined with, Thornbury Township, Delaware County.

==History==

Thornbury Township was organized in 1687 with the appointment of Hugh Durborrow as constable and received its name from Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, England. At the time, no more than five or six families lived within the limits of the township. George Peirce, one of the earliest and most influential inhabitants of the township, was married to a native of Thornbury, England, and the township was purportedly named to compliment her. Thornbury, Birmingham and Westtown townships are the only townships within the present limits of Chester County which were organized before 1704.

The township was divided when Delaware County was separated from Chester County in 1798. As a result, there is a Thornbury Township in each county. Landowners were allowed to choose which county they wished to be in, causing the line between the two townships, and the two counties, to be very irregular.

The Battle of Brandywine, part of the American Revolutionary War took place partially in the town. It was one of Thornbury&#x27;s citizens, Squire Thomas Cheyney, who informed George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, of the approach of the British troops.

The Squire Cheyney Farm and William J. Barnard Residence are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Toughkenamon is a census-designated place (CDP) in New Garden Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,492 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The area known as Toughkenamon was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans who spoke Unami. In the original survey, in 1700, the surveyor notes that he crossed the Dochcanamon Hill. Other forms of spelling this name were used, such as Tokenamon, Taukenamon, Taughlikenemon.

Thomas and Mary Rowland settled in the valley, near the present village of Toughkenamon, in 1706, being perhaps the first settlers who purchased lands in New Garden Township. They came to the township from old Ashton Township, old Chester County, now in Delaware County.

Toughkenamon has been of significant importance in the development of the United States. First, the characteristics of the interactions between settlers and Lenapes was a microcosm of the conflicts that would occur in the future. For example, the farmers dug trenches around their crops, and filled them with water, to prevent reoccurrence of the conflagration that occurred when local Lenapes started a burn. The fact that the original Toughkenamon settlers maintained water-filled trenches is evidence that they had dialogue and an understanding of the importance of the burn. The traditional burn was an ancient way to increase yields of local grains and tubers, and increase the deer population. But later settlers no longer interacted with the departed tribe, so falsely assumed the burns had been solely aimed at destroying their ancestors&#x27; crops, adding to mistrust of remaining Native-American families in nearby counties.

Toughkenamon Hill has been quarried for centuries.

In later centuries Toughkenamon was considered a village. It was an early industrial center due to its strategic location on the old Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., easy access to raw materials such as wood, water and ore. Even today, businesses critical to national wholesale distribution of perishable foods are located in and near Toughkenamon.

==Geography==

Toughkenamon is located at (39.829874, -75.758847).

The Philadelphia &amp; Baltimore Central Railroad (now East Penn Railroad) parallels Baltimore Pike, originally crossing the Pennsylvania Rail Road in Avondale. East Penn Railroad now connects Toughkenamon to the national freight network at Chadd&#x27;s Ford. New Garden Airport is to the northeast on Toughkenamon Hill.

<text>Tredyffrin Township ( ) is a township located in eastern Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 29,332 at the 2010 census. 

Settled in the late 17th century, Tredyffrin is bounded by Delaware and Montgomery counties. It includes on its northern boundary a small part of Valley Forge National Historical Park, where George Washington encamped during the American War of Independence. Tredyffrin and the entire Great Valley region also have many limestone deposits. Tredyffrin is the most populous township in Chester County.

Unincorporated communities within Tredyffrin Township include Chesterbrook, Strafford, a portion of Paoli, and a portion of Wayne, Howellville at the intersection of Swedesford and Howellville Roads, and East Howellville, along Howellville Road, west of the intersection of Howellville Road and the border between Tredyffrin and Easttown Townships. Tredyffrin is bordered by Easttown, East Whiteland, Willistown, Charlestown, Upper Merion, Radnor and Schuylkill townships.

== History ==
On March 13, 1684, William Penn decided to set aside a portion of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania for settlements for Welsh immigrants. This area, known as the &quot;Welsh Tract&quot;, was surveyed in 1684 and included several modern-day townships, including Tredyffrin. Although the Welsh Tract was originally meant to be a self-ruling municipality, it was divided between Chester County and Philadelphia when that county was created in 1685, and the Welsh subsequently submitted to the authority of Chester County. In 1707, Tredyffrin was incorporated as a township. This name comes from the Welsh &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;town&quot;, joined to &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;wide, cultivated valley&quot;. Tredyffrin was quick to develop into a thriving township. In 1710, the first mill in Tredyffrin was started by Thomas Jerman on what is now North Valley Road. Swedesford Road, one of the first roads in the township, was created by 1718.

As the population of the township grew, with 30 resident landowners in 1722 and 83 in 1774, churches sprung up to meet the demand by religious residents. In 1710, the Baptist minister Hugh Davis moved to the Great Valley from Britain and, there being several Baptist families in this area, the Baptist Church in the Great Valley was formed on April 22, 1711. The church originally met in Radnor. However, there were enough members of this Baptist church that by 1722, a log building was erected in Tredyffrin to serve the congregation.

As Tredyffrin includes part of Valley Forge National Historical Park, there are many Revolutionary War-related sites in the township, especially the park and houses where various generals were quartered.

Development in the township was sparked in the 19th century by construction and advertisement of the &quot;Main Line&quot; railroad service, which terminated in Paoli, which straddles the western border of the township.

Tredyffrin-Easttown school district was unusual for the area in being racially integrated during the early part of the century. In 1932, the district planned to segregate after building a new school, and African Americans in the township boycotted the school system for two years in protest (the &quot;School Fight&quot;). In 1934 a negotiated settlement was reached whereby the schools remained integrated, and helped kill school segregation in Pennsylvania.

During the Cold War, a Nike anti-aircraft missile site was active in the township. It was located off Le Boutillier Road, near Swedesford Road.

The rocks of Tredyffrin were laid down in the upper Paleozoic, meaning that they are primarily metamorphic. Limestone is often at the surface in the Great Valley, so many limestone kilns were created in the 18th century.

The northern edge of the township is a ridge of quartzite and sandstone (the Cambrian Chickies Formation) including Valley Forge Mountain (or Mount Misery), which was mined for quartz in the 18th century through the mid-19th century.

===Public libraries===
Tredyffrin Township Libraries operates Tredyffrin Public Library and Paoli Library.

The Tredyffrin Library, with of space as of 1977, is located in the Strafford community. The architectural firm Mitchell/Giurgola developed the Tredyffrin Library. It has an amphitheater that is focused on a park in a southward direction. The library has a single large reading room. The library building has a larger two-story end, while the other end has only one story at the upper level. Offices at the main level are in a separate element of the structure from the main reading room, and this structure juts out from the flue. &quot;Architectural Record&quot; said that this &quot;allows direct access to the reading room from the public entrance.&quot; In 1990 a new children&#x27;s library was created on the lower level of the building in previously unfinished space.

As the community continued to grow and change, plans were finalized in 2004 to renovate and expand Tredyffrin Library. In September 2007, the library broke ground for a $6 million renovation and expansion. On January 31, 2009, the entire expanded building was open to the public for the first time.

&quot;Architectural Record&quot; stated that Tredyffrin Library and the library built in Condon Hall of the University of Washington School of Law, which was also designed by Mitchell/Giurgola, have common underlying concepts. According to the publication, the shared concepts were &quot;unusual sensitivity in using natural light to best advantage while warding off the sun,&quot; a &quot;quickly apparent organization of functions,&quot; and being &quot;responsive to the varying situations in which it is built.&quot;

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===

As of 2011, there were of public roads in West Chester, of which were maintained by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and were maintained by the borough.

US 202 and US 322 are the major highways serving the area, though both bypass West Chester Borough on the limited-access West Chester Bypass. US 202 heads northeast to King of Prussia and south to Wilmington, Delaware while US 322 heads northwest to Downingtown and southeast to Chester. US 322 Business still follows the original alignment of US 322 and part of the original alignment of US 202 through West Chester along Hannum Avenue, Chestnut and Market streets, and South High Street.

The main east–west road to West Chester is West Chester Pike, which begins in Upper Darby Township, Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia, and is part of Pennsylvania Route 3 (PA 3). The West Chester Pike originally existed as a private turnpike connecting Philadelphia and West Chester between 1850 and 1918, when it became a public road. In West Chester, PA 3 follows Market Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound. The main north–south road in West Chester is High Street. To the north of town, the road is known as Pottstown Pike, which connects to PA 100 near Exton (PA 100 formerly ran through town). To the south of town, the road is known as Wilmington-West Chester Pike. Other state routes serving West Chester include PA 162 and PA 842, which head west towards Unionville, and PA 52, which heads southwest towards Kennett Square.

===Public transportation===

West Chester is home to the West Chester Transportation Center, which serves as a parking garage for the Chester County Justice Center and a bus terminal, which is located on the lower level of the facility. Three of SEPTA&#x27;s Suburban Division bus routes serve West Chester. The Route 92 bus connects West Chester to the King of Prussia Transit Center, the Route 104 bus runs between West Chester University and the 69th Street Transportation Center, mostly following West Chester Pike, and the Route 135 bus connects West Chester to Exton, Downingtown, and Coatesville. The Route 104 bus replaced a trolley service that connected West Chester to Philadelphia along the West Chester Pike between 1898 and the 1950s. West Chester is also served by the Transportation Management Association of Chester County&#x27;s SCCOOT, which provides service to Kennett Square and Oxford.

Until September 1986, West Chester was served by SEPTA&#x27;s Media/Wawa Line commuter rail line, then known as the Media/West Chester Line. Service on the line was discontinued because of poor track conditions west of Elwyn station. At the time, SEPTA had limited funds for the necessary repairs and offered Chester County the option of either improving the rail line or expanding parking availability at the nearby Exton station on SEPTA&#x27;s Paoli/Thorndale Line. The county opted for the latter, and service on the line was cut back to Elwyn (service was re-extended to Wawa station in August 2022). The rail line into West Chester is used by the West Chester Railroad, a heritage railroad.

== Geography ==
Hudiksvall is located approximately from Stockholm, from Gävle, and from Sundsvall.

The municipality furthermore comprises several islands, such as Agön, Innerston, Kråkön, and Olmen,

In the old history, the industry was dominated by fishing. In the 19th century the forest industry came to dominate, further enhanced by the improved transportations which the rail roads provided in the second half of that century. Although in decline during the 20th century, half of the municipal industry is still based around forest industry.

<text>Ljusdal Municipality (&quot;Ljusdals kommun&quot;) is one of Sweden&#x27;s 290 municipalities within Gävleborg County. Its seat is Ljusdal.

The municipality was formed in 1971 by the amalgamation of the market town (&quot;köping&quot;) of Ljusdal (instituted in 1914) with the rural municipalities Järvsö, Färila, Los and Ramsjö.

Ljusdal is known for its successful bandy team and for the annual Bandy World Cup that used to be held in the town.

== Geography ==
Geographically the town is located on the shores of the river Ljusnan, along the shores of which Sweden&#x27;s northern main line railway (&quot;Norra Stambanan&quot;) stretches. The municipality calls itself &quot;Sweden&#x27;s nearest Norrland&quot;, with Norrland being historically how Sweden&#x27;s north was referred to. Geographically, the municipality is located at the centre of Sweden.

In this large municipality (Sweden&#x27;s 25th largest) there are several nature activities one can enjoy. Along Ljusnan there are a total of 40 kilometers of water ways, with possibilities for sailing, rafting, fishing or taking a tour with the tour boats.
Hamra National Park is also located partly within the western parts of the municipality.

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Ljusdal Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 14,791 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 48.1% voted for the left coalition and 50.8% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== History ==
The area had a large immigration from Finland in the 17th and 18th century in the western part of the municipality known as Orsa Finnmark (in Dalarna). Still there are many names which trace this Finnish influence. In Ljusdal a museum dedicated to the regions history is now located in a former dairy, and in Järvsö there is the Stenegård cultural centre.

The population was boosted when the mainline railway was constructed here in the late 19th century.

==Tourism==
Tourism in the municipality is focussed on Järvsö. Popular tourist activities in Järvsö include skiing on Järvsöbacken and visiting Järvzoo.

===Nature===
Gröntjärn Nature Reserve is located in Ljusdal Municipality around 20 kilometers north of Ljusdal. Here several Kettle holes formed during glacial retreat, where ice blocks melted under sediments. The pool is not fed by streams but by groundwater and can see large variations in the lake level. The ground water source also gives the lake it is characteristic turquoise-green colouring.

<text>West Grove is a borough in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,775 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The village of West Grove derived its name from the Friends Meeting House on Harmony Road built in 1787 several miles west of the Friends Meeting House in the village of London Grove. West Grove was separated from London Grove Township and became an incorporated borough on November 29, 1893. However, the decree of incorporation was not recorded until January 9, 1894, to prevent confusing the tax accounts of London Grove Township and to eliminate the need for a special borough election.

The move for incorporation followed several years of significant growth in West Grove that began to develop with the coming of the Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad in 1860. On March 28, 1885, the &quot;Daily Local News&quot; described West Grove as &quot;one of the most flourishing villages in this county&quot; and stated that &quot;it contains some three flouring mills and the largest nursery for rose culture [see below] in the United States (Dinger &amp; Conrad, Co.), a large casket factory (Paxson Comfort) and a large number of dwellings.&quot; In May 1885, the &quot;Chester County Democrat&quot; reported that thirty new homes were under construction in the village of West Grove.

The &quot;Father of West Grove&quot; was Joseph Pyle. Born in Penn Township in 1836, Joseph Pyle opened a general store in 1860 in the brick building that is currently empty. This building was constructed by Pyle and is believed to be the oldest brick structure in the center of town. Joseph Pyle constructed many of the commercial buildings along the present-day Exchange Place, including the Roselyn Theater Building in 1867 (torn down in 1980), the National Bank of West Grove building in 1883 and the K&amp;P Building in 1885. Appointed postmaster of the borough by President Lincoln in 1864, Pyle served twenty-two years. Furthermore, Pyle introduced the manufacture of brick, planned and installed the first public water system, was President of the West Grove Improvement Company which financed the construction of the casket factory in 1885, served on Borough Council and was Burgess (Mayor) from 1900 to 1903.

The first election of borough officials was held in the West Grove Hotel on February 20, 1894. John P. Cheyney was elected the first burgess (mayor) in what amounted to a Democratic landslide. The Democrats won every office, including mayor, six school directors, two squires, constable, assessor and tax collector, two assistant assessors, three auditors, town clerk and high constable. The first council meeting was held March 6, 1894, in the Library Room on the second floor of the National Bank Building on Exchange Place. The current mayor of West Grove is Stephen B. Black, Republican, who has been in office since August 2000.

===Home of the Roses===

In 1868 Charles Dingee and Alfred Fellenberg Conard founded the Dingee &amp; Conard Nursery, a commercial grower of fruit trees, roses and other nursery products. In the late 1880s the West Grove Post Office was the second largest in Chester County, mostly due to the volume of nursery products shipped by Dingee &amp; Conard.

Located near the borough of West Grove is the Red Rose Inn, which was established in 1740. William Penn originally granted land for the inn subject to an annual rent payment of one red rose. The inn was subsequently renamed in honor of this event.

<text>West Marlborough Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 814 at the 2010 census. East Marlborough and West Marlborough townships were carved out of the larger Marlborough Township in 1729.

West Marlborough Township is a second class township, governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors, who meet monthly at the township garage in the village of Doe Run. Other elected officials include an auditor, constable, and political party committee members. A Planning Commission is appointed by the supervisors and serve to advise the supervisors as to real estate subdivision, zoning, the township comprehensive plan, and similar matters.

==History==
For many years the King Ranch was the largest landowner in West Marlborough Township and adjoining municipalities Newlin and East Fallowfield townships. The ranch property, operated as Buck and Doe Run Valley Farms, Inc., received Texas longhorn cattle shipped north by railroad for fattening on the lush grass of eastern Pennsylvania before being delivered to cattle markets for sale and slaughter. The heart of the King Ranch property was preserved by land conservation easements in the 1980s through the tireless efforts of a number of local public spirited citizens. Today, much of the rich pasture and scenic vistas remain preserved perpetually from encroachment by intensive land development. Over time, the King Ranch still remains true to its roots with many families still today living there their whole life.

It was incorporated in 1851, and held the first town election on March 21, 1851.

In laying out the town, Mr. Callen reserved three acres for building a Presbyterian Church and cemetery, and deeded an open lot north of Main street, where the town spring was located, to the town. He built his house south of Licking Township, where local legend claimed there was a large poplar tree:

&quot;This tree grew from a twig used by Mr. Callen as a riding whip. On his return from church at Concord one Sunday he stuck the whip into the ground, and this lone poplar stands today as a monument to the piety of him who planted it.&quot;

<text>Foxburg is a borough in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located along the east bank of the Allegheny River, about north of the mouth of the Clarion River. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 181.

==History==
The town takes its name from the Fox family of Philadelphia, former owners of the land upon which the town was built. Samuel Mickle Fox (1763–1808), along with his brother George and brothers-in-law Joseph Parker Norris and George Roberts, purchased a number of tracts of land in western Pennsylvania from the Commonwealth during the 1790s. Six of these tracts, numbered #5725–5730, comprising , were contiguous and located along the Allegheny north of its confluence with Toby&#x27;s Creek (today&#x27;s Clarion River). The present town of Foxburg is located on what was designated tract #5729.

Samuel&#x27;s son Joseph purchased these tracts from his father&#x27;s estate in 1816 and established a residence here ten years later. This was south of the town near the mouth of the Clarion. It became known to generations as &quot;the Fox Mansion&quot; or simply &quot;the Mansion&quot;. Succeeding generations would make it a seasonal residence for the next 140 years.

== Horsethief Days Festival ==
Knox is known locally as &quot;The Horsethief Capital of the World&quot;, due to its annual Horsethief Days festival in the last week of August.

=== History ===
Horsethief Days began when Sebastian (Boss) Buck started stealing horses and changing them, in order to resell them without the original owners knowing they were their horses. He would sell them in the South along with other members of his crew who sold them in the North. Boss didn&#x27;t have much of an education, but even so he was the mastermind behind the Horsethief operation.

His Horsethieving business was mostly unchecked because people weren&#x27;t aware he was doing it, so it was like a free money vacation for him. He had other members of his clan in the south steal horses and bring them to Clarion County. The reason he was in Clarion County was because the county was the head quarters, the “Horsethief Capital”. Boss never worked alone. He never stole a horse by himself; he had other people with him. When the police found out about this, they went and got a warrant for his arrest. He went into hiding for a while and after they gave up on him, he came out and started stealing horses and making fake money again. He was the top criminal of the United States of America at one point until finally he got caught and was arrested. After release from jail, he lived a normal life and never stole a horse again. The Horsethief Days festival is in remembrance of this critical part of the county&#x27;s history.

=== Events ===
Horsethief Days has many different events year-to-year, but most commonly seen are the antique car show, yard sales, bike races, tractor / lawn mower races, live music (most nights), and the Horsethief Days Parade on the final day of the festival.

<doc id="131927" wikidata="Q626045" url="?curid=131927" title="Halland">
<text>Halland () is one of the traditional provinces of Sweden (&quot;landskap&quot;), on the western coast of Götaland, southern Sweden. It borders Västergötland, Småland, Scania and the sea of Kattegat. Until 1645 and the Second Treaty of Brömsebro, it was part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Its name means &quot;Land of Rocky Slabs&quot; (Swedish: &quot;hällar&quot;) referring to the coastal cliffs of especially the northern part of the region.

==Administration==
The provinces of Sweden serve no administrative function. Instead, that function is served by the Counties of Sweden. However, the province of Halland is almost coextensive with the administrative Halland County, though parts of the province belong to Västra Götaland County and Skåne County, while the county also includes parts of Småland and Västergötland.

As of 31 December 2023, Halland had a population of 351,508.

==Heraldry==
During the Danish era until 1658, the province had no coat of arms and no seal. In Sweden, however, every province had been represented by heraldic arms since 1560. When Charles X Gustav of Sweden suddenly died in 1660 a coat of arms had to be created for the newly acquired province, as each province was to be represented by its arms at the royal funeral. There are several theories about the choice of a lion. Bengt Algotsson, duke of Halland and Finland in the 14th century, used a lion in his personal arms, blazoned &quot;Azure, a Lion rampant Argent langued and armed Gules.&quot;

The same coat of arms was later granted for the administrative Halland County, which has almost the same boundaries.

==Geography==
The rivers of Viskan, Ätran, Nissan and Lagan flow through the province and reach the sea in Kattegat. Halland is well known for its fertile soil and as an agricultural district.

Most of the region is made up of a relief unit known as the Sub-Mesozoic hilly peneplain. Around Morup and Tvååker hilltops are remnants of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain, an ancient erosion surface that covers much of eastern Sweden. Loose flint nodules of Cretaceous age have been found around Halland. The flints are remnants of a former cover of sedimentary rock that has been eroded. At present the sedimentary cover continues to exist in Scania, Denmark and offshore.

== History ==
===Early history===
The Bronze Age was probably a period of relative prosperity in Halland. This is shown in the number of new settlements and the numerous archaeological remains. Over 1,100 tumuli and grave mounds have been found.

The end of the Bronze Age witnessed an over-consumption of resources. Large areas were deforested. This might have been a result of a high demand for charcoal in smelting gold or bronze among the local elites.

The worsening climate at the beginning of the Iron Age meant that the local elites no longer could obtain bronze to the same extent as before. As a result, the social structures collapsed.

The early Iron Age social structures seem to have been relatively egalitarian, but from around 200 AD there was a trend in which villages formed larger communities and small kingdoms. This is likely to have been a distant influence from the growing Roman Empire. During the 5th and 6th century large free-standing farms were created; they grew larger as time passed. An example of such a farm can be found in Slöinge.

It was not just the social structure that changed, so too did the settlement structure. New villages were formed, while old ones were abandoned. The new centers that were formed became the kernel from which new areas were settled during medieval times.

===800–1645 AD===
According to information from a trader travelling from Skiringssal, close to the Oslofjord to Hedeby in the 870s it can be concluded that Halland was a Danish area at that time. It would stay so for most of recorded history.

Iron extraction is known to have taken place in Hishult and Tvååker/Sibbarp during the Iron Age.

As part of the Scanian lands (then part of the Kingdom of Denmark) Halland came under the Scanian Law and participated in the Scanian Thing, one of three Things electing the Danish king. Local assemblies took place in Getinge.

Halland was the scene of considerable military action from the 13th century and on as Sweden, Denmark and to some degree Norway fought for supremacy in Scandinavia. The many wars made the province poor. Not only were material damages caused by military action, but the social impact of the fighting was devastating; people lacked the motivation to invest in their land and properties as it was likely to be destroyed anyway.

The county was the site of combat and plunder three times during the 13th Century: in 1256 Haakon IV of Norway invaded, followed by Magnus III of Sweden in 1277 and Eric VI of Denmark in 1294. The county came to be split in two parts for the next century, with the river Ätran forming a boundary. The lords of the two parts succeeded each other in a high tempo.

As the Kalmar Union was formed, Halland came for a brief period of time to be centrally located. According to the union treaty, the king was to be elected in Halmstad.

During the rebellion of Engelbrekt in 1434 the fortress in Falkenberg was burnt down and two years later was captured by the Swedes. The Swedo-Danish struggles in the early 16th century came to affect the province as well, as in 1519 when the border regions were sacked by the Swedes as a vengeance for similar Danish action in Västergötland.

The Danish civil war called the Count&#x27;s Feud in 1534–1536, the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1563–1570 and the Kalmar War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1611–1613 all affected Halland. One of the major battles of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, the battle of Axtorna, took place in Halland.

===After 1645===
Halland was temporarily (for a period of 30 years) transferred to Sweden in 1645 under the terms of the Second Treaty of Brömsebro. The conquest was later made permanent by the ceding of the province in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The last battle in Halland took place in Fyllebro on 17 August 1676, during the Scanian War.

The more peaceful conditions that followed meant that the province could start to develop again. The 19th century saw the farming develop quickly to become one of the more efficient in the country by the end of the century. Parts of the province did however remain poor and erosion and blown sand remained a problem for much of the century. The county did therefore see a lot of emigration, continuing well into the 20th century.

The 20th century has seen the province becoming one of the fastest growing in Sweden, as it has doubled its population since World War II. This is in part due to the northern parts, such as Kungsbacka and Onsala, more or less becoming suburbs of Gothenburg.

===Cities===
During Danish rule, privileges to towns in Halland were granted to:
*Falkenberg (1558)
*Halmstad (1307)
*Kungsbacka (approximately 1400)
*Laholm (approximately 1200)
*Varberg (approximately 1100)
Such privileges have no official significance nowadays.

=== Hundreds ===
Hundreds of Sweden were provincial divisions until the early 20th century, when they lost importance. Halland&#x27;s hundreds were: Faurås Hundred, Fjäre Hundred, Halmstad Hundred, Himle Hundred, Höks Hundred, Tönnersjö Hundred, Viske Hundred and Årstad Hundred.

== Culture ==
The language varieties spoken in Halland are together called &quot;halländska&quot;, though they belong to two main dialectal groups. In northern Halland a variation of the Götaland dialect is spoken and in the south the spoken language is a variety of Scanian.

== Sights ==
* Varberg Fortress, a medieval fortress.
* Tjolöholm Castle, a castle and museum in the Kungsbacka Fjord, just off of the Swedish coast. 

==Dukes of Halland==

As early as the 13th century, southern Halland was given as duchy to a branch of the Danish royal family. In the 14th century, it was given to various relatives and friends of Danish and Swedish royal families, such as Bengt Algotsson (during 1353–1357).

Since 1772 Swedish royal princes have been nominated dukes of provinces without political significance. Such a title was held by Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland (1912–1997), who was survived by his wife Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland (1976–2013), and currently is held by Prince Julian (since 2021).

==Sports==
Football in the province is administered by Hallands Fotbollförbund. Team handball is also popular, with HK Drott, HK Aranäs and HK Varberg.

<doc id="131928" wikidata="Q385625" url="?curid=131928" title="Metic">
<text>In ancient Greece, a metic (Ancient Greek: , : from , , indicating change, and , &#x27;dwelling&#x27;) was a resident of Athens and some other cities who was a citizen of another polis. They held a status broadly analogous to modern permanent residency, being permitted indefinite residence without political rights.

==Origin==
The history of foreign migration to Athens dates back to the archaic period. Solon was said to have offered Athenian citizenship to foreigners who would relocate to his city to practice a craft. However, metic status did not exist during the time of Solon.

Scholars have tended to date the development of metic status to the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. However, the rate of the increase in the Athenian population in the years following 480 BC is difficult to explain by purely natural growth – suggesting that immigrants to Athens could still become Athenians citizens at this point, and metic status did not yet exist. The first known use of the word is in Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;Persians&quot;, first performed in 472 BC. However, James Watson argues that the word was used in &quot;Persians&quot; in a non-technical sense, meaning nothing more than &quot;immigrant&quot;. Rebecca Futo Kennedy dates the origin of metic status in Athens to the 460s, while Watson argues that the legal status of being a metic did not develop until 451 BC – the same year as Pericles introduced his citizenship law.

== Metics in classical Athens ==
One estimate of the population of Attica at the start of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC found the male metic population to be ~25,000, roughly a third of the total. The majority of metics probably came to Athens from nearby cities, seeking economic opportunities or fleeing from persecution, although there are records of immigrants from non-Greek places such as Thrace and Lydia.

In other Greek cities (&quot;poleis&quot;), foreign residents were few, with the exception of cosmopolitan Corinth, of which however we do not know their legal status. In Sparta and Crete, as a general rule with few exceptions, foreigners were not allowed to stay (Xenelasia). There are also reported immigrants to the court of tyrants and kings in Thessaly, Syracuse and Macedon, whose status is decided by the ruler. Due to these complications, the legal term &quot;metic&quot; is most closely associated with classical Athens. At Athens, the largest city in the Greek world at the time, they amounted to roughly half the free population. The status applied to two main groups of people—immigrants and former slaves. As slaves were almost always of foreign origin they can be thought of as involuntary immigrants, drawn almost exclusively from non-Greek speaking areas, while free metics were usually of Greek origin. Mostly they came from mainland Greece rather than the remote parts of the Greek world.

Metics held lower social status primarily due to cultural rather than economic restraints. Some were poor artisans and ex-slaves, while others were some of the wealthiest inhabitants of the city. As citizenship was a matter of inheritance and not of place of birth, a metic could be either an immigrant or the descendant of one. Regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. From a cultural viewpoint such a resident could be completely &quot;local&quot; and indistinguishable from citizens. They had no role in the political community but might be completely integrated into the social and economic life of the city. In the urbane scene that opens Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;—the dialogue takes place in a metic household—the status of the speakers as citizen or metic is never mentioned.

Metics typically shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform military service and, if wealthy enough, were subject to the special tax contributions () and tax services (&quot;liturgies&quot;, for example, paying for a warship or funding a tragic chorus) contributed by wealthy Athenians. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica, whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption. Neither could they sign contracts with the state to work in the silver mines, since the wealth beneath the earth was felt to belong to the political community. Metics were subject to a tax called the , assessed at twelve drachmas per year for metic men and their households, and six for independent metic women. In addition to the , non-Athenians wishing to sell goods in the agora, including metics, seem to have been liable to another tax known as the .

Although metics were barred from the assembly and exempted from jury service, they did have the same access to the courts as citizens. They could both prosecute others and be prosecuted themselves. A great many migrants came to Athens to do business and were in fact essential to the Athenian economy. It would have been a severe disincentive if they had been unable to pursue commercial disputes under law. At the same time they did not have exactly the same rights there as citizens. Unlike citizens, metics could be made to undergo judicial torture and the penalties for killing them were not as severe as for killing a citizen. Metics were also subject to enslavement for a variety of offences. These might either be failures to abide by their status obligations, such as not paying the tax or not nominating a citizen sponsor, or they might be &quot;contaminations&quot; of the citizen body like marrying a citizen or claiming to be citizens themselves.

How long a foreigner could remain in Athens without counting as a metic is not known. In some other Greek cities the period was a month, and it may well have been the same at Athens. All metics there were required to register in the deme (local community) where they lived. They had to nominate a citizen as their sponsor or guardian (&quot;prostates&quot;, literally &#x27;one who stands on behalf of&#x27;). The Athenians took this last requirement very seriously. A metic without a sponsor was vulnerable to a special prosecution. If convicted, his property would be confiscated and he himself sold as a slave. For a freed slave the sponsor was automatically his former owner. This arrangement exacted some extra duties on the part of the metic, yet the child of an ex-slave metic apparently had the same status as a freeborn metic. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of &quot;equal rights&quot; () under which they were freed from the usual liabilities. Metics, regardless of status, could participate in most religious rituals; only a few were reserved to citizens.

The status divide between metic and citizen was not always clear. In the street no physical signs distinguished citizen from metic or slave. Sometimes the actual status a person had attained became a contested matter. Although local registers of citizens were kept, if one&#x27;s claim to citizenship was challenged, the testimony of neighbours and the community was decisive. (In Lysias 23, a law court speech, a man presumed to be a metic claims to be a citizen, but upon investigation—not by consulting official records but by questions asked at the cheese market—it transpires that he may well be a runaway slave, so the hostile account attests.)

Metics whose family had lived in Athens for generations may have been tempted to &quot;pass&quot; as citizens. On a number of occasions there were purges of the citizen lists, effectively changing people who had been living as citizens into metics. In typical Athenian fashion, a person so demoted could mount a challenge in court. If however the court decided the ejected citizen was in fact a metic, he would be sent down one further rung and sold into slavery.

In studying the status of the metics, it is easy to gain the impression they were an oppressed minority. But by and large those who were Greek and freeborn had at least chosen to come to Athens, attracted by the prosperity of the large, dynamic, cosmopolitan city and the opportunities not available to them in their place of origin. Metics remained citizens of their cities of birth, which, like Athens, had the exclusionary ancestral view of citizenship common to ancient Greek cities.

The large non-citizen community of Athens allowed ex-slave metics to become assimilated in a way not possible in more conservative and homogenised cities elsewhere. Their participation in military service, taxation (for the rich of Athens a matter of public display and pride) and cult must have given them a sense of involvement in the city, and of their value to it. Though notably, while Athenians tended to refer to metics by their name and deme of residence (the same democratic scheme used for citizens), on their tombstones freeborn metics who died in Athens preferred to name the cities from which they had come and of which they were citizens still.

===Aftermath===
The term &quot;metic&quot; began to lose its distinctive legal status in 4th century BC, when metics were allowed to act in the court without a prostate (patron) and came to an end in Hellenistic Athens, when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of Demetrius Phalereus in ca. 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves (Athenaeus, vi. p. 272 B). In the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a polis were called &quot;paroikoi&quot; (see etymology of &quot;parish&quot;), and in Asia Minor .

== Modern French usage ==
In French, was revived as a xenophobic term for immigrants to France. This sense was popularized in the late 19th century by the nationalist writer Charles Maurras, who identified metics as one of the four primary constituents of the traitorous &quot;Anti-France&quot;, along with Protestants, Jews, and Freemasons. This pejorative sense remains current in the French language, and has to some extent been reappropriated by French people of immigrant background. In 1969 the Greco-French singer Georges Moustaki recorded a song, , which has since been covered by several artists of immigrant descent.

<text>Falkenberg Municipality (&quot;Falkenbergs kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Halland County on the Swedish west coast. The town Falkenberg is the municipal seat.

The municipality was created in 1971 when the &quot;City of Falkenberg&quot; was amalgamated with six rural municipalities (themselves formed by the 1952 local government reform) and part of a seventh. There are 24 original entities within the area.

Today, Falkenberg holds a strong position in the food and beverage industry with companies such as Arla Foods, Carlsberg and SIA Glass having plants in the city. In the inland Gekås, a major department store, draws visitors from all over the country. Falkenberg is also a tourist city, mainly for its many beaches.

==Economy==
The main income for the Municipality is tourism from around Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Holland and Norway. The food industry is important. Here has Carlsberg Brewery a plant with 570 employees and Arla Foods who makes cheese has a factory with 400 employees. Other important workplaces is the Gekås shoppingcentre in Ullared which has more than 1,100 employees. The centre is a &quot;Mecka&quot; for low-price shoppers and the company earns more than 
2 700 000 000 (340 500 000 US Dollars) kronor each year. The shoppingcentre in Wal-Mart style (almost without food)company has 3,800,000 visitors each year which makes it Sweden&#x27;s most visited place.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Falkenberg Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 46,717 inhabitants, including 35,872 Swedish citizens of voting age. 47.7% voted for the left coalition and 51.3% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Politics==
The Right Party was the major party until 1931, when the Social Democratic Party gained that position. The municipality has, however, been a stronghold for the centre-right, whose parties have led the municipality thereafter, except for the period between 1994-1998 and 2018-. The current mayor is Per Svensson (Socialdemokratic Party) and the deputy mayor is Annelie Andelén (Centre).

==Localities==
There are 17 urban areas (also called a &quot;tätort&quot;, or locality) in Falkenberg Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of 31 December 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

== Parks ==

* Bengtesgård meadow, a nature reserve

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
The municipality is twinned with:
* Borgarfjörður, Iceland
* Gniezno, Poland
* Leirvík, Faroe Islands
* Pieksämäki, Finland
* Ullensaker, Norway
== Notable natives ==
*Pär Zetterberg, football player

<text>Laholm Municipality (&quot;Laholms kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Halland County in southwest Sweden. The seat is located in Laholm.

The amalgamation process during the local government reform in the 1970s took place in two steps. In 1971 the &quot;City of Laholm&quot; merged with two rural municipalities forming the unitary municipality and three years later four more units were added.

== Localities ==
There are 14 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Laholm Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2010. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

This is a demographic table based on Laholm Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 26,276 residents, including 20,080 Swedish citizens of voting age. 38.3% voted for the left coalition and 60.6% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==
Below are the results listed since the 1973 municipal reform. Between 1988 and 1998 the Sweden Democrats&#x27; results were not published by the SCB due to the party&#x27;s small size nationwide. &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes the percentage of the electorate casting a ballot, but &quot;Votes&quot; only applies to valid ballots cast.

===Riksdag===
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<doc id="131935" wikidata="Q103679" url="?curid=131935" title="Jämtland County">
<text>Jämtland County (, ) is a county or &quot;län&quot; in Sweden. It consists of the provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen, along with minor parts of Hälsingland and Ångermanland, plus two small strips of Lapland and Dalarna. It borders the counties of Dalarna, Gävleborg, Västernorrland, and Västerbotten, as well as the Norwegian county of Trøndelag. It measures and constitutes 12% of Sweden&#x27;s total area, making it the country&#x27;s third largest county. The capital is Östersund. The county governor and leader of the administrative board, as appointed by the Swedish government, has been Marita Ljung since 2021.

The county was established in 1810, at which time it consisted only of the provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen, which is why the coat of arms is a shield parted per fess with their provincial arms. His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf is occasionally referred to as Duke of Jämtland after his title of king.

== Province ==
Jämtland County consists of primarily the provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen, though minor parts of Hälsingland and Ångermanland are also included, along with small uninhabited areas in Lapland and Dalarna.

== Administration ==
The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfill the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests and promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor. See List of Jämtland Governors.

== Demography ==
Jämtland County is sparsely populated and more than one-third of the population lives in the countryside, making Jämtland County the second largest rural region in Sweden, after Gotland County. However, most of the population lives in the rather densely populated region surrounding lake Storsjön, commonly called &quot;Storsjöbygden&quot;, &quot;the Storsjö district/countryside&quot;.

== Politics ==
The county is dominated by the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party, which is unique in Sweden, but corresponds to the situation in the bordering Norwegian county of Nord-Trøndelag. The county is rather contrastive in the political field. While the municipality association and a majority of the municipalities are governed by liberal-conservative (, lit. &quot;bourgeois&quot;) majorities or by coalitions overstepping the bloc border, the county council is red-green and the Social Democrats receive three out of five mandates to the Riksdag.

After the Swedish county council election in 2018, the following political parties are represented in the Jämtland county council ():

== Riksdag elections ==
The table details all Riksdag election results of Jämtland County since the unicameral era began in 1970. The blocs denote which party would support the Prime Minister or the lead opposition party towards the end of the elected parliament.

<text>Härjedalen Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Jämtland County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Sveg.

The municipality roughly, but not exactly, corresponds with the traditional province Härjedalen.

The municipality was created in 1974 and is one of two in Sweden with the name of a province (Gotland Municipality is the other). It consists of nine original local government entities (as of 1863).

==Geography==
With a total area of , it is Sweden&#x27;s fifth largest. However, it is largely wilderness, and the municipality is sparsely inhabited. For comparison, the municipality covers as much territory as Uppsala County and Stockholm County combined, but those two counties have over 2,000,000 inhabitants.

===Localities===
There are eight localities (or urban areas) in Härjedalen Municipality:

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Härjedalen Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 8,125 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 50.0% voted for the left coalition and 48.7% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Riksdag==

This table lists the national results since the 1972 Swedish municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats from 1988 to 1998 were not published by the SCB at a municipal level due to the party&#x27;s small size nationally at the time.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

<text>Strömsund Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Jämtland County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Strömsund.

The nearest larger city is Östersund, the provincial capital of Jämtland, which is located approximately 100 km to the south.

==History==
Strömsund Municipality was formed in 1974 through the amalgamation of the former municipalities of Fjällsjö, Frostviken, Hammerdal and Ström. The most populous locality in the area, Strömsund, was chosen as administrative centre, and it also gave its name to the new entity.

==Geography==
With an area of roughly , it is the sixth largest in Sweden, and one of the most sparsely populated. The town Strömsund has a municipal population of about 3,500 and is located on the slopes of Ströms vattudal, the river that flows through the town. Among locals, the town itself is usually referred to as &quot;Ström&quot; or &quot;Flata&quot; (a reference to the flack slope on which the central parts of the town is built).

===Localities===
There are seven localities (or urban areas) in Strömsund Municipality:

== Demographics ==
This is a demographic table based on Strömsund Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

==Economy==
Forest industry has traditionally been an important industry, but today tourism also has an important part. Like the rest of Jämtland, nature is what attracts visitors, with its blend of forests, mountains, lakes and rivers.

The two most visited sights are Hembygdsgården in Strömsund (16,000 visitors) and Hällingsåfallet (12,000 visitors).

Another popular site is the cave Korallgrottan.

<doc id="131965" wikidata="Q306789" url="?curid=131965" title="Östersund Municipality">
<text>Östersund Municipality (, ) is a municipality in Jämtland County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Östersund, which is also the county seat of Jämtland County.

The present municipality was formed in 1971 by the amalgamation of the City of Östersund with five surrounding rural municipalities.

==Localities==
There are ten localities (or urban areas) in Östersund Municipality:

==Politics and governance==
Swedish municipalities are responsible for government-mandated duties, and elections for the municipal council (&quot;kommunfullmäktige&quot;) are held every four years, parallel to the general elections.

===Political history===
Östersund gained a city council (&quot;stadsfullmäktige&quot;) in 1863, known as &quot;Östersunds stad&quot;, and each member was elected through a single-winner voting system. Sweden was democratized in the end of the 1910s and a more parliamentarian election system was introduced. Östersund continued to be governed by the &quot;burghers&quot;, unlike Sweden nationally. The dominating parties were the conservatives, the freeminded and the social democrats. The latter did become the single largest party in 1938 but due to a strong centre-right majority it remained in opposition. The only other party present in Östersund was the communists, though they had little support in the city, having entered the city council in 1922 and lost representation completely in 1930. The conservatives was by far the largest party and had a majority of its own with 18 seats in 1922. After the municipal elections of 1950 the situation had changed. The conservatives was the smallest party with 10 seats, the liberals (now represented by the Liberal People&#x27;s party) had 11 and the social democrats 19. This was in contrast to the turnout on a national level, where the social democrats had been the dominant party for over a decade gaining e.g. 46 percent of the votes in the general elections of 1948. In 1952 a social democrat was appointed chairman of Östersund&#x27;s governing body, due to the lack of political blocs and the strive for mutual agreements.

A majority for the social democrats was achieved first in 1962. The political scene was shortly afterwards altered, in 1966, when the agrian and rural Centre Party (previously known as &quot;Peasant&#x27;s League&quot;) got into the city council, after broadening its scope to include non-farmers, alongside the Christian Democrats (though not present on the national political scene) and the communists returning after a 40-year period of absence. &quot;The burghers&quot; was thus back in power. Following the rise of Swedish welfare the small municipalities could not cope with their assigned duties. As a result, large municipality blocks were introduced and &quot;Östersunds stad&quot; was heavily enlarged and several districts kilometres away from the city were included in the new &quot;Östersund Municipality&quot;.

The first election for the new municipality was held in 1970 and it was a large success for the Centre Party, both locally in Östersund and nationally due to its opposition towards centralisation. Having entered in 1966 with 4 seats it now possessed one fourth of the total number of seats (which was mainly due to support from the city, not the newly included rural areas). Block politics formation became prominent and the Centre Party became the leading party for the centre-right block, whilst the Social Democrats came to dominate the left block. The Social Democrats regained power in 1980 and has since governed Östersund Municipality until present day (excluding a brief period in the 1990s) supported by the communists (after 1991 known as the Left Party) and occasionally the Green Party. The Green Party has been in the municipal council since 1982.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Östersund Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

Residents include everyone registered as living in the district, regardless of age or citizenship status. Valid voters indicate Swedish citizens above the age of 18 who therefore can vote in general elections. Left vote and right vote indicate the result between the two major blocs in said district in the 2022 general election. Employment indicates the share of people between the ages of 20 and 64 who are working taxpayers. Foreign background is defined as residents either born abroad or with two parents born outside of Sweden. Median income is the received monthly income through either employment, capital gains or social grants for the median adult above 20, also including pensioners in Swedish kronor. The section about college graduates indicates any degree accumulated after high school.

In total there were 49,635 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 58.5% voted for the left coalition and 40.2% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Amish country along the Great Shamokin Path==

A corridor of Amish settlements developed in the 19th and 20th centuries roughly along the Great Shamokin Path as a means of travel and migration through Clearfield, Jefferson, Indiana and Armstrong counties, beginning at Big Spring near Luthersburg, Clearfield County, and ending in Rural Valley in Armstrong County. Amish settlements exist near the villages of Troutville in Clearfield County; Big Run, Cloe and Punxsutawney in Jefferson County; Smicksburg in Indiana County; and Rural Valley in Armstrong County. Amish buggies co-mingle with automobiles through the corridor. The Troutville Amish settlement in Brady Township, Clearfield County, is good-sized and has eight church districts. The settlement has farms, trades and small shops. Troutville was named for Jacob Trautwien who settled the area in 1832.

The Smicksburg Amish settlement is centered on the borough of Smicksburg, Indiana County, about 10 miles southwest of Punxsutawney. An example of a new community formed by migration, it is the third-largest Amish settlement in Pennsylvania, and the eleventh largest in the U.S. The Smicksburg settlement has 18 church districts and was founded in 1962. Amish here drive Midwestern-style black buggies. Smicksburg was founded in 1827 by the Reverend J. George Schmick. Most of the residents are Amish. The population was 46 at the 2010 census, and this is one of the smallest incorporated boroughs in Pennsylvania. The Smicksburg settlement has specialty shops featuring Amish wares of handcrafts, quilts, furniture, foods and eating establishments.
Rural Valley is a borough in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, where the Cowanshannock Creek flows west leading to the Allegheny River. The population was 876 at the 2010 census. The regional high school, West Shamokin High School, bears the name of the historic Great Shamokin Path.

<text>Jönköping County () is a county or &quot;län&quot; in southern Sweden. It borders the counties of Halland, Västra Götaland, Östergötland, Kalmar and Kronoberg. The total county population was 356,291 inhabitants in September 2017. The capital and largest city is Jönköping. About one quarter of the total county population lives in the combined Jönköping-Huskvarna urban area around the southern point of Lake Vättern.

== Provinces and administrative history ==
Despite being commonly used to indicate the geographical, cultural and historical region, the larger historical province &quot;(landskap)&quot; of Småland, which most of Jönköping County is part of, has no administrative or political significance today. Jönköping County has existed as an administrative division since the 17th century, and constitutes the north-western part of Småland, the other parts being Kronoberg County in the south-west and Kalmar County in the east. Jönköping County was periodically united with neighbouring Kronoberg County in the single Jönköping and Kronoberg County until 1687. Until the 18th century the administration was housed in the Renaissance fortress at Jönköping Castle, which was demolished in the 19th century; the former site of the castle is still the site of the County Administrative Board building and the Governor&#x27;s residence.

Habo Municipality and Mullsjö Municipality, from the south-eastern part of the historical province of Västergötland, are since the dissolution of Skaraborg County in 1998 also part of Jönköping County; both municipalities joined Jönköping County as the results of local referendums in 1997.

== Administration ==

The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfill the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests and promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor. The seat of residence for the Governor or &quot;Landshövding&quot; is the city of Jönköping. See the list of Jönköping Governors.

== Politics ==
The main responsibilities of the County Council of Jönköping, or &quot;Landstinget i Jönköpings län&quot;, are the regional public healthcare system and public transport. The County Council Assembly &quot;(landstingsfullmäktige)&quot;, which is the elected body for regional municipal issues, is elected every four years concurrently with the Riksdag elections.

The county&#x27;s best-known parliamentary representative was the late Olof Palme, leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1969 to 1986, and twice Prime Minister of Sweden from 1969 to 1976 and from 1982 to 1986.

Jönköping County is the strongest electoral region of the Christian Democrats, who traditionally have a large following among members of evangelical churches in the region. The County Council Assembly and most of the municipalities in the county are governed by liberal-conservative, center-right coalitions. The Social Democrats have historically been strong in mill towns and industrial districts of Jönköping County.

In the 1922 prohibition referendum which would have banned the sale of alcohol in Sweden, Jönköping County at 81.5% had the strongest support for the ban.

<text>Gislaved Municipality (&quot;Gislaveds kommun&quot;) is a municipality in Jönköping County in southern Sweden, with its seat located in the town Gislaved.

The municipality was created in 1974, when Gislaved locality where amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities to form an entity of unitary type. There are seventeen original units making up the present municipality. Within Sweden, and as part of Gnosjö region, it&#x27;s regarded as being both cultural and industrially dominated. The municipality is notably home to Scandinavian Raceway in Anderstorp, the only Swedish circuit to host a Formula One Grand Prix as it held the Swedish Grand Prix for six years in the 1970s.

==History==
The municipality has been inhabited for a long time, but without any significant urban areas. At the turn of the 19th century it contained some 700 inhabitants. By 1949 it was eligible to receive rights as a &quot;köping&quot;, comparable to town rights. A coat of arms was designed for the occasion, traditionally used by the cities of Sweden. When the municipal reform was carried out in the 1970s, Gislaved adapted the still unused coat of arms as the municipal arms. The arms depict the insignia for a historical hostel nearby.

There are 19 churches in the municipality, the oldest from 1350. In the small town of Burseryd is a church bell that is even older. Its inscription was made with the Futhark alphabet and reads in translation &quot;The year Anno Domine 1238 was this bell made. Bero wrote the inscription&quot;. It is today the second oldest church bell in Sweden.

== Geography==
There are six nature reserves in the municipality. Rare plants and animals include the provincial flower the Twinflower (Linnaea borealis), the only flower named after the botanist Carl von Linné. Lake Bolmen lies in the south-east part of the municipality, with its main part in the Ljungby Municipality. It is the tenth largest lake in Sweden and offers fishing, canoeing and other nature activities.

Gislaved used to have a large tire factory under the same name as the town but it has shut down.

===Localities===
There are eight urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Gislaved Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2015. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
