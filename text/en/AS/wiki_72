<text>Sunbury ( ) is a city and the county seat of Northumberland County in Pennsylvania, United States. Located in the Susquehanna Valley, Sunbury is positioned on the east bank of the Susquehanna River.

Sunbury&#x27;s roots stretch back to the early 18th century. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 9,905. The city is one of the three principal cities in the larger Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area.

Sunbury is connected to inventor Thomas Edison. In 1883, the Hotel Edison became the first building in Sunbury to be illuminated by Edison&#x27;s innovative three-wire electrical system. The hotel was later named in honor of Edison.

Sunbury is home to the Beck House and the Northumberland County Courthouse. The Sunbury Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
 
The first human settlement of Sunbury were likely Shawnee migrants. A large population of Delaware Indians was also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canassatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was present-day Sunbury.

From 1727 to 1756, Sunbury was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania. At that time, it was known as Shamokin, not to be confused with the present-day city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located about 13 miles to the east.

In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.

In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, &quot;to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance.&quot; According to Weslager, &quot;the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut.&quot;

The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions.

However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhütten massacre in 1755, and Shamokin was abandoned in May 1756. Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 1756 on the former site of the village of Shamokin. The Bloody Spring is a historic site from the era.

On March 21, 1772, Northumberland County was incorporated and subdivided. The settlement was named Sunbury that same year, and the present-day city of Sunbury identifies 1772 as the date of its establishment. It was named after Sunbury-on-Thames, a town in the Surrey borough of Spelthorne, England, just outside Greater London.

Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart and of Salieri, lived in Sunbury for some years after his arrival in America.

In July 1883, American inventor Thomas Edison installed the first successful three-wire electric lighting system in at what was then known as the City Hotel. At the city&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration in 1922, it was renamed the Edison Hotel.

==In popular culture==
In the episode titled &quot;Nixon vs. Kennedy&quot; in first season of the AMC cable drama &quot;Mad Men&quot; a train supposedly carrying the unrecognizable body of Pvt. Dick Whitman, who was killed in the Korean War, arrives in Sunbury. The escort officer with the casket is said to be Lt. Don Draper, and the casket is met by Dick Whitman&#x27;s adoptive mother, his half brother, Adam and his mother&#x27;s second husband. In fact, the person killed in Korea was Don Draper, and Dick Whitman has switched identities with Draper. Though Dick Whitman posing as Draper attempts to hide, Adam Whitman sees him, recognizes him, and chases the train as it leaves the station.

On September 29, 2020, Sunbury was featured on the Comedy Central television series Tosh.0 in a recurring video category called &quot;Shithole of the Week&quot;, a segment in which host Daniel Tosh takes images or videos of various communities found online and will select the &quot;Winner&quot; based on the comedic negative features based in that community.

Nearby city Shamokin was a previous &quot;winner&quot; of the same segment in 2016.

==Parks and recreation==
The extensive Sunbury Riverfront Park Project is in the planning and implementation stages in Sunbury. An extensive floodwall protection system was designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1951. Additional height was added to the wall in 2003. The system has provided protection from 15 major flood events over the past 50 years. In 1972, flood waters from Hurricane Agnes crested at at Sunbury, two feet higher than the crest in 1936. The wall held back the water and residents showed their gratitude in messages they wrote on the wall.

 Hurricane Agnes in late June 1972 was blamed for 10 deaths in Lancaster County, eight in Dauphin County, five in York County and four in both Northumberland and Luzerne counties, according to the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.

Additionally, a multimillion-dollar fish ladder is being built across the river in Shamokin Dam to mitigate the impediment of the shad migration up the Susquehanna River caused by the annual inflation of the Adam T. Bower Fabri Dam.

The Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam, an inflatable fabric-tube dam barrage impounding the Susquehanna River, creates the Augusta Lake for recreation. It is inflated in May and deflated in the fall. The new waterfront development in Sunbury will provide a marina with transient boat docks, walking trails, gardens, an amphitheater and a new accessible fishing pier. Three acres of land will be added to the river side of the flood wall.

The city offers baseball fields, a skating park, tennis courts, playgrounds, a community pool and a small park that is next to the county courthouse, in the downtown area.

A vacant building in the Shikellamy State Park along the river is under consideration for redevelopment as an environmental research and education center. Designed in the 1960s, the facility was originally the Basse Beck Environmental Center. It has been empty for several years.

==Economy==
The city and state struggle economically, part of America&#x27;s &quot;Rust Belt&quot;. A Brookings Institution publication has cited reasons including a lack of inter-municipal coordination and cooperation, a changing employment base and a dearth of jobs paying a living wage, out-migration of young people, an aging population, the need for workforce development, and an inequitable local tax structure.

The Greater Susquehanna Valley United Way in 2006 commissioned a study regarding what matters most in area communities. They found that some major concerns were alcohol and drug use among all age groups and its effects on the community, the dependency on social services and assistance across generations, and a lack of public transportation. It is the intention of the organization to focus spending on these issues.

The Susquehanna Industrial Development Corporation (SIDCO) received $173,500 in planning grant funding (2005) to support the redevelopment of the Wilhold Manufacturing facility in Sunbury. The BOS funding paid for a market study, phase II environmental study, wetland review, traffic impact study and title survey. The site, an former rail yard and plastic manufacturing plant, is to be developed into four, shovel ready sites. It was suggested that the redevelopment of this facility will result in the creation of 120 jobs. The site was purchased by Moran Industries, based in Watsontown, for $200,000. Moran is using the space for food grade storage.

Weis Markets has its corporate headquarters in Sunbury.

<text>Turbotville Borough is a borough in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 705 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Turbotville is located at (41.102454, –76.771188). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.4 square mile (1.2 km2), all land.

Turbotville is located along the Upper Susquehanna River in the north-central part of Pennsylvania. Turbotville is the northernmost town in Northumberland County, and is surrounded on all sides by Lewis Township.

==History==

The greater part of the site of the borough was once owned by Jacob Sechler and wife Catherine, who had received a land grant from Governor Thomas Penn, son of William Penn. Sechler named his land &quot;Green Lawn&quot;; it included the area of present-day Main Street, Church Street, and the Turbotville Cemetery, and extended into present-day Lewis Township.

The settlement was originally called Snydertown, after Philip Reifsnyder, believed to be one of the first European-American settlers of the area. Reifsnyder, a blacksmith by trade, built a tavern southwest of the intersection of Main and Paradise streets; it was operated by his wife. He also operated a blacksmith shop southeast of the intersection of Main and Church streets.

Prior to being incorporated, the town name was changed to Tributville (spelled Turbotville today). The town lay within Turbot Township, and later in Lewis Township. The township and town were named after Colonel Turbutt Francis. After his service in several wars, Colonel Francis was compensated for his service with a land grant called the &quot;Colonel&#x27;s Reward&quot;, which encompasses much of the area south of Turbotville, including present-day Turbot Township. 

The residents of Turbotville (formerly spelled Tributville) presented a petition for incorporation as a borough to the Northumberland County Court of Quarter Sessions at the April term in 1858. In August Andrew J. Muffly was appointed as commissioner to take depositions in the matter; his report was considered at November 1858 session, and on January 3, 1859, a decree of court was granted for this incorporation. The &quot;Charter for the Incorporation of Turbutville in to a Borough&quot;, a handwritten account is noted on three consecutive pages (379-381) in a deed book dated April 6, 1859, located at the Northumberland County Courthouse in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. It is not known when the spelling of the town&#x27;s name changed.

==Religion==

The town had churches that were initially associated with the ethnic backgrounds of its residents; they were fundamental to community. Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church on Paradise Street, Trinity United Church of Christ (the name expresses a 20th-century merger of Congregational churches; this was formerly the German Reformed Church) on Church Street, and St. James Lutheran Church (later Holy Spirit Lutheran Church) on Church Street were all associated with ethnic Germans. The Turbotville Baptist Church was originally associated with British Americans. This was formerly located on the south block of Broadway Street. Zion and Trinity still have strong congregations within the borough. 

Holy Spirit moved to a new location in Lewis Township, and the former church building is now privately owned. The Turbotville Baptist Church, formerly on Broadway Street, was razed several decades ago. It was replaced in 2009 by a new house. The Turbotville Baptist Church was last used in 1948, the year that the last pastor, Reverend Booth, died. Years later a new Baptist Church, not affiliated with the former Broadway Street church, was erected just east of the borough on State Route 54 in Lewis Township. Now known as Bethel Baptist Church, it has a strong congregation.

The racial makeup of the borough was 99.13% White, 0.14% African American, 0.14% Native American, and 0.58% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.03.

In the borough the population was spread out, with 28.2% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Education==

The borough is part of the Warrior Run School District, which encompasses Watsontown, Dewart, McEwensville, Exchange, Lewis Township, Delaware Township, a small portion of Gregg Township in Union County, and other outlying areas. The Warrior Run School District is unique in Pennsylvania because it stretches across three county boundaries: it serves portions of Northumberland, Montour and Union counties. The Turbotville Elementary School is located in the borough, and the Middle School/High School complex is located in Lewis Township on the Susquehanna Trail. 

The first Turbotville High School was a wood-framed structure erected on present-day Church Street. This site has been redeveloped for the Turbotville Community Park pavilion. As the building became outdated and was considered too costly to heat, a new brick high school was erected on Pine Street in 1937, built during the Great Depression. That building has undergone several renovations and additions; today it is used as the Turbotville Elementary School. In 1958, a new high school was built on present-day Susquehanna Trail. It was replaced by another high school completed in 1968. The former high school was adapted for use as the Warrior Run Middle School.

== History ==
Early settlement began around the mill built by James Blaine in 1778, from whom the borough took its name. The final &quot;e&quot; was dropped at some point, although there are records of county newspapers using the &quot;Blaine&quot; spelling until at least 1868. Early in the 1800s, Blaine&#x27;s mill came into the possession of William Douglas, who had a post office established with the name &quot;Douglas&#x27; Mills&quot;. A subsequent owner of the mill, Anthony Black, had the name of the post office changed to &quot;Multicaulisville&quot;, after the mulberry tree (&quot;morus multicaulis&quot;), in which he had a financial interest during a speculative bubble in the tree. Lots were platted for sale in 1846 and the name of the post office was changed to &quot;Blain&quot;.

At one time, Blain was noted for being the smallest borough in Pennsylvania to own its own water plant and electric street lighting system. Jacob Wentz was instrumental in the construction of the first water plant in about 1869 or 1870. The borough was incorporated by an order of the Perry county court on November 3, 1877.

<doc id="133550" wikidata="Q63009" url="?curid=133550" title="The Prince of Tides">
<text>The Prince of Tides is a 1991 American romantic drama film directed and co-produced by Barbra Streisand, from a screenplay written by Pat Conroy and Becky Johnston, based on Conroy&#x27;s 1986 novel. It stars Streisand and Nick Nolte. It tells the story of the narrator&#x27;s struggle to overcome the psychological damage inflicted by his dysfunctional childhood in South Carolina.

The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but received none. A television series adaptation is in development for Apple TV+.

==Plot==
Tom Wingo, a teacher and football coach from South Carolina, is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to New York City to help his twin sister Savannah&#x27;s psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, after Savannah&#x27;s latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him.

During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family&#x27;s secrets. In flashbacks, he relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah&#x27;s life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful, spent his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.

Tom is also torn by his own problems but hides behind what he calls &quot;the Southern way&quot;—laughing at things instead of crying. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her.

Tom and Lowenstein begin to have feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but secretly wants to play football.

Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. He discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer.

Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. He reveals that, when he was 13, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again.

Discovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits and return to his music lessons to prepare to leave for Tanglewood, a prestigious music academy.

Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts.

Tom then receives a call from his wife, who wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and he tells Lowenstein that he doesn&#x27;t love his wife more, &quot;just longer.” Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman.

After working out the traumatic events in his past with Lowenstein&#x27;s help, Tom is happy in his renewed life.

== Reception ==

===Critical reception===

Pat Conroy gave Streisand a copy of his novel &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; with the inscription: &quot;To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you&#x27;re also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life. I honor the great teachers and they live in my work and they dance invisibly in the margins of my prose. You&#x27;ve honored me by taking care of it with such great seriousness and love. Great thanks, and I&#x27;ll never forget that you gave &#x27;The Prince of Tides&#x27; back to me as a gift.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film stars out of 4, praising Streisand&#x27;s directing. Ebert wrote, &quot;By directing one good film, you prove that you had a movie inside of you. By directing two, you prove you are a real director&quot;. He called the film &quot;an assured and very serious love story that allows neither humor nor romance to get in the way of its deeper and darker subject&quot;, adding that &quot;Streisand shows herself as a director who likes emotional stories - but doesn&#x27;t simplify them, and pays attention to the human quirks and strangeness of her characters&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;A deeply moving exploration of the tangled emotions of a dysfunctional Southern family, this lovingly crafted (though unevenly scripted) film of Pat Conroy&#x27;s novel centers on Nick Nolte&#x27;s performance of a lifetime. Bringing her usual strengths of character to her role as Nolte&#x27;s psychiatrist/lover, Barbra Streisand marks every frame with the intensity and care of a filmmaker committed to heartfelt, unashamed emotional involvement with her characters&quot;.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote: &quot;The results may seem overripe and dated in spots, but (Streisand) coaxes a fine performance out of Nolte, and the other actors (herself included) acquit themselves honorably&quot;.

As of May 2024, &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; holds a rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Although the central romance arguably suffocates the heart of the drama, a moving performance by Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand&#x27;s deft direction give &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; a soulful edge.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; was a critical and box office success, opening at number four at the US box office with a weekend gross of $10,035,412, behind &quot;Hook&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. It remained in the top 10 for seven weeks. Eventually the film grossed $74,787,599 in the United States and Canada with $61 million made overseas, for a worldwide total of $135 million. The film was among the top 20 highest-grossing movies of the year at the box office.

===Awards and nominations===
Although the film, its cast, and its crew received many nominations for Academy Awards, Best Director was not among these, while Best Picture was. At the following year&#x27;s Oscar ceremonies, host Billy Crystal sang, to the tune of &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot;, &quot;Did this film direct itself?&quot; The following year, when &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; joined &quot;The&quot; &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; and the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Awakenings&quot; in being nominated for the latter award, but not the former, Columbia Pictures president Mark Canton issued a statement, &quot;This is unfortunately the third year in a row that Columbia has had a film nominated for Best Picture that seemingly directed itself.&quot;

== Differences from novel ==
While the film was a box office hit and raised Streisand&#x27;s reputation as a director, its numerous changes from the original novel upset some Conroy purists. Conroy and Johnston eliminated most of the novel&#x27;s flashback scenes. They describe Tom Wingo&#x27;s relationship with his siblings in great detail. In the novel, these flashbacks form the main plot and take up more of the novel than the romance between Streisand&#x27;s character, Dr. Lowenstein, and Tom Wingo. The removal of the flashbacks makes the relationship between Wingo and Lowenstein the central story in the film, whereas in the novel, it is not.

Another character in the novel – the second Wingo brother, Luke, who appears only in flashbacks onscreen – is vitally important to the novel, and his death is a major plot point. In fact, the title of the book derives from a poem written by Savannah about Luke and his struggle against the government after the seizure of Colleton. In the film, &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; is the title of a book of poetry written by Savannah and dedicated to Tom. Luke only appears intermittently, and his death is only vaguely described.

==Soundtrack==
Streisand initially hired English composer John Barry to write a score for the film, but Barry eventually left due to creative differences. In a March 7, 1996, Cinemusic conference interview, Barry explained his exodus from the film, stating, &quot;I was asked by Barbra Streisand to do &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; – I live in New York, she lives in Los Angeles – and I went and met with her, and she showed me some footage, and she said, &#x27;Why aren&#x27;t you moving to Los Angeles?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Absolutely not.&#x27; And she said, &#x27;Well, I like to know what&#x27;s going on&#x27; – Barbra&#x27;s an extreme case, by the way – and I said, &#x27;Even if I did move to Los Angeles, I have no desire to meet with you once I know what I&#x27;m going to do. I can&#x27;t work with someone over my shoulder, absolutely no way.&#x27;&quot; Barry later retitled his theme for &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; &quot;Moviola&quot; and it was released on his 1992 movie theme album of the same name. The theme also appeared in Barry&#x27;s 1995 score for the 3D IMAX film &quot;Across the Sea of Time&quot;, retitled &quot;Flight Over New York&quot;.

The final film score was composed by James Newton Howard and released November 12, 1991. It was well received by critics and garnered Howard his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though it lost to Alan Menken&#x27;s music for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The soundtrack contains two songs by Streisand, although they did not appear in the film (one of those songs, &quot;Places That Belong To You&quot;, was at one point intended for the film&#x27;s end credits, but replaced with new music by Howard in the released version). The film also includes songs and music that do not appear on any soundtracks.

==Cultural impact==
* In the 1993 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;, Marge&#x27;s childhood flashbacks are similar to this, then Marge says &quot;Wait a minute, that was &quot;Prince of Tides&quot;&quot;. In the 1994 episode, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, Marge mistakenly thinks her psychiatrist is called Lowenstein.
* In &quot;The Office&quot; online webisode series &quot;The Accountants&quot;, Oscar reveals he was going to watch &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; with friends. &quot;We don&#x27;t like it, we make fun of it. It&#x27;s like our &quot;Rocky Horror Picture&quot; thing we do.&quot;
* In &quot;The Sopranos&quot; season 5 premiere, &quot;Two Tonys&quot;, Tony sees a scene from &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; then sends Dr. Melfi a flower basket with Tide detergent and a card that references the film.
* In the &quot;Atlanta&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Sportin&#x27; Waves&quot;, Tracy refers to himself (in jest) as the &quot;prince of tides&quot;.
* In &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; season 2, episode 2, Sharon’s favorite book is revealed to be &quot;The Prince of Tides.&quot;

==Television series==

<text>Liverpool is a borough located in the northeastern corner of Perry County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area.

The borough&#x27;s population was 959 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Location==
Liverpool is located along the Susquehanna River and U.S. Routes 11 and 15 at the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 17.

The borough is situated approximately northwest of Harrisburg in Dauphin County and southwest of Selinsgrove in Snyder County.

It is not to be confused with Liverpool Township, which is adjacent to the borough.

==History==
Liverpool was settled in 1808 by the Stailey family, who emigrated from Liverpool, England, for which it was named. Located beside the Susquehanna River in eastern Perry County, the community was surveyed by John Huggins and plotted by Peter Williamson that year, and originally was made up of the land located between present-day North Alley to Strawberry Street. Subsequently incorporated on May 4, 1832, it is one of the nine boroughs that have been incorporated in the county. The neighboring community of Northern Liberties was absorbed into Liverpool at the time of its incorporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan 1913 https://archive.org/details/ahistoryjuniata00jordgoog/page/12, 206, 223-224, 255&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As the population grew, so did its business offerings, civic services and industries. Its first businessmen were merchant Thomas Gallagher and hotelier John Huggins.

In subsequent months and years, a foundry was built, George Thorp opened a distillery, and John Speece erected a tannery operation.

The community&#x27;s first schoolhouse was a twenty-five-square-foot log structure.

In July 1821, John Huggins launched the borough&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Mercury&quot;, which was absorbed later that decade by &quot;The Perry County Democrat&quot;.

Over the years, a bank, post office and multiple new businesses and churches were also built.

By 1829, the Pennsylvania Canal system had completed work on its Main Line Canal, which ran north, parallel to the Susquehanna River for thirty-nine miles, from Duncan&#x27;s Island in Perry County (now Duncannon) through New Buffalo, Girty&#x27;s Notch, Montgomery&#x27;s Ferry, Mount Patrick, Liverpool, and Selinsgrove to Northumberland. Liverpool ultimately became the Mainline Canal&#x27;s hub, attracting canal boat builders and operators, more hotels to house visitors to the area and more homes for the employees of the businesses that catered to those travelers.

In 1910, the population of the borough was five hundred and ninety-six. By 1912, the borough&#x27;s schools employed four teachers.

==School district==

Liverpool is part of the Greenwood School District, the campus of which is located in nearby Millerstown.

==Emergency services==
Liverpool&#x27;s fire and emergency medical services are provided by the Liverpool Volunteer Fire Company.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 census, Liverpool was home to nine hundred and fifty-five people at the time.

The population consisted of 47.2% males and 52.8% females. 96.1% of residents were White, 1% were Asian, 0.6% were Hispanic, 0.5% were Black, 0.2% were Native Americans/Pacific Islanders, and 0.2% were of other races or two or more races.

In 2010, the median household income was $35,517.

==History==
Millerstown is located on a tract of land originally sold as &quot;Smithfield&quot; to James Gallagher on September 23, 1766; there is evidence, however, that he had lived in the area prior to his purchase.

This plot of ground was later deeded to David Miller on September 1, 1780, who established a settlement and a ferry operation. Miller filed for a patent in 1790 with Thomas Mifflin for the &quot;laying out of the town,&quot; thus making Miller&#x27;s Town the first town to be plotted for sale in the territory at that time comprising Perry County. Miller&#x27;s Town was later combined to form Millerstown.

In 1800, the first tavern was constructed on Market Street, later known as the Alexander House, which would in more recent years become a VFW Post until its closure in 2017.

Millerstown Borough was incorporated February 12, 1849, and the first meeting of the newly formed town council was held on April 14, 1849. Abraham Addams was the first chief burgess (mayor), and John M. Cauffman, Christian Beck, James R. Gilmer, and Jacob Emerick, were members of the first borough council. Thomas P.

<text>Newport is a borough in Perry County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,487 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Newport was originally known as Reider&#x27;s Ferry—later Reidersville—as it was the site of an early ferry on the Juniata River operated by Paul Jr., Daniel, and John Reider until 1851. The trio had also originally laid down 54 plots and several streets. When the Juniata Division of the Pennsylvania Canal was finished in 1929, the town was officially renamed Newport.

In 1849 the Pennsylvania Railroad had laid tracks through Third Street downtown. The PRR purchased the struggling canal in 1857, but kept the waterways open until 1889 when the Johnstown Flood demolished it. By 1905, the PRR began construction of a new trackline along the former towpath which remains today. There was a small freight yard where railcars and cargo could be transferred to standard gauge, and in 1890 Newport was the eastern end of the Newport and Shermans Valley Railroad.

Newport once had a large tannery that operated from the second half of the 19th century until the early part of the 20th. The town playground and youth baseball fields now occupy the site.

<text>Unforgiven is a 1992 American revisionist Western film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood. It stars Eastwood himself as William Munny, an aging outlaw and killer who takes on one more job years after he turned to farming. The film co-stars Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris and was written by David Webb Peoples.

&quot;Unforgiven&quot; grossed over $159 million on a budget of $14.4 million and received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for the acting (particularly from Eastwood and Hackman), directing, editing, themes, and cinematography. The film won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Eastwood, Best Supporting Actor for Hackman, and Best Film Editing for Joel Cox. Eastwood was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but lost to Al Pacino for &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. The film was the third Western to win Best Picture, following &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931) and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (1990). Eastwood dedicated the film to directors and mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel.

In 2004, &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was remade into a 2013 Japanese film, also titled &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, which stars Ken Watanabe and changes the setting to the early Meiji era in Japan. Eastwood has long asserted that the film would be his last traditional Western, concerned that any future projects would simply rehash previous plotlines or imitate someone else&#x27;s work.

==Plot==

In 1880, in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, a cowboy named Quick Mike slashes prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald&#x27;s face with a knife, permanently disfiguring her after she laughs at his small penis. As punishment, Sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot; Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, Davey Bunting, to turn over several of their horses to Delilah&#x27;s employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a $1,000 bounty for the cowboys&#x27; deaths.

In Hodgeman County, Kansas, a boastful young man visits Will Munny&#x27;s hog farm. He calls himself the &quot;Schofield Kid&quot; and claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and his children&#x27;s future is in jeopardy. He recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid, whom they discover, is severely near-sighted.

Back in Big Whiskey, British-born gunfighter &quot;English&quot; Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill&#x27;s, seeks the bounty. He arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, who naively believes Bob&#x27;s tall tales. Enforcing the town&#x27;s antigun law, Little Bill, with his deputies, disarms Bob and beats him savagely to discourage others from attempting to claim the bounty. Bob, humiliated, is banished from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of a fascination with the sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the Wild West. Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first.

Will, Ned, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and enter Skinny&#x27;s saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, Little Bill confronts a feverish Will. Not realizing Will&#x27;s identity, but correctly guessing that he wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his pistol and beats him. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they and the prostitutes nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush Davey. After missing Davey and shooting his horse, Ned falters and Will shoots Davey instead. Ned decides to quit and return to Kansas.

Ned is later captured and flogged to death by Little Bill to learn the whereabouts of Will and the Kid. Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys&#x27; ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the outhouse and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before and is overcome with remorse. A prostitute arrives with the reward and tells them about Ned&#x27;s fate. Shocked by the news, Will begins drinking and demands the Kid&#x27;s revolver. The Kid hands it over, saying that he no longer wants to be a killer, and Will sends him back to Kansas to distribute the reward.

That night, Will finds Ned&#x27;s corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinny&#x27;s saloon. Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a posse. Will walks in alone, brandishing a shotgun, and kills Skinny for displaying Ned&#x27;s corpse. He then aims at Little Bill, but the shotgun misfires. In the ensuing gunfight, Will shoots Little Bill and several other men with the revolver. He then orders the rest of the posse out. Beauchamp lingers briefly to ask how Will survived. Will replies that it was luck and scares him away. Little Bill tries and fails to take another shot while lying on the floor, then bemoans his fate and curses Will, who shoots him dead. Will shouts threats as he mounts his horse and rides out of town.

A closing title card states that Will&#x27;s mother-in-law found his farm abandoned years later, Will having possibly moved to San Francisco with the children, and she remained at a loss to understand why her daughter married such a notorious outlaw and murderer.

== Cast ==
==Production==

=== Development ===
The film was written by David Webb Peoples, who had written the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; and co-written &quot;Blade Runner&quot; with Hampton Fancher. The concept for the film dated to 1976, when it was developed under the titles &quot;The Cut-Whore Killings&quot; and &quot;The William Munny Killings&quot;. The script was originally optioned by Francis Ford Coppola, who failed to raise the money to develop the project any further. 

By Eastwood&#x27;s own recollection, he was given the script in the &quot;early 80s&quot;, although he did not immediately pursue it, because according to him, &quot;I thought I should do some other things first&quot;. In 1984, Sonia Chernus, Eastwood&#x27;s long time story editor at Malpaso Productions, sent him a scathing memo after reading the script stating that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t deserve my time or yours&quot; and is &quot;an insult to this company&quot; and that Eastwood should &quot;get rid of it FAST&quot;. 

=== Casting ===
Eastwood personally phoned Harris to offer him the role of English Bob, and later said Harris was watching Eastwood&#x27;s movie &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; at the time of the phone call, leading to Harris thinking it was a prank. 

Gene Hackman was hesitant to play Bill Daggett, as his daughters were upset that he was starring in too many violent films, but his agent and Eastwood convinced him to do it.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place between August 26, 1991, and November 12, 1991. Much of the film was shot in Alberta in August 1991 by director of photography Jack Green. Production designer Henry Bumstead, who had worked with Eastwood on &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;, was hired to create the &quot;drained, wintry look&quot; of the Western. The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California.

==Themes==
Like other revisionist Westerns, &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is primarily concerned with deconstructing the morally black-and-white vision of the American West, which was established by traditional works in the genre, as the script is saturated with unnerving reminders of the now teetotaling Munny&#x27;s own horrific past as a drunken murderer and gunfighter, who is haunted by the lives he has taken, while the film as a whole &quot;reflects a reverse image of classical Western tropes&quot;; the protagonists, rather than avenging a God-fearing innocent, are hired to collect a bounty offered by a group of prostitutes. Men who claim to be fearless killers are variously exposed as being either cowards, weaklings, or self-promoting liars, while others find that they no longer have it in them to take yet another life. A writer with no concept of the harshness and cruelty of frontier life publishes stories which glorify common criminals as infallible men of honor. The law is represented by a pitiless and cynical former gun-slinger whose idea of justice is often swift and without mercy, and while the main protagonist initially tries to resist his own violent impulses, the murder of his old friend drives him to become the same cold-blooded killer he once was, suggesting that a Western hero is not necessarily &quot;the good guy&quot;, but is instead &quot;just the one who survived&quot;.

Film scholar Allen Redmon describes Munny&#x27;s role as an antihero by stating he is &quot;a virtuous or an injured hero [who] overcomes all obstacles to see that evil is eradicated, using whatever means necessary&quot;.

Critic Sven Mikulec called the film Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;eulogy to the Man with No Name character that made him immortal.&quot;

==Literary allusions==
&quot;Unforgiven&quot; shares many parallels with Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, in characters and themes. &quot;In both works, the protagonists – Achilles and William Munny – are self-questioning warriors who temporarily reject the culture of violence, only to return to it after the death of their closest male friend, in which they are implicated.&quot; Munny and Achilles have the same dilemma between fate and counter-fate. They know that their fate is being a warrior and likely dying that way; however, they both try to reject it for at least some time. Munny continually claims he has changed and &quot;ain&#x27;t like that no more&quot;, referring to his warrior-like hitman past, whereas Achilles continually refuses to be a soldier in the Greek army since he condemns Agamemnon for stealing his captured bride as war spoil.

Neither wants to kill for causes from their past (Munny being an outlaw, Achilles being a warrior-king) since they find them unjust. Both are committed to a &quot;higher&quot; cause—Munny to his children and his wife&#x27;s wishes, and Achilles to the injustice of women-stealing and to Briseis, who at one point he would have had to sacrifice to Agamemnon to stop the war.

When their best friends are killed—Achilles&#x27; Patroclus and Munny&#x27;s Ned—they allow their rage and desire for vengeance, though, to make them return to their warrior-prescribed fate. Achilles rages against the Trojans and kills many. He gets vengeance by killing Hector and desecrating his corpse, dragging it around the town. Munny rages against Little Bill and his crew. He gets vengeance by killing Little Bill and them, threatening to kill anyone who opposes him.

Relevant differences are seen, though, between Homer&#x27;s epic and Eastwood&#x27;s film, namely that Achilles is fated to die in battle, whereas Munny moves to California at the end of the film to become a businessman to provide for his children. Whether Munny has successfully countered his warrior-fate is unclear, as is whether a life in dry goods redeems him as his love for his wife had done.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film debuted at the top position in its opening weekend. Its earnings of $15 million ($7,252 average from 2,071 theaters) in its opening weekend was the best-ever opening for a Clint Eastwood film at that time. This was also the highest August opening weekend, holding that record until it was surpassed a year later by &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. It spent a total of three weeks as the number-one film in North America. In its 35th weekend (April 2–4, 1993), capitalizing on its Oscar wins, the film returned to the top 10 (spending another three weeks total there), ranking at number eight with a gross of $2.5 million ($2,969 average from 855 theaters), an improvement of 197% over the weekend before, when it made $855,188 ($1,767 average from 484 theaters). The film closed on July 15, 1993, having spent nearly a full year in theaters (343 days / 49 weeks), having earned $101.2 million in North America, and another $58 million internationally for a total of $159.2 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 96% based on 109 reviews, and an average rating of 8.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;As both director and star, Clint Eastwood strips away decades of Hollywood varnish applied to the Wild West, and emerges with a series of harshly eloquent statements about the nature of violence.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Jack Methews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described &quot;Unforgiven&quot; as &quot;the finest classical Western to come along since perhaps John Ford&#x27;s 1956 &quot;The Searchers&quot;.&quot; Richard Corliss in &quot;Time&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;Eastwood&#x27;s meditation on age, repute, courage, heroism—on all those burdens he has been carrying with such grace for decades.&quot; Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert criticized the work, though the latter gave it a positive vote, for being too long and having too many superfluous characters (such as Harris&#x27; English Bob, who enters and leaves without meeting the protagonists). Despite his initial reservations, Ebert eventually included the film in his &quot;The Great Movies&quot; list.

&quot;Unforgiven&quot; was named one of the 10 best films of the year on 76 critics&#x27; lists, according to a poll of the nation&#x27;s top 106 film critics.

===Accolades===
====American Film Institute recognition====
In June 2008, &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was listed as the fourth best American film in the Western genre (behind &quot;The Searchers&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, and &quot;Shane&quot;) in the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10&quot; list.
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – No. 98
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – No. 68

===Legacy===
The music for the &quot;Unforgiven&quot; film trailer, which appeared in theaters and on some of the DVDs, was composed by Randy J. Shams and Tim Stithem in 1992. The main theme song, &quot;Claudia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, was composed by Clint Eastwood.

The film was planned to be used as the theme for Six Flags Great Adventure&#x27;s then-upcoming roller coaster, but market research showed that people found it to be too dark of a theme, so the ride&#x27;s name was changed to Viper.

In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked Peoples&#x27; script for &quot;Unforgiven&quot; as the 30th-greatest ever written.

Several story elements of the film are paralleled in &quot;The Noblest of Men, and a Woman&quot;, a side-quest in the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, including an English Bob-like former gunfighter having his biography written by a naive journalist, the player having to visit an aging outlaw who runs a pig farm, the gunfighter revealing himself to be a complete fraud, a final shootout where the player kills him, and the journalist deciding to write a fictitious account of the gunfighter&#x27;s death that completely ignores the truth of what really happened.

==Home media==
&quot;Unforgiven&quot; was released as premium home video, on DVD and VHS, on September 24, 2002. It was released on Blu-ray Book (a Blu-ray Disc with book packaging) on February 21, 2012. Special features include an audio commentary by Clint Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel; four documentaries including &quot;All on Accounta Pullin&#x27; a Trigger&quot;, &quot;Eastwood &amp; Co.: Making &quot;Unforgiven&quot;&quot;, &quot;Eastwood...A Star&quot;, and &quot;Eastwood on Eastwood&quot;, and more. &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on May 16, 2017.

==Remake==

A Japanese adaptation of &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, directed by Lee Sang-il and starring Ken Watanabe, was released in 2013. The plot of the 2013 version is very similar to the original, but it takes place in Japan during the Meiji period, with the main character being a samurai instead of a bandit.

<text>Lackawaxen Township is the largest and northernmost township in Pike County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 5,066 at the 2020 census. The Delaware River, which marks the eastern boundary of the township, joins the Lackawaxen River at Lackawaxen Village. The housing communities Fawn Lake Forest and Masthope Mountain are in the township.

==History==
The European-American settlement in 1798 adopted the Lenape name Lackawaxen, meaning &quot;swift waters,&quot; after the river that flows twelve miles through the township.

Bands of both Algonquian-speaking Lenape and Iroquoian-speaking Seneca lived in the area through the early 19th century. Neither tribe had any substantial villages in the area, and they used the land as hunting grounds. Their tools, pot shards and bone fragments have been found at Native American rock shelters and camp sites.

The first permanent European settlers in the area were Jonathan Conkling and John Barnes, who built in 1770. In the Battle of Minisink in 1779, 40-50 European colonial settlers were killed in an engagement with a band of mostly Iroquois and Loyalists led by Colonel Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who commanded forces for the British.

During the early part of the 19th century, logging was the principal commercial activity in the area. It produced as much as 50 million board feet (120,000 m³) of lumber annually. Workers floated logs downriver on the Delaware to markets in Easton or Trenton.

In 1829, the Delaware and Hudson Canal began operating between Honesdale, Pennsylvania and Kingston, New York. In its time, the canal company was the largest private commercial enterprise in the nation. It built 28 locks in Lackawaxen Township alone, raising the elevation of the canal . Some of the old locks are still visible and several lock houses are now privately owned. Roebling&#x27;s Delaware Aqueduct, built by John A. Roebling, famed engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, was constructed in 1848 as part of the canal. It is now preserved as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark and National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service (NPS).

The canal linked New York City with the rich coal deposits of the Carbondale, Wilkes-Barre and Scranton areas, providing fuel for both the city&#x27;s industrial foundries and heating the expanding number of residences. In 1848, the New York and Erie Railroad was built through the area; although the canal continued to operate for another fifty years, railroads eventually made canals obsolete.

At the same time, the railroad brought tourism to the area and new sources of revenue; the rugged countryside of the upper Delaware Valley became a popular destination for urban tourists. Stations were built at Lackawaxen, West Colang and Mast Hope, and elaborate resort hotels soon were developed nearby. They often provided guides to visitors for fishing, hiking and riding in the area.

Bluestone quarrying became a major enterprise in the area, starting in the mid-19th century. It was used extensively in the construction of the region&#x27;s buildings and sidewalks.

From 1905 to 1918, western author Zane Grey lived in Lackawaxen with his wife and growing family. His early stories related his experiences of fishing along the upper Delaware. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Greys&#x27; home from 1914 to 1918, now preserved by the NPS as a house museum, part of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River area. Grey was buried nearby in the local Union Cemetery.

Physician Orvan Hess was born here.

<text>Milford is a borough that is located in Pike County, Pennsylvania, United States, and the county seat. Its population was 1,103 at the time of the 2020 census.

Situated near the upper Delaware River, Milford is part of the New York metropolitan area.

==History==
The area along the Delaware River where the community of Milford is located had long been settled by the Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous tribe that lived in the mid-Atlantic coastal areas at the time of European colonization. The English also called them the Delaware, after the river they named for colonial leader Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, the Delaware.

Milford was founded in 1796 by Judge John Biddis, one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s first four circuit judges. He named the settlement after his ancestral home in Wales.

Milford has a large number of buildings of historical significance, many constructed in the nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries. Some are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, while numerous others are included in the Milford Historic District. Of the 655 buildings in the district, 400 of them have been deemed to be historically significant. The district is characterized by a variety of Late Victorian architecture.

The Grey Towers National Historic Site, the ancestral home of Gifford Pinchot, noted conservationist, two-time governor of Pennsylvania, and first head of the U.S. Forest Service, is located in Milford. It was designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt has been designated a National Historic Site.

From 1904 to 1926, Grey Towers was the site of summer field study sessions for the Master&#x27;s degree program of the Yale School of Forestry, together with the Forester&#x27;s Hall, a commercial building that was adapted and expanded for this purpose. Jervis Gordon Grist Mill Historic District, Hotel Fauchere and Annex, Metz Ice Plant, and Pike County Courthouse are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nearby is Arisbe, the home of Charles S. Peirce, a prominent logician, philosopher and scientist in the late 19th century, and another NRHP property.

The Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop, an annual science fiction writers&#x27; event, was founded in 1956, and ran until it moved to the United Kingdom in 1972, where it is still running.

The Pike County Historical Society Museum in Milford includes in its collection the &quot;Lincoln Flag,&quot; which was draped on President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s booth at Ford&#x27;s Theatre on the night he was assassinated. The flag was bundled up and placed under the president&#x27;s head, and still bears his blood. It was kept by stage manager Thomas Gourlay, who passed it down to his daughter, Jeannie, an actress who had appeared in the play, &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, at the theatre that night and who later moved to Milford. The flag was donated to the museum after her death.

In September 2007, &quot;Arthur Frommer&#x27;s Budget Travel&quot; named Milford second on its list of &quot;Ten Coolest Small Towns&quot; in Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Milford is located on the Upper Delaware River, which divides Pennsylvania&#x27;s Poconos region from the Catskill Mountains in New York, in what was historically a heavily-forested area. When Judge Biddis bought up the land of what was then known as Wells Ferry and laid out the lots for the new town, he generally followed the urban plan of Philadelphia. He created the grid that made High Street the equivalent of what is now Market Street in Philadelphia, running it to the Delaware River while also making Broad Street perpendicular to High. At the intersection of Broad and High is a public square, just as there is at Broad and Market in Philadelphia. Most of Milford&#x27;s official buildings are located there.

Within that grid, Milford&#x27;s east–west streets were numbered as Second through Seventh streets with Broad falling between Fourth and Fifth. North–south streets were named after Biddis&#x27; children: Ann, Catherine, George, John, Sarah, and Elizabeth. In between both the named and numbered streets are alleys, that were named after berries and fruit.

In contemporary Milford, Broad Street is also marked as U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 209. At its intersection with Harford Street, Route 6 continues north on Harford, while Route 209 continues south on the street.

Milford is located on an escarpment above the Delaware River. All waterways there which drain into the river fall the difference in height, creating what is known as a &quot;fluviarchy,&quot; a network of waterfalls that is putatively the most notable east of the Rocky Mountains. These also provided waterpower to mills that contributed to Milford&#x27;s growing economy during the nineteenth century.

<text>A Few Good Men is a play by Aaron Sorkin, first produced on Broadway by David Brown in 1989. It tells the story of military lawyers at a court-martial who uncover a high-level conspiracy in the course of defending their clients, two United States Marines accused of murder.

It opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in Manhattan of New York City on November 15, 1989, in a production directed by Don Scardino, with Tom Hulce as Lieutenant (junior grade) Daniel Kaffee, Megan Gallagher as Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway, and Stephen Lang as Colonel Jessep. Michael O&#x27;Hare replaced Lang as Col. Jessep later in the run.

Sorkin adapted his work three years later into a screenplay for the 1992 feature film of the same name.

== Plot ==

Private William Santiago, a United States Marine at the United States Navy&#x27;s Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, on the south shore of the island of Cuba is a weak Marine who has a hard time physically keeping up and gets along poorly with his fellow Marines and has gone outside the chain of command to the Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) to request a transfer. Although Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson requests that Santiago be transferred, his senior Base Commander Colonel Nathan Jessep instructs Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, Private Santiago&#x27;s platoon commander, to &quot;train&quot; Santiago. Soon afterward, Santiago dies. He was murdered, and the two Marines Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private First Class Louden Downey who broke into Santiago&#x27;s dorm room and attacked him and stuffed a rag into his mouth / throat, will stand trial.

United States Navy&#x27;s United States Navy Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps (JAG Corps) investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway believes Dawson and Downey may have carried out an illegal &quot;code red&quot; order: a brutal extrajudicial punishment that in recent years has been outlawed by military regulations. Santiago was ostensibly killed in retaliation for naming Corp. Dawson in a fenceline shooting into adjacent Cuban sovereign territory, but Lt. Cmdr. Galloway believes Santiago was killed as part of a premeditated plan or even conspiracy. Galloway wants to represent them, but the case is assigned to fellow Navy officer and lawyer Lieutenant (junior grade) Daniel Kaffee, a bumbling attorney who enjoys accepting plea bargain deals and avoiding drawn-out trials / court martials. Lt. Kaffee&#x27;s casual attitude bothers intense driven Galloway, while Galloway annoys Kaffee with her female meddling and overbearing attitude.

At Guantanamo Bay, Kaffee and Galloway interrogate base commander Marine Corps Colonel Nathan Jessep and others. Jessep asserts that Santiago was supposed to be transferred off the base and sent back to America the following day. Marines Dawson and Downey reject their lawyer Lt. Kaffee&#x27;s offer to enter into a plea agreement and receive a short six months sentence with government prosecutor U.S. Marine Captain Jack Ross, claiming that Kendrick gave them the &quot;code red&quot; order, that they never intended for Santiago to die and did nothing wrong. Cpl. Dawson thinks it is dishonorable and a violation of the Marines&#x27; strict code of honor for Kaffee to opt for a plea agreement rather than stand their ground in court. Kaffee in disgust and unable to understand their sense of morals, wants to be terminated from his position as counsel because he believes the case is worthless, that if they&#x27;re found guilty, that they&#x27;ll both be sentenced to long prison terms. Kaffee suddenly submits a not guilty plea on behalf of the accused at the arraignment. He explains to Galloway that the reason he was selected to handle the case was because of his reputation for quickly settling cases out of court with as little fuss as possible, that it was anticipated that he would take a fast plea deal and the case would then be closed, and swept away under the rug. 

Lt. Col. Markinson tells Kaffee, during their secretive covert meeting in Kaffee&#x27;s car, that the code red order was actually given, then hidden, and that Col. Jessep never requested Santiago be transferred. According to the defense, Cpl. Dawson was passed up for promotion because he had given food secretly to another Marine who had been on punishment and ordered to go without meals. The defense Kaffee now presents is a favorable picture of Dawson and shows that &quot;code reds&quot; had previously been authorized through Pvt. Downey. On the other hand, Downey claims under oath and cross-examination that he was not present when Dawson allegedly received the &quot;code red&quot; instructions. Lt. Col.Markinson then kills himself before he can testify because he feels guilty about not protecting a fellow Marine under his charge and being an informer / whistle-blower.

Kaffee thinks the case has been lost without Markinson&#x27;s testimony. He complains that he fought the case rather than accepting a settlement as he returns home drunk. Galloway urges Kaffee to summon and get Jessep to testify on the stand under oath despite the possibility of facing court-martial for defying a superior officer.

When Kaffee brings up a discrepancy in Col. Jessep&#x27;s testimony in court at the court-martial at the Washington Navy Yard—that his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be relocated for his own safety—he is disturbed. Jessep spars under Kaffee&#x27;s interrogation. Considering that Jessep had told his men to leave Santiago alone, Kaffee wonders why he was still in danger. Jessep, disgusted by Kaffee&#x27;s behavior, praises the military&#x27;s contribution to national security as well as his own. Finally, Jessep admits with disdain and intense anger that he really did give the &quot;code red&quot; command. Then while attempting to leave the courtroom thinking he&#x27;s above reproach or questioned, Jessep is then arrested by order of the observing military judges.

The murder and conspiracy charges against Dawson and Downey are dropped, but they are found guilty of lesser offenses of &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; and will be dishonorably discharged. Dawson explains to his confused and non-comprehending friend that they failed to stand up for people who were too helpless to defend themselves, like Pvt. Santiago, while Downey is unsure what they did wrong. Lt. Kaffee tells Dawson that having honor does not require wearing a patch on one&#x27;s arm. Dawson then snaps to attention, barking &quot;there&#x27;s an officer on deck&quot; and smartly snaps off a salute to Lieutenant Kaffee and recognizes him as an officer to be respected (unlike his earlier contempt). Before prosecutor Ross leaves to arrest Kendrick, Kaffee and Ross give each other compliments as friends.

==Play==
Sorkin got the idea for the play from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and was serving a three-year stint with the Navy Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. She was going to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to defend a group of Marines who had come close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins during the first act of the musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.

Several former Navy JAG lawyers have been proposed as the model for the character of Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, USN, JAG Corps. These include Donald Marcari, David Iglesias, and Walter Bansley III. The court martial was Marcari&#x27;s first big court case. However, in a statement released by his spokeswoman, Sorkin said, &quot;The character of Dan Kaffee in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; is entirely fictional and was not inspired by any particular individual.&quot;

Once Sorkin completed a draft, his theatrical agent sent it to producer David Brown, who wanted the film rights. Sorkin sold Brown the rights, getting Brown to agree to also produce &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; as a play.

===Premieres===
&quot;A Few Good Men&quot; had its world premiere at the Heritage Repertory Theatre at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Department of Drama on September 19, 1989. It then transferred to the Kennedy Center.

The original Broadway stage production opened at the Music Box Theatre in New York on November 15, 1989, in a production directed by Don Scardino, designed by Ben Edwards, and with music by John Gromada. It starred Tom Hulce as LTJG Kaffee; Megan Gallagher as LCDR JoAnne Galloway; Clark Gregg as Lt. Jack Ross; Stephen Lang as Col. Jessup, and Robert Hogan as Capt. Matthew A. Markinson. Replacement actors included Timothy Busfield and Bradley Whitford as Lt. Jack Ross (understudy for Kaffee), Perry King, Michael O&#x27;Hare, and Ron Perlman as Jessep, and Pamela Blair as Galloway. Joshua Malina also appeared. Malina went on to appear in the movie adaption.

The production ran for 497 performances.

===Other performances===
A Spanish-language production titled &quot;Hombres de Honor&quot; opened on January 10, 1991, at the Ferré Performing Arts Center in Puerto Rico, starring Cordelia González and Rafo Muñiz, directed by Pablo Cabrera.

A national touring company performed through 1992 with Michael O&#x27;Keefe as LTJG Kaffee, Alyson Reed as LCDR Galloway, and Paul Winfield as the judge.

In January 1993 &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; had its premiere in German language at the Volkstheater, Vienna, Austria (translation: Gunther Baumann, director: Erhard Pauer, Daniel Kaffee: Alfons Haider). In the following years this production went on tour and was shown all over Germany, Switzerland and Austria (German title: Eine Frage der Ehre/A Question of Honor).

A revival of the play starring Rob Lowe in the role of LTJG Kaffee, Suranne Jones as LCDR Galloway, and John Barrowman as Capt. Ross opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, in late August 2005 for preview showings followed by a three-month run in early September 2005. The stage show was directed by David Esbjornson.

In 2006, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged a production as part of their second stage for modern shows. The tour was presented in city courtrooms, directed by Jon Ciccarelli and featured notable New York City actors such as Jon Crefeld as LTJG Kaffee and Charles J. Roby as Col. Jessup.

Jensen Ackles appeared as LTJG Kaffee alongside Lou Diamond Phillips as Col. Jessup in a production of the play at the Casa Mañana Theatre, in Fort Worth, Texas, June 5–10, 2007.

It has also been performed in London, Oxford, and Portsmouth by amateur groups.

A Hungarian production of the play was performed at Madách Szinház, Budapest. It was directed by Imre Kerényi, starring Sándor Czvetkó, Éva Kerekes, and Gábor Koncz.

Indian writer Swadesh Deepak adapted the play into Hindi as &quot;Court Martial&quot; (1991) which served as the basis of the films &quot;Shaurya&quot; (2008) and &quot;Melvilasom&quot; (2011).

By the Book Theatre produced the play November 25, 2014, to December 6, 2014 at the McManus Studio Theatre, London, Ontario. The production won 4 Brickenden Awards including Outstanding Drama.

June 30, 2016, marked the opening of the Warehouse Studio Theatre production at The Noho Arts Center under the direction of Tony Pauletto and starring K. C. Clyde as Kaffee alongside Dennis LaValle as Jessup and Sarah Klein as Galloway.

In March 2016, NBC announced its intent to broadcast a live television production of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, starring Alec Baldwin as Col. Jessup, in the second quarter of 2018, with a teleplay adapted by Sorkin from his original script. The broadcast would be executive produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and patterned upon NBC&#x27;s ongoing series of live Broadway musicals. However, NBC has yet to announce an airdate. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the availability of Sorkin, Zadan, and Meron may have had an impact, noting that Sorkin had to represent his 2017 film &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; during awards season, while Zadan and Meron (who have produced all of NBC&#x27;s live musicals) were committed to other projects (such as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert&quot; in 2018, and a later canceled production of &quot;Hair&quot; in 2019) being produced by NBC in lieu of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, which had been delayed multiple times in order to accommodate Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s other projects. Zadan died on August 20, 2018, at the age of 69.

===Awards and nominations===
The Broadway production earned Megan Gallagher a 1990 Theatre World Award and a Best Actor nomination for Tom Hulce at the 44th Tony Awards.

==Source material and legacy==
The play is based on events that took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in July 1986, though various details were changed for dramatic purposes. Members of Rifle Security Company, Windward Side, 2nd Platoon believed that one of their number, Pfc. William Alvarado, was a malingerer and had informed about a Marine firing across the border into Cuba. In a retaliatory hazing (called a &quot;Code Red&quot;), ten Marines seized Alvarado, blindfolded him, stuffed a rag in his mouth, beat him, and shaved his head. Alvarado was seriously injured, but did not die. Of the ten Marines, seven accepted other than honorable discharges as part of a plea bargain, but three, including David Cox, refused to accept the plea bargain and went to court. Cox was defended by Don Marcari. Cox was found not guilty of aggravated battery but guilty of the misdemeanor charge of simple assault. He was sentenced to time already served in the brig and returned to active duty.

Cox was honorably discharged from the Marines in 1989. When he saw the film version of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, he was upset at the liberties taken with the event, most notably that the Marines in the case were dishonorably discharged, and considered suing the filmmakers. Cox disappeared in 1994. He was found murdered, along a riverbank near Medfield, Massachusetts.

<text>Austin is a borough along the Freeman Run (river) in southwestern Potter County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 482 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In September 1856, Edward Orramel Austin came to Freeman Run. He fell in love with the area and began to build a village. From then on, he lived his entire life in the valley. He served in the Civil War and returned to his valley after. His dream grew until his town, at one period, was one of the largest in Potter County. At the time of his death in 1908, the town of Austin was at its most productive with paper mills and saw mills as well. He lived to see a great dream come true. Two years later, nearly the entire town was swept away when the great dam built by the Bayless Pulp and Paper Company failed to hold back its 500,000,000+ gallons of water. The home of E.O. Austin went with it.

The building is a replica of E.O. Austin’s house of the 1800’s.  It is in almost the exact spot as it was before the flood of 1911.  The inside of the home is a museum filled with memorabilia from Austin and the surrounding areas (Wharton, Keating Summit and Odin). The goal of “The New, Oldest Home in Austin” is to preserve our own town’s history – past, present, and future.

===1911 dam failure===
The Austin Dam, also known as the Bayless Dam, was a concrete gravity dam for the Bayless Pulp and Paper Mill. Built in 1909, it was the largest dam of its type in Pennsylvania at the time. The catastrophic failure of the dam on September 30, 1911, destroyed much of the town and killed 78 people. The town was rebuilt, under the slogan &quot;the town too tough to die&quot;. This was later changed to &quot;the best town by a dam site&quot;.

===Mayoral controversy, 2021===
On November 9, 2021, Kate Crosby won the mayoral election against Jim Setzer. They received 38 and 30 votes, respectively. On July 7, 2021, Crosby pleaded guilty for the felony crime of aggravated assault by vehicle on December 21, 2014, which resulted in the death of one and the maiming of another man. The &quot;Potter Leader-Enterprise&quot; wrote that Crosby&#x27;s felony conviction may render her ineligible to hold office as mayor, because the Pennsylvania Constitution bars anyone convicted of an &quot;infamous crime&quot; from holding office in Pennsylvania. Once in office, the DA or attorney general would need to file a &quot;quo warranto&quot; to remove her. On June 7, 2022, the Austin Borough Council followed Judge Stephen Minor&#x27;s court decision to remove Kate Crosby as mayor of Austin. During a special meeting on June 30, the Austin borough council unanimously appointed James Setzer as mayor.

<text>Coudersport is a borough in and the county seat of Potter County, Pennsylvania. It is located approximately east by south of Erie on the Allegheny River. The population was 2,371 at the 2020 census.

==History==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Coudersport lies in a broad valley at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Mill Creek. It is surrounded by the great hilltop plateaux of the Allegheny highlands. Highways enter north and south on Pennsylvania Route 44, the very old Jersey Shore (log road) Turnpike, and from west to east on U.S. Route 6, the &quot;Grand Army of the Republic Highway&quot;, which had been long a major mid-east-states east-west corridor before the construction of Interstate highways which began in the late 1950s. The most noted hilltops, located here on this plateau, are Dutch Hill, stretching to the southeast, and Vader Hill, stretching to the southwest. The Allegheny River makes a quick turn at this point, going from north to west; for that reason, these features are distinctly individual from afar in the broad turning valley, and rise 2400–2500 feet above sea-level.

==Fracking controversy==
In early 2018, the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA) became involved in a controversial proposal for a fracking wastewater plant near Coudersport. JKLM Energy proposes trucking &quot;produced water&quot; (fracking wastewater) to a centralized plant for treatment to be located adjacent to the CAMA plant in Eulalia Township when and if the plant is approved and licensed by governmental authorities. The treated wastewater would then be transferred to CAMA for disposal into the headwaters of the Allegheny River.

The entire proposal is opposed by many residents of the borough and the county, as well as by the Seneca Nation of Indians who reside downriver from the proposed plant location. 

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined JKLM $472,317 in 2016 for groundwater contamination caused by the use of an unapproved surfactant during the drilling of a natural gas well. The contamination impacted six private drinking water wells in Sweden and Eulalia townships (Potter County). 

The Cattaraugus County, New York legislature as well as New York State Senator Catharine Young (R-NY) have joined the Seneca Nation in opposition to the proposed fracking wastewater plant. The Coudersport Borough Council voted to oppose siting the plant near Coudersport. The Coudersport Borough Council&#x27;s resolution of opposition was forwarded to the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA), who has not yet considered it in a public forum.

==Notable facts==

Coudersport is home to a Scottish Rite . With approximately 3000 members, Coudersport&#x27;s Consistory has the largest per-capita membership of any Scottish Rite Consistory.

The newly re-opened Ice Mine is a popular tourist attraction in Coudersport. The mine freezes with ice in the summer, and the ice melts in the winter.

Coudersport was the home of &quot;Untouchable&quot; Eliot Ness at the time of his death. He was a principal in the Guaranty Paper Corporation, which specialized in watermarking legal &amp; official documents to prevent counterfeiting. The company moved from Cleveland to Coudersport around 1955 because operating costs were lower. Ness, with his wife and son, were living in the Brocklebank home from 1956-57. Ness died there from a heart attack in May 1957.

Located in the northern portion of Coudersport is the Coudersport Area Recreation Park (CARP). This sports and recreation park was established in the 1960s by a group of town leaders including Dr. William L. Mitchell, a local veterinarian. It currently has a football field with track &amp; field capabilities, baseball and softball fields, basketball courts, picnic areas and hiking trails.

According to historical books at the Penn State University Park library, Coudersport derived its name from a Dutchman named Couder who was a primary funder for the surveying of the future town as a &quot;port&quot; on the Allegheny River, thus becoming Couder&#x27;s Port.

Coudersport was the former headquarters of Adelphia, which at its peak was the 5th largest cable provider in the United States. The company went bankrupt due to internal corruption in 2002, and the headquarters were moved to Colorado a few years later.

The fictional town of Farringdon, depicted in the Judy Bolton detective series by Margaret Sutton, is based on Coudersport, where Sutton grew up and attended school. The school, town hall, and several recognizable residences are described in her books. Judy Bolton Days, an annual festival honoring the books of the late Sutton, is hosted each October by the local Chamber of Commerce.

Radio stations WNG591 (a NOAA Weather Radio outlet programmed out of State College) and WFRM (a locally programmed AM radio station, 600 kHz) are licensed to Coudersport. The former WFRM-FM, 96.7 MHz, was licensed to Coudersport for much of its existence but was later reallocated to Portville, New York. The local newspaper, the &quot;Potter Leader-Enterprise&quot;, is published out of Coudersport.

Coudersport is located near Cherry Springs State Park, which features some of the darkest skies near the East Coast. This means the town is a prominent destination for stargazers.

<text>Oswayo is a borough in Potter County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 133 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Oswayo was incorporated on January 8, 1901 and named for the Township. The Oswayo Valley had one of the best white pine stands in Pennsylvania. The name is the English derivative of the Seneca word &quot;O-sa-ayeh&quot;, meaning pine forest. The whole of the valley was a vast pine forest of trees standing so close that it was impossible for underbrush to grow. Some of the trees reached heights of between 100 and 150 feet with the lowest branches 50 to 75 feet above the ground. The nucleus of the town had been well established in the days before the Civil War. Early settlers earned their living harvesting white pine. Many of the logs were splashed out on the high waters in the spring of the year. The cities along the Ohio often specified &quot;Oswayo White Pine&quot; because of its quality.

The village was first called Brindleville, but the name was changed when the post office was established in the 1840s. During early years, the village contained two sawmills and shingle mills and several small shops which catered to local business. Several doctors and attorneys were also located here. The first large tannery to begin operation in the county began tanning here in 1877. It was sold to P.H.. Costello Company in 1879. The tannery was destroyed by fire on June 20, 1903. At that time, it was owned by the Penn Tanning Company. From 1894 to the 1930s, the town was served by the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad. The borough probably peaked in population at the time of incorporation with about 1000 people. By 1910, the Census showed only 382 residents. The loss of the tannery and several other lumber related business had rapidly taken its toll. By 1920, the Census showed only 209 residents. Today agriculture remains important and there are a few loggers in the region. A state Fish Cultural Station, located above the village, raises trout for stocking in streams throughout the State.

<text>Sweden Township is a township in Potter County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 871 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Sweden Township was formed on February 26, 1828, from Eulalia Township. It was named for the nation of Sweden, the native country of its early pioneer settlers.

In 2023, the township voted 2–1 to abolish its police force after the township&#x27;s police chief, Bryan Phelps, resigned to become a county judge, citing low crime and a lack of space in the budget to support an independent police force. As such, the Pennsylvania State Police holds jurisdiction over the township.

===Coudersport Area Municipal Authority Treatment Plant Controversy===

The Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA) became involved in a controversial proposal for a fracking wastewater plant in early 2018. CAMA services Sweden Township. JKLM Energy intends to truck &quot;produced water&quot; (fracking wastewater) to a centralized plant for treatment to be located adjacent to the CAMA plant in Eulalia Township, Pennsylvania, when and if the plant is approved and licensed by governmental authorities. The treated wastewater then will be transferred to CAMA for disposal into the headwaters of the Allegheny River.

The plant proposal is opposed by many residents Potter County as well as by the Seneca Nation of Indians who reside downriver from the proposed plant location. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined JKLM $472,317 in 2016 for groundwater contamination caused by the use of an unapproved surfactant during the drilling of a natural gas well. The contamination impacted six private drinking water wells in Sweden and Eulalia townships, Potter County. The Cattaugus County, New York, legislature as well as New York State Senator Catharine Young have joined the Seneca Nation in opposition to the proposed fracking wastewater plant. Additionally, the Coudersport Bourough (PA) Council voted to oppose the siting of the plant near Coudersport. The Coudersport Borough Council&#x27;s resolution of opposition was forwarded to the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA), who has not yet considered it in a public forum.

<text>Howards End is a 1992 historical romantic drama film directed by James Ivory, from a screenplay written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala based on the 1910 novel by E. M. Forster. Marking Merchant Ivory Productions&#x27; third adaptation of a Forster novel (following 1985&#x27;s &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Maurice&quot;), it was the first film to be released by Sony Pictures Classics. The film&#x27;s narrative explores class relations in turn-of-the-20th-century Britain, through events in the lives of the Schlegel sisters. The film starred Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, Helena Bonham Carter and Vanessa Redgrave, with James Wilby, Samuel West, Jemma Redgrave and Prunella Scales in supporting roles.

The film was theatrically released on 13 March 1992 to critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing over $32 million on an $8 million budget. It was in competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival and won the 45th Anniversary Award. At the 65th Academy Awards, the film received a leading nine nominations including for Best Picture, and won three: Best Actress (for Thompson), Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Art Direction. At the 46th British Academy Film Awards, it garnered a leading eleven nominations, winning two awards; Best Film and Best Actress (for Thompson).

==Plot==
In Edwardian Britain, Helen Schlegel becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox during a moment of passion, while staying at the Wilcox family&#x27;s country home, Howards End. The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German bourgeoisie, while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, led by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but she has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, leading to an uproar when the sisters&#x27; Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene.

Months later in London, when the Wilcoxes take a flat across the street from the Schlegels, Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Ruth, Henry&#x27;s wife. Ruth is descended from English yeoman stock, and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes have come to own her beloved Howards End. The two women grow close as Mrs. Wilcox&#x27;s health declines and, unbeknownst to Margaret, a dying Ruth bequeaths Howards End to her. However, the Wilcoxes refuse to believe Ruth would leave the house to a relative stranger and burn her written bequest. Henry develops an attraction to Margaret, assisting her in finding a new home and eventually proposing marriage, which she accepts.

The Schlegels befriend Leonard Bast, a self-improving young clerk who lives with Jacky, a woman of dubious origins. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that the insurance company Leonard works for is heading for bankruptcy. Leonard quits, settling for a much lower-paying job which is eventually downsized altogether. Helen is later enraged to learn Henry&#x27;s advice was wrong; Leonard&#x27;s first employer was perfectly sound but will not reemploy him.

Months later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his Shropshire estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with an impoverished Leonard and Jacky. Considering Henry responsible for their plight, Helen demands his help, but Jacky drunkenly exposes Henry as a former lover from years ago. Henry is ashamed to be revealed as an adulterer, but Margaret forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. Helen, upset with Margaret&#x27;s decision to marry a man she loathes, leaves for Germany, but not before giving in to her attraction for Leonard and having sex while out boating. Fearing the Basts will be penniless, Helen instructs her brother Tibby to give them over £5000 of her own money, but Leonard returns the cheque uncashed out of pride, and because of his own feelings for Helen.

Margaret and Henry marry, arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret&#x27;s and her siblings&#x27; belongings. After months of hearing from Helen only through postcards, Margaret grows concerned, and Helen returns to England when Aunt Juley falls ill but avoids seeing her family. Believing Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, arriving herself with Henry and a doctor, and realizes Helen is pregnant. Insisting on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone, Helen asks to stay the night at Howards End but Henry refuses, leading to an argument with Margaret.

Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, has a dream about how he first met Helen. Realizing that he wants to see her again, he travels to Howards End, arriving to find a very pregnant Helen, Margaret, and Henry&#x27;s brutish eldest son, Charles. Realizing Leonard is the baby&#x27;s father, Charles assaults him for &quot;dishonoring&quot; Helen and a bookcase collapses on Leonard, who dies of a heart attack. Margaret tells Henry that she is leaving him to help Helen raise her baby, and Henry breaks down, telling her the police inquest will charge Charles with manslaughter.

A year later, Paul, Evie, and Charles&#x27;s wife, Dolly, gather at Howards End. Henry and Margaret are still together, living with Helen and her young son. Henry tells the others that upon his death, Margaret will inherit Howards End and leave it to her nephew, though Margaret wants none of Henry&#x27;s money, which will be split among his children. She overhears Dolly point out the irony of Margaret inheriting the house, revealing Mrs. Wilcox&#x27;s dying wish to leave it to her. Henry tells Margaret he did what he thought was right, but she says nothing.

==Production==
===Financing===
Merchant-Ivory had difficulty securing funding for &quot;Howards End&quot;, whose budget stood at $8 million. This was considerably larger than those of &quot;Maurice&quot; and &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, which led to trouble in raising capital in the UK and the United States. Orion Pictures, the film&#x27;s distributor, was on the verge of bankruptcy and contributed only a small amount to the overall budget.

A solution presented itself when Merchant Ivory sought funding through an intermediary in Japan, where the previous Forster adaptations, particularly &quot;Maurice&quot;, had been very successful. Eventually Japanese companies including the Sumitomo Corporation, Japan Satellite Broadcasting, and the Imagica Corporation provided the bulk of the film&#x27;s financing.

The distribution problem was solved when the heads of Orion Classics departed the company for Sony Pictures, creating the entirely new division of Sony Pictures Classics; &quot;Howards End&quot; was the first title it acquired and distributed. In 2022, the division&#x27;s co-founder Michael Barker recalled that, despite a highly lucrative offer for distribution rights from Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films, Ismail Merchant was content choosing Sony&#x27;s relatively smaller offer of $1 million instead.

===Casting===
Anthony Hopkins accepted the part of Henry Wilcox after reading the script, passed to him by a young woman who was helping edit &quot;Slaves of New York&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; simultaneously in the same building.

Phoebe Nicholls, Joely Richardson, Miranda Richardson, and Tilda Swinton were all considered for the part of Margaret Schlegel before Emma Thompson accepted the role. James Ivory was unfamiliar with Thompson before she was recommended to him by Simon Callow, who had a small cameo appearance as the music lecturer in the concert scene.

Jemma Redgrave (Evie Wilcox), who played the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave&#x27;s character (Ruth Wilcox), is her niece off-screen. Samuel West, who played Leonard Bast, is the son of Prunella Scales, who played Aunt Juley.

According to James Ivory, although Vanessa Redgrave was his preferred choice for the role of Ruth Wilcox, her participation was uncertain until the last moment, because she was committed to other projects and it took some time to negotiate an acceptable salary. When she did agree to play Mrs. Wilcox, she mistakenly believed she would be playing Margaret; only when she showed up on set to begin filming her scenes did the person in Hair and Makeup explain that she would be playing the &quot;elder&quot; Mrs. Wilcox.

===Music===
The score was composed by Richard Robbins, with elements of the score based on Percy Grainger&#x27;s works &quot;Bridal Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Mock Morris&quot;. The piano pieces were performed by English concert pianist Martin Jones. Orchestral works were conducted by Harry Rabinowitz and performed by the English Chamber Orchestra.

* &quot;Bridal Lullaby&quot; by Percy Grainger Courtesy of Bardie Edition (used for the main title and Margaret&#x27;s Arrival At Howards End)
* &quot;Mock Morris&quot; by Percy Grainger Courtesy of Schott &amp; Co. (End Credits theme)
* 5th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven (uncredited; featured in the lecture scene &#x27;Music and Meaning&#x27;)

Also of note is a Tango composed and performed by the Teddy Peiro Tango Quintet, and the music of Francis Poulenc, the Nocture #8. This theme is used while Ruth Wilcox walks at Howards End in the Evening Scene.

===Filming locations===
Filming locations in London included a house in Victoria Square (which stood in for the Schlegel home), Fortnum &amp; Mason in Piccadilly, Simpson&#x27;s-in-the-Strand restaurant, and St Pancras railway station. Areas around the Admiralty Arch and in front of the Royal Exchange in the City of London were dressed to film traffic scenes of 1910 London. The scene where Margaret and Helen stroll with Henry in the evening was filmed on Chiswick Mall in Chiswick, London. The bank where Leonard encounters Helen is the lobby of the Baltic Exchange, 30 St. Mary Axe, London. Soon after filming the building was bombed and destroyed by the IRA. The Rosewood London on High Holborn, which was then the Pearl Assurance Building, represented the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.

The quadrangle of the Founder&#x27;s Building at Royal Holloway, University of London stood in for the hospital where Margaret visits Mrs. Wilcox. The &quot;Howards End&quot; house in the countryside is Peppard Cottage in Rotherfield Peppard, Oxfordshire. At the time it was owned by an antique silver dealer with whom production designer Luciana Arrighi was acquainted. The bluebell wood where Leonard strolls in his dream, as well as Dolly and Charles&#x27; house, were filmed nearby. Henry&#x27;s country house, Honiton, was actually Brampton Bryan Hall in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. Bewdley railway station on the historic Severn Valley Railway featured as Hilton station.

==Release==
&quot;Howards End&quot; had its premiere in New York City on 27 February 1992. It was released on 13 March 1992 in the United States and Canada and on 1 May 1992 in the United Kingdom.

===Critical reception===
The film received widespread critical acclaim. On 5 June 2005, Roger Ebert included it on his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;. Leonard Maltin awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, and called the film &quot;Extraordinarily good on every level.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; gave a mixed review while reporting that the film &quot;provides more than enough in the way of production values to keep its primary audience entertained. An audible gasp went up at a recent sneak preview over the film&#x27;s re-creation of a Christmas-bedecked Harrod&#x27;s of the turn of the century; the movie, like the store, knows how to put its merchandise on display.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of 65 reviews are positive for the film, and the average rating is 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A superbly-mounted adaptation of E.M. Forster&#x27;s tale of British class tension, with exceptional performances all round, &quot;Howards End&quot; ranks among the best of Merchant-Ivory&#x27;s work.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 89 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. American audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

In 2016, the film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically after restoration on 26 August 2016.

&quot;Howards End&quot; was placed on more top ten lists than any other film in 1992, edging out &quot;The Player&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. It was placed on 82 of the 106 film critics polled.

===Box office===
The film grossed $26.3 million in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom it grossed £4 million ($5.9 million).

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
Columbia-TriStar released the film on LaserDisc on 2 June 1993.
The Criterion Collection released Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film on 3 November 2009, which have since gone out of print. The release was unfortunately subject to a bronzing issue which would discolor the disc bronze and render it unplayable, due to a pressing issue at the factory, though not every disc was subject to bronzing. Cohen Film Collection released their own special edition Blu-ray on 6 December 2016. Although this edition was labelled as remastered in 4k, it is a 1080p Blu Ray disc. However in 2018, Concord Video released a 4K Ultra HD Region Free edition in Germany.

In 2019 the borough celebrated its sesquicentennial.

==History==
When it was first settled in 1831, Ulysses was named Lewisville after Orange Lewis, an early settler and prominent farmer who later became justice of the peace and county treasurer. But the post office and newspaper had always called the town Ulysses, and eventually, in 1968, the town itself was officially renamed Ulysses.

== White supremacist and neo-Nazi presence ==
In the early 20th century, the Ku Klux Klan arrived, giving the town its continuing presence of white supremacists and national significance.

The borough has caught media attention in recent years for a local group&#x27;s involvement in white supremacy and its practice of Odinism.

In the 1990s, August Kreis III moved to town and established the national headquarters of the Aryan Nations. He organized the &quot;World Aryan Congress&quot; meeting of neo-Nazis, skinheads and Klan members held in the borough in the 2000s.

A local neo-Nazi and member of the National Socialist Movement, Daniel Burnside, has a Hitler-themed house in the town and has held meetings and demonstrations locally.

Speaking in 2019 about Burnside, the president of the Borough Council said &quot;There are some people here that are genuinely scared. I think he thrives on that because that gives him a sense of power and control over something in his life. But most of us, I don&#x27;t want to say we are scared.&quot;

Six members of an Aryan Strike Force cell, who were arrested for plotting a suicide bombing of an &quot;anti-racism&quot; protest, had held weapons training in Ulysses in 2018.

Some local authorities and citizens have resisted, and opposed any involvement in the group&#x27;s activities.

==History==

===Beury&#x27;s Grove===

Harvey E Beury (1871-1965) and his wife Alice Hubler Beury (1871-1952) began creating the Beury&#x27;s Lake in 1920 by creating a dam on Deep Creek (then also known as Buckhorn Creek) and removing the trees and stumps from the surrounding area.
&quot;Beury&#x27;s Grove&quot; opened in 1923 as a swimming attraction at &quot;Beury&#x27;s Lake&quot; with a 10 cent admission fee. Later additions included cottages for rent or sale, boating, canoeing, fishing, and camping. Facilities included a picnic area, dance hall, and band shell.
Entertainment included local bands and as well as celebrities such as the Lone Ranger.

===Mountain Valley Lake===

Beury&#x27;s Grove, Inc began seeking a buyer for the grove in 1957

which culminated in the sale to a group of private investors called Mountain Valley Lake, Inc in 1962.

Despite the corporation changing the attraction&#x27;s name to &quot;Mountain Valley Lake,&quot; most references included the parenthetical &quot;Formerly Beury&#x27;s Grove&quot; since that name remained in common use. Competition from other area attractions (for example, Knoebel&#x27;s Grove which started as a similar summer swimming site and continued to expand into an amusement park with thrill rides) and changing social interests led to decreasing attendance and financial difficulties for Mountain Valley Lake. The corporation faced a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1970.

The lake closed for the 1971 season and permanently in 1974.
The corporation then tried to sell the location which contained the lake and a few surrounding lands and buildings from 1974 through 1983.

===Moon Lake Association===

In 1984 the lake property was purchased by Moon Lake Association, Inc.
 The lake proper was also renamed &quot;Moon Lake&quot; at this time and is shown as such
in the Census-designated place map of Barry Township
This was a homeowner&#x27;s association created by a group of homeowners surrounding the lake who were interested in preserving the lake. This voluntary association continues to represent the interests of those living in the area around the lake.

<doc id="133640" wikidata="Q3476375" url="?curid=133640" title="Coaldale, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania">
<text>Coaldale is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. Initially settled in 1827, it was incorporated in 1906 from part of the former Rahn Township; it is named for the coal industry—wherein, it was one of the principal early mining centers. Coaldale is in the southern Anthracite Coal region in the Panther Creek Valley, a tributary of the Little Schuylkill River, along which U.S. Route 209 was eventually built between the steep climb up Pisgah Mountain from Nesquehoning (easterly) and its outlet in Tamaqua, approximately five miles to the west.
The town is virtually joined at the hip to nearby Lansford, to its immediate east—as both were founded as company towns on lands owned by and mined by the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (LC&amp;N) while technically &quot;on opposite sides of the county lines&quot;. The history, business situation, and fortunes of not just the two, but of three towns, the third being the nearby Summit Hill, located a few thousand feet upslope, were tied in decades of co-development because the LC&amp;N had built the western terminus of the nation&#x27;s second railroad, the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Gravity Railway to ship coal out, and opened multiple mines throughout Coaldale and Lansford and the rest of the Panther Creek Valley in the days when railroads were coming into their own. The town has a bus stop with a mural on one side reading: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Goal Is Mine More Coal&quot; and the other side reading: &quot;A Car More a Day Means More Pay&quot;. The area on the western border of the borough is known as Seek.

There is a historical marker for Mother Jones located in Coaldale, as she organized many strikes and protests on behalf of coal miners around the country for improved pay, safer work environment and child labor laws. She organized a march for child workers that started in Coaldale and proceeded to McAdoo. At one trial for Mary Jones, a prosecution lawyer famously said, &quot;there sits the most dangerous woman in America... to put down their tools and walk out&quot;.

Herbert Whildin was elected mayor in 2017.

==History==
The origins of today&#x27;s Coaldale have their beginnings in West Penn and Rahn townships. Rahn Township was formed from West Penn Township in 1860. Initially, the land was developed for its timber tracts, with only a few farms to indicate an attempt at agriculture. The beginnings of present-day Coaldale date from 1827, when John Moser and his wife settled there. Moser was born on May 24, 1805, in Tamaqua and was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Burkardt Moser, the original settlers of Tamaqua. Upon arriving at a site that is present day Coaldale, John Moser built a log cabin on the north side of what was known as the Manila Grove Park. Today, the St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital is located on this site.

Coaldale (alternatively known in the 19th century as Coal Dale) developed from scattered villages. The first dwelling houses (other than Moser&#x27;s) were erected nearby in 1846 in what was known as Bugtown, located along the main road directly below the current St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital. Houses were then erected in 1848 at old Coal Dale on the Summit Hill road.
Gearytown was established in 1866. That village was named in honor of the then Pennsylvania Governor, John W. Geary. Houses in Bull Run were erected in 1864 by the Greenwood Coal Co., run by Charles F. Shoener and William Carter (who purchased the nearby breaker of the same name). Shortly after the mines began working, the population increased, and many new dwellings were built, practically all by the company. New Wales, or New Coal Dale, began later in 1868 or 1869. Housing on the line of Schuylkill and Carbon counties were erected beginning in 1870. Centerville was located on the south side of Coaldale but was abandoned because of mines located beneath the surface.

Coal Dale received a post office in 1871, thereby formalizing the name. The Greenwood breaker burned down in 1874 and in 1878 the Lehigh Navigation and Coal Co. purchased this property. Coaldale was in the midst of the following LC&amp;N mines - Nos. 4–6, Lansford; Nos. 8, 9, 12, Coaldale; Nos. 10 and 15, Greenwood; No. 11, Rahn; and No. 14, Tamaqua.

Coaldale was historically a coal-mining town, where the entire region was effectively the property of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company. The mine, the railroads the LC&amp;N put in and a small shirt factory were the main historic industries in Coaldale. Because of the adverse topology, the LC&amp;N took several decades to survey and drive a railbed with a negotiable grade from Mauch Chunk through Nesquehoning, along the Nesquehoning ridge to Hometown, and then up the Panther Creek Valley from Tamaqua.

Coaldale also became the site of a State Hospital that was established to take care of coal miners. During the early years of mining in the Panther Valley, badly injured miners were taken to Ashland or Pottsville. This took a great deal of time. In 1909, the miners of the valley volunteered a pay day for the construction of a hospital, while the LC&amp;N donated a site for the building and matched every dollar donated. The area chosen for the hospital was Manila Grove, a park near where John Moser had built his first home. The hospital was completed on July 11, 1910. and exists today as St. Luke&#x27;s Miners Memorial Medical Center.

Some notable people come from here including:
*Former pro football player Johnny Gildea 
*George Welsh, an all American quarterback at the US Naval Academy and successful college head coach at the US Naval Academy and the University of Virginia 
*Miner-musician Albert B. Morgan, who wrote and recorded his song Union Man in the Newkirk Tunnel in 1946 for George Korson of the Library of Congress compilation of Miner Songs.

==Geography==

Coaldale is located at (40.822234, -75.910115), which is (technically) one mile southwest of Lansford as both municipalities lie along the border of Carbon and Schuylkill Counties.

It is located on the northwestern fringe of the Lehigh Valley and just two ridgelines away from the nearby Poconos, and drains to the Delaware River by way of Panther Creek, the Little Schuylkill River, and the Schuylkill River. Coaldale sits atop one of the richest coal seams in the eastern end of the southern Coal Region, which is still being exploited by a successor company of the LC&amp;N (called the Old Company in the valley), the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company (or the New Company). Coaldale&#x27;s elevation is 1050 feet above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

Coaldale is served by U.S. Route 209, which runs through neighboring Lansford&#x27;s business district, serving both municipalities as their main thoroughfare. The borough&#x27;s terrain is mostly hilly, many of those ancient mine tailings or culm piles, and when not developed, its lands are mostly forested.

<text>Cressona is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Formed in 1857 from part of North Manheim Township, it was founded by and named for John Chapman Cresson, a Philadelphia civil engineer and manager of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, president of the Mine Hill and Schuylkill Haven Railroad, and the chief engineer of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia.

==History==
Until the Mine Hill Road was built in Cressona, the borough remained mostly wilderness, with some minor agricultural areas. In 1831, the Mine Hill and Schuylkill Railroad was completed, and the tracks went through Cressona. The borough was historically called West Haven, but the name was changed to Cressona.

<text>Scent of a Woman is a 1992 American drama film produced and directed by Martin Brest that tells the story of a preparatory school student who takes a short-term job near Thanksgiving as a companion and assistant to a retired Army lieutenant colonel who is blind, depressed and irritable.

The film was adapted by Bo Goldman from the Italian novel &quot;Il buio e il miele&quot; () by Giovanni Arpino. This was previously adapted by Dino Risi for his 1974 Italian film &quot;Profumo di donna&quot;.

The American film stars Al Pacino and Chris O&#x27;Donnell, with James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman (credited as Philip S. Hoffman), Gabrielle Anwar and Bradley Whitford in supporting roles.

The film was shot primarily around New York State, and on location at Princeton University. Scenes were shot at the Emma Willard School, an all-girls school in Troy, New York; as well as at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the Fieldston School in New York City.

The film had a limited theatrical release on December 23, 1992, expanding nationwide on January 8, 1993. It received generally positive responses from critics and was a box-office success. Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. The film was nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published.

The film won three Golden Globe Awards, for Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Motion Picture – Drama.

==Plot==
Charlie Simms is a scholarship student at Baird, an exclusive New England preparatory school. Karen hires him to watch her uncle, retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, during Thanksgiving weekend. Charlie accepts so he can buy a plane ticket home to Gresham, Oregon, for Christmas. He meets Frank, a highly decorated, blind Vietnam War veteran who has become a cantankerous and cynical alcoholic.

Charlie and student George Willis Jr. witness three classmates set up a prank to humiliate the headmaster, Mr. Trask. Afterward, Trask learns of the witnesses and unsuccessfully presses them to name the perpetrators. He privately offers Charlie virtually guaranteed acceptance to Harvard University if Charlie will inform on the other students. Trask schedules a meeting of the school disciplinary committee to take place on the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend.

Frank Slade unexpectedly takes Charlie on a trip to New York City and arranges their stay at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. During dinner in the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel, Frank reveals that the goals of his trip are to stay at a luxurious hotel, enjoy good food and wine, visit his older brother, and have sex with a &quot;terrific&quot; woman. Afterward, he intends to die by suicide.

On Thanksgiving Day, they visit Frank&#x27;s brother at his home in White Plains. Frank provokes everyone at dinner, which ends up in a confrontation with his nephew Randy, who reveals that Frank was not blinded heroically in combat, but in an accident that occurred when he juggled live grenades to show off for a group of younger officers.

As they return to New York City, Charlie mentions his problem at school. Frank advises Charlie to turn informant, warning that George will probably submit to Trask&#x27;s pressure, so Charlie should act first so he can attend Harvard. While at a restaurant, Frank notices the scent of a young woman waiting for her date. He introduces himself and offers to teach her the tango. The evening ends with Frank having sex with a high-class escort, completing the stated objectives of his trip.

Despondent the next morning, Frank is uninterested in any suggestions for that day until Charlie suggests going for a ride. Frank talks a Ferrari salesman into letting them take a convertible for a test ride. When on the road, Frank becomes depressed again until Charlie allows him to drive. When they are pulled over by a policeman, Frank convinces the officer to let them go without revealing that he is blind.

After returning the car, Frank again becomes despondent. He jaywalks into rushing traffic on Park Avenue and narrowly escapes being struck by multiple cars. When they return to the hotel, Frank sends Charlie to buy cigars. Charlie leaves but becomes suspicious and returns to find Frank donning his dress uniform, preparing to end his life with his service pistol. Frank backs down after Charlie convinces him that he has much to live for and should courageously face his circumstances.

On Monday morning, Charlie and George appear before the Baird disciplinary committee with the student body in attendance. Frank unexpectedly arrives and sits with Charlie. George Jr. provides tentative identifications but claims he was not wearing his contact lenses, so he cannot be positive.

Charlie refuses to confirm George Jr.&#x27;s identification, so Trask recommends his expulsion. Frank gives a speech defending Charlie, denounces Baird for not living up to its own standards, and urges the committee to value Charlie&#x27;s integrity. The disciplinary committee places the instigators on probation, denies George credit for naming them, and excuses Charlie from the proceedings.

As Charlie escorts Frank to his limousine, political science professor Christine Downes, a member of the disciplinary committee, commends Frank for his speech. Frank flirts with Christine, and impresses her by knowing the name of her perfume. Charlie accompanies Frank home, where Frank happily greets his niece&#x27;s children.

==Production==
The rights to remake Dino Risi&#x27;s &quot;Profumo di donna&quot; were purchased by Ovidio G. Assonitis and first slated for presale by Ronald DeNeef&#x27;s Rainbow International at MIFED in October 1988, alongside Assonitis&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Door III&quot; and &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; (then called &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;). When Assonitis became Chairman of Cannon Pictures Inc. in 1989, he announced that his films currently in development and production, including the remake of &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, would be made and released under the Cannon banner.

By May 1990, Cannon Pictures had entered into an agreement with Universal Pictures to produce the film. in 1991, Bo Goldman was hired to write the screenplay. He later said, &quot;If there is a moral to the film, it is that if we leave ourselves open and available to the surprising contradictions in life, we will find the strength to go on.&quot;

Martin Brest was approached to direct the film in April 1991, and chose this film over another potential remake with which he was presented, a remake of &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; (which was made and released by Universal as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins). By early August, Brest had officially signed, and Al Pacino was being sought for the lead. Pacino officially signed on the following month.

===Casting===
Rising young actors, including Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Brendan Fraser, Anthony Rapp, Randall Batinkoff, Dante Basco, Chris Rock and Stephen Dorff auditioned for the role of Charlie Simms before Chris O&#x27;Donnell was cast in November 1991. Jack Nicholson was offered the role of Lt. Col. Frank Slade but turned it down.

===Research===
Pacino painstakingly researched his part in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. To understand what it feels like to be blind, he met clients of New York&#x27;s Associated Blind, being particularly interested in accounts by those who had lost their sight due to trauma. Clients traced the entire progression for him—from the moment when they knew that they would never see again to the depression and through to acceptance and adjustment. The Lighthouse, an advocacy group for the blind also in New York, schooled him in techniques that a vision impaired person might use to find a chair and seat themselves, pour liquid from a bottle, and light a cigar.

===Filming===
Production on &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; began on December 3, 1991, in New York City, and ran until April 1992. It was filmed in the following US locations.

==Track listing==
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number 20 at the US Box Office. It would go on to earn $63,095,253 in the US and Canada and over $71 million internationally (excluding Italy), totaling $134,095,253 worldwide.

===Critical response===
As of 2020, the film holds an 85% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 48 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It might soar on Al Pacino&#x27;s performance more than the drama itself, but what a performance it is – big, bold, occasionally over-the-top, and finally giving the Academy pause to award the star his first Oscar.&quot; The film holds a score of 59 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 14 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed reviews&quot;.

Two critics criticized the film for its length. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy said it &quot;goes on nearly an hour too long&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen writes that the &quot;two-character conceit doesn&#x27;t warrant a two-and-a-half-hour running time&quot;.

===Accolades===
Al Pacino won an Academy Award for Best Actor, the first of his career after four previous nominations for Best Actor. It was his eighth overall nomination. Ovidio G. Assonitis, who had originated the project and chose to go uncredited on the final cut of the film, took out a full-page advert in Variety congratulating Tom Pollock, Universal Pictures and Martin Brest for making the adaptation successful and praising Pacino on his Oscar win.

<text>Frackville is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Incorporated in 1876, Frackville is located at the intersection of Interstate 81 and Pennsylvania State Route 61, which is approximately northwest of Philadelphia and southwest of Scranton. Frackville is named for Daniel Frack, an early Anglo-American settler.

==History==
Frackville was settled in 1861. It was incorporated more than a decade later in 1876, when the villages of Frackville and Mountain City merged to form the borough of Frackville. The name &quot;Mountain City&quot;, however, is still a common nickname for the borough. A diner and beer distributor were both named after it.

Early in the 20th century, anthracite coal mining was the chief industry of this area, Northeastern Pennsylvania&#x27;s historic Coal Region. While many mines were operated in the area, the borough developed about 4 miles south of Shenandoah as a predominantly residential community - for workers in and related to mining. With many immigrants to the borough and region, they developed businesses reflecting their cultures. In 1922, Frackville had its own independent brewery. This was short lived after Prohibition was implemented by a national constitutional amendment. (It was later repealed.)

The Mahanoy Plane, which operated from 1862 to 1931 on Broad Mountain just to the north of the borough, was able to hoist 50,000 tons of coal daily. A small coal town, also known as a &quot;patch town&quot;, owned the name &quot;Mahanoy Plane&quot;. It is located at the northern foot of Frackville&#x27;s Broad Mountain. Railroad companies once located here transported coal from the region to markets.

Since the late 20th century, coal mining has largely ceased in the area. Industrial relics and infrastructure can be found in the thick forest north of the borough&#x27;s youth baseball complex, but historical preservation or restoration has yet to take place of such structures.

Frackville celebrated its centennial in 1976, while James Nahas was mayor. The week-long event, from August 22 to 28, hosted parades each night and brought the community closer together. The borough&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebration was held in 2001 and had similar events and effects. It culminated with a Frackville Cruise Night, which had car routes defined for roadways throughout the borough.

Many Frackville&#x27;s residents are employed at local factories of other industries, retail outlets, and the numerous Pennsylvania State Prisons in the immediate area. More commute daily for work in the cities of Pottsville, Hazleton, Allentown, Reading, or Harrisburg.

In 1900, the population was 2,595; in 1910, 3,118; and in 1940, 8,035, its peak. With the decline in coal mining and related jobs in the region, the population has declined. It was 4,361 at the 2000 census and 3,805 in 2010.

With access via Exit 24 from Interstate 81, Frackville is a popular stop for travelers. Destinations include Dutch Kitchen, a renovated diner. The Schuylkill Mall, a former Crown American shopping mall and one of the largest in Pennsylvania, operated in the south end of the borough from 1980 to January 15, 2018. The mall was demolished and replaced by an industrial warehouse.

Frackville was home of the Schuylkill County Brew Fest from 2015 to 2018. The fest moved in 2019 to Pottsville, Pennsylvania.

==Notable people==
Dennis Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, was born in the village of Homesville on the outskirts of Girardville in 1865 and served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1918 until his death in 1951.

A citizen who became famous in the &quot;wild west&quot; is &quot;Captain Jack&quot; Crawford, (also known as the &quot;Poet Scout&quot;) western actor, scout for General George Crook&#x27;s campaign in the Black Hills, native of Carndonagh, Ireland and performer with William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill), was postmaster and had a small general store in Girardville in 1869−1874, leaving town to go out west to find Gold. His poem &quot;Only a Miner Killed&quot; about his experiences as a miner in the region was said to be used by Bob Dylan as the basis for his song &quot;Only a Hobo.&quot;

Another famous citizen was John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Kehoe, the high constable of Girardville during the 1870s, whose charismatic leadership in the fight for labor rights by the coal miners of the period earned him a place in local, state, national and world history. Jack Kehoe was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and several divisions of the AOH now bear his name. Kehoe has gone down in history as a member of the Molly Maguires, a group of Irish immigrants who committed acts against the mine and railroad owners and was hanged along with 19 other alleged Molly Maguires in a series of trials. These hangings are popularly known as &quot;The Day of the Rope&quot;. Today, Black Jack&#x27;s tavern in Girardville, The Hibernian House, continues to be operated by his great-grandson, Joseph Wayne and is a popular destination for historians, genealogists, and tourists searching for information on the Molly Maguires, the coal region culture, and their Irish roots. Wayne&#x27;s exhaustive efforts in the 1970s obtained a posthumous pardon for his great-grandfather through then Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp. John Kehoe, a native of County Wicklow, Ireland, was buried in old St. Jerome&#x27;s Cemetery in Tamaqua. His gravesite is a historical site maintained by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. 

Colonel Patrick H. Monaghan, a native of County Mayo, Ireland, who emigrated at the age of five and later became a naturalized American citizen, won the U.S. Medal of Honor, for recapturing the regimental flag of the 7th New York Heavy Artillery on June 17, 1864, while fighting in the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia during the American Civil War. A teacher in the Schuylkill County public schools from 1873 to 1916, Monaghan was also appointed to the post of superintendent of the school system in Girardville, a position he continued to hold from the early 1880s until August 20, 1909, when he was moved by his school board into an elementary school principal&#x27;s position, according to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;:

The town of Girardville is alluded to in the comic book series &quot;Amelia Rules!&quot; Created by Girardville native Jimmy Gownley, the series, begun in 2001, has won several awards, been translated into numerous languages, and even turned into a stage musical.

==History==

The earliest available history shows that in 1831 the entire Heckscherville valley contained only two villages. At this time the valley was called “Chapmanville” after the owners of the coal mines. In 1843 the Chapmanville interests were taken over by George and William Payne. Subsequently, the valley’s name was changed to “Payne’s Patch”.

With coal sales increasing, the Payne brothers found it necessary to secure additional laborers. Taking advantage of the famine in Ireland in 1845, they traveled to Ireland to persuade hundreds of families and individuals to move to America. The Payne brothers focused on the Queens and Kilkenny counties, and provided transportation, employment and homes to those who agreed to move. Before the brothers returned to Payne’s Patch, the valley was populated almost entirely by Welsh with only a few scattered Irish families. However, when they did return with the Irish immigrants, the Welsh started to migrate elsewhere and the population changed to mostly Irish. This influx of immigrants continued until almost the entire population was either Irish or of Irish descent. Because of this, the small valley then became known as the “Irish Valley”.

The August Heckscher family from New York acquired the Payne brothers holding, and changed the name to Heckscherville.

Years later the population began to undergo another change. The coal companies, due to a manpower shortage, began to bring into the region laborers from various countries in Europe. Nationalities included: Polish, Lithuanians, Slavs, and Greeks. Today nearly every nationality is represented in the eight miles of the Heckscherville Valley.

==Education==
The school district is Minersville Area School District.

==Irish Festival==

Heckscherville hosted an annual &quot;Irish Festival&quot;, beginning in 1987 until 2010. This festival celebrated the settlement&#x27;s Irish heritage, and was the main fundraiser for the village&#x27;s Clover Fire Company. The members of the volunteer fire company and village residents were the main coordinators of the event. Before his death in 2001, Joseph Callaghan was the main coordinator and chairman of the Irish Festival. During this time, it was considered one of the best Irish Festivals on the east coast. Local hotels would often be completely booked during the weekend of the festival, with people coming from as far as Anchorage, Alaska.

The festival was also known as &quot;Irish Weekend&quot;; it featured aspects of Irish culture from food to family. A wide assortment of food vendors provided Irish comfort foods, including Irish stew, potato pancakes, soda bread, scones, and colcannon (a mixture of cabbage, onions, turnips, mashed potatoes). Irish music was also an integral part of the festival. It has been the launching pad for one Philadelphia based band Blackthorne. Other acts who have performed during the festival include The Molly Wogs, Ceann, The Martin Family, The Irish Lads and Irishtown Road. In addition to the stage bands, other entertainment includes storytelling, Irish plays and Irish dancing.

==Saint Kierans Church==
Saint Keirans is a Roman Catholic church in Heckscherville. It is the sole church in the town and was built by Irish miners in the 1850s under the direction of John Neumann. Neumann was the first United States Bishop to be made a saint. St. Kieran&#x27;s is the only church whose construction the Bishop personally oversaw, traveling to the valley on three occasions to oversee the work. Architecturally designed after the tiny country church at Knock, Ireland (which became famous in 1879 due to an apparition of Our Lady of Knock), St. Kieran&#x27;s was rumored to be one of Bishop Neumann&#x27;s favored parishes. The little church was named after a parish in Kilkenny, Ireland, the home country of several of the congregation&#x27;s parishioners.

St. Kieran&#x27;s Church was closed in June 2008, a casualty in the widespread restructuring and consolidation of Roman Catholic churches currently underway in America. Currently there is a group of individuals working to preserve the Church. This group is known as &quot;The Friends of St. Kierans&quot;.

<text>In the Name of the Father is a 1993 biographical crime drama film co-written and directed by Jim Sheridan. It is based on the true story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings that killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the 1990 autobiography &quot;Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four&quot; by Gerry Conlon.

The film grossed $65 million at the box office and received overwhelmingly positive reviews. It was nominated for seven Oscars at the 66th Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Pete Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Emma Thompson), Best Director, and Best Picture.

==Plot==
In Belfast, Gerry Conlon is mistaken as an IRA sniper by British security forces and pursued until a riot breaks out. Gerry is sent to London by his father Giuseppe to dissuade an IRA reprisal against him.

One evening, Gerry burgles a prostitute&#x27;s flat and steals £700. While he is taking drugs in a park with his friend Paul Hill, alongside homeless Irishman Charlie Burke, an explosion in Guildford occurs, killing four off-duty soldiers plus a civilian as well as injuring many others. Returning to Belfast sometime later, Gerry is captured by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary and arrested on terrorism charges.

Gerry is flown to England, where he and his friend Paul together with two others are dubbed the Guildford Four and are subjected to police torture as part of their interrogation.

Gerry maintains his innocence, but signs a confession after the police threaten to kill his father, who is later arrested along with other members of the Conlon family, later dubbed the Maguire Seven. At his trial, although Gerry&#x27;s defence points out numerous inconsistencies in the police investigation, he, along with the rest of the Guildford Four, is sentenced to life imprisonment.

During their time in prison Gerry and Giuseppe are approached by new inmate Joe McAndrew, who informs them that he was the real perpetrator of the bombing and had confessed this to the police. The police, in order to save face, withheld this new information.

Though Gerry warms to Joe, his opinion changes when Joe sets a hated prison guard on fire during a riot. Giuseppe later dies in custody, leaving Gerry to take over his father&#x27;s campaign for justice.

Giuseppe&#x27;s lawyer Gareth Peirce, who had been investigating the case on Giuseppe&#x27;s behalf, discovers vital evidence related to Gerry&#x27;s original alibi with a note attached that reads: &quot;Not to be shown to the defence.&quot; Through a statement made by Charlie Burke, at a court appeal, it totally exonerates Gerry and the rest.

The film ends with the current activities of the wrongly accused being given, and also by stating that the police who investigated the case were never prosecuted for any wrongdoing. The real perpetrators of the Guildford Bombing have not been charged with the crime.

Model, now actress, Saffron Burrows made her feature film debut in the film, as Gerry Conlon&#x27;s free love-interest at a commune/squat in London at the time of the bombings.

==Production==
To prepare for the role of Gerry Conlon, Day-Lewis lost over in weight. To gain an insight into Conlon&#x27;s thoughts and feelings at the time, Day-Lewis also spent three days and nights in a jail cell. He was prevented from sleeping by a group of thugs, who would bang on the door every ten minutes with tin cups through the night, then he was interrogated by three different teams of real Special Branch officers for nine hours. He would also insist that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him. He also kept his Belfast accent on and off set.

Day-Lewis has stated in an interview that he went through all this because otherwise &quot;How could I understand how an innocent man could sign that confession and destroy his own life.&quot;

==Reception==
The film received very positive reviews from most critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 94% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Impassioned and meticulously observed, &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; mines rousing drama from a factual miscarriage of justice, aided by scorching performances and director Jim Sheridan&#x27;s humanist focus.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100 based on 16 reviews indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was the second highest-grossing ever in Ireland (behind &quot;Jurassic Park)&quot;, and the highest-grossing Irish film, beating the record set by &quot;The Commitments&quot; in 1991, with a gross of IR£2.91 million ($4.5 million).

===Accolades===

==Controversy==
Upon its release, the film proved controversial for some historical inaccuracies and for fictionalising parts of the story. Jim Sheridan defended his choices in 2003, stating: &quot;I was accused of lying in &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, but the real lie was saying it was a film about the Guildford Four when really it was about a non-violent parent.&quot; In the film Gerry and his father Giuseppe (in the closing credits, the name is misspelled &quot;Guiseppe&quot;) share a cell, but this never took place; they were usually kept in separate prisons. The real perpetrators of the Guildford pub bombings were the IRA&#x27;s Balcombe Street Gang, who admitted to the Guildford and Woolwich bombings during their trials, rather than the fictional character of Joe McAndrew. The courtroom scenes featuring Gareth Peirce were also heavily criticised as clearly straying from recorded events and established English legal practices since, as a solicitor and not a barrister, she would not have been able to appear in court at the time. Furthermore, Peirce did not represent Giuseppe Conlon. Investigative journalist David Pallister wrote: &quot;The myriad absurdities in the court scenes, straight out of &quot;LA Law&quot;, are inexcusable.&quot;

In a 1994 radio interview, Anne Maguire, a member of The Maguire Seven who, along with her husband, brother and two young sons, went to prison because of the false confessions of her nephew Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill, revealed her lingering anger and bitterness at the pair for wrongly incriminating them, as well as her dismay at the film for, in her view, depicting Conlon as a hero. (She and her family were all officially exonerated by the British government in 1991.) She also criticised director Jim Sheridan for, as she claims, never reaching out to her or her family for their side of the story, and sharply castigated the film for alleged inaccuracies, including a scene showing Conlon and Hill visiting her prior to their arrests, as she adamantly maintains that Hill never once set foot in her home—a key point in her defence at trial.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack of the film includes the song &quot;You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart&quot;, performed by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and written by Bono, Gavin Friday, and Maurice Seezer. The soundtrack also includes &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; performed by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. However, the Bob Dylan Song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was not included on the album due to licensing restrictions.

<text>Thunder Road is a 1958 American drama–crime film directed by Arthur Ripley and starring Robert Mitchum, who also wrote the story. The supporting cast features Gene Barry, Jacques Aubuchon, Keely Smith, James Mitchum, Sandra Knight, and Peter Breck. The film&#x27;s plot concerns running bootleg moonshine in the mountains of Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee in the late 1950s. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; became a cult film and continued to play at drive-in movie theaters in some southeastern states through the 1970s and 1980s.

==Plot==
Lucas Doolin (Robert Mitchum) works in the family moonshine business, running liquor his father distills to clandestine distribution points throughout the South in his hot rod. However, Lucas has more problems than evading government &quot;revenuers&quot;.

Both a hothead and a fatalist, he is concerned that his teen-aged younger brother Robin (James Mitchum), who is also his mechanic, will be tempted into following in his footsteps. An aggressive urban gangster, Carl Kogan (Jacques Aubuchon), is trying to gain control of the independent local moonshine producers and their distribution points. Dead shiners strewn along Thunder Road prove he is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way. Determined Treasury agent Troy Barrett (Gene Barry) is drawn in to stop the bloodshed, and its cause.

Barrett&#x27;s attempt to engage Lucas are thrown right back in his face. The stakes rise when an attempt by Kogan to kill Lucas results in the deaths of another moonshine driver, Jed Moultrie (Mitchell Ryan), and Treasury Agent Mike Williams (Dale Van Sickel) mistaken for him and one of Barrett&#x27;s men.

Still, Lucas does not back off, a stubbornness and strike-first hostility attributed by townsfolk to a &quot;machine-gunner&#x27;s mentality&quot; they feel he brought home from the Korean War, which pervades his every doing. Only with nightclub singer Francie Wymore (Keely Smith) can he drop his guard, as far as he is able. At the same time, he steadfastly resists the attentions of the belle of the mountain girls, innocent Roxanna Ledbetter (Sandra Knight), who has a crush on him and fears for his life.

When a series of government raids destroy local moonshiners&#x27; hidden stills, Lucas&#x27;s father and the others shut down production &quot;for a spell&quot; to let the government deal with Kogan in its own time. In spite of this, Lucas is forced by circumstances and his own code of honor to make one final run of his dad&#x27;s shine.

Kogan&#x27;s men successfully trick Robin into agreeing to drive for them, infuriating Lucas, who sends Robin home on the bus. Barrett tries to enlist Robin&#x27;s help in convincing Lucas it&#x27;s Kogan his Bureau is after, not his brother, but is rebuffed. In the exchange Barrett reveals Lucas never left the States in the Army and implies he may have spent his hitch in its stockade instead, explaining his pent-up anger and seeming death wish.

After Lucas meets with Francie and forebodingly gives her a large sum of money to hold for him, he calls Kogan to let him know he is coming to kill him for trying to set up his brother. Meanwhile, Roxanna spills all she knows about Lucas&#x27;s intended final moonshine run – for now, anyway, till things sort out – to agent Barrett&#x27;s wife when she can&#x27;t contact Barrett directly. He deploys a sweeping dragnet of Bureau men and state police in an attempt to intercept Lucas before he gets caught, or killed, in Kogan&#x27;s trap.

Kogan sends his top henchman after Lucas just before Barrett and his officers arrive and arrest Kogan for murder. Lucas turns the tables on Kogan&#x27;s driver and runs him off the road. Kogan&#x27;s men then set spike strips to blow out Lucas&#x27;s tires, which send his car careening down an embankment into an arcing electrical transformer. Barrett arrives too late to help with anything.

As a snake of headlights winds up the lonely mountain road back home, Robin and Roxanna stand alone in silence. The same cortege of mourners bring their own back home as when a local boy was taken out by Kogan&#x27;s men early in the conflict. As the glows draw closer Robin and Roxanne approach one another slowly. Without a word they clasp hands and walk away together into the dark.

==Cast==
* Robert Mitchum as Lucas Doolin
* Gene Barry as Troy Barrett
* Jacques Aubuchon as Carl Kogan
* Keely Smith as Francie Wymore
* Trevor Bardette as Vernon Doolin
* Sandra Knight as Roxanna Ledbetter
* James Mitchum as Robin Doolin
* Peter Breck as Stacey Gouge, a rival driver

* Dale Van Sickel as Mike Williams (uncredited) 
* Nicholas Mann Konrad as Robert Mitchum&#x27;s stunt driver

==Production==
The film was a production of Mitchum&#x27;s own company, DRM, but no producer was credited.

The film was based loosely on an incident in which a driver transporting moonshine was said to have crashed to his death on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, between Bearden Hill and Morrell Road. Per &quot;Metro Pulse&quot; writer Jack Renfro, the incident occurred in 1952 and may have been witnessed by James Agee, who passed the story on to Mitchum.

===Casting===
The part of Lucas&#x27;s younger brother, Robin, was originally written for Elvis Presley per Mitchum&#x27;s request. Mitchum personally submitted the script to Elvis in Los Angeles. The singer was eager to play the role, but his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, demanded Elvis be paid a ridiculous sum of money, more than the entire budget for the movie, which ended negotiations. Mitchum&#x27;s elder son, James, who strongly resembled his father, got the part instead. It was his first credited film role.

===Filming===

In the film, Mitchum drove a souped-up black 1950 Ford two-door sedan (which was later repainted gray) with a custom tank in the back for moonshine liquor and a newer OHV Ford V8 with three two-barrel carburetors, but after it was blown up by Kogan&#x27;s men, it was replaced with a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 two-door sedan.

Most of the scenes were filmed in Woodfin, North Carolina, along U.S. Route 19 and others at Lake Lure. Some scenes were filmed in Beech, east of Weaverville. Scenes include Reems Creek Road, Sugar Creek Road, and the Beech Community Center. Some scenes were actual local moonshine drivers shot with a camera mounted on a pickup tailgate. Many city scenes were filmed in Asheville, North Carolina, including the explosion of Doolin&#x27;s car.

The stunt coordinator was Carey Loftin, with a stunt team of Hollywood&#x27;s most accomplished stunt drivers, Ray Austin, Neil Castes Sr., Robert Hoy, and Dale Van Sickel.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Whippoorwill&quot;, was sung by Keely Smith in her role as a nightclub singer, and a different studio rendition by her was released as a 45 rpm single on Capitol Records. Mitchum wrote the music with lyrics by Don Raye. The film&#x27;s opening song, also co-written by Mitchum, is &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot;, sung by Randy Sparks, a different arrangement of which was recorded by Mitchum and released as a popular 45 rpm single, also on Capitol.

==Reception==
A contemporary review by &quot;Whit.&quot; of &quot;Variety&quot; said it was &quot;Burdened with an overage of dialog and an abundance of uneventful footage&quot;, but it had &quot;plenty of fast auto action&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Bruce Springsteen said at a 1978 concert that the name of his song &quot;Thunder Road&quot; had been inspired by seeing a poster of the movie, but he had not seen the movie.

In the episode of &quot;Cheers&quot; titled &quot;And Coachie Makes Three&quot;, Sam and Coach watch the movie as part of a long-running tradition they have with viewing Robert Mitchum movies.

<text>Mahanoy City is a borough located southwest of Wilkes-Barre and 13 miles southwest of Hazleton, in northern Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Coal Region of Pennsylvania and is surrounded by (but not part of) Mahanoy Township.

The name Mahanoy is believed to be a variation of the Delaware word , or &quot;the salt deposits&quot;.

==History==
Mahanoy City, originally a part of Mahanoy township, was settled in 1859 and incorporated as a borough by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill County on December 16, 1863. It was served by branches of the Lehigh Valley and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading railways.

Mahanoy City lies in a valley in the Pennsylvania Coal Region and was a major center of anthracite production; the area was embroiled in the Molly Maguires incidents. In 2010, the borough erected the Molly Maguire Historic Park, which features a Zenos Frudakis statue of a hooded miner on a gallows about to be hanged.

The borough&#x27;s principal industries remain the mining and shipping of coal, although the demand for it has steadily declined since its peak in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1930 the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker was built and went into operation in 1932. A controlled explosion destroyed the breaker in March 2018.

Fire clay abounds locally. The manufacturing of shirts, bedding and foundry products is also fairly prominent.

In 1948, Mahanoy City became the first municipality in the country to have cable TV.

<text>Minersville is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. Anthracite coal deposits are plentiful in the region. The population was 4,388 at the 2020 census.

Minersville is located west of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
In the year 1783, a settler by the name of Adolph Oliver Busch traveled through the valley between the Thomaston Mountains and the Gap Rocks. At this junction, several mountain streams converged where this settler built a log cabin and a sawmill on the west Branch of the Schuylkill River, just below the mouth of Wolf Creek. Shortly thereafter, he built a tavern on the South Side of the Sunbury Trail on the present site of the Saint Michael the Archangel Church.

This tavern was referred to as the &quot;Half Way House&quot;, because it was half-way between Reading and Sunbury. The Sunbury Trail was the first road through Schuylkill County and was known as the Kings Highway which was authorized by the Crown of England, King George III in 1770. The early settlers engaged in timbering as their first livelihood, but experienced difficulty in transporting the heavy logs out of the valley. The rough timber was floated by raft to Schuylkill Haven to the Schuylkill Canal and on to Reading where it was sold or traded for other products. Necho Allen discovered coal in 1799, but it was not until 1814 that any actual mining took place. Dr. McFarland, a scientist, opened a vein at York Farm near Pottsville. Later, in 1818, Jacob Reed, son of the original founder, opened another vein in the Minersville Area.

 The completion of the Schuylkill Haven and Mine Hill Railroad provided the means to transport the coal produced in the region. The development of the coal industry grew rapidly and attracted many immigrants. Experienced English and Welsh miners arrived first from their respective countries. The next arrivals were Germans and Irish immigrants, soon to be followed by many other ethnic groups that make up the community.

 The influx of inhabitants to the community promoted the need to begin municipal planning. Titus Bennett laid out the town in 1830 on parts of two tracts of land patented to Lawrence Lewis and Robert M. Lewis on July 20, 1829, at that time part of Branch Township. On May 2, 1830, Minersville citizens held an election at the home of David Buckwater for the purpose of electing a Burgess. Samuel Richert was elected to this position, as well as the following men who served on the first Council: John Provst, John Patrick, Dr. Anthony Steinberger, John L. Swaine, John B. Hahn, David Buckwater and Daniel R. Bennet. The first president of the town council was Daniel R. Bennet; first treasurer, Thomas J. Harman, Clerk, and Milligan G. Gable, High Constable. Minersville was incorporated as a borough on April 1, 1831 by Act of the legislature approved by Governor George Wolf. Minersville School District was involved in a national court case gaining much attention; Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 1940. This case dealt with a family whose children would not salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance because of their religious beliefs (they were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses). This case would put Minersville &quot;on the map,&quot; as it reached all the way to the Supreme Court. The final verdict was that the school district could, in fact, make students stand, salute, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. This decision came under much scrutiny and would not stay long, as it would be overturned shortly thereafter by West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette.

<doc id="133682" wikidata="Q549569" url="?curid=133682" title="Mount Carbon, Pennsylvania">
<text>Mount Carbon is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States, two miles south of Pottsville. It was formed from North Manheim Township in 1864. The population was 88 in the 2020 census. The borough is the smallest municipality in Schuylkill County.

==The old Mount Carbon Brewery==
The borough was home for many years to the Mount Carbon Brewery, which closed in the late 1970s. D.G. Yuengling &amp; Son bought the rights to use the Mount Carbon (Bavarian) name and label when Mount Carbon Brewery went out of business in 1977. Yuengling brewed Mount Carbon for a short time but eventually abandoned it. 7up bottling Co. then took over the building for years as a distribution and shipping point.

==Government==
Mount Carbon has also had one of the youngest mayors in history; Mayor Jeffrey Dunkel was sworn in as mayor when he was only 18-years-old. On July 16, 2015, The Pottsville Republican Herald reported that Mayor Dunkel will resign after 13 years for a 
job opportunity in another state. He was succeeded by Donna Porter, who also resigned after moving outside the borough.

The borough was considering a merger with the City of Pottsville. The merger was shot down by the residents, and the borough has been making financial progress since a new council took the helm. In 2019, the borough had no functioning government after the borough secretary resigned and three borough council members quit. That year, John Raess was elected mayor by two write-in votes and borough council member by five write-in votes. Raess was the only person to show up to the borough council reorganization meeting, meaning there would be no functioning government in 2020. As a result, Mount Carbon may have to merge with Pottsville, which would need to be approved by voters in both municipalities. Another option would be to merge with North Manheim Township, though that would force the borough to change school districts.

==Transportation==
Mount Carbon was the terminus of the original Philadelphia and Reading Railway, opened in 1842. Mount Carbon was a very active location along the Canal. The Hotel which was located at the present Pottsville Pizzeria, was rumored to have royalty stay there on their travels.

South Centre Street, Main Street, Sherwood Drive and the Mt. Carbon Arch are the only streets of the borough. Pennsylvania Route 61 passes to the east of Mount Carbon and access is provided by a bridge over the Schuylkill River. The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates along the former tracks of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, later known as the Reading Company.

==Geography==
Mount Carbon is located at (40.672364, -76.187494).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2), all land.

==Early Mt. Carbon History==
Among the first inhabitants of the settlement of Mt. Carbon were Lewis Murphy and Joseph Porter. The first dam for the Schuylkill Canal was built at Mount Carbon on the Schuylkill River in the spring of 1817. The entire canal was in operation by 1824.

By 1818, Necho Allen resided here, engaged in lumbering, and built a saw-mill. Although coal was to become the principal commodity transported on the canal, the company conveyed lumber and merchandise as well. By 1828 the village consisted of six homes, one store, an office building and a large stone warehouse, used to store produce, which was brought in wagons from surrounding counties to be sent to market in Philadelphia.

In 1829 John White (President of the Mt. Carbon Railroad) began the Mansion House construction here. During this same year, the Norwegian and Mount Carbon Railroad was incorporated and by April 1831, coal was being conveyed through Mt. Carbon from the rich coalfields north and west of present day Pottsville to Philadelphia.

In 1842, the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company had made Mt. Carbon the termination point of its railroad line from Philadelphia in direct competition with the Schuylkill Canal. The canal company was leased by the railroad in 1870 and the canal north of Port Clinton was abandoned at the signing of the lease. The Philadelphia and Reading Company leased the Mt. Carbon Railroad on May 16, 1862, and merged the line into the parent organization on June 13, 1872.

In 1849, geologist Isaac Lea discovered fossilized footprints of &quot;Sauropus&quot; in red sandstone in Mount Carbon. Lea contended the tracks were reptilian and that due to the level of strata where the footprints were found, they were from the Devonian Period between 360 and 408 million years old and constituted a new species that he named &quot;Sauropus primaevus&quot;. The footprints have since been identified as coming from an amphibian now known as &quot;Palaeosauropus primaevus&quot; from the Mississippian Age over 330 million years ago.

New Philadelphia had historically been an anthracite mining town.

Because of the high number of Lithuanians and Irish in the area, there was much separation of the two nationalities. This tension ultimately resulted in the forming of two separate Catholic churches; Sacred Heart (Lithuanian) and Holy Family (Irish). There was also a town-wide brawl that occurred as a result of this tension. The dispute was settled by the priests from Sacred Heart and Holy Family calling their respective patrons to stop fighting and buying each other a beer.

In 2008, the two Catholic parishes were merged to create Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church.

In 2012, the Souls Harvest Baptist Church relocated to New Philadelphia from Port Carbon. They are now located at the corner of Kimber and Clay streets in the building that once housed a Methodist church. This building is the oldest building in town.

<text>The Piano is a 1993 historical drama film written and directed by New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion. It stars Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, and Anna Paquin in her first major acting role. The film focuses on a mute Scottish woman who travels to a remote part of New Zealand with her young daughter after her arranged marriage to a settler. The plot has similarities to Jane Mander&#x27;s 1920 novel, &quot;The Story of a New Zealand River&quot;, but also substantial differences. Campion has cited the novels &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The African Queen&quot; as inspirations.

An international co-production between New Zealand, Australia, and France, &quot;The Piano&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$140.2 million worldwide (equivalent to $ million in ) against its US$7 million budget (equivalent to $ million in ). It was noted for its crossover appeal beyond the arthouse circuit to attracting mainstream popularity, largely due to rave reviews and word of mouth.

Hunter and Paquin both received high praise for their performances. In 1993, the film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making Campion the first female director to receive the award. It won three Academy Awards out of eight total nominations in March 1994: Best Actress for Hunter, Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, and Best Original Screenplay for Campion. Paquin was 11 years old at the time and remains the second-youngest actor to win an Oscar in a competitive category.

==Plot==
In the mid-1800s, Ada McGrath, a Scottish woman with elective mutism, travels to colonial New Zealand with her daughter Flora for an arranged marriage to settler Alisdair Stewart. Ada has not spoken since the age of six, and the reason for this as well as the identity of Flora&#x27;s father remain unknown. She communicates through playing the piano and sign language, with Flora acting as her interpreter.

Ada and Flora, along with their handcrafted piano, are stranded on a New Zealand beach by a ship&#x27;s crew. The next day, Alisdair arrives with his Māori crew and neighbour George Baines, a retired sailor who&#x27;s adapted to Maori customs, including facial tattoos. Alisdair tells Ada that they don&#x27;t have enough bearers for the piano and then refuses to go back for it, claiming that they all need to make sacrifices. Desperate to retrieve her piano, Ada seeks George&#x27;s help. While at first saying no, he appears to give in due to her keenness on recovering the piano. Once at the beach, he is entranced by her music and appears charmed by her happy ways when she is playing, in contrast to her stern behaviour when in the farm. 

George offers Alisdair the land he&#x27;s been coveting in exchange for the piano and Ada&#x27;s lessons. Alisdair agrees, oblivious to George&#x27;s attraction to Ada. Ada is enraged by George&#x27;s proposition but agrees to trade lessons for piano keys. She restricts the lessons to the black keys only and resists George&#x27;s demands for more intimacy. Ada continues to rebuff Alisdair&#x27;s advances while exploring her sensuality with George. George eventually realizes that Ada will never commit to him emotionally and returns the piano to her, confessing that he wants Ada to care for him genuinely.

Although Ada has her piano back, she longs for George and returns to him. Alisdair overhears them having sex and watches them through a crack in the wall. Furious, he confronts Ada and tries to force himself on her despite her strong resistance. He then coerces Ada into promising she will no longer see George.

Shortly after, Ada instructs Flora to deliver a package to George, which contains a piano key with a love declaration engraved on it. Flora delivers it to Alisdair instead. Enraged after reading the message, Alisdair cuts off Ada&#x27;s index finger, depriving her of the ability to play the piano. He sends Flora to George with the severed finger, warning him to stay away from Ada or he will chop off more fingers. Later, while touching Ada as she sleeps, Alisdair hears what he thinks is her voice in his head, asking him to let George take her away. He goes to George&#x27;s house and asks if Ada has ever spoken to him, but George says no. George and Ada leave together with her belongings and piano tied onto a Māori canoe. As they row to the ship, Ada asks George to throw the piano overboard. She allows her leg to be caught by the rope attached to the piano and is dragged underwater with it in an attempt to drown herself. As she sinks, she appears to change her mind and struggles free before being pulled to safety.

In the epilogue, Ada describes her new life with George and Flora in Nelson, New Zealand, where she gives piano lessons in their new home. George has made her a metal finger to replace the one she lost, and Ada has been practicing and taking speech lessons. She sometimes dreams of the piano resting at the bottom of the ocean with her still tethered to it.

==Production==
The film was originally titled &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;, but the filmmakers could not obtain the rights to use the title because of the American play of the same name, and it was changed to &quot;The Piano&quot;.

Casting the role of Ada was a difficult process. Sigourney Weaver was Campion&#x27;s first choice, but she was not interested. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also considered, but had a conflict with her commitment to &quot;Rush&quot; (1991). Isabelle Huppert met with Jane Campion and had vintage period-style photographs taken of her as Ada, and later said she regretted not fighting for the role as Hunter did.

The casting for Flora occurred after Hunter had been selected for the part. They did a series of open auditions for girls age 9 to 13, focusing on girls who were small enough to be believable as Ada&#x27;s daughter (as Holly Hunter is relatively short at tall). Anna Paquin ended up winning the role of Flora over 5,000 other girls.

Alistair Fox has argued that &quot;The Piano&quot; was significantly influenced by Jane Mander&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a New Zealand River&quot;. Robert Macklin, an associate editor with &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; newspaper, has also written about the similarities. The film also serves as a retelling of the fairytale &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, itself depicted as a scene in the Christmas pageant. Campion has cited the novels &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The African Queen&quot; as inspirations.

In July 2013, Campion revealed that she originally intended that the main character would drown in the sea after going overboard after her piano.

Principal photography took place over 12 weeks from February to mid-May 1992. &quot;The Piano&quot; was filmed in New Zealand’s North Island. The scene where Ada comes ashore and the piano is abandoned was filmed at Karekare Beach, west of Auckland. Bush scenes were filmed near Matakana and Awakino, while underwater scenes were filmed at the Bay of Islands.

Campion was determined to market the film to appeal to a larger audience than the limited audiences many art films attracted at the time. Simona Benzakein, the publicist for &quot;The Piano&quot; at Cannes noted: &quot;Jane and I discussed the marketing. She wanted this to be not just an elite film, but a popular film.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Reviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive. Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;&quot;The Piano&quot; is as peculiar and haunting as any film I&#x27;ve seen&quot; and &quot;it is one of those rare movies that is not just about a story, or some characters, but about a whole universe of feeling&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it an &quot;evocative, powerful, extraordinarily beautiful film&quot;.

&quot;The Piano&quot; was named one of the best films of 1993 by 86 film critics, making it the most acclaimed film of 1993.

In his &quot;2013 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film three and half out of four stars, calling the film a &quot;haunting, unpredictable tale of love and sex told from a woman&#x27;s point of view&quot; and went on to say &quot;writer-director Campion has fashioned a highly original fable, showing the tragedy and triumph erotic passion can bring to one&#x27;s daily life&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 71 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Powered by Holly Hunter&#x27;s main performance, &quot;The Piano&quot; is a truth-seeking romance played in the key of erotic passion.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Box office===
The film was the highest-grossing New Zealand film of all-time surpassing &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1986) with a gross of $NZ3.8 million.

It grossed over US$140 million worldwide, including $7 million in Australia, $16 million in France, and $39 million in the United States and Canada.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture), winning three for Best Actress (Holly Hunter), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin) and Best Original Screenplay (Jane Campion). At age 11, Anna Paquin became the second youngest competitive Academy Award winner (after Tatum O&#x27;Neal in 1973).

At the Cannes Film Festival, the film won the Palme d&#x27;Or (sharing with Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;), with Campion becoming the first woman to win the honour, as well as the first filmmaker from New Zealand to achieve this. Holly Hunter also won Best Actress.

In 2019, the BBC polled 368 film experts from 84 countries to name the 100 best films by women directors, and &quot;The Piano&quot; was named the top film, with nearly 10% of the critics polled giving it first place on their ballots.

==Soundtrack==

The score for the film was written by Michael Nyman, and included the acclaimed piece &quot;The Heart Asks Pleasure First&quot;; additional pieces were &quot;Big My Secret&quot;, &quot;The Mood That Passes Through You&quot;, &quot;Silver Fingered Fling&quot;, &quot;Deep Sleep Playing&quot; and &quot;The Attraction of the Pedalling Ankle&quot;. This album is rated in the top 100 soundtrack albums of all time and Nyman&#x27;s work is regarded as a key voice in the film, which has a mute lead character. The main musical score &quot;The Heart Asks Pleasure First&quot; is based on the traditional Scottish song &quot;Gloomy Winter&#x27;s Noo Awa&#x27;&quot; 

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on May 25, 1994. Initial fears in leadup to its release were in relation to the films status as &quot;arty&quot; and &quot;non-mainstream,&quot; however its nominations and success at the Academy Awards guaranteed it profitability in the home video market. It finished in the top 30 video rentals of 1994 in the United States. It was released on DVD in 1997 by LIVE Entertainment and on Blu-ray on 31 January 2012 by Lionsgate, but already released in 2010 in Australia.

On 11 August 2021, the Criterion Collection announced their first 4K Ultra HD releases, a six-film slate, will include &quot;The Piano&quot;. Criterion indicated each title would be available in a 4K UHD+Blu-ray combo pack, including a 4K UHD disc of the feature film as well as the film and special features on the companion Blu-ray. &quot;The Piano&quot; was released on January 25, 2022.

<doc id="133695" wikidata="Q1181611" url="?curid=133695" title="Palo Alto, Pennsylvania">
<text>Palo Alto is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. Bacon Street is the main street of town.

This borough stretches along the south bank of the Schuylkill River, and maintains its own fire department, but shares its zip code, telephone exchanges and school district with the city of Pottsville.

The population was nine hundred and seventy-one at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Heavily forested until the mid-1870s, the land which became the community of Palo Alto was the site of a log cabin and wooden blacksmith&#x27;s shanty earlier in the nineteenth century. As more and more settlers arrived in the region, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the Schuylkill Navigation Company (later known as the Schuylkill Canal) opened stops here. In response, the neighboring land was surveyed and plotted out by John G. Hewes between late 1844 and early 1845 to create the town of Palo Alto.

As more boatmen and other laborers arrived to work on the canal and railroad, mining companies continued to increase their hiring of miners to work deep underground in their anthracite coal collieries that were operating across Schuylkill County, which sparked the opening of stores and other businesses to serve the town&#x27;s growing population.

A public school was established sometime during this phase of the community&#x27;s expansion; it was situated in the town&#x27;s eastern section.

Officially incorporated as a borough in 1854, Palo Alto may have been given its name because of &quot;very high timber [that] grew on the mountain above it,&quot; according to historians. According to a borough history, Palo Alto was named for the Battle of Palo Alto, the first major battle of the Mexican-American War near present-day Brownsville, Texas.

The borough&#x27;s first elected officials were Burgess Waters S. Chillson, William M. Stellwagon, clerk, and borough council members William Bensinger, Allen Enison, John Griner, Jacob Lime, David Riley, and William Stellwagon. A second public school was then opened in the borough&#x27;s western section. Both schools were two-room structures with stone exteriors.

Between 1854 and 1855, William Harris erected and began operating a large rolling mill plant, which produced railroad iron. That plant was subsequently purchased by Benjamin Haywood, who built a second rolling mill in the town in 1863. The two-plant operation was known as the Palo Alto Rolling Mill. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which was one of the company&#x27;s major customers, operated a roundhouse and repair facility roughly a mile west of both rolling mills.

By 1856, a stable water system was in place with water supplied by the Pottsville Water Company.

In 1866, community leaders designed and built a Methodist Episcopal church on Union Street at a cost of thirteen hundred dollars.

The borough&#x27;s first post office opened in 1870, but it ceased operations in 1873. Mail service was subsequently provided by a post office branch in Pottsville.

In 1878, borough leaders built a new, two-story public school in the center of the community. Equipped with mountain spring-supplied water and steam heat, it delivered multiple grades of education in four classrooms while the two older schools focused on providing primary school instruction.

<text>The Power Macintosh 8500 is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from August 1995 to February 1997. Billed as a high-end graphics computer, the Power Macintosh 8500 was initially released with a 120 MHz PowerPC 604, and unlike earlier Power Macintosh machines, the CPU was mounted on an upgradeable daughtercard. Though slower than the 132 MHz Power Macintosh 9500, the first-generation 8500 featured several audio and video (S-Video and composite video) in/out ports not found in the 9500. In fact, the 8500 incorporated near-broadcast quality (640×480) A/V input and output and was the first personal computer to do so, but no hard drive manufactured in 1997 could sustain the 18 MB/s data rate required to capture video at that resolution. Later, special &quot;AV&quot; hard drives were made available that could delay thermal recalibration until after a write operation had completed. With special care to minimize fragmentation, these drives were able to keep up with the 8500&#x27;s video circuitry.

The 8500 was introduced alongside the Power Macintosh 7200 and 7500 at the 1995 MacWorld Expo in Boston. Apple referred to these machines collectively as the &quot;Power Surge&quot; line, communicating that these machines offered a significant speed improvement over its predecessors. Infoworld Magazine&#x27;s review of the 8500 showed a performance improvement in their &quot;business applications suite&quot; from 10 minutes with the 8100/100, to 7:37 for the 8500/120. They also noted that the 8500 run an average of 24 to 44 percent faster than a similarly clocked Intel Pentium chip, with the performance nearly double on graphics and publishing tasks.

The 8500&#x27;s CPU was updated twice during its production run. It originally shipped with a 120 MHz PowerPC 604, later with the same chip running at 150 MHz, and finally with a PowerPC 604e running at 180 MHz. It was succeeded by the Power Macintosh 8600 in February 1997.

<text>Pottsville is a city and the county seat of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 13,346 at the 2020 census, and is the principal city of the Pottsville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies along the west bank of the Schuylkill River, south of Wilkes-Barre. It is located in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Coal Region.

Pottsville is located west of Allentown, northwest of Philadelphia, and west of New York City.

==History==
===18th century===

King Charles II granted the land that would eventually become Pottsville to William Penn. This grant comprised all lands west and south of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers; present-day Pottsville was originally in Chester County. When the legislative Council, on May 10, 1729, enacted the law erecting Lancaster County, which included all the lands of the Province lying westward of a straight line drawn northeasterly from the headwaters of Octoraro Creek (near the southern borders) marked with blazed trees, to the Schuylkill River, then this placed Pottsville in Lancaster County. By enactment of the same Council, approved on March 11, 1752, Berks County was erected; this placed Pottsville within the limits of that county.

Pottsville&#x27;s anthracite coal history began in 1790 when a coal seam was discovered by hunter Necho Allen. Legend has it that Allen fell asleep at the base of the Broad Mountain and woke to the sight of a large fire; his campfire had ignited an outcropping of coal. By 1795 an anthracite-fired finery forge was established on the Schuylkill River.

===19th century===

In 1806, John Pott, the founder of Pottsville, purchased the forge. By an act of Assembly of the Commonwealth approved March 1, 1811, the County of Schuylkill was erected out of portions of Berks and Northampton; this placed the site of Pottsville in Schuylkill County. The town was formally laid out in 1816 by a local surveyor, Henry Donnell. Pottsville was established as a village in Norwegian Township in 1819 and incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1828.

In 1829, D.G. Yuengling &amp; Son established what is now the oldest brewery in the United States. In 1851, Pottsville became the county seat of Schuylkill County, replacing the original county seat of Orwigsburg.

The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, which has its roots in the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company, the remnants of which were acquired in the late 20th century by the Reading Anthracite Company, acquired extensive coal lands and would become one of the most notable of the coal companies operating in Pennsylvania until the demise of the anthracite industry after World War II.

Because of its location along the Schuylkill River, Pottsville developed a small textile industry. Out of this industry grew the Phillips Van Heusen company which was founded in 1881. Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to the local coal miners. Van Heusen and other textile companies left the region starting in the late 1970s, mainly as a result of foreign competition. Another element of the textile industry was the Tilt Silk Mill on Twelfth Street, which produced silk from silk worms imported from China which fed on mulberry trees in the building&#x27;s solarium. The silk business eventually was eclipsed by the development of nylon stockings. The building still stands and is presently the headquarters of a storage and vehicle rental business.

===20th century===
During the Prohibition period in the United States, under the 18th Amendment, Yuengling all but stopped making beer and moved to production of near beer. The three brews produced in this time were the Yuengling Special, the company&#x27;s most popular brand, Yuengling Por-Tor (a version of their &quot;celebrated Pottsville Porter&quot;), and finally, the Yuengling Juvo, which was a cereal beverage. They were allowed a limited production of porter on the grounds that it had medicinal qualities. Then-owner Frank Yuengling also opened the Yuengling Dairy, which produced ice cream and other dairy products for the local area. These ventures helped to keep the company afloat during that period.

When the 18th Amendment was repealed, Yuengling stopped production of &quot;near beer&quot; and resumed making alcoholic beverages. The brewery famously sent a truckload of its Winner Beer to the White House in 1933 as thanks to President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the repeal of Prohibition. Yuengling still continues its family-owned business today and is the second largest American-owned brewery. The Yuengling Dairy was operated by a different branch of the family from the Brewery. Business declined and the dairy folded as of 1985. Attempted buyouts by large conglomerate breweries have all been unsuccessful.

Pottsville was chartered as a third-class city on March 22, 1911.

Pottsville was host to a National Football League franchise from 1925 to 1928. The Pottsville Maroons played in Sportsman&#x27;s Park (or Minersville Park) in nearby Minersville, now the site of King&#x27;s Village shopping plaza. The Maroons posted some of the best records in the NFL during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. The Maroons had a claim to the 1925 NFL championship, but because of a controversial decision by NFL President Joe Carr, the title was instead awarded to the Chicago Cardinals. The Maroons suffered two more losing seasons before relocating to Boston and becoming the Boston Bulldogs. The Bulldogs folded in 1929.

Until the middle of the 20th century, Pottsville was a popular destination for many traveling acts and vaudeville performers. The 1929 film &quot;Berth Marks&quot; stars the comedy legends Laurel and Hardy as they attempt to reach Pottsville by train for one of their booked performances. Pearl Bailey had once resided in Pottsville during the early part of her entertaining career. Soldiers in training at nearby Fort Indiantown Gap were prohibited from visiting Pottsville during most of World War II due to the large numbers of illicit venues and activities present during the time.

===21st century===
The city completed a streetscaping project in 2007 on Centre Street. In June 2011, the City of Pottsville became the county&#x27;s transportation hub for Schuylkill Transportation System (STS) bus service throughout the county with the $16.1 million Union Station Intermodal Transit Center at 300 South Centre Street. It also accommodates Trailways and Greyhound bus services.

The Pottsville Downtown Historic District, Cloud Home, John O&#x27;Hara House, Burd Patterson House, Pottsville Armory, D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewing Complex, and Frank D. Yuengling Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The area is also served by local television stations from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. They include WNEP-TV 16 (ABC), WYOU-TV 22 (CBS), WBRE-TV 28 (NBC), WVIA-TV 44 (PBS) and WOLF-TV 56 (FOX). Two radio stations broadcast from Pottsville: WAVT-FM 101.9-FM (Hot AC) and WPPA 1360-AM 105.9-FM (Talk &amp; Sports).

==Communications==
Dial telephone service came to Pottsville on August 30, 1956, with Mayor George Heffner making the first call on the new MArket 2 exchange, which still exists. Since then five exchanges have been added to serve the city.

==Transportation==

Pottsville is served by a small general aviation airport, Schuylkill County Airport (ZER).
Since 2011, Intercity public bus service has been provided at the Union Station Intermodal Transit Center at 300 South Centre Street. Mass transit for the greater Pottsville area is provided by Schuylkill Transportation System, which operates inter-city bus services throughout the county. The Union Station Intermodal Transit Center also accommodates Greyhound and Trailways. Two major highways converge on Pottsville, Pennsylvania Route 61 and U.S. Route 209.

Passenger train service between Pottsville, Reading, and Philadelphia was operated by Conrail under the auspices of SEPTA until July 29, 1981. The station site has since been demolished and replaced with a parking lot.

==Healthcare==

Lehigh Valley Hospital–Schuylkill is an affiliation between two community hospitals, formerly known as Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center and Pottsville Hospital and Warne Clinic, both of which are located in Pottsville. On August 1, 2008, Schuylkill Health became the new parent organization for both facilities and their related health systems. The medical center is designated a Level III Trauma center by the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation. On September 16, 2016, Schuylkill Health became part of Lehigh Valley Health Network.

<text>Rush Township is a township in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,423 at the 2020 census. The township is served by Tamaqua Area School District and Mahanoy Area School District.

==History==

The township was incorporated in 1811 and is named after Judge Jacob Rush, younger brother of Benjamin Rush, a signer of the declaration of independence. Judge Rush was the judge of the third judicial district of Northampton County which included the area which would become Rush township prior to Schuylkill County&#x27;s formation in 1811.

Rush township has been greatly reduced in size since 1811. Mahanoy Township split off in 1849, Ryan Township and East Union Township took sections of Rush in 1866. In 1873 Kline Township split off, and in 1882 Delano Township split off.

===19th century===
The township was largely settled by German families during its foundation, with the economic basis of the township being agriculture. The company &quot;Gross &amp; Wisimer&quot; built the township&#x27;s first three mills, two sawmills and a gristmill, in 1812. However, during the Civil War the township focused almost entirely on Gunpowder production with five gunpowder mills being constructed in the township during the war. These mills resulted in a series of fatal accidents as they were prone to exploding. There were four notable and fatal explosions in 1868, 1871, 1874, and 1879.

In 1854, the Catawissa and Little Schuylkill railroads where built through the township joined soon after by the Nesquehoning Valley Railroad Company building a spur connecting Mauch Chunk to Tamanend and rail interchanges at Haucks, Pennsylvania and Quakake. The rail industry came to dominate the local industry as millions of tons of Anthracite coal would pass through the township.

===20th century===
The declining use of coal to heat homes and generate electricity resulted in the closure of the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1921. The massive decline in the rail industry greatly hurt Rush township which is still recovering.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 23.9 square miles (61.8 km2), of which 22.9 square miles (59.2 km2) is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) (4.27%) is water. It is in the Delaware watershed and is drained by the Schuylkill River via the Little Schuylkill River and by the Nesquehoning Creek into the Lehigh River. Its villages include Barnesville, Ginthers, Grier City (also in Delano Township), Haucks, Hometown, Park Crest (also in Ryan Township), Quakake, Still Creek, and Tamanend (also in Delano Township).
