There is not a post office in Centerville, and thus no zip code; it simply uses that of Louisburg, which is located west. Centerville is centered on &quot;the crossroads&quot;, which is the intersection of NC-561 and NC-58 and the site of two small old-fashioned general stores.

Centerville has a church, (Centerville Baptist Church, a member of the Southern Baptist Convention), and volunteer fire department. There is not a police department, so Centerville, like the surrounding unincorporated area, is patrolled by the Franklin County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

Centerville includes many antique buildings from its heyday, including the now-defunct Serepta Church, a former Methodist church located at the intersection of NC-561 and Centerville-Laurel Mill Road.

Perry School and Vine Hill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Centerville was established &quot;circa&quot; 1882 and named for its central location between the towns of Louisburg, Warrenton and Littleton. It was incorporated in 1965, four years after the dissolution of the nearby town of Wood.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 89 people residing in what was then a town. The racial makeup of the town was 93% White (83 persons), 3.5% Black (3 persons), and 3.5% other (3 persons).

==Dissolution==
On February 22, 2017, a bill was filed in the North Carolina General Assembly seeking legislative approval for dissolution of the Town of Centerville. The Centerville Town Council voted unanimously in their January meeting to dissolve the town charter due to Centerville&#x27;s lack of growth and its financial inability to continue as a municipality. When the bill is passed, the town will have 30 days to pay off its bills and liquidate its assets. Under the legislation, any remaining money would be given to Centerville Fire Department. Senate Bill 122, regarding the dissolution of the Town of Centerville, was ratified by the North Carolina General Assembly on June 22, 2017. The town officially dissolved on July 22, 2017.

<doc id="127897" wikidata="Q1445323" url="?curid=127897" title="Franklinton, North Carolina">
<text>Franklinton is a town in Franklin County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,456 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Franklinton, was established as Franklin Depot in 1839 on land owned by Shemuel Kearney (1791–1860), son of Crawford Kearney and Nancy White. A home constructed by grandfather Shemuel Kearney (1734–1808) was originally located south of town and is currently the second oldest residence in Franklin County, built in 1759. The building was purchased in 2009 and moved to nearby Louisburg for restoration. Franklin Depot changed its name to Franklinton in 1842 when the town was incorporated. Like Franklin County, Franklinton was named for Benjamin Franklin.

Generous offers by local businessmen Washington Duke and Julian S. Carr brought Trinity College to the city of Durham in 1892. This well known school is now called Duke University. A source from the University Archives states that nearby Raleigh was actually the initial approved bidder. This does not mean Franklinton wasn&#x27;t included as a possible site, mentioned by some locals, even though no other bidding communities are mentioned. The citizens of Raleigh offered land now occupied by North Carolina State University and pledged $35,000.00 for a new building which was quickly approved by the Methodist Conference for Trinity College. It eventually lost to a higher bid of $85,000.00 plus donations in 1890.

In December 1919, an African-American veteran of World War I named Powell Green got involved in an altercation with a white man named R.M. Brown over smoking in the movie theater, and Green allegedly killed Brown. The police arrested Green, but then a lynch mob seized him, pulled him behind a car for two miles, and hung him from a tree.

Franklinton was once home to Albion Academy, a co-educational African-American school started by clergyman Moses A. Hopkins in 1879. Once a State Normal &amp; Industrial School (trade school), it eventually became a graded school and later merged with the B.F. Person School in 1957 to become B.F. Person-Albion High School. When schools were fully integrated, the upper grades consolidated with Franklinton High School in 1969. Mary Little was the first African-American teacher to begin teaching at the newly integrated Franklinton High School, who taught there till her death in 1984. The B.F. Person-Albion High School was renamed Franklinton Elementary School.

Also located in Franklinton is the historic Sterling Cotton Mill, founded by Samuel C. Vann and first opened in 1895. Remaining in the Vann family for many years, the mill was purchased in 1972 by Union Underwear Company, manufacturers of Fruit of the Loom fabric products. Sterling Cotton Mill eventually closed in 1991. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

Burlington Industries, another well known textile and fabric maker at the time, had a facility located in Franklinton known as Vamoco Mills. It closed in 1989, and was demolished in 2007. A third mill was also located in Franklinton which has since closed.

On June 10, 1946, former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson died in a car crash on U.S. Highway 1 in Franklinton.

On April 4, 1963, the entire town of Franklinton was threatened by a large wildfire which consumed roughly of woodlands and destroyed several homes north and west of town. A similar incident occurred on February 10, 2008, covering practically the same area (though not as widespread), about . There were a couple homes which were damaged during that event. U.S. Highway 1 was temporarily closed adjacent to the affected area while firefighters battled the fires. No injuries were reported. High winds and dry conditions were factors in both incidents.

In 1996 Franklinton, North Carolina became the home of Opio Holy Spirit Academy a private school providing an academic arena for both academically gifted and students who face academic challenges from grades k-12. The school was established and directed by Lenora E. Attles-Allen a former elementary school teacher from Boston, Massachusetts. Allen&#x27;s work became known and respected in Wake, Granville, Vance, and Franklin counties as well as her dedication to the Franklin County Community Restitution Program. Opio Holy Spirit Academy closed its doors for the last time after the final High School commencement ceremony in 2012.

Charles Draughn III was elected to the mayoral position of Franklinton for 8 years, from 1987 to 1995. He is currently working with family law. He was followed in office by Larry Kearney from 1995 to 2003, Jenny McGhee Edwards from 2003 to 2007 and Elic Senter from 2007 to 2015. Current Mayor Art Wright was elected in 2015.

Franklinton has been a Tree City USA community since 1985.

In addition to the Sterling Cotton Mill, the Franklinton Depot, Dr. J. H. Harris House, Shemuel Kearney House, C.L. and Bessie G. McGhee House, Person-McGhee Farm, Dr. J. A. Savage House, and Aldridge H. Vann House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. All properties are privately owned and should be respected.

The center of town is at Main Street (U.S. Highway 1A) and Mason Street. Green Street (N.C. Highway 56) passes just south of that point and U.S. Highway 1 bypasses Franklinton to the west. The town is located approximately northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina and south of the Tar River.

A railway operated by CSX Transportation currently passes through Franklinton, which is part of the old Seaboard Coast Line Railroad &quot;S-Line&quot;. There was also a spur off this line which ran east from Franklinton to Louisburg, originally built in 1884 by the Louisburg Railroad and leased to the Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad as a branch line. The two lines were taken over by Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1900. From 1985 to 1988, the Franklin County Railroad operated the branch line from Franklinton to Louisburg. The section was sold to the North Carolina Department of Transportation in 1990 and the tracks removed a few years later.

Settlement in the Belmont area began around the colonial-era Fort at the Point, built in the 1750s by Dutch settler James Kuykendall, Robert Leeper, and two others near the junction of the South Fork and the Catawba River. The fort was built because of ongoing hostilities with the Cherokee, but it was apparently never attacked.

The South Point Community, located about miles south of present-day downtown Belmont, was the site of Stowesville Mill. Founded by Jasper Stowe and Associates in 1853, it was one of the first three cotton mills in operation in Gaston County.

Abram Stowe (1842–1897) returned to the area after serving in the Civil War. He built a Greek Revival home (still the oldest known structure in Belmont) and opened a small mercantile store. He later became postmaster and town depot agent for the new Atlanta and Richmond Air-Line Railway, which was constructed in 1871. Additional stores were soon built near the community&#x27;s railroad stop, Garibaldi Station. The station was named for John Garibaldi, who had supervised construction of a water tank near the new railroad. Existing settlers in the South Point community moved north to be closer to the railroad.

In 1872, Father Jeremiah O&#x27;Connell, a Roman Catholic missionary priest, purchased a tract known as the Caldwell farm, less than one mile (1.6 km) north of Garibaldi Station. The land was then donated to the Benedictine monks of Saint Vincent&#x27;s Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for the establishment of a religious community and school. Belmont Abbey, officially named &quot;Mary Help of Christians Abbey&quot;, was founded in 1876 by Bishop Leo Haid, and still functions today. The abbey operates Belmont Abbey College, a liberal arts college.

In 1883, the name of Garibaldi Station was formally changed to Belmont. It was named for the New York banker August Belmont. In 1895, by an act of the North Carolina General Assembly, an area within a 1/4 mile radius from the intersection of Main Street and the railroad was incorporated as the Town of Belmont.

Belmont was still a small town at the turn of the century, with a population of only 145. The organization of Chronicle Mills in 1901 marked the beginning of Belmont&#x27;s development as a textile center. It was founded by Robert Lee Stowe Sr. (1866–1963), his brother Samuel Pinckney Stowe (1868–1956), and Abel Caleb Lineberger (1859–1948, son of Caleb John Lineberger, who had founded Gaston County&#x27;s first textile mill, the Woodlawn, or &quot;Pinhook&quot;, Mill in Lowell, North Carolina in 1848). Chronicle was the first of the nearly twenty mills built in Belmont through 1930, expanding the town population to 3,793.

==Geography==
Nestled in the southern Piedmont region of North Carolina, the town of Belmont is flanked by two rivers, the Catawba River and its right tributary, the South Fork Catawba River. Adjacent to Belmont, the rivers make up two arms of Lake Wylie and form a peninsula on which the city is situated.

Areas to the west of the center of town are part of the South Fork Catawba watershed. Eastern parts of Belmont north of the Norfolk Southern Railway belong to the Catawba Heights watershed, while those to the south are in the Paw Creek watershed. Areas of unincorporated South Point Township south of Belmont belong to the Neal Branch-Beaverdam Creek watershed.

Belmont is located west of Charlotte and east of Gastonia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.74%, is water.

The campus of Belmont Abbey College has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an Historic District since 1973. The Abbey Basilica of Mary Help of Christians is the central feature of the campus. Built in the German Gothic Revival architectural style, the basilica was the largest Catholic church in North Carolina at the time of its construction. The monks of Belmont Abbey did much of the construction work themselves. The original art glass windows of the Basilica were designed and executed by the Royal Bavarian Establishment of Francis Mayer and Company of Munich, Germany. They were painted then heat-fused, allowing for greater detail than was possible with stained glass. The windows were part of a display that won four gold medals at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1892. The Basilica held cathedral rank from 1910 to 1977. It was elevated to the rank of a Minor Basilica on July 27, 1998.

==Economy ==
The textile industry was once the core of Belmont&#x27;s economy, but due to most textile facilities moving overseas, Belmont&#x27;s motto &quot;The City of Diversified Textiles&quot; is no longer relevant. The large textile facilities that once employed thousands of local workers have been torn down or converted to other uses, including housing. Most of the &quot;mill houses&quot; where employees lived and raised their families for generations have been torn down to make room for new housing developments, and some areas have been converted to industrial centers containing various types of businesses. The few remaining plants still in operation run at reduced capacity and employ fewer workers.

Despite the loss of the textile plants, Belmont continues to grow in population. Its proximity to the large, fast-growing city of Charlotte has made Belmont an attractive place to live for new residents moving into the Charlotte area.

R.L. Stowe Mills, Inc. has its headquarters in Belmont and operates the Helms production facility. Gastonia-based Parkdale Mills currently operates two plants (Plants No. 15 and 61) and its Fiber Research Center in Belmont.

==Government==

Belmont, like the majority of cities in North Carolina, has a council-manager government, with a mayor and a five-member city council.

<text>Bessemer City is a small suburban city in Gaston County, North Carolina, United States. The population is 5,340 (as of the 2010 census). The city is approximately northwest of Gastonia and west of Charlotte. It was settled in 1756 and founded in 1893.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.78%, is water. The elevation at city hall is above sea level.

==History==

Bessemer City is named for Sir Henry Bessemer who created the Bessemer process for smelting iron. Bessemer City was founded on land purchased from the Ormand family, near the Sloan-Washington-Ormand Iron Furnace, but the Bessemer Process made Bessemer City&#x27;s early iron smelting industry obsolete.

The earliest European settlement in the Bessemer City area dates to 1754, when King George II of Great Britain granted about to James Ormand (1716–1771), who established the Ormand Mining Company to extract iron ore. By 1786, a furnace had been built on the land, called the Washington Furnace after the family of Colonel John C. Washington. The Old Ormand Furnace was used to process most of the iron ore that was mined in the area and today is one of the oldest remaining furnaces in the country. Despite a local tale that cannonballs were made during the Revolutionary War, there is no proof the furnace was built that early. The furnace was sold and later bought back by the family of Zenas Stanhope Ormand (b. July 12, 1802 - d. July 28, 1878). The furnace made iron implements and other products for local and statewide use and was in operation until the mid-19th century (when the Bessemer process made small furnace operations uneconomical). The &quot;Old Furnace&quot; is still owned by the Ormand Family Foundation, and the site is used as a gathering place for the Ormand, Ormond Family Reunion, one of the oldest family reunions in America, held annually since 1897.

During the late 1840s, corn and cotton were the region&#x27;s two main crops. Whiskey production was also profitable. Gaston County had more licensed whiskey distilleries than any county in North Carolina.

In 1871, the Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Division of the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad Company built through Gaston County. Laying the track through Whetstone Mountain, located west of modern-day Bessemer City, was considered a great engineering accomplishment. John Wooten built a general store next to the railroad on the site of present-day Bessemer City and called the store and depot &quot;Wooten&#x27;s Station&quot;.

In 1891, John Askew Smith, previously of Reidsville, North Carolina, moved with his wife Fannie and brother-in-law, John A. Pinchback, to Gaston County. Smith purchased and wanted to establish a town to the east of Whetstone Mountain. By 1893, Smith and other residents petitioned the North Carolina legislature to incorporate the town. On March 6, 1893, Bessemer City was officially chartered. Smith hired W.R. Richardson, an engineer from Guilford County, to lay out the town. In 1896 Smith built the first luxurious home in the area he named &quot;Long View&quot; where he lived with his wife for nearly 20 years. This house still stands in pristine condition, and the Mitchell family has taken up its stewardship. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Highacre&quot; house, built in the early 20th century, is now occupied by the Eury family.

The population of Bessemer City at the time of its charter was very small, with only a few families, but by 1900 it had grown to between 500 and 600 people. In 1895, Stonewall Jackson Durham and John M. Odell incorporated Southern Cotton Mills and as their first venture completed and opened the failed Smith/Pinchback Mill. A series of textile mills opened by Smith and Pinchback; Durham and Odell; Frank, Robert and Max Goldberg; as well as the Ragan Spinning Company, gave Bessemer City its industrial foundation.

In 1929 Textile mill striker and songwriter Ella Mae Wiggins, 29, the mother of nine, is killed when local vigilantes, thugs and a sheriff&#x27;s deputy force the pickup truck in which she is riding off the road and begin shooting.

A native of Sevierville, Tennessee, Wiggins by 1926 settled in Gaston County, N.C., living in an African-American neighborhood outside Bessemer City known as Stumptown. Her neighbors would look after her children as she worked as a spinner at American Mill No. 2. According to an article published online by the North Carolina Museum of History, &quot;she worked twelve-hour days, six days a week, earning about nine dollars a week.&quot;She became a bookkeeper for the union, which was Communist run, and traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about labor practices in the South. She also told her story: &quot;I’m the mother of nine. Four died with the whooping cough, all at once. I was working nights, I asked the super to put me on days, so’s I could tend ‘em when they had their bad spells. But he wouldn&#x27;t. I don’t know why. ... So I had to quit, and then there wasn&#x27;t no money for medicine, and they just died.&quot; She also sang her ballads, including her best-known song, &quot;A Mill Mother’s Lament,&quot; which has been recorded by Pete Seeger, among others. Wiggins believed in organizing African-Americans along with whites, and in a close vote, her local NTWU branch voted to admit African-Americans to the union.

On September 14, 1929, she and other union members drove to a union meeting in Gastonia. They were met by an armed mob, and turned back. They had driven about five miles toward home when they were stopped by a car; armed men jumped out and began shooting. Wiggins was shot in the chest and killed. Her five children were sent to live in orphanages. Five Loray Mill employees were charged in Wiggins&#x27;s murder but were acquitted after less than 30 minutes of deliberation in a trial in Charlotte in March 1930 despite the fact that the crime was committed in daylight and more than 50 people witnessed it. She was buried in the Bessemer City Cemetery on North 12th St. Hers is one of the biggest markers there, after being expanded by the AFL–CIO in 1979 to include a marker inscribed, &quot;She died carrying the torch of social justice.&quot;

An historic Supreme Court case on sexism originated in Bessemer City in 1985. Anderson v. Bessemer City was a case involving a woman who sued the city after applying for a position and then not being chosen based solely on the fact that she was a woman. The Supreme Court found that discrimination was present in the decision. The factors that Phyllis Anderson showed the court to demonstrate that the hiring committee was sexists were 1) Ms. Anderson was better qualified, 2) Testimony from one of the committee members that he thought the position would be &quot;real hard&quot; for a woman and that he wouldn&#x27;t want his wife to perform such duties, 3) Ms. Anderson alone among the applicants was asked whether she realized that the job would involve night work and travel and whether her husband approved of her applying for the job, and 4) The reasons offered by the all-male hiring committee as to why they hired a less qualified man were pretextual.

The Bessemer City Downtown Historic District and Central School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Cherryville (/ˈtʃɜr.vəl/) (Chur-a-vull) is a city in northwestern Gaston County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 5,760 at the 2010 census. The New Year&#x27;s Shooters celebrate the area&#x27;s German heritage by beginning each year with a customary chant and the honorary shooting of muskets. Cherryville is located approximately west of Charlotte and northwest of Gastonia.

==Geography==
Cherryville is located in Cherryville Township at an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.21%, is water. The small Cherryville City Reservoir is located just southeast of the city limits.

Cherryville is located along a divide among three watersheds. The western end of Cherryville is in the watershed of Muddy Creek, a right tributary of Buffalo Creek and part of the Broad River catchment basin. The north side of Cherryville is in the Indian Creek watershed, drained by Lick Fork Creek and an unnamed tributary of Indian Creek. The south side of Cherryville Township is in the Beaverdam Creek watershed, drained by unnamed right-hand tributaries of Beaverdam Creek. Indian Creek and Beaverdam Creek are tributaries of the South Fork Catawba River.

==History==
During the last half of the 18th century, German, Dutch, and Scots-Irish families from the Colony of Pennsylvania migrated south and settled in the Cherryville area. Land grants made by King George III of Great Britain date back to 1768, and as early as 1792 Governor Samuel Ashe of North Carolina made grants in and around &quot;White Pine&quot;, as the settlement was known at the time. A village began to develop at a crossroads of the Morganton-to-Charleston road, closely followed by modern Highway 274 / Mountain Street, and the Old Post Road, a main thoroughfare between Salisbury, North Carolina, and Spartanburg, South Carolina.

In 1862, the Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad (later known as the Carolina Central Railroad) reached White Pine. Construction of the railroad westward from Cherryville was interrupted by the Civil War, so that throughout the war Cherryville was a western terminus of the railroads in North Carolina. When construction resumed and the railroad extended beyond Cherryville, the town served as a water and coal stop. Along the railroad, a local resident planted cherry trees, and the train engineers soon began calling the settlement &quot;Cherryville&quot;. The town was incorporated under this name in 1881.

Agriculture was Cherryville&#x27;s main economic base for many years. However, during the late 19th century, the textile industry became established in the town. Cherryville&#x27;s first cotton mill, the Cherryville Manufacturing Plant, was incorporated in 1891. It was soon followed by the opening of three other mills. By the start of the 20th century, the rural village had become an industrial community of a thousand people. Eventually, 13 mills would be opened in Cherryville, including Gaston Manufacturing Company (later operated as Dora Yarn Mills), Vivian Manufacturing Company (&quot;Old Sardine&quot;, later operated as Nuway Spinning Company), Melville Manufacturing Company (later Burlington Industries&#x27; Pinnacle Plant), Howell Manufacturing Company, Rhyne Houser Manufacturing Company (later part of Burlington Industries&#x27; Madision Division), and Carlton Yarn Mills, Inc. All of these plants have since closed.

In 1932, a trucking company began operating in Cherryville with one truck hauling produce from Florida to Cherryville. This company would become one of the largest freight carriers in the nation, known as Carolina Freight Carriers Corporation. After operating for more than sixty years, Carolina Freight was bought by the Arkansas Best Trucking Company in October 1995, and operations moved from Cherryville.

On July 13, 1966, Trains #45 &amp; #46 of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, hit head-on on the southeast side of the city, killing one and injuring three. GP-9&#x27;s 1911–1927–1963–1971–1979 and F-3, 4027 of SAL, were destroyed and scrapped on site. J. W. Pait of Hamlet, North Carolina, was killed in the wreck.

The Beam&#x27;s Shell Service Station and Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

<doc id="127903" wikidata="Q1138788" url="?curid=127903" title="Cramerton, North Carolina">
<text>Cramerton is a small town in Gaston County, North Carolina, United States. It is a suburb of Charlotte and located east of Gastonia. The population was 4,165 at the 2010 census. A well-known feature is the Cramer Mountain gated development, featuring homes around an 18-hole golf course at Cramer Mountain Country Club.

==Geography==
Cramerton is located at an elevation of . Two topographic high points, Berry Mountain, elevation , and Cramer Mountain, approximate elevation , are located in the southwestern part of town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.51%, is water.

Cramerton is bisected by the South Fork Catawba River, which makes a sharp S-curve around the center of town. Just southwest of downtown, Duharts Creek flows into the South Fork Catawba. Duharts Creek is formed by the confluence of Armstrong Branch and New Hope Branch on the western edge of town.

Cramerton town limits include a portion of zip code 28012 that encompass the neighborhood of Lakewood and Stuart W. Cramer High School on the eastern shore of the South Fork River.

The town is located seven miles east of Gastonia and 16 miles west of Charlotte.

==History==
Originally named Mayesworth, the town was founded in 1906 when J.H. Mayes built a spinning mill along the banks of the South Fork of the Catawba River, just east of Gastonia. In 1910, textile engineer and Thomasville native Stuart Warren Cramer became owner and president of the mill and property. He turned the mill and the surrounding community into a model mill village. In 1921, Cramer changed the name of the town to Cramerton, and the name of the mill to Cramerton Mills in 1922. In 1923, Cramer built the Mayflower Weave Mill.

Cramer is credited with designing and equipping &quot;about one-third of the new cotton mills in the South&quot; between 1895 and 1915, and simultaneously acquiring extensive holdings in textile mills. Among Cramer&#x27;s numerous industrial engineering patents was one for the &quot;Cramer System of Air Conditioning&quot;, which included the automatic regulation of temperature and humidity. These early innovations in air conditioning resulted more from the need to remove lint from the air (a persistent problem in the textile mills) than to cool the factory atmosphere. The term &quot;air conditioning&quot; is attributed to Cramer.

In 1946 the mills and homes were sold to Burlington Industries, who in turn sold the homes to residents. The Town of Cramerton incorporated in 1967 and began providing municipal services.

In 1997, a luxury home on Cramer Mountain was briefly the residence Steven Eugene Chambers, a participant in the October 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery. The Mayworth School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

==Government==
Cramerton operates under the council-manager form of government with a mayor and a five-member town board and a town manager. In 2011, after 50 years of service, the town ended its contract with the Cramerton Volunteer Fire Department. The town then worked to create a new town-managed department that provides fire protection for Cramerton as well as neighboring McAdenville. The new Town of Cramerton Fire Department has been in place since 2012.

Cramerton operates its own police department. Based on a contract signed in 2006 by both the McAdenville and Cramerton town councils, officers of the Cramerton Police Department also handle patrol duties within the McAdenville town limits between the hours of 6 PM and 6 AM daily. Cramerton police also assist McAdenville officers with felony criminal investigations.

Cramerton is in South Point Township.

==Business and industry==
The textile industry has long been central to Cramerton&#x27;s economy, but globalization has caused many of the local plants to close and devastated the local economy. Burlington Industries, which had operated the former Cramerton Mills, went bankrupt in 2001. Employers like Eagle Mountain Finishers and Lakewood Dyed Yarns (both subsidiaries of Joan Fabrics Corp.) were closed in 2006 and 2007. Textile companies Brookline Inc. and Wagner Knitting, Inc., have also been affected by the economic downturn. Syncot Fibers and Plastics, Inc., operates a facility in Cramerton specializing in the recycling of nylon.

In the twenty-first century, like many nearby communities affected by the exit of many businesses in the textile industry, the town has seen some significant growth and revitalization in the years following the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. As a suburb of the greater Gaston and Charlotte area, the town is within commuting distance for workers of businesses within other industries, such as financial and banking services, technology, travel and tourism, and retail.

Within Cramerton, especially in the Downtown district, there are a number of companies operating within the restaurant, coffee shop, retail, and recreational-related industries. The downtown area includes Cramerton&#x27;s Centennial Park (which includes the Veteran&#x27;s Memorial) and Goat Island Park (which is accessible by two foot bridges); these attractions are intended to bring visitors to the area that support the local businesses.

The Gaston Business Association and Montcross Area Chamber of Commerce are the major commerce associations of businesses representing Cramerton and other communities.

The Cramer Mountain golf course was designed by renown golfing course architect Dan Maples, a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.

Since the town is situated along the South Fork Catawba River, it also has an active recreational culture of waterspouts, such as kayaking and canoeing. The Goat Island Park in Cramerton also features an 18-hole Disc Golf course.

The town government has renovated the courthouse.

Dallas began to decline in importance when the town commissioners refused to appropriate money for construction of bridges over several creeks for the Atlanta and Richmond Air-Line Railway in the 1872. The commissioners said the reason was because residents thought that trains would wake them during the night and frighten their livestock. In 1890, White Caps attacked the town &quot;&#x27;Kuklux&#x27; style&quot;, destroying entire portions of the town. After this the county seat was relocated to Gastonia in 1911.

<text>Gastonia is the most populous city in and the county seat of Gaston County, North Carolina, United States. It is the second-largest satellite city of the Charlotte area, behind Concord. The population was 80,411 in the 2020 census, up from 71,741 in 2010. Gastonia is the 13th-most populous city in North Carolina. It is part of the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the Charlotte-Concord, NC-SC Combined Statistical Area.

The city is a historic center for textile manufacturing and was the site of the Loray Mill Strike of 1929, which became a key event in the labor movement. While manufacturing remains important to the local economy, the city also has well-developed healthcare, education, and government sectors.

==History==
Gastonia is named for William Gaston, a jurist and United States Representative from North Carolina.
The Loray Mill strike occurred in Gastonia in 1929. The role of organizers for Communist Party-affiliated National Textile Workers Union (NTWU) alienated religious leaders in Gastonia, who denounced the organizers&#x27; ideology, undermining support for the strike. The strike collapsed after the death of Gastonia&#x27;s police chief, Orville Alderholt, led to a murder trial of several militants including NTWU chief organizer Fred Beal. Beal was convicted in the killing but fled to the Soviet Union. The strike largely failed in attaining its goals of better working conditions and wages, and the American labor movement was never able to gain a foothold among textile workers in Gastonia. The strike, however, became for a while an international cause célèbre, figuring in several novels published in the 1930s.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The City Hospital-Gaston Memorial Hospital, Craig Farmstead, Downtown Gastonia Historic District, First National Bank Building, Gaston County Courthouse, Gastonia High School, David Jenkins House, Loray Mill Historic District, Robinson-Gardner Building, Third National Bank Building, and William J.

During the War of 1812, his High Shoals ironworks produced cannonballs for use by the United States Army. Fulenwider died in 1826 and is buried at High Shoals cemetery. The ironworks he developed remained in operation until 1875.

In the last decade of the 19th century, the community of High Shoals became totally owned by High Shoals Mills, a textile company founded by Charlotte industrialist Daniel A. Tompkins.

<text>Mount Holly is a small suburban city in northeastern Gaston County, North Carolina, United States. The city is situated just west of the Catawba River, north of Interstate 85, south of North Carolina State Highway 16. The population was 17,703 at the 2020 census, up from 13,656 in 2010.

==Geography==

==History==

Land grants were first issued in the Mount Holly area by King George II of Great Britain around 1750. In 1754, a land grant was issued to James Kuykendall of Holland in the locale known as Dutchman&#x27;s Creek. Later in 1838, a post office in the area was named Woodlawn. In 1875, the name of the town was changed to Mount Holly, after the Mount Holly Cotton Mill that was started that year. The name &quot;Mount Holly&quot; was used in recognition of the famed yarn made at a spinning mill in Mount Holly, New Jersey.

A.P. and D.E. Rhyne and Ambrose Costner originally owned the Mount Holly Cotton Mill. It was the fourth mill to be built in Gaston County and is the oldest surviving mill today. The mill&#x27;s success and the prosperity of the area as a whole led local residents to petition the North Carolina General Assembly for incorporation of Mount Holly in 1879.

The first railroad in Gaston County, the Carolina Central Railway, began serving Mount Holly in 1860. The line, which runs parallel with North Carolina State Highway 27, is still in service and operated by CSX. In 1911, construction began on the area&#x27;s second railroad, the Piedmont and Northern Railway. On May 20, 1912, it made its first run from Charlotte to Gastonia.

Electricity became available to homes and businesses around the turn of the twentieth century. The Woodlawn Mill, located on Woodlawn Avenue, was built in 1906 and was the first mill in Gaston County to be served with electricity.

The Downtown Mount Holly Historic District and Mount Holly Cotton Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The city&#x27;s largest textile firm is American &amp; Efird, Inc. (A&amp;E), the world&#x27;s second-largest thread maker. The firm was created with a 1952 merger of American Yarn and Processing Company (located in Mount Holly) and the Efird Manufacturing Company (located in Albemarle, North Carolina). American Yarn had its start in 1891 when Charles Egbert Hutchison founded the Nims Manufacturing Company on Dutchman&#x27;s Creek. With six plants and their corporate offices in Mount Holly, A&amp;E employs more than 980 people and maintains a strong presence in the community.

<text>Ranlo is a small town in Gaston County, North Carolina, United States and a suburb of Charlotte, located north of Gastonia. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 4,511, up from 3,434 in 2010.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has 2.06 sq. mi of land and 0.002 sq. mi of water.

==History==
Ranlo was named for John Calvin Rankin and William Thomas Love, two prominent area industrialists - &quot;Ranlo&quot; was a contraction of RANkin and LOve. The community grew up around their textile mills, which produced cotton goods. Rex Spinning Company was begun in 1915, Ranlo Manufacturing Company in 1916, and Priscilla Spinning Company in 1921. Nearby, the community of Smyre was developed around the A. M. Smyre Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1917. In 1963, Ranlo and Smyre were incorporated as the Town of Ranlo, in reaction to the concern over possible annexation into Gastonia. However, the part of the Smyre mill village south of the Norfolk Southern Railway was not included, and was eventually annexed by Gastonia in June 1996.

Row houses were erected in the 1920s and 1930s and still stand today. At the time, they were owned by the mill and rented at very low rates to workers. They have long since been sold to individuals, and the mills are 75-80% closed. Only one or two still operate and they are at low capacity. The town, however, has become a &quot;bedroom community&quot; and prides itself on its facilities and growth. New industry has started to move in and new neighborhoods are being built.

<text>Lake Santeetlah is a town in Graham County, North Carolina, United States, northwest of Robbinsville on a peninsula surrounded by Lake Santeetlah—which in turn is largely surrounded by Nantahala National Forest. The town has more than two hundred residences, many of them second homes owned by permanent residents of Florida and Georgia. The town was organized in 1989 as &quot;Santeetlah&quot;; in 1999, it changed its name to &quot;Lake Santeetlah&quot;. The full-time population was 67 at the 2000 census and dropped to 45 in 2010.

==Geography==
The town of Lake Santeetlah is located in central Graham County on a peninsula on the northern side of Lake Santeetlah, a reservoir on the Cheoah River, a northward-flowing tributary of the Little Tennessee River. U.S. Route 129 passes just north of the town, leading southeast to Robbinsville, the county seat, and northwest to Tapoco at the Little Tennessee River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Lake Santeetlah has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Because of its mountainous terrain, Graham County was one of the last sections of the eastern United States to be settled by Europeans. Robbinsville was not incorporated until 1893, and it had only 200 residents in 1915. The area known as &quot;Santeetlah&quot; along the Cheoah River was sparsely settled, and in any case, the river valley was flooded after Santeetlah Dam was completed in 1928. In 1939, the U.S. Forest Service purchased from Carolina Aluminum Company the land now occupied by the town of Lake Santeetlah.

The father of Lake Santeetlah was Kenneth S. Keyes, Sr. (1896–1995), a native of Detroit, who became an extremely successful real estate dealer in Miami, heading over fifty corporations that operated hotels, office buildings and other realty enterprises in Florida, New York, and Canada. In 1957 he served as president of the National Association of Realtors. Keyes, an evangelical Christian, was also finance chairman of the National Association of Evangelicals and a founder of the Presbyterian Church in America.

In 1947, Keyes exchanged with the Forest Service some land he held for the area that is now the town of Lake Santeetlah. For undetermined reasons he called the property &quot;Thunderbird Estates&quot;. Apparently Keyes hoped to build a large hotel complex in the area of the community now known as Chalet Village, and that area was graded in preparation for building. Nevertheless, although he hired a Miami architectural firm to draw the plans, Keyes never built, and in 1958, he sold the undeveloped property to another Florida land developer, who transferred it again in 1961.

In the early 1960s, a new corporation, Smoky Mountain Resorts, built a lodge and some cabins, and the first landowners began to build on the north shore of the peninsula. The lodge, with its two faux totem poles, became &quot;the heartbeat of Thunderbird Mountain Resort&quot; with activities that included square dancing, bingo, movies, and church services, as well as a place &quot;to gather together when the mail was delivered.&quot; Although roads were graded and paved and a water system installed, &quot;Thunderbird Mountain Club Resort&quot;, as the development was first called, was &quot;always short of capital.&quot; In 1971, Smoky Mountain Resorts sold its interest to W. Bennett Collette, &quot;a dabbler in buying financially distressed properties.&quot;

Collette transferred the properties around among his various companies, and by 1973, he had clearly communicated to the residents that he was not interested in operating the water system. The Thunderbird Homeowners Association—later, Thunderbird Property Owners Association—which had been formed in 1969 and incorporated in 1971, began to investigate the possibility of taking over the water system itself, not without disharmony among the members. In 1979, the Insurance Commissioner of Indiana confiscated the assets of Collette&#x27;s now-defunct Pilgrim Life Insurance Company, and the State of Indiana briefly owned Thunderbird Mountain before selling it to Executive National Life Insurance in 1981.

Relations between Executive National Life Insurance and the Thunderbird property owners &quot;were at best rocky.&quot; The insurance company did not repair the water system or provide other services specified by the restrictive covenants, and many property owners stopped paying their fees. The water system grew so unreliable that some property owners dug their own wells. A lawsuit by the insurance company was dismissed by the court, and the company became more amenable to the formation of an incorporated town.

On April 13, 1989, Thunderbird Mountain became the Town of Santeetlah, and in 1991, Executive National transferred the roads and the water system to the town. Through state grants and assessments on the properties (including those of the insurance company), a new water system was created and the roads were repaved. The same year a volunteer fire department and community center were constructed. Ten years later, in 1998, a town hall was dedicated on the Fourth of July.

In 1979, the State of North Carolina had prohibited any new connections to the antiquated water system. Although property sales and home construction did not completely cease—a builder could drill his own well—the completion of the new water system in 1995 occurred simultaneously with a new round of construction. Homes built in the 1990s and first decade of the new century tended to be much grander than the simple cottages of the 1960s. Before being demolished, the lodge, which had operated only sporadically during the preceding decades, was recycled into the sales office of an upscale lake-front development called &quot;Santeetlah Lakeside&quot;; and million-dollar property transfers occurred for the first time.

<text>Robbinsville is a town in Graham County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 597 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Graham County, county population 8,030.

==History==
A trading post was established near present-day Robbinsville in the early 1840s and the town’s post office opened in 1843. The post office originally served Cheoah Valley, then Fort Montgomery in 1849. Robbinsville was incorporated on June 9, 1874. The town is believed to be named for N.C. state senator James L. Robinson. The town water system was installed in 1925.

The Graham County Courthouse was constructed in Robbinsville in 1874 but its floor collapsed two decades later while the building was packed during a murder trial. A replacement built in 1895 was the last wooden courthouse built in North Carolina. The third and current building was completed in 1942.

Graham County&#x27;s first public library opened in Robbinsville in 1939. The library joined the Nantahala Regional Library system in 1940. The building was demolished in 1952 and replaced with a newer facility which opened April 6, 1953.

Bemis Lumber Company and American Uniform previously had facilities in Robbinsville. James Lees Carpet Company operated in Robbinsville between 1957 and August 1971, employing about 400 people. The facility later became a Stanley Furniture plant and the town&#x27;s largest industry and employer. That plant closed in mid-2014, laying off 400 workers.

<text>Butner is a town in Granville County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 8,397 as of the 2020 census. Butner was managed by the state of North Carolina from 1947 through 2007.

==History==
The area eventually comprising the town of Butner was originally land along the Occaneechi Path, a Native American trade route. Following the arrival of European settlers, it became a rural community populated by farmers. In August 1941, the U.S. federal government beginning planning for the development of a military facility in the area, motivated partly by its proximity to a rail line. Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War II that December, planning hastened and in January 1942 the government began ordered locals to vacate their land. The government ultimately evicted between 400 to 500 families and razed most of their homes and agricultural buildings to make way for a U.S. Army camp. Construction commenced in March and Camp Butner officially opened in August 1942. It was named for Major General Henry W. Butner (1875–1937), a North Carolina native. Thousands of soldiers were trained at the camp for service overseas. By April 1946, activity at the facility had declined significantly and it was officially closed in January 1947.

Following the camp&#x27;s closure, its land was divided up among the U.S. War Assets Administration, the North Carolina National Guard, the state of North Carolina, and the dispossessed farmers who had once lived in the area. The state converted its former infirmary into a psychiatry hospital. A civilian community subsequently developed around the hospital&#x27;s new workforce. Some former camp facilities were retained by the residents for their own use such as its recreation center and churches, others were repurposed as homes, and some were demolished so their materials could be used in new construction. The state government assumed responsibility for governance in the town and provided police and firefighting services.

In 2003, a seven-member elective Butner Advisory Council was created to advise the North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services on governance of the town. Following legislation passed by the North Carolina General Assembly, Butner became an incorporated community effective November 1, 2007 and the advisory council was turned into a town council. The town assumed responsibility for local police and firefighting services from the state in 2013.

<text>Creedmoor is a city in Granville County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 4,124 at the 2010 census.

==History==

In 1885, a group of 25 taxpayers of Granville County, including Civil War Confederate veteran Robert Fleming, appeared before the Board of Commissioners for the County of Granville with a petition from the Dutchville Township. The petition made a proposition to subscribe ten thousand dollars to the capital stock of the Oxford and Clarksville Railroad Company. Under the provisions of the act of the General Assembly of North Carolina which was entitled &quot;An Act to Incorporate&quot;, the Oxford and Clarksville Railroad Company was notified on 28 February 1885. The proposal was thereby approved under the provisions of the General Assembly of North Carolina. As a result, it was ordered that the election of subscribing the said sum of ten thousand dollars to the capital stock of the said railroad company be submitted to the qualified voters of the Dutchville Township and that an election be held in the said township at the proper voting place therein on 8 October 1887.
Over the next few years, Creedmoor served as a railroad depot between the Clarksville and Oxford Railroad and the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad. In 1886, Thomas B. Lyon applied to the Postal Department for a post office to be located in Creedmoor. Lyon&#x27;s request was granted on 10 April 1886. John Harmon was appointed as the first postmaster. In September of that same year, Samuel C. Lyon, son of Thomas B. Lyon, was appointed postmaster.

In 1888 Lyon sold part of his land to the Durham and Northern Railroad for track to run through the town. Linking Creedmoor to Henderson and Durham was a major cause of growth of this town. The old Seaboard train depot building still stands at its location on Elm Street, making it over 120 years old. Also previously located on Elm Street was the original First Baptist Church of Creedmoor, built in 1895. The present church building from 1950 stands on Main Street. Lyon&#x27;s body is entombed on the grounds of the original cemetery for the church, whereas Robert Fleming&#x27;s body is entombed in a small family plot on Fleming Street, a road named for the founder, adjacent to Elm Street.

Creedmoor was incorporated in 1905, having previously been known as &quot;Creedmore&quot;. The first mayor was Joseph L. Peed (1859–1936). The street Joe Peed Road located on southbound US-15 leaving the city is named in his honor. The first Commissioners were J.F. Sanderford, Isaac Bullock, S.C. Lyon, and Claude Garner. In 1917, electricity came to Creedmoor when G. H. Dove and F. J. McDuffy flipped a switch in their plant on Railroad Street.

Although the town is rich with history (home to four buildings on the National Register of Historic Places), it does not hold the title of a Historic District unlike nearby Oxford and Wake Forest.

===Impact of tobacco===
Tobacco was extremely important in the early history of the town. Four tobacco warehouses were built in the town in the early 1900s. Tobacco was a cash crop in Creedmoor, and was shipped by railroad to nearby Oxford&#x27;s Tobacco Research Facility and Durham&#x27;s thriving smoking tobacco industry, with firms including W. T. Blackwell and Company, American Tobacco Company, and Liggett &amp; Myers. At one time Creedmoor was a larger tobacco market than Durham. Area farmers did not limit themselves to tobacco only, but also grew cotton, a profitable crop.

===The mule trade===
In the wake of the tobacco era, mules came to Creedmoor. About forty train car loads of mules were pulled into the town each year. Mules were the ideal farm animals because their hooves were smaller than those of a horse. Their smaller feet helped them pass through rows of tobacco without stepping on the crop. In 1906, Jim Netherly and a Mr. Cooper founded the Creedmoor Supply Company, which sold feed, mules, horses, buggies, and even some groceries and seeds to meet the demands of local farmers. G.M. Chappell opened a barn that auctioned mules, horses, and cows from 1938 to 1962. At one point in time, Creedmoor was considered to be the largest mule trading center in the world and was widely referred to as &quot;Mule Town&quot;. By 1940, over $500,000 were traded and spent on mules each year. It was not until the mid-1950s that the town removed the slogan &quot;One of the Largest Retail Livestock Markets in North Carolina&quot; from the official letterhead. By then, the mule trade was no longer a major part of the local economy.

==Historic places==
Creedmoor is home to four buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: 
*Cannady-Brogden Farm south of Creedmoor in Wake County
*James Mangum House
*First National Bank Building
*Obediah Winston Farm

==Education==

Creedmoor High School opened in 1909 at the intersection of Main Street and Highway 56. Joel Anderson Pitts (1877–1958), a graduate of Duke University – then called Trinity College – was the first principal. This school served grades one through twelve until 1963, when white students went to South Granville High School. On January 9, 1970, Creedmoor School, at that time serving grades one through eight, burned down. Behind the former Creedmoor High School gym lies B.C. Roberts Ballfield, named after Battle Caviness Roberts who coached for the South Granville Athletic Association well into his years before his death in 1982.

Creedmoor is also the home of South Granville High School, G.C. Hawley Middle, and Creedmoor Elementary. The Hawley School, dedicated in 1937 for educationalist Rev. Grover Cleveland Hawley, originally educated the local black students. The opening of the school was bolstered by the support of Dr. R.G. Rogers, Creedmoor town physician and dentist who was a member of the Granville County Board of Education at that time. His support was instrumental on the board. The doors to Hawley School first opened for all local black students in September 1952 after many years of tireless and dedicated work spearheaded by Reverend Hawley. The new facility housed grades seven through twelve. In 1975, Hawley became a middle school serving grades five through eight from the Butner, Stem, and Creedmoor areas and eighth graders from Wilton. In September 1986, seventh graders from Wilton Elementary were moved to Hawley, and in 1987 sixth graders from Wilton also began to attend Hawley. At the present time, Hawley Middle School teaches grades six through eight from the Creedmoor and Wilton area. Students from Butner and Stem now attend Butner-Stem Middle School.

== Other notable places ==
* The Dr. Joseph Thompson house at 213 S. Main Street belonged to the town&#x27;s first medical doctor and had an office in his home to the right of the building on the main floor. There is a porte-cochère that extends off that side as well. The home is an early Craftsman period structure with a wrap-around porch. It was built in 1910 on land purchased from the Lyon family. Dr. Thompson was a native of Leasburg in Caswell County. He attended the University of North Carolina as an undergraduate before going to the University of Louisville School of Medicine for his medical degree. He moved to Creedmoor about 1908. He married Mayme Lunsford in 1910 and moved her to their home on Main Street (at that time, a four-room, one-story cottage). He practiced medicine in northern Wake and southern Granville County until 1957 and died at home in August 1958.
* The Cedar Creek Gallery was built in 1968 on what used to be an old tobacco field in the community of Northside. The gallery has grown from one building to over ten.

<text>Oxford is a town in Granville County, North Carolina, United States, with a population of 8,628 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Granville County.

==History==
The town&#x27;s history dates to 1761, when local legislator Samuel Benton built a plantation home and called it &quot;Oxford.&quot; The legislature ordered the area around his plantation to be the seat of Granville County. The town was not incorporated until 1816.

The first Masonic orphanage for children in the United States was built in Oxford. It was originally established as St. John&#x27;s College in 1858. The college ceased operations shortly after opening, however. In 1872 the community decided that the property should be repurposed to educate disadvantaged populations. In December 1873 the first residents were admitted to the Oxford Orphans Asylum, which is today known as the &quot;Masonic Home for Children at Oxford.&quot;

In 1851 James H. Horner established Horner Military School, which enrolled many young men from New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina and other states. Many of the students went on to become leaders in the United States government, such as James Crawford Biggs, Solicitor General under President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the inception of the New Deal. After the barracks were destroyed by a fire in 1913, the school relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Oxford Female College was established in 1850 by North Carolina Baptists. After suffering financial difficulties, the college was sold and became a private educational institution renamed &quot;Oxford Female Seminary.&quot; In 1880 F. P. Hobgood took over leadership of the school, and it gained popularity under his leadership. The school closed in 1925, following Hobgood&#x27;s death the previous year.
In 1883 the state legislature established the Colored Orphan Asylum in Oxford. Henry Plummer Cheatham, a former U.S. congressman (1889-1893), was appointed as superintendent in the early 1900s and led the institution for 28 years.

In 1970, Henry Marrow was shot and killed in Oxford. The killing resulted in a racial protest. The events were chronicled by Timothy Tyson in the book &quot;Blood Done Sign My Name&quot; (2004) and a 2010 movie with the same name.

A Confederate statue was erected in 1909 by the Granville Grays United Daughters of the Confederacy at a cost of $3000.00 and valued in 2009 at $1,327,791.62. The monument was erected in the courthouse square facing away from the courthouse. The base, constructed of granite from Warren County, is tall, and the bronze statue is tall. The monument, a memorial to the Confederate veterans of Granville County that served in the Civil War in the Granville Grays Company D, 12th Regiment, was dedicated October 30, 1909. The statue had not arrived in time but the ceremony continued and the statue was placed at a later date.

Following the 1970 Oxford protests, the city moved the monument from the courthouse square to a site in front of the Richard H. Thornton Library. Since 2009, some activists had suggested moving it to an historic graveyard located down the street. In June 2020 the statue was removed and is currently in storage.

The Central Orphanage, Granville County Courthouse, Joseph B. Littlejohn House, Locust Lawn, Oxford Historic District, Paschall-Daniel House, Archibald Taylor Plantation House, and Thorndale are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Stem is a town in Granville County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 960 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The town of Stem was established as a separate and distinct entity from Tally Ho township in 1888 by William Thomas Stem. The Stem family were co-proprietors of a general store in the Tally Ho township and owners of the land where a new spur of the Richmond and Danville Railroad terminated. Stem was built around this new rail station. The town was incorporated in 1911. 

Stem is home to the historic Cozart-Coley House. Tally Ho township was the childhood home of James Webb, for which the space telescope is named.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , including of water area.

Stem is located in the Tally Ho voting precinct of Granville County.

==Schools==
The town of Stem is assigned to the following schools:

* Elementary School (K-5) - Butner-Stem Elementary School 
* Middle School (6-8) - Butner-Stem Middle School 
* High School (9-12) - Granville Central High School 

==Stem High School vs. UNC - Chapel Hill, 1936==

Long-time residents of Granville County recall the tale of how the Stem High School basketball team played and defeated the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill men&#x27;s team in an impromptu basketball game. As the story goes, the Stem team won the Granville County championship in 1936 and were rewarded by their coach (known only as Coach Pegram) with a trip to see UNC play Davidson at the Tin Can. The Davidson team was unable to show because of a snowstorm, so Coach Pegram volunteered his team so that the crowd could still watch a game. The team from Stem (Brent Meadows, Wallace Bowling, Thomas Farabow, Clyde Cates, and James &quot;Bunk&quot; Guthrie) played well against their college opponents, and in the end won the game on a dramatic last-second shot.

The story is unverified in contemporaneous sources. If the game occurred, it is most likely to have taken place on February 12, 1936, when an influenza outbreak caused the cancellation of a UNC/Davidson basketball game. &quot;Bunk&quot; Guthrie would have been 22 years old at the time and 4 years past his graduation (though the Stem team was disqualified from the 1934 county championship for using ineligible players, so this does not necessarily rule out his participation in 1936). The Daily Tar Heel from February 13, 1936, mentions only that the team practiced on the date of the cancelled Davidson game to prepare for their upcoming contest against North Carolina State. The story (true or not) has become a piece of local legend and brought statewide attention to the town of Stem in 1999 when it was covered by Frank Newell for the Warren Record of Warren County, and again in 2000 when it was covered by Ned Barnett on the front page of the News &amp; Observer.

<text>Snow Hill is a town in Greene County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,481 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Greene County and is part of the Greenville Metropolitan Area. Snow Hill hosts numerous tennis tournaments during the year. Snow Hill is home to the Green Ridge Racquet Club. Many junior players and adults travel to Snow Hill in order to play in the USTA (United States Tennis Association) Sanctioned tournaments.

==History==
In its early history, Snow Hill was near the location of the final major battle of the Tuscarora War at Fort Neoheroka in 1713. There are several theories for the derivation of the town&#x27;s name. One theory is that the town derived its name from the Contentnea Creek on whose banks Native Americans camped and called them &quot;snowy white,&quot; which was translated into &quot;snowy hills.&quot; It snows rarely, however, so the snowy white is more likely a reference to the white sands along the creek. Another theory was described by McLoud in the Goldsboro newspaper as being &quot;loblolly pine is in water,&quot; and the most recent translation from the Tuscarora language offered was &quot;as fish go by.&quot;

Originally a community in central Greene County, the town of Snow Hill was chartered in 1828. The town almost became the capital of North Carolina and was originally a major trading depot on Contentnea Creek. At the time, Contentnea Creek was a main Wilson-to-New Bern trading artery. Contentnea Creek connects with the Neuse River at Kinston.

It is believed Snow Hill is the smallest town in the United States to ever field a professional baseball team. From 1937-40, the Snow Hill Billies played in the Class D Coastal Plain League and won the league pennant in 1937. Future New York Yankees Aaron Robinson and Al Gettel began their careers with the Billies, as did Walter Rabb, who would serve as head baseball coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for nearly thirty years.

In April 2011, a tornado struck the town and caused massive damage.

The Greene County Courthouse, Neoheroka Fort Site, Snow Hill Colored High School, Snow Hill Historic District, and St. Barnabas Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
===The Keyauwee===
As early as 1701, the Keyauwee people were living in a village in this region. They enjoyed the area&#x27;s mild climate, abundant natural resources, and the fertile hunting grounds along the Deep and Uwharrie rivers.

Part of a loose confederacy of 20 or more tribes, it is believed that by the 1760s, the Keyauwee had moved south, close to the boundary between the two Carolinas, where they were likely absorbed by the Catawba tribe.

===Quaker settlement===
By the late 18th century, European settlers came to Jamestown. Many were Quaker families who moved to the area from Pennsylvania in search of productive farmland. Among the original settlers was James Mendenhall, who established a farmstead near present-day Jamestown in 1752. Though Mendenhall moved to Georgia in 1775, his son George remained, and by 1816, he founded the village of Jamestown in honor of his father.

The Mendenhall family, who owned and operated the area&#x27;s first grist and lumber mills, also owned much of the town&#x27;s original land. Today, High Point City Lake is situated where the original family farmhouse and land was located.

In 1781, during the Revolutionary War, British General Cornwallis&#x27; army camped near the settlement and commandeered provisions from local farms and mills prior to his engagement with Nathanael Greene&#x27;s troops at New Garden, in modern-day Greensboro.

===19th century===

By 1800, Jamestown was a bustling settlement of 150 residents with its own post office, inn and Freemasons&#x27; lodge. Around this same time, gold was discovered near Jamestown, and several mines profited until the California Gold Rush frenzy shut down local efforts.

In 1811, James Mendenhall&#x27;s son Richard, a local tanner, built the Mendenhall Plantation homestead, a highlight of any tour of Jamestown today.

In addition to farming and related industries, Jamestown was home to a gun factory, which manufactured a sturdy and accurate muzzle-loading gun known as the &quot;Jamestown Rifle&quot;, the mainstay of Jamestown&#x27;s industry through the latter half of the 19th century and a highly prized collectible among gun enthusiasts today.

During the Civil War, Jamestown&#x27;s Quakers, who opposed war and violence, attempted to remain neutral. However, the Confederacy demanded that those who were able to make shoes, uniforms, or weapons continue to do so or pay heavy taxes. Records indicate that Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his entourage passed through Jamestown during their hasty retreat to the south after the Civil War ended.

Prior to the war, Jamestown was a known &quot;stop&quot; along the Underground Railroad, which helped fugitive slaves reach freedom in the North. According to local historical records, many Quaker homes in this area had a trap door leading to the basement to help slaves escape. Further, according to records, the Mendenhall and Beard families were instrumental in assisting in emancipation efforts.

Built in 1856, the railroad bisects Jamestown, and still provides a vital link for freight and some passengers between the port cities to the east and interior destinations.

===20th century===
By April 1947, the North Carolina General Assembly granted Jamestown incorporation. Several months after incorporation, Jamestown adopted zoning districts and began construction of a municipal water and sewer system.

T. C. Ragsdale Sr. served as the town&#x27;s first mayor, and Charles P. Turner was the first town manager.

In the 1950s, with a population of approximately 750, the town boasted such improvements as street lighting, water and sewer service, and a fire department.

During the 1960s, Jamestown grew quickly. Several residential neighborhoods sprang from old farmland. An ABC board was formed and a liquor store was constructed, enabling the town to pay off debt incurred for water and sewer lines as well as fund the building of Town Hall in 1967 and the Jamestown Park and Golf Course in 1974.

The Former Jamestown High School, Gardner House, Jamestown Historic District, McCulloch&#x27;s Gold Mill, Richard Mendenhall Plantation Buildings, Oakdale Cotton Mill Village, and Ragsdale Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
In 1907 the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a law providing for the creation and maintenance of public high schools in each county. Jamestown Public School, a union school, was built and became the &quot;best equipped school&quot; in Guilford County, with dormitories for boarding students. In 1914 the school was destroyed by fire, but a new building was completed the next year. This building now stands in the heart of Jamestown and houses the Jamestown Public Library.

The school grew steadily, and a new high school complex in Jamestown was opened in September 1959. The new high school was named for Lucy Coffin Ragsdale because of her dedication and interest to public school education in Jamestown. The first principal of Ragsdale High School was T.G. Madison, followed by Steve Dalton. Kathryn Rogers was the third principal in the history of the school. Ragsdale is one of 26 high schools in Guilford County Schools. The areas that are zoned to Ragsdale&#x27;s district include areas of northeastern High Point, southeast Jamestown, and the Adams Farm/Sedgefield area of Greensboro. The school&#x27;s current principal is Jim Gibson.

Millis Road Elementary School opened in the fall of 1961. The first enrollment included 360 students, 12 teachers, a part-time librarian, and one principal. The intent of it being built was to relieve overcrowding in the Jamestown district. Even though the school originally had a capacity for 560 students, it at one time served a student body of 792. When the neighboring Pilot Elementary opened in the fall of 1996, the student body decreased to 330. Current enrollment is 515 students.

A variety of organizational patterns have been tried at the school, beginning with first through sixth grade, later third through fifth grade and the present pre-K through fifth grade. Millis Road students are participating in seminars led by teachers and specialists using Paidela techniques and methods. Millis Road is located in District 5 of the Guilford County School System.

To compensate for the town&#x27;s growth, Jamestown has since built two more elementary schools and one more middle school. A community college, Guilford Technical Community College, provides local adults with a higher education.

<text>Summerfield is a town in Guilford County, North Carolina. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,951.

The town is largely regarded as a suburb of Greensboro and as development has grown, the town has slowly transformed from a rural farming area into a bedroom community primarily from Northern transplants. It features a town hall, along Oak Ridge Road (aka NC 150), west of Battleground Avenue (aka US 220), as well as a shopping center east of Battleground Avenue and Auburn Road, located on the eastern portion of NC 150. Interstate 73 passes just west of the town&#x27;s center, connecting with NC 150, and also connecting with US 158 in the northernmost part of the town.

==History==
The area was settled in about 1769 by Charles Bruce and acquired the name Bruce&#x27;s Crossroads. In February 1781 patriot forces under General Henry Lee III and British forces under General Banastre Tarleton skirmished at the crossroads during the American Revolutionary War. The Patriots won the battle and forced the British cavalry to retreat. In 1812 a post office was established, and the community was renamed Summerfield, in homage to evangelist John Summerfield.

Summerfield School Gymnasium and Community Center has a gym that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The Summerfield Historic District was listed in 2005.

Former North Carolina Governor Alexander Martin had a house that he lived in the town square of Summerfield, which is not standing today. George Washington stayed in the house during the Revolutionary War. There is currently a historical home on the square known as the Martin House, but it was lived in by a son of the Governor. Currently, the Martin House is owned by the town of Summerfield.

In June 2024, the North Carolina General Assembly voted to deannex close to 1000 acres owned by developer David Couch after officials and people living in the area opposed his planned housing development. While an appeal of the action is possible, Couch would get to develop the land without being denied permission by the town government.

<text>Enfield is a town in Halifax County, North Carolina, United States, and was founded in 1740. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 1,864, which reflected a decrease of almost 27% from the population of 2,538 in 2010. It is the oldest town in Halifax County, and was once the world&#x27;s largest raw peanut market. Enfield is part of the Roanoke Rapids micropolitan area.

==History==

The small rural town was site of the Enfield Riots, which helped spark American independence. The Crown governed the area, and Robert Earl Granville, heir of John Lord Carteret, possessed land rights in the district. The riots were set off by a controversy over corrupt agents, land grants, titles, and the collection of quitrents (which often ended up in Granville’s pocket). A group of Colonists — many of them land owners and office holders from Halifax, Edgecombe, and Granville counties — went to Edenton on the night of January 25, 1759, and kidnapped Francis Corbin and a co-agent, Joshua Bodley. Corbin and Bodley were brought to Enfield, where they were thrown in jail for four days and forced to open all land records for public inspection. Corbin returned illegal fees he had collected, but he filed a lawsuit against his abductors after his release.

The suit was eventually dropped, but the Colonial Assembly jailed some of the men who had kidnapped Corbin and Bodley. A group of citizens in Enfield expressed outrage against British tyranny and on May 14, 1759, broke into jail and freed the men.

<text>Roanoke Rapids () is a city in Halifax County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 15,229 at the 2020 census and is the largest community in Halifax County. It is the principal city of the Roanoke Rapids Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also an anchor city of the Rocky Mount-Wilson-Roanoke Rapids CSA, with a total population of 297,726 as of 2018.

==Geography==
Roanoke Rapids is located in northern Halifax County bordered to the north by Northampton County, with the county line following the Roanoke River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.36%, are water.

The town is located at the eastern edge of the North Carolina Piedmont, on the Roanoke River at the fall line, which marks the area where an upland region (continental bedrock) and a coastal plain (coastal alluvia) meet. The fall line is typically prominent where a river crosses it, for there will usually be rapids or waterfalls. Because of these features, riverboats normally could not travel any further inland. Because settlements needed a port and a ready supply of water power, they often developed where the river crosses the fall line. The Roanoke River and its falls inspired the development of Roanoke Rapids; businessmen such as Sam Patterson and other textile manufacturers used the river to power their mills.

The most prominent example of fall line settlement was the establishment of the cities along the eastern coast of the United States where the Appalachian Rise and the coastal plains meet.

All the textile mills are now closed and nearly 3,000 employees eventually lost their jobs. Roanoke Rapids is now home to a WestRock paper manufacturing facility.

==Attractions==
Roanoke Rapids is known for its many historical sites. The original Roanoke Rapids High School building or Senior building as it is sometimes referred, opened in 1921 and is still in use. The building embodies many elements of Elizabethan Gothic and Tudor Revival architecture in its castle-like facade. It was built by industrialist Samuel Paterson and designed by renowned architect Hobart Upjohn in a modified H-design. Hobart Upjohn was the grandson of Richard Upjohn, architect of Christ Episcopal Church in Raleigh, North Carolina and Trinity Church, in New York, NY among other notable buildings. The high school is the dominant building in the city&#x27;s central core and is flanked by another castle-like structure which formerly housed a National Guard Armory. In addition to Roanoke Rapids High School, the Roanoke Canal and Roanoke Rapids Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Roanoke Canal Museum and Trail is one of the city&#x27;s oldest historical sites. The 1823 canal lock building has been adapted as a museum to show the significance of the canal system to American westward expansion. It offers an in-depth look at the influential people who pushed for the Roanoke River to become a source of trade and navigation, as well as the commodities that were shipped and traded on the Roanoke River. The trail, over seven miles long, is adjacent to the museum and largely parallel to the Roanoke River.

Roanoke Rapids had planned Carolina Crossroads, an entertainment district founded by a group of local business developers. Attractions were to include the Randy Parton Theater as an anchor for the development, an outdoor amphitheater, a campground, an aquarium, hotels, restaurants, outlet shopping, travel center, several other dinner theaters, and water park. The association between the city and Randy Parton, brother of Dolly Parton, ended in December 2006. The city renamed the theater as the Roanoke Rapids Theater. A Black Widow Billiards Center was also announced by the pool player, Jeanette Lee. Carolina Crossroads and the theater in particular became a controversial matter because of the city&#x27;s financial exposure. After nearly a decade of failed attempts to lease or sell the theater, the city sold the theater on July 23, 2018.

<text>Weldon is a town in Halifax County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,655 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In 1752, Daniel Weldon purchased 1,273 acres of land on the Roanoke River. His plantation became known as Weldon&#x27;s Landing. As it was just below the fall line, Weldon&#x27;s Landing was the westernmost point of navigation along the Roanoke.

The Roanoke Canal was built in 1823 to bypass the rapids and open up trade to Virginia. The aqueduct across Chockoyotte creek was built near Weldon&#x27;s Landing, bringing an economic boom to the area. The canal is now dry, and is a hiking trail open to the public.

Weldon was the first railroad hub in the American South. The Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad terminated in Weldon. In 1841, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was completed, also terminating in Weldon. At the time, it was the longest railroad in the world. This led to the incorporation of the town in 1843.

The Petersburg and Roanoke Railroad in 1848 and the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad in 1853 both extended to terminate in Weldon.

During the Civil War, both railroad bridges over the Roanoke were burned. Only the Seaboard and Roanoke rebuilt their bridge.

Grace Episcopal Church and the Weldon Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

U.S. Route 158 runs east–west through the town, connecting the downtown area with Interstate 95 at the town&#x27;s western border. US 158 leads east to Murfreesboro and west into the southern part of Roanoke Rapids. Interstate 95 leads north to Emporia and south to Rocky Mount, providing a highway alternative to US 301.

Located on the Roanoke River, Weldon calls itself the &quot;Rockfish Capital of the World&quot; due to abundant fishing during the May spawning season.

===School paddling controversy===

In December 1981, three students at Dunn High School were spanked with a wooden paddle by the assistant principal, Glenn Varney, as punishment for skipping school. School corporal punishment is legal in the state of North Carolina and was at the time permitted by the Harnett County school district. The paddling led the parents of one of the students, 17-year-old Shelly Gaspersohn, to file a $55,000 lawsuit against Varney and the school the following May (&quot;Gaspersohn v. Harnett County Board of Education&quot;), claiming that the punishment was too severe. When Shelley reached the age of 18 in October, she took over as direct plaintiff. In December 1983, following one week of testimony and 15 minutes of deliberation, the jury found for the defendants, and the plaintiff&#x27;s subsequent appeal was ultimately rejected two years later by the Supreme Court of North Carolina. The trial was chronicled by psychologist Irwin Hyman, who was a witness for the plaintiff, in his 1990 book, &quot;Reading, Writing and the Hickory Stick&quot;.

On October 17, 1984, Shelly Gaspersohn recounted her experience before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, led by the subcommittee chairman, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. She stated that the county medical examiner who treated her for bruises and external hemorrhaging in the days after she was paddled filed a child abuse charge against Varney (a fact that was not allowed to be presented at trial), but that &quot;there is no agency that can investigate a charge of child abuse against a public school teacher.&quot; Shelly&#x27;s mother, Marlene Gaspersohn, also testified during the same session. When asked if she believed schools had the right to administer corporal punishment to students,&quot; Mrs. Gaspersohn replied, &quot;I used to think that they had that right, but after experiencing the trauma that it can create, I have changed my mind completely about it.&quot;

Shelly Gaspersohn also called for the abolition of school paddling in a guest column for &quot;USA Today&quot;, published October 23, 1984.

In 2008 Harnett County changed its policy to ban corporal punishment in schools.

In 1902, the Duke family built the Erwin Cotton Mill, which closed on December 1, 2000, due to the North American Free Trade Agreement increasing the labor costs of the mill workers, leaving Swift Textiles to relocate the mill&#x27;s operations to Mexico. The new town was named &quot;Duke&quot; after the founding shareholders. In 1925, the name was changed to &quot;Erwin&quot; because of the formation of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Oak Grove, Averasboro Battlefield Historic District, and Downtown Erwin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="127951" wikidata="Q2029343" url="?curid=127951" title="Canton, North Carolina">
<text>Canton is the second largest town in Haywood County, North Carolina, United States. It is located about west of Asheville and is part of that city&#x27;s metropolitan area. The town is named after the city of Canton, Ohio. The population was 4,422 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
This area was long settled by succeeding indigenous cultures. What is known as the archeological Garden Creek site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located on the south side of the Pigeon River, approximately seven miles west of Canton. It was inhabited from 8000 BCE by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. Villages were developed in the Middle Woodland (200-600 CE) and The Southeast Appalachian Mississippian culture (1000 to 1450/1500 CE) periods. The Cherokee people are the most recent Native Americans to occupy this area, which is part of their homelands in the western Carolinas, southeastern Tennessee, and northeastern Georgia. The Cherokee in Western North Carolina are known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally recognized tribe.
The prehistoric peoples built a total of four earthwork mounds at the site. Three have been excavated, the last two platform mounds in the 1960s prior to residential development.

European Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 1780s, following the American Revolutionary War, United States independence, and gaining cessions of land to the US by the Cherokee. By 1790, Jonathan McPeters was farming the banks of the Pigeon River at the site where Canton developed. Around 1815 the first church was built in what was to become Canton; it was called the Locust Old Field Baptist Church. &quot;Old Field&quot; often referred to areas cultivated or occupied by the Cherokee people, as this was known to be part of their traditional homelands.

Canton was founded in 1889 as &quot;Buford&quot;. Later that same year, the name was changed to &quot;Vinson&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Pigeon Ford&quot; in 1891, and to &quot;Canton&quot; in 1893. The town was named for Canton, Ohio, the source of the steel for the bridge that was built across the Pigeon River.

Canton&#x27;s river location enabled the development of industry that used water power.

Peter G. Thomson had built Champion Coated Paper Company of Hamilton, Ohio into one of largest manufacturers of paper in the United States. He visited Western North Carolina in 1905 looking for a location for a pulp mill to supply his company. The area had large forests that would supply timber. Leaders of communities farther to the west tried to convince Thomson to choose their areas. While the timber supplies were greater to the west, Thomson wanted areas with more spruce and settled on Canton, which had the type trees Thomson wanted, enough land for a mill, and the Pigeon River to move logs to the mill (Thomson later realized the river did not decline sufficiently, so railroads were used to move logs instead). Construction on the mill began in 1906. Many of the workers also had farms that they had to return to, so immigrants were hired to do much of the work.
Canton had 350 people when work began. When the Champion Fibre Company mill opened in 1908, it had about 1000 employees and resulted in other related jobs being created, including construction of neighborhoods such as Fibreville, with 60 homes for employees. Thomson had great respect for the workers, believing those who had wealth should provide jobs for those who needed them, and began an annual Labor Day celebration in 1906, which continued a hundred years later.

When Champion owners decided to close the plant in 1997 because of environmental issues, the employees purchased the plant and formed Blue Ridge Paper Company. Under an ESOP, the employees owned a 45% stake in the new company. The plant was sold to Evergreen Packaging, which in 2020 became Pactiv Evergreen. The Blue Ridge Southern Railroad served the plant and has a small railyard next to it. On March 6, 2023, Pactiv Evergreen announced the mill would close in the summer, affecting 1,100 workers.

The Canton Main Street Historic District and Colonial Theater are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On August 17, 2021, Tropical Storm Fred flooded the town near the Pigeon River. As of June 2022, many buildings surrounding the river were still not usable as a result of the storm. In nearby Cruso, six people died as a result from the flooding, many of which at Laurel Bank Campground. Flooding from Hurricane Helene in September 2024 was even worse.
==Geography==

<text>Clyde is a town in Haywood County, North Carolina, United States. The 2010 census recorded the population at 1,223 people. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the area that is now Clyde was inhabited by the Cherokee people and other Indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The Cherokee in Western North Carolina are known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally recognized tribe.

The city of Clyde was founded in 1890.
On March 3, 1900, an African-American man named George Ratliffe was lynched in Clyde after being accused of raping an 8 year old white girl named Hester Wagstaff. The girl was the granddaughter of Ratliffe&#x27;s employers, Matthias and Nithis Holland. Ratliffe was accused of committing the crime at 4:00 PM of March 3, 1900, three miles outside of Clyde. Arrested on the evening of the same day, and subjected to an initial trial in Clyde before being taken to the jail in Waynesville on March 4, a mob of 40-50 &quot;masked men&quot; attempted to break into the jail cell where Ratcliffe was held. Failing to break into the jail, the mob of white men fired 40 shots, killing Ratcliffe in his jail cell before he could go to trial or even speak with a lawyer. The Haywood County branch of the NAACP has supported the creation of a monument recognizing the murder of George Ratliffe.

The area is prone to flooding. The town was damaged by Hurricane Ivan (2004), Tropical Storm Fred (2021) and Hurricane Helene in 2024. 

The Shook-Welch-Smathers House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

<doc id="127953" wikidata="Q946396" url="?curid=127953" title="Lake Junaluska, North Carolina">
<text>Lake Junaluska is a census-designated place (CDP) in Haywood County, North Carolina, United States, and an artificial lake in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Lake Junaluska is named after nearby Mount Junaluska (now North Eaglenest Mountain), which was named after a Cherokee leader in the early nineteenth century. As of the 2010 census, the population of the community was 2,734.

The manmade lake of the same name is surrounded by private residences and the Lake Junaluska Conference and Retreat Center. The lake is fed primarily from Richland Creek and discharges into the creek, maintaining an approximately constant lake level. Richland Creek is a tributary to the Pigeon River. Water sports at the lake include canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding and fishing, plus swimming in the lakeside swimming pool. To maintain a quiet environment, only electric trolling motors are permitted to operate on the lake. There is a paved walking trail and an extended 3.8-mile walking trail around the lake. Lake Junaluska also has an 18-hole golf course, pickleball and tennis courts, and dedicated bocce ball, corn hole and shuffleboard courts. The Blue Ridge Parkway is nearby, as is Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Lake Junaluska was formerly the site of the headquarters of the World Methodist Council.

==History==
Before Indian Removal in 1839, all this area was part of the homelands of the Cherokee people. Today the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is based on Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, the only federally recognized tribe in the state. European Americans colonized most of the former Cherokee territories.

Methodist pastors James Atkins and George R. Stuart believed the Southeastern United States needed a place comparable to Chautauqua Lake, New York and Winona Lake, Indiana. Atkins contacted Stuart in April 1908 while attending a missionary conference in Chattanooga, Tennessee where Stuart was a pastor. The Southern Assembly, Inc. bought 1,200 acres of land.

On June 25, 1913, the Second General Missionary Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South convened in the new auditorium built here and named for Stuart. It was beside a new lake being filled after the damming of Richland Creek. As there were only 13 houses and no hotel until 1914, the 4,000 people had to stay elsewhere.

Auditorium Hotel, the first hotel, was built in 1914 across from Stuart Auditorium but burned in 1920.

The Junaluska Inn was built in 1917, but it caught fire and burned down the next year. A new hotel in 1921 was built on the same site, eventually to be named for Bishop Walter Russell Lambuth. Additions were made in 1956 and 1964.

In 1923, a classroom building called Shackford Hall was constructed at the lake&#x27;s west end. Both Lambuth Inn and Shackford Hall have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1922, a large, lighted cross was erected at a spot overlooking the lake near Lambuth Inn, the oldest hotel at the lake. In 1994, a new cross was installed. The original, eventually restored, was moved to Mount Shepherd Retreat Center near Asheboro, North Carolina.

The Southeastern Jurisdiction (SEJ) of the United Methodist Church became the owner in 1948. Lake Junaluska Assembly Inc., an agency of the SEJ, has been tax-exempt since 1959. In the 1950s, the World Methodist Council, a consultative body linking almost all Methodist denominations worldwide, moved its headquarters to Lake Junaluska. In Spring 2021, the World Methodist Council sold its headquarters building, including a museum, to the assembly for $1.25 million. The World Methodist Council moved to offices in nearby Waynesville. The museum&#x27;s collection moved to Southern Methodist University.

===Conference and Retreat Center===

Lake Junaluska Assembly Inc. received financial support from the United Methodist Church for nearly 100 years, but that support ended and the Assembly became more of a business. The Lake Junaluska Assembly Board of Directors, in addition to acting as the &quot;de facto government&quot;, owns the Lake Junaluska Conference and Retreat Center, the lake and the dam, and recreational facilities. The board voted in March 2013 to ask for Waynesville to annex the community.

The Lake Junaluska Conference and Retreat Center hosts events for the United Methodist Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, The Salvation Army, Church of the Brethren, and other organizations. Several musical events are hosted in Stuart Auditorium, including Folkmoot USA programs and Appalachian bluegrass concerts. The Smoky Mountain Folk Festival is held here. The facilities are intended to be used for the renewal of &quot;body, mind and spirit&quot;.

The Terrace Hotel and the Lambuth Inn, the community&#x27;s primary accommodations, were extensively renovated in 2015 and 2018. The Corneille Bryan Native Garden contains many plants once abundant in the region but now rare.
The Conference and Retreat Center is governed by an active, diverse 32-member Board of Trustees. Some 68% of the Board members are property owners in the Lake Junaluska community. The board provides strategic direction, and budget approval for the Conference and Retreat Center, the Lake Junaluska Public Works, residential fees, and utility (water and sewer) rates. The Executive Director, who has day-to-day management responsibility, reports to the board of Trustees. The board approves changes to the rules and regulations of the community.

The amenities of Lake Junaluska include lodging, meeting facilities, dining (food service), trails, gardens, meditation areas, golf, and other recreation opportunities. The maintenance of the public areas around the lake and the dam, which is inspected annually, are funded primarily through charitable giving and proceeds from lodging guests. There is periodic removal of sediment that has been carried into the lake from Richland Creek. All property within the boundaries of the Assembly, approximately , has deed covenant restrictions that give the Board of Trustees the right to enforce regulations and the first right of refusal on all property sales.

Work began in 2022 on a $2.5 million renovation of the former World Methodist Council headquarters, which Lake Junaluska purchased for $1.25 million along with an adjacent building in 2021. The former headquarters was named the Warren Center for Mike and Anne Warren, who gave $625,000 toward the purchase and $1.1 million for the renovation. In June 2024 the first event was held in the building that will be used for weddings and community events.

==Geography==

The community of Lake Junaluska is located in central Haywood County just east of the artificial lake of the same name. The lake was formed by damming Richland Creek (a tributary to the Pigeon River) which flows northwest of the community. Haywood County has 18 mountain peaks over , more than any other county east of the Mississippi River. The closest high summits are High Top on Utah Mountain, to the north; and North Eaglenest Mountain (formerly Mount Junaluska), to the southwest.
The community is bordered by Waynesville, the Haywood county seat, to the south; Maggie Valley to the west, and Clyde to the east. U.S. Routes 19, 23, 74, and 276 all pass through the community. Interstate 40 passes just northeast of the community, with access from Exits 24 and 27.

Asheville, the major city in the region, is to the east via I-40 or by Routes 19, 23, and 74. Route 19 leads west to Cherokee, base on the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and near the south entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Routes 23 and 74, the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, leads southwest to Sylva, and US 276 leads southeast through Waynesville and to Brevard.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Lake Junaluska CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.53%, are water.

==Climate==
Lake Junaluska has an oceanic climate under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). Monthly temperature averages range from in January to in July. Precipitation averages annually, and snowfall averages .
==Today==

The Lake Junaluska Public Works office manages the roads and utilities. Water for the community is purchased from the town of Waynesville, and sewage treatment is provided by Waynesville through a purchase agreement. Water and sewer fees and annual service fees provide funds for maintenance and improvements to the infrastructure. The community has engaged in a program to renew roads and systematically replace water and sewer lines without incurring debt. A prioritized list of improvements was initially developed, and replacement of the oldest underground water lines has saved money by reducing water loss due to leakage.
A Community Council of elected representatives provides guidance to the public works office and Conference and Retreat Center leadership on issues that impact the community, such as utility rates, annual service charges, residential rules, and regulations. Open monthly meetings also provide a means for the property owners to learn about new developments in the community and provide input to the council and the conference and retreat center leadership.
The community of residents, year-round and seasonal alike, are a very diverse active group that enjoy many opportunities for involvement in recreation and fellowship. Community organizations include the Lake Junaluska Assembly Property Owners organization (LJAPOO), which addresses issues associated with the ownership, and the Junaluskans, which is a service group that meets twice monthly and supports many activities.
The campus is also the home to the Foundation for Evangelism, a non-profit organization serving ministries of the United Methodist Church by promoting the growth of new generations of clergy and laity that have a passion for evangelism.

<text>Maggie Valley is a town in Haywood County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 1,687 at the 2020 census. A popular tourist destination, it is home to Cataloochee Ski Area and the former Ghost Town in the Sky amusement park. Maggie Valley is part of the Asheville metropolitan area.

The community gets its name from Maggie Mae Setzer; her father John &quot;Jack&quot; Sidney Setzer founded the area&#x27;s first post office and named it after one of his daughters.

==History==
Before European colonization, what is now Maggie Valley was inhabited by the Cherokee people and other indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The Cherokee in western North Carolina are known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally recognized tribe.

Maggie Valley was officially incorporated as a town on May 10, 1904.

==Geography==
Maggie Valley is in west-central Haywood County. U.S. Route 19 is the main road through the town, leading east to Asheville and west over Soco Gap to Cherokee.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has an area of , all land.

==Wildlife==

Elk were copious throughout the United States, but numbers decreased in the mid-19th century because of overhunting and habitat loss. In 2001, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the National Park Service and other partners joined to restore wild elk to the Great Smoky Mountains in the Cataloochee Valley near Maggie Valley. Most elk are found in Cataloochee Valley, which is a perfect viewing area in the southeastern section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. But the elk have been known to wander out of the park and walk toward Maggie Valley. There are an estimated 200 elk in the Maggie Valley area currently.

Black bears are occasionally seen in and around Maggie Valley. During winter, the black bears are inactive for a short amount of time and exhibit some physiological responses to low food storage and temperatures. But a result of their brief hibernation is that there are more bear sightings. This is risky because they can be looking for food in neighborhoods or killed on roads. Locals strongly suggest never approaching a bear to photograph it, or leaving food or garbage out, and taking in any bird feeders that are not monitored (especially at night).

<text>Waynesville is the county seat of Haywood County, North Carolina, United States. It is the largest town in North Carolina west of Asheville. Waynesville is located about southwest of Asheville between the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountains.

As of the 2010 census, Waynesville had a population of 9,869. The town is located just outside the Pisgah National Forest and is close to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway. Waynesville and Haywood County are part of the four-county Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area, currently the fifth largest metropolitan area in North Carolina. It is the third largest town in the MSA behind the cities of Asheville and Hendersonville.

==History==
The town of Waynesville was founded in 1810 by Colonel Robert Love, a Revolutionary War soldier. He donated land for the courthouse, jail, and public square, and named the town after his former commander in the war, General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne.

The Boone-Withers House, Citizens Bank and Trust Company Building, Former, Francis Grist Mill, Frog Level Historic District, Haywood County Courthouse, Alden and Thomasene Howell House, Masonic Hall, Charles and Annie Quinlan House, Clyde H. Ray Sr. House, Frank Smathers House, Spread Out Historic District, Waynesville Municipal Building, Dr. J. Howell Way House, and Waynesville Main Street Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Waynesville was incorporated as a town in 1871. In July 1995, the towns of Hazelwood and Waynesville merged into one community and continued to grow with a population today of over 10,000.

===The &quot;Battle&quot; of Waynesville===
Waynesville was the scene of the last and perhaps most unusual skirmish in the eastern theater of the American Civil War. On May 6, 1865, Union Colonel William C. Bartlett&#x27;s 2nd North Carolina (Federal) Mounted Infantry were attacked at White Sulphur Springs (east of Waynesville) by a detachment of rebels from Thomas&#x27; Legion of Highlanders, who had been summoned by locals.

East of the Mississippi, Thomas&#x27; Legion fired &quot;The Last Shot&quot; of the Civil War in White Sulphur Springs, North Carolina. The Legion consisted of Cherokee and White soldiers. Some of these soldiers had served under Jubal A. Early during the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, but had been sent back to their native North Carolina mountains to engage in guerrilla warfare against the remaining Union forces.

The disoriented Union soldiers retreated into Waynesville, and on the evening of May 6 remaining elements of Thomas&#x27; Legion surrounded the town. The soldiers lit numerous bonfires on the ridges above the town and engaged in war chants in an effort to intimidate the Federals. The following day the Confederate commanders Gen. James Green Martin and Col. William Holland Thomas (for whom the Legion was named) negotiated a surrender. These commanders had been made aware that Generals Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston had already surrendered and that continued hostilities would prove pointless.

===Frog Level===
Waynesville began to see development after arrival of the railroad in 1884. The agricultural, lumber and tourism industries in Waynesville and Haywood County began to thrive as access to the west was opened up.

The area of Waynesville located along Richland Creek, northwest and downhill from Main Street, was where the railroad tracks were laid. Until this time the area had been essentially a swampland, with a few scattered buildings but no major development. Once the depot was built and the train arrived this section was developed. It was given the name of &quot;Frog Level&quot; by the local community because of its low-lying location along Richland Creek, the &quot;frog level&quot; when the area flooded.

Downtown and the nearby Frog Level commercial centers of Waynesville continued to be the central focus for social life, transportation, and wholesale and retail businesses through the 1940s. Businesses in the Frog Level area in the 1930s and 1940s included hardware stores, farm supplies, coal sales, auto dealers and garages, furniture stores, wholesale groceries, and warehouses and lumber companies, all of which were businesses dependent on the railroad.

As the automobile became the primary mode of transportation for most residents, the railroad declined in importance. This in turn led to a shift of business away from Frog Level. The last passenger train arrived in Waynesville in 1949, and freight trains pass through Frog Level twice daily, with most trains continuing on to Sylva.

By the 1980s, the railroad in Waynesville had been integrated into the Southern Railway Company system. The first depot burned in 1900, but it was soon replaced with another depot that remained standing until 1987.

==Geography==
Waynesville is located southwest of the center of Haywood County in the valley of Richland Creek, a tributary of the Pigeon River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Due to its elevation, Waynesville has an subtropical highland climate under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;).
===Waynesville watershed===
Waynesville&#x27;s water supply is located south of the town, with a watershed that covers an area of of town-owned land on the headwaters of Allens Creek. Tributary streams within the watershed flow into the Waynesville Reservoir, a lake created by a dam on Allens Creek. The reservoir and surrounding watershed are classified by the state of North Carolina as WS-1. This classification is the state&#x27;s most stringent and forbids development within the watershed boundary.

===Neighborhoods===
* Downtown - Once the primary retail business center of the town, downtown Waynesville is now home to art galleries, cafes, restaurants, shops, banks, doctors offices, and town and county government administration buildings.
* Frog Level - The historic district whose name came about because of frequent flooding of Richland Creek. As transportation shifted from railway to cars in the 1940s, business shifted up the hill to higher ground. By the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, Frog Level became known as a seedy part of downtown, mainly due to a now-closed bar called The Tap Room. In recent years, the revitalization of Main Street has spread down into this area. In 2003, the Frog Level Historic District was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. The local merchants association presents The Whole Bloomin&#x27; Thing Spring Festival every year just before the last frost date, marking the start of planting season for the locals. The festival draws approximately 8,000 attendees to the area and features nature-related themes. The historic Murphy Branch of the old Western North Carolina Railroad runs through Frog Level and still carries freight rail traffic twice daily from the Blue Ridge Southern Railway, which now owns the line.
* Hazelwood - Due to financial troubles, this once independent town ceased to exist and was annexed by Waynesville in 1995. Its ZIP code is 28738.
* Laurel Ridge - The Laurel Ridge neighborhood is connected to a country club of the same name and features a golf course, pool, tennis courts, and upscale mountain homes.
* West Waynesville - Once the industrial part of town, West Waynesville is now home to Waynesville Commons, a large retail shopping center which sits on the site of an old Dayco rubber hose factory.
* Russ Avenue - A newer business district featuring restaurants, retail stores, auto dealerships, banks, and grocery stores. Russ Avenue is the most traveled surface street in Haywood County and is slated for a major makeover by the NCDOT in the 2020s.

<text>Fletcher is a town in Henderson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 7,187 at the 2010 census, and was estimated to be 8,333 in 2018.

Fletcher is adjacent to Asheville Regional Airport, which serves western North Carolina. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Fletcher was first settled in 1795 when Samuel Murray decided to move his family to the mountains of western North Carolina. His family made the difficult journey from South Carolina up the old Howard Gap Road which, in areas, was little more than an old Indian trail. Samuel decided he wanted to live just east of the location where Howard Gap Road ended which is very close to where Fletcher Community Park is located today. Murray began buying property in what was then the Limestone District of Buncombe County.  Eventually he purchased more than 10,000 acres bounded roughly by Cane Creek to the south, the French Broad River to the west, Long Shoals Road to the north and Hooper’s Creek and Burney Mountain to the East.  In 1827, Samuel’s son opened the first post office in the Limestone District and the area became known as Murrayville.
The Town was used by Stateville, North Carolina to access the Asheville Metropolitan Area and is still being used to give Statesville access to the Asheville Metropolitan Area.

Murrayville became a strategic location because it was one of the main way-stations on the Buncombe Turnpike which was built in the early 1800s. This road quickly became the main passageway for families, farmers, and traders traveling from South Carolina up into Asheville and points north. In 1837, Murrayville was renamed Shufordsville after the newly appointed Postmaster Jacob Rhyne Shuford. Shortly thereafter in 1838, the state of North Carolina formed the last hundred of its counties and Shufordsville was no longer part of Buncombe County but rather part of the newly created Henderson County. Shufordsville continued to slowly grow and changed its name one last time when the town’s namesake, Dr. George Fletcher, became the local postmaster in 1886.

The Meadows and Rugby Grange are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hendersonville is a city in and the county seat of Henderson County, North Carolina, United States, located south of Asheville. Like the county, the city is named for 19th-century North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Leonard Henderson.

The population was 13,137 at the 2010 census and was estimated in 2019 to be 14,157.

==Introduction==
Prior to the Treaty of Hopewell, the land that now is occupied by Hendersonville was settled by Cherokee tribes. Following this treaty, white settlers entered the region, eventually taking the land of what is now Henderson County in full from the original inhabitants. Poor trade links still restricted economic and demographic growth in the region, until the development of the Buncombe Turnpike, completed in 1827. Wealthy low-country planters started to migrate to the area, building summer homes and bringing lots of money with them. In response to this population growth, Henderson County was split off from Buncombe County and founded in 1838.

Judge Mitchell King owned , of which he donated 50 acres for the establishment of the town of Hendersonville. He used some of the enslaved African Americans he owned as workers to lay out its Main Street.

Formed in 1838 and chartered in 1847 as the county seat of Henderson County, Hendersonville is traditionally known as &quot;The City of Four Seasons&quot;. The town has a well-preserved Main Street and adjoining downtown areas with many restaurants, antique shops and boutiques in buildings that housed key local businesses until the mid-1980s. At that point some businesses moved to suburban or highway locations, or were put out of business by big box competition. The town&#x27;s architecture reflects the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Much downtown revitalization has occurred since the early 1990s.

Larger stores have been developed almost entirely along the commercial strips extending outward from the downtown along U.S. Highway 64 east and U.S. Highways 176 and 25. There are historic neighborhoods outside the Main Street corridor, including the 5th Avenue neighborhood on the city&#x27;s west side and the Druid Hills neighborhood north of downtown. Depressed areas are found along the city&#x27;s east side, but redevelopment efforts are underway in the historic commercial district along 7th Avenue East.

The architectural focus of the downtown area is the historic Henderson County Courthouse, completed in 1905 and completely renovated in 2008. The newly restored City Hall (erected 1924) and the modern Henderson County Courthouse (1995) are also located downtown.

The largest street festival of the Hendersonville calendar is the annual North Carolina Apple Festival, culminating in the Apple Parade that regularly draws up to 50,000 spectators. Main Street is home to other festivals and special activities throughout the year.

High schools in the city and surrounding area include Hendersonville High School, West Henderson High School, North Henderson High School, and East Henderson High School.

==Geography==
Hendersonville is located at the center of Henderson County, in the southern mountains of western North Carolina near the Eastern Escarpment.

Interstate 26 runs through the eastern side of the city, with access from Exit 49. U.S. Routes 25 and 74 run concurrently with I-26. The freeway leads north to Asheville and southeast to Spartanburg, South Carolina. Interstate 26 also provides direct access to the Asheville Regional Airport (AVL), which features scheduled passenger airline service operated by several major air carriers.

U.S. Route 64 (6th Avenue) also passes through the center of Hendersonville, leading northeast to Bat Cave and west to Brevard. U.S. Route 176 (Spartanburg Highway) leads southeast to Saluda.

<text>Laurel Park is a town in Henderson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,250 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The town of Laurel Park was settled on what had been Cherokee land in the late 1800s. Summer cottages and camps were construction in the areas surrounding Echo Mountain. By 1903, a rail line had been built up Fifth Avenue in Hendersonville to bring day-trippers and summer visitors to Rainbow Lake to enjoy swimming, boating, dancing, camping, and gambling at the Laurel Park Casino. Visitors to the casino included famous boxer Jack Dempsey. Later, another rail line and a canal connected Rainbow Lake with Laurel Lake (Rhododendron Lake), and a counter-balanced railway took sightseers from Crystal Spring (near Rainbow Lake) to an observation tower for views of downtown Hendersonville and near and distant mountains. 
In 1925, the town was formally incorporated. That same year, Commodore J. Perry Stolz, builder of the popular and expensive Miami Fleetwood Hotel in Florida, arrived in Hendersonville with plans to repeat his success at the top of Jump Off Mountain near Jump-Off Rock. This 15-story hotel, also to be called the Fleetwood, would have a brick exterior trimmed with marble, all the modern conveniences, and a radio station at the top. A new concrete road (named Laurel Park Highway) was built up the mountain to the hotel site; this was used for transporting construction materials. Less than a year later, financial problems led to a halt in construction. Despite numerous attempts to complete the hotel, the 13th floor was the last floor completed, and the hotel was razed in 1939 by a salvage company.

After the stock market crash, the town slowly transitioned from a summer recreational resort to a more residential community.

The Singletary-Reese-Robinson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

==Government==
The town of Laurel Park is organized under the Council-Manager form of government, consisting of a mayor elected to a four-year term, as well as four commissioners elected to staggered four-year terms. The Mayor is J. Carey O’Cain, first elected in 2011 after serving on the city commission.

In recent years, the town has been one of the areas of Henderson County trending the most to the Democratic Party. In 2016, the town gave 50% of its votes to Donald Trump, while in the 2020 Presidential Election it gave 55% of its votes to Joe Biden, a swing of 15%, one of the largest swings to the Democrats in Henderson County.

==Geography==
Laurel Park is located in central Henderson County on the eastern slopes of Jump off Mountain. It is bordered to the east by the city of Hendersonville, the county seat. To the south is the unincorporated community of Valley Hill, and to the west is the community of Horse Shoe.

U.S. Route 64 passes through the northern part of the town, in the valley of Shaw Creek. Route 64 leads east into Hendersonville and west to Etowah.

The town government maintains three parks: Jump Off Rock Park, Rhododendron Lake Nature Park, and Little Laurel Green Park. Additionally, several hiking trails run around the town.

<text>Ahoskie ( ) is a town in Hertford County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 4,891 at the 2020 census. Ahoskie is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Inner Banks region. Its nickname is &quot;The Only One&quot; because no other town in the world is known by the same name. The etymology of the word Ahoskie, which was originally spelled &quot;Ahotsky&quot;, was from the Wyanoke Indians, who entered the Hertford County area at the beginning of European settlement.

==History==
Ahoskie began as a railroad siding for log trains hauling timber from the forests of Bertie and Hertford counties to a sawmill at Tunis on the Chowan and Southern Railroad line beginning in 1885. The town grew out of a loading station and commissaries to supply the community workers who cut, hauled and loaded the logs. Ahoskie&#x27;s post office was established in 1889. The first passenger train passed through town on the newly opened tracks of the Norfolk and Carolina line in 1890.  

By the time of its incorporation on January 24, 1893, Ahoskie had grown to include several stores, a saw mill and gin, a one-room school and a Baptist church. Other industries that flourished in the town&#x27;s early days included an ice plant, a laundry operated by a wandering Chinese man, and a number of horse and mule exchanges and sales stables. Since few of the smaller towns in Hertford and Bertie counties were located on passenger lines, traveling salesman or &quot;drummers&quot; would use the town as a base to make sales trips to outlying community stores by horse and buggy.

The town&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of Ahoskie, was chartered in 1905.
&lt;br&gt;

This area&#x27;s economy was initially based on the cultivation of tobacco and cotton. It has continued to be largely rural with small towns.
The town has both historic districts and individual buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Ahoskie Historic District, Ahoskie Downtown Historic District, and East End Historic District; and Ahoskie School, Roberts H. Jernigan House, King-Casper-Ward-Bazemore House, William Mitchell House, Mulberry Grove, and James Newsome House. The town has highlighted these resources to encourage heritage tourism.

The county gave an acre of land on which the first Black school in Ahoskie was built, three years after the Civil War. The one-room schoolhouse at Hayes Street and Catherine Creek Road remained about 35 years. The first teacher at the school was Van Butler, and the school term was four months.

Through years of untiring efforts by the Black community, by 1939 the Ahoskie Graded School consisted of two brick buildings, with fourteen elementary teachers, five high school teachers and an enrollment of some 800 boys and girls.

The first Black church, the New Ahoskie Baptist Church, was organized in 1866. Other early churches in the Black community were the Methodist Church and Calvary Baptist Church.

The first charity organized in the Black community was Love and Charity, a mutual help group that met in members&#x27; homes under the slogan &quot;Love to All, True to each Other, Mercy to all Mankind.&quot; Other early organizations included the Elks, Masons and Tents. The United Order of the Queens of the Orient had its origins in Ahoskie in 1923.

By 1939, the town had grown to include a number of Black-owned businesses including five grocery stores, three barber shops, three cafes, a dry goods store, a millinery shop, three hairdressers, three seamstresses, a doctor, a stenographer, two funeral homes and a garage. The Atlantic District Fair Association represented the economic interests of the town&#x27;s Black community.

Perhaps the largest show seen in the town was a visit by Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show in October 1916, an event that drew an estimated 12,000 people and required three shows to accommodate everybody. The leading citizens of the town hosted a breakfast at the Manhattan hotel for Col. William F. Cody, who expressed his deep appreciation for the hospitality accorded to him. Cody&#x27;s visit came about through the personal solicitation of a kinsman of the show&#x27;s business manager.

Electric lights were first turned on in Ahoskie around Christmas in 1915. The power was generated by a gasoline engine and within two years was providing electricity day and night.

Ahoskie was the first stop in North Carolina for first lady Claudia Alta Johnson during her whistle-stop tour of the South aboard the Lady Bird Express, on October 6, 1964.

<doc id="127969" wikidata="Q830638" url="?curid=127969" title="Morphou">
<text>Morphou (; ) is a town in the northwestern part of Cyprus, under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Northern Cyprus. Having been a predominantly Greek Cypriot community before the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the town is now inhabited by Turkish Cypriots.

With a population of 18,000 people, the town is famous for its oranges, apples, vegetables, grapefruit and melons. A large proportion of the citrus fruits are exported and the remainder are turned into fruit juice and canned for local consumption and export. Morphou is also famous for its annual Orange Festival, which is a major event lasting two weeks.

==History==
Morphou was founded by Spartans who brought with them the worship of Aphrodite. In the Middle Ages, the city was referred to as Morphou but also Theomorphou. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Morphou hosted royal &quot;casalia&quot;, where the profitable cultivation of sugar took place with the encouragement of the kings of Cyprus. The Morphou area grew more than half of Cyprus citrus fruits. In 16th and 17th centuries, during Ottoman period, Morphou was famous for its export of linen.

Between 1907 and 1948, Morphou was one of the prominent stations of the Cyprus Government Railway.

In the wake of the intercommunal violence called &quot;Bloody Christmas&quot;, the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population fled the town in January 1964, though one-third remained. As a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, all of the Greek Cypriots of Morphou fled to the south of the island, and Morphou was inhabited by displaced Turkish Cypriots from the south. These people hailed from various villages in the Paphos district and the town of Paphos, though there were some who came from Limassol and the villages around it. This turned Morphou into a refugee town.

The agriculture in Morphou is expected to be boosted via the increase in irrigated farming by the help of the water pipe-line from Turkey.

===Population===

Before 1974, Morphou was an almost entirely Greek Cypriot community. According to the 1960 population census it was inhabited by 6480 Greek Cypriots, 123 Turkish Cypriots and 32 Maronites.

The population of Morphou increased slightly from 2006 to 2011. In 2019, State Planning Organization of Northern Cyprus recorded a population of 24,070 for Morphou. 

==Mahalle==
İsmet Paşa, Lala Mustafa Paşa and Piyale Paşa are quarters (&quot;mahalle&quot;) of Morphou.

==Education==
In 2005, a Turkish state university, Middle East Technical University, opened its Northern Cyprus campus in Morphou, after the invitation of the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot governments in 2000.

In 2016, another university called Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University was established as a private university in the center of Morphou (Güzelyurt) City.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Morphou is twinned with:
== Culture ==
The town is known for the annual Morphou Orange Festival, which has been organized by the municipality since 1977. The festival features local and Turkish singers and bands (the 2015 festival included many bands and singers including Model, Pinhani and SOS), modern and Latin dance shows, plays, fashion shows, traditional music and dance shows, sports competitions in several fields including football and darts and acrobatic shows. Along with the festival, the town annually hosts an Open Golf Tournament. 

The town is home to two museums: the Icon Museum at the St Mamas Church and the Morphou History of Natural History and Archaeology. The latter is home to several specimens of native species that lived in Cyprus in different periods, as well as antiquities from the Neolithic Age to the Byzantine period. The St Mamas Church still annually hosts a Greek Cypriot liturgy. Bandabuliya (the closed market) is an important commercial center and was built in the 1930s in the British colonial architecture.

The town is the home of Binatlı Yılmaz S.K., a football club that spent the 2014-15 season in the KTFF 1. Lig, the second highest division. They finished the season in the third place and achieved promotion into the Süper Lig. The town is also home to Baf Ülkü Yurdu S.K., which will play in the 1. Lig in the 2015-16 season.

The municipality also runs the Morphou City Theater, a theatrical group that regularly puts on performances. The Morphou Theater Days are organized annually with the participation of the City Theater and other theaters from Northern Cyprus and Turkey. The organization reached 5000 viewers in 2014.

==Church==
It contains one of the many churches in the country dedicated to St. Mamas, popularly believed to have lived as a hermit in a cave near Morphou. According to local legend, he was a hermit living in very poor circumstances and when the authorities tried to tax him, he evaded them. Soldiers were sent out and captured him but on the way back to town, he saw a lion attacking a lamb, escaped the soldiers, saved the lamb, jumped on the lion&#x27;s back and in that way came to town. His bravery earned him exemption from tax, hence his traditional attribute.

The church is now an icon museum.

==Notable people==

* Saint Philoumenos (Hasapis) of Jacob&#x27;s Well

==Climate==
Morphou has a borderline Mediterranean climate/semi-arid climate as the rest of the island where summers are hot and dry, and winters are cool and wet.

<text>Murfreesboro is a town in Hertford County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 2,835 at the 2010 census. The town is home to Chowan University.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.27%, are water.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,619 people, 1,081 households, and 552 families residing in the town.

==History==

===Before European settlement===
The first recorded inhabitants of the area were Native Americans from the Nottoway, Meherrin and Chowanoke tribes.

The first European known to visit the area was John White of the Roanoke Colony in the 16th century. It was also visited by an expedition from Jamestown, Virginia, in the 17th century.

The last native inhabitants, the Chowanoke, were expelled after warring with the English in 1675 and 1676. After that, they were moved to a reservation east of the Chowan River in what is now Gates County.

===Colonial era to the American Revolution===
The first known deed to property in the area is a land grant dated November 5, 1714, made to Henry Wheeler for a tract on the Meherrin River which included what is now Murfreesboro. Several other transactions quickly followed, and in 1735 Joseph Parker founded the Meherrin Church. It is the second-oldest Baptist church in North Carolina (now known as Meherrin Baptist Church).

On May 27, 1746, James Jordon Scott sold on the Meherrin River (part of Wheeler&#x27;s original grant) to an Irish immigrant, William Murfree from Nansemond County, Virginia. On December 12, 1754, the General Assembly designated Murfree&#x27;s Landing as a King&#x27;s Landing, where imports and exports would be inspected by a representative of the King.

===Revolution to the American Civil War===

On July 17, 1781, British forces led by Banastre Tarleton and the British Legion attacked Maney&#x27;s Neck near Murfree&#x27;s Landing. William Murfree&#x27;s son, Hardy Murfree, led a local militia that repulsed the attack at Skinner&#x27;s Bridge.

William Murfree contributed of land surrounding Murfree&#x27;s Landing in 1787 to the growing settlement to form a town. The town was chartered by the General Assembly and renamed Murfreesboro on January 6, 1787. This act also provided for the establishment of a public dock, as the town was located at the northernmost point of navigation on the Meherrin River.

Murfreesboro was designated by the US Congress in 1790 as an official port of entry, and the customs records indicate a profitable three-cornered trade with New England and the West Indies.

In 1809, the Hertford Academy was established in Murfreesboro, opening in 1811 for male students. In 1814, Harriet Sketchly and Martha Sketchly arrived and expanded the female department of the academy considerably. By 1849, it was renamed as the Chowan Baptist Female Institute, the forerunner of Chowan University.

In 1831 Murfreesboro was among towns that sent armed forces (these were led by Captain Solon Borland) to Southampton County, Virginia, to quell Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion. As a result of these events, Virginia and North Carolina reduced the rights of free blacks, prohibiting education of both free blacks and slaves.

==Education==
Riverview Elementary School and Hertford County Middle School, both of which are part of the Hertford County Public Schools system.

Chowan University, a small Baptist university, is located in Murfreesboro.

==Commerce==
Murfreesboro is no longer an active port. The last commercial vessel to operate on a regular basis was a Texaco Oil barge; it ceased service to the town in October 1966.

The town is served by the &quot;Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald&quot; newspaper, which is based in nearby Ahoskie.

==Attractions==
Numerous buildings of the town, mostly grand houses, are on the National Register of Historic Places: the David A. Barnes House, The Cedars, The Columns, Cowper-Thompson House, Freeman House, Melrose, Myrick House, Myrick-Yeates-Vaughan House, Francis Parker House, William Rea Store, Roberts-Vaughan House, and John Wheeler House. In addition, Princeton Site and the Murfreesboro Historic District are listed on the NRHP.

The John Wheeler House is identified as the birthplace of John Hill Wheeler, a planter and politician who served as Minister to Nicaragua and North Carolina State Treasurer. In 2013 it was established that Hannah Bond, a slave who escaped to the North and wrote &quot;The Bondwoman&#x27;s Narrative&quot; under the name of Hannah Crafts, had been held by him as a domestic servant. She escaped around 1857 from his plantation and wrote her manuscript on paper traced to his library. It was found in the early 21st century, authenticated and published for the first time in 2002 as the first known novel by an African-American woman.

The old Murfreesboro public school (which housed grades 1 - 12 until 1972) has been redeveloped as the Brady C. Jefcoat Museum. It houses the collections of Brady Jefcoat, a Raleigh native. It includes hundreds of well-preserved ordinary items from the late 19th and early 20th century, including functional phonographs, radios, washing machines, and agricultural implements, as well as a wide variety of other novelties.

<text>Winton is a town and the county seat of Hertford County, North Carolina, United States. It is governed by the Town Council which consists of a Mayor and five Council members. The population was 769 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area eventually comprising the town of Winton was proximate to a community of Meherrin people. The area was first named Cotton&#x27;s Ferry in homage to Alexander Cotton, a settler who operated a ferry in the 1740s. Hertford County was formed effective 1760. The county&#x27;s first session of court was held at Cotton&#x27;s Ferry. Benjamin Wynns, who had since acquired Cotton&#x27;s property, donated 150 acres to the county for the creation of a town in the mid-1760s. In 1766 the town of Winton—originally styled Wynnton after the erstwhile landowner—was established as Hertford&#x27;s seat of government and a courthouse was subsequently constructed. The original spelling of the name was used into the 1800s. The town&#x27;s economy in its early years relied primarily upon agriculture. In 1830 the original courthouse was burned.
During the American Civil War, North Carolina seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America. Federal forces intervened in eastern North Carolina early in the conflict, and in February 1862 they captured Roanoke Island, exposing territory along the Chowan River vulnerable to further penetration. Federal gunboats were subsequently dispatched up the river to destroy rail bridges north of Winton but were repulsed in an ambush by Confederate artillery. The following day federal troops under Colonel Rush C. Hawkins landed at Winton and found it deserted. Angered by the ambush and determined to deny Confederate troops the use of facilities, Hawkins ordered his troops to burn most of the buildings in town. As a result, the vast majority of structures in the town were destroyed, including the county courthouse.

After the war the town slowly rebuilt, with a new courthouse erected in 1870. The area economy continued to be based in agriculture, though the local lumber and fishing industries grew in importance in the latter portion of the 19th century. The town&#x27;s economy and population continued to grow in the following years. In 1924, Winton was connected south to Ahoskie by the Winton-Ahoskie Highway, and a steel highway bridge was built across the Chowan River at Winton in 1925, the first in the county to cross the river. While the town&#x27;s bank failed during the Great Depression, the local lumber, fishing, and shipping industries continued to be of importance into the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, the county government invested in the construction of new facilities, including the erection of a new courthouse in 1956.

The agricultural economy which underpinned the Winton region began to consolidate in the mid-20th century. In 1974, a bypass for U.S. Highway 13 was built diverting traffic around the community, leading to sharp decline in business in the town&#x27;s center. Overfishing and pollution led to the sharp decline of the fishing industry in the 1990s.

The earliest buildings in the Winton Historic District reflect the Italianate, Queen Anne, and Gothic Revival styles of the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The C. S. Brown School Auditorium, Gray Gables, and King Parker House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Raeford is a city in Hoke County, North Carolina, United States. Its population was 4,559 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Hoke County.

==History==

John McRae and A.A. Williford operated a turpentine distillery and general store, respectively. Each took a syllable from his name and came up with the name Raeford for the post office they established. The McRae family, who lived at the &quot;ford of the creek&quot;, was at one time made up primarily of old Highland Scot families. Likewise, the Upper Cape Fear Valley of North Carolina was, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the largest settlement of Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots in North America. Today, many of these old families continue to live in the area, though their presence is noticeably diminished by the great numbers of newcomers to the area as a result of Fort Bragg. Since World War II, many Lumbee Indian families have moved northward from Robeson County and now constitute a significant element of the population that is otherwise European and African American.

The Hoke County Courthouse and Raeford Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Ocracoke ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated town located at the southern end of Ocracoke Island, within Hyde County, North Carolina. The population was 948 at the 2010 census. In the 2020 census, the population had dropped to 797.

No bridges connect Ocracoke Island to the mainland, though the main road across the island is part of North Carolina Highway 12, which uses a series of ferries to connect to Hatteras Island, to Cedar Island, and to the mainland at Swan Quarter. The economy of the island is driven by tourism and commercial fishing. A unique dialect of English, known colloquially as the Hoi Toider accent, is spoken in Ocracoke, though among younger residents it is being replaced by more standard dialects of General American. Ocracoke Island was the location of the pirate Blackbeard&#x27;s death in November 1718. Though it saw no direct military action, Ocracoke was the site of a Confederate fort during the U.S. Civil War. During World War II, German submarines torpedoed several British ships off the coast of the island; the remains of four sailors washed ashore and occupy a small cemetery on the island. There is a yearly ceremony to honor the British dead presented by the British government, the National Park Service, and the United States Coast Guard.

Being so far out in the Atlantic Ocean, Ocracoke Island is frequently in the path of tropical cyclones, notably Hurricane Dorian in 2019, which destroyed approximately of pavement along NC 12.

==History==
In the 16th century, Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Indians called the Hatteras or Croatan
peoples. Okracoke was called Wococcon by the 16th century explorers, possibly a reference to an Indian settlement at the site. The Hatteras people disappeared by the mid 18th century. Some were victims of epidemics of Old World diseases. Others intermarried with white settlers. &quot;Yaupon tea&quot; or &quot;black drink&quot; was made from the dried leaves of the indigenous yaupon, a native holly, and was used ceremonially by the Indians in the area.

Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano described the area in detail in 1524. He was unable to navigate the shallow inlets leading into Pamlico Sound. In 1585, Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s ship the &quot;Tiger&quot; ran aground on a sand bar in Ocracoke Inlet and was forced to land on the island for repairs. English colonists attempted a settlement at Roanoke Island in the late 16th century, but it failed. This effectively halted European settlement in the area until 1663, when the Carolina Colony was chartered by King Charles II. However, remote Ocracoke Island was not permanently settled until 1750, being a pirate haven at times before then. It was a favorite anchorage of Edward Teach, better known as the pirate Blackbeard. He was killed on the island in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia on November 22, 1718. The grounds of what is now the Springer&#x27;s Point Nature Preserve were said to be his hideout.

The state assembly established Pilot Town in 1715. Throughout the mid-to-late 18th century, the island was home to a number of especially skilled schooner pilots who could get smaller ships through the inlet to Pamlico Sound. As population increased on the mainland, demand increased for shipment of goods from ocean-going vessels. Warehouses were built to hold goods off-loaded from larger ships offshore and then loaded onto smaller schooners to be delivered to plantations and towns along the mainland rivers.

By the late 19th century, the shipping business was gone, and the United States Life-Saving Service became a major source of steady income for local men. Fishing became more important to the livelihood of the area, including charters for tourists.

The Ocracoke Historic District, Ocracoke Light Station, and Salter-Battle Hunting and Fishing Lodge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Major hurricanes struck the island in August and September 1933, September 1944, and August 1949. The first-person accounts of these storms were recorded on the walls of the &quot;Hurricane House&quot;.

Ocracoke continues to suffer frequent storm damage, including the recent Hurricane Dorian in 2019, which destroyed approximately of pavement along NC 12. Afterwards, Ocracoke Island was closed to visitors for contractors to repair the road and dune line. Normal access was restored as of December 5, 2019.

===Fort Ocracoke===

Fort Ocracoke, a Confederate fortification constructed at the beginning of the American Civil War, was situated on Beacon Island in Ocracoke Inlet, two miles to the west-southwest of Ocracoke village. The octagon-shaped fort was built on a previous War of 1812 site. At one point nearly 500 Confederate troops were stationed in and around Ocracoke and the fort. The Confederates abandoned and partially destroyed the fort in August 1861 after Union victories on nearby Hatteras Island. Union forces razed it a month later on September 17, 1861. Beacon Island and the fort subsided beneath the waves of the inlet after the 1933 hurricanes that struck the area. The remnants of Fort Ocracoke were relocated and identified in 1998 by the Surface Interval Diving Company.
=== Energy modernization project ===
In May 2021, Ocracoke was one of 11 communities (along with nearby Nags Head, North Carolina) chosen by the United States Department of Energy to participate in the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project, a program to provide federal aid for remote communities to modernize their electric infrastructure and resiliency through natural disasters and outages. Ocracoke&#x27;s grant is used to analyze the possibility of electrifying its ferry fleet. An electrified ferry fleet would increase hurricane evacuation access while decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.

==Geography==

The island of Ocracoke is a part of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. At various times throughout recorded history the barrier island now known as Ocracoke has been part of Hatteras Island. The &quot;Old Hatteras Inlet&quot; opened prior to 1657 south of the current inlet separating Ocracoke from Hatteras, but closed around 1764 causing the islands to be reconnected. Ocracoke remained connected to Hatteras until Wells Creek Inlet opened in the 1840s and later closed. The modern &quot;Hatteras Inlet&quot; that separates the two islands was formed on September 7, 1846 by a violent gale. This massive storm, known in Cuba as 1846 Havana hurricane and along the East Coast of the United States as the Great Gale of 1846, was the same storm that opened Oregon Inlet.

It is one of the most remote islands in the Outer Banks, as it can only be reached by one of three public ferries (two of which are toll ferries), private boat, or private plane. Other than the village of Ocracoke and a few other areas (a ferry terminal, a pony pen, a small runway), the entire island is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
The village of Ocracoke is located around a small sheltered harbor called Silver Lake, with a second smaller residential area built around a series of man-made canals called Oyster Creek. The village is located at the widest point of the island, protected from the Atlantic Ocean by sand dunes and a salt marsh. The average height of the island is less than above sea level, and many of the buildings on the island are built on pilings to lift them off the ground. Flooding is a risk during both hurricanes and large storms. Ocracoke Light is situated near Silver Lake and has remained in continuous operation since 1823.
The island is home to a British cemetery. During World War II, German submarines sank several British ships, including , and the bodies of British sailors were washed ashore. They were buried in a cemetery on the island. A lease for the plot, where a British flag flies at all times, was given to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for as long as the land remained a cemetery, and the small site officially became a British cemetery. The United States Coast Guard station on Ocracoke Island takes care of the property. A memorial ceremony is held each year in May.

Ocracoke village is located at (35.112687, -75.975895). The United States Census Bureau counts the entire island as a census-designated place (CDP), with a total area of , of which , or 89.58%, of the area is land, and , or 10.58%, is water.

==Climate==
Ocracoke has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with hot, humid summers and cool, windy winters. Precipitation is plentiful year round and peaks during the months of August and September. The record high and low are and and occurred, respectively, on the dates August 18 and 22, 1975 and February 20, 2015. The highest minimum temperature recorded was and occurred on July 2, 1973. The lowest maximum temperature recorded was and occurred on February 20, 2015. The highest daily snowfall recorded was and happened on January 24, 2003. The highest daily snow depth also occurred on January 24, 2003 and was nine inches, with the snow sticking on the ground for five days in total. The first and last average dates for a freeze are December 21 and March 3, giving Ocracoke an average growing season of 293 days. The average first and last dates for a hot temperature are May 9 and October 16. The water temperature averages in August to in February, and usually is never above or below , though due to the island&#x27;s proximity to Cape Hatteras, where the warm Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador Current meet, water temperatures commonly fluctuate year round. The ocean is usually comfortable for swimming from late May into early October.

==Transportation and public services==
A single paved two-lane road, NC 12, runs from the village at the southwestern end of the island to the ferry dock at the northeastern tip of the island, where a one-hour-long free ferry connects to Hatteras Island. The second ferry dock, located in the village, has toll connections to Swan Quarter, on the mainland and Cedar Island, near Atlantic. A passenger ferry operates across Ocracoke Inlet to the deserted village of Portsmouth, at the northern end of the Core Banks.

Ocracoke Island Airport (FAA Identifier W95) is located slightly southeast of the village, allowing small aircraft to land.

Being so far out in the Atlantic Ocean, Ocracoke Island is frequently in the path of tropical cyclones, notably Hurricane Dorian in 2019, which destroyed approximately of pavement along NC 12. This is possibly a consideration against building a bridge to this island.

The lengthy travel time between Ocracoke and other portions of Hyde County meant that, according to David S. Cecelski, author of &quot;Along Freedom Road: Hyde County, North Carolina, and the Fate of Black Schools in the South&quot;, that &quot;Ocracokers have had little interaction with the rest of Hyde County&quot;.

Hyde County maintains the Ocracoke Volunteer Fire Department located on Highway 12.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
The economy of Ocracoke Island is based almost entirely on tourism. During the winter, the population shrinks and only a few businesses remain open. During the spring, summer, and early fall, an influx of tourists occupies hotels, campgrounds and weekly rental houses—and day visitors arrive by ferry from Hatteras Island. Several bars, a brewery, dozens of restaurants, and many shops, stores and other tourist-based businesses open for the tourist season. Visitors can find many shops that feature local, handmade goods, as well as imported artisanal goods and rare antiques, unusual for such a small island.

===Fishing===

Commercial fishing contributes to the local economy with chartered sport fishing drawing tourism. With easy access to Pamlico Sound, the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Stream, Ocracoke offers various fishing opportunities, from small Sound fish to tuna and drum.

===Winter economy===
During the winter, the island&#x27;s only main employers are construction, the NC Department of Transportation, and the businesses that support the small population. Many islanders use the winter as time off, since they tend to work between 60 and 80 hours a week during the tourist season.

==Local dialect==
Ocracoke Island and other parts of the Outer Banks historically have a distinct dialect of English, often referred to as a brogue. The dialect is known as the High Tider dialect, after the characteristic phrase &quot;high tide&quot; (often pronounced &quot;hoi toide&quot;). Due to the influx of tourists and greater contact with the mainland in recent years, however, the brogue has been increasingly influenced by outside dialects.

<text>Love Valley is a town in Iredell County, North Carolina, United States. It also extends into Alexander County on its western end. The population was 90 at the 2010 census, and in 2020 the estimated population was 154.

== History ==
Love Valley is a small town located in a remote valley in the Brushy Mountains of northwestern North Carolina. Its creation in 1954 marked the fulfillment of a dream for founder Andy Barker. Barker developed two visions as a young man—he wanted to build a Christian community, and he wanted to be a cowboy. In 1954 he combined those visions to create an Old West-style village in the hills of northwestern Iredell County. The town was incorporated on April 2, 1963.

Modeled after the Old West towns seen in countless Hollywood films, Love Valley boasts a saloon, general store, hitching posts, and rodeos. Automobiles are not allowed inside the town limits; people still use horses and horse-drawn vehicles to travel in the town. A small, nondenominational Christian church sits on a hill overlooking the town, thus emphasizing Barker&#x27;s vision of a Christian utopia. The town garnered its share of controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, including around the &quot;Love Valley Rock Festival&quot;, which local farmers complained brought drug addicts and other &quot;troublemakers&quot; to the area. However, over the last two decades the town has settled down considerably and is now known as a popular gathering spot for horse-lovers and horseback riding. There are miles of horseback riding trails in the surrounding Brushy Mountains.

<doc id="127985" wikidata="Q2027955" url="?curid=127985" title="Mooresville, North Carolina">
<text>Mooresville is a town located in the southwestern section of Iredell County, North Carolina, United States, and is a part of the fast-growing Charlotte metropolitan area. The population was 50,193 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous municipality in Iredell County. It is located approximately north of Charlotte.

Mooresville is best known as the home of many NASCAR racing teams and drivers, along with an IndyCar team and its drivers, as well as racing technology suppliers, which has earned the town the nickname &quot;Race City USA&quot;. Also located in Mooresville is the corporate headquarters of Lowe&#x27;s Corporation and Universal Technical Institute&#x27;s NASCAR Technical Institute.

==History==
The area that would develop into the town of Mooresville was originally settled by English, German, and Scots-Irish families who moved into the area from nearby Rowan County, as well as from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Many were seeking new lands on which to establish farms. Many of the early families such as the Wilsons, Davidsons, Cowans, Sherrills, Torrances, and others came to the area as early as the mid-1700s. They formed small communities that eventually grew into the community known as &quot;Deep Well&quot;, which took its name from a large natural well that was found in the area.

Many of these families established large farms, primarily of cotton, which grew into small plantations by the 1850s. Major Rufus Reid was the most prominent planter in the area, enslaving 81 African Americans on over of land. His property was known as Mount Mourne Plantation, named after the Mourne Mountains of County Down in Northern Ireland. Several other historic plantation homes are set in the area as well, including the Johnson-Neel House, the Cornelius House, Forest Dell Plantation, and the colonial era Belmont Plantation.

In 1856, a railroad was placed on a ridge that crossed the land of a local farmer by the name of John Franklin Moore. A small-scale planter, Moore set up a depot on his land, and encouraged others to help establish a small village on the location in the late 1850s. The little village, known as &quot;Moore&#x27;s Siding&quot;, was born. The Civil War hampered developments, with the railroad tracks being removed to aid the Confederate efforts in Virginia. After the war, the tracks were returned, and Moore&#x27;s Siding slowly began to prosper.

Shortly after the Civil War, John Franklin Moore saw the need for the village to incorporate into a town. The town was incorporated as Mooresville in 1873. Moore helped to establish the first brick factory in Mooresville, and built some of the first brick buildings on Main Street. He died in 1877, and his wife, Rachel Summrow Moore, continued the development of the town.

In 1883 the railroad lines were run back through the town with the addition of a new depot. The railroad brought growth to the town, which continued with the addition of the first water plant in the early 1890s, the establishment of a library in 1899, a phone company in 1893 and the first of many textile mills in 1900.

In 1938, artist Alicia Weincek painted the mural &quot;North Carolina Cotton Industry&quot; in the town&#x27;s post office, having won a WPA competition for the commissioned work. 
The Mooresville Moors were a minor league baseball team who played in the Class D North Carolina State League from 1937 to 1942. The league ceased operations for two seasons due to World War II but was reorganized in 1945.

Selma Burke, a prominent sculptor during the Harlem Renaissance who was born and raised in Mooresville, created the bust of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Four Freedoms plaque on the Recorder of Deeds building in Washington, D.C. The bust would later be used for the image on the United States dime.

On December 11, 2014, Duke Energy, to repair a rusted, leaking pipe, received approval from North Carolina to dump coal ash (containing arsenic, lead, thallium and mercury, among other heavy metals) from the Marshall Steam Station west of Mooresville into Lake Norman.

On October 3, 2015, Duke reported that a sinkhole had formed at the base of the Marshall Steam Station dam on Lake Norman. The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) says Duke placed a liner in the hole and filled it with crushed stone.

==Geography==

<text>Statesville is a city in and county seat of Iredell County, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the Charlotte metropolitan area. Statesville was established in 1789 by an act of the North Carolina Legislature. The population was 28,419 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
In 1753, Scots-Irish Presbyterians and German Lutherans, who had originally settled in Pennsylvania, began arriving in what would become Statesville in 1789 to plant crops in the fertile soil where game and water were also plentiful. The settlement, known as Fourth Creek Congregation, was named for the freshwater stream running to the north of the present-day city center, the fourth creek west of the neighboring settlement of Salisbury. The center of the settlement was a log cabin where the Presbyterians worshiped and where the First Presbyterian Church is located today.


In 1755, colonial governor Arthur Dobbs authorized the construction of the colony&#x27;s frontier fort, which was located approximately due north of the Fourth Creek settlement. Built and garrisoned by North Carolina provincial soldiers, Fort Dobbs defended British North America&#x27;s western frontier in the colony of North Carolina during the French and Indian War and Anglo-Cherokee War. Fort Dobbs combined the functions of a military barracks, fortification, refuge for settlers, provisioning depot and center for negotiations with Native Americans.

The state legislature divided Rowan County in 1788, and the new county was named &quot;Iredell&quot; for James Iredell, associate justice of the first Supreme Court during the presidency of George Washington.

One year later, the legislature selected a spot for the county seat. The Fourth Creek Congregation was chosen, and the settlement became known as &quot;Statesville&quot;. The 1800 US Census lists the town as &quot;States Ville&quot;, which was later combined as &quot;Statesville&quot;. In 1800, there were 95 inhabitants in &quot;States Ville&quot;, including 68 free white persons and 27 slaves.
As early as 1833, Statesville&#x27;s leaders began laying track for railroads to connect the Piedmont area of North Carolina with the rest of the country.

By 1858, Statesville was growing rapidly and soon afterward began leading the state in the production of tobacco and tobacco products, the manufacture and blending of whiskey, and became a large distribution center for roots and herbs.

On August 27, 1891, a passenger train derailed on the Bostian Bridge, a bridge, and seven cars fell down. About 30 people died in the accident.

<doc id="127988" wikidata="Q2023245" url="?curid=127988" title="Cashiers, North Carolina">
<text>Cashiers ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated village located in southern Jackson County, North Carolina, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the community had a total population of 657, up from 157 at the 2010 census. Cashiers is pronounced KASH-erz locally, and is one of several communities in the area popular with tourists and owners of vacation homes.

The village is at the crossroads of U.S. Route 64 (US 64) and North Carolina Highway 107 (NC 107), which connects to Highlands, Rosman, Sylva, and Walhalla.

==History==
The establishment of Cashiers began with two men: Barak Norton, the first white settler in Whiteside Cove and Colonel John Zachary, who with his talented sons was responsible for the area&#x27;s economic and civic development. Barak Norton came to the area around 1820 and the land he claimed in the area, including a gold mine eventually became Cashiers&#x27; main business district. Colonel John Zachary arrived in the area in 1833 and by 1836 received a state land grant, plus two land grants adjoining the . The Zachary family set up several businesses including a general store and sawmill; they provided trade skills including brick mason, hatter, and carpenter.

Several stories exist as to the derivation of the name Cashiers including a racehorse, steer, or mule named Cash or a hermit living in the area with the name. However, it has been concluded that the Zachary Family came up with the name related to their accounting work for individual gold miners in the area, being the &quot;cashier&quot;. In 1839, Jonathan Zachary, the youngest son of the family, applied to become the first postmaster for, what he called, &quot;Cashiers Valley;&quot; it was changed to Cashiers in 1881.

In 1851, the first Post Office was established. In 1855, the Zachary Family sold land to Wade Hampton II, in what later became the High Hampton Inn. In 1927, Cashiers received a town charter from the state, but has since become inactive with no acting government body. In 2003, the North Carolina General Assembly passed local legislation allowing Cashiers to re-incorporate, but this was turned down by a vote of 161 to 302 in a local referendum on August 12. The Jackson County government set up a special zoning council for Cashiers in response; operated by the county, it covers what would normally be done by a municipality.

Five properties near Cashiers are listed on the National Register of Historic Places—Camp Merrie-Woode, the Church of the Good Shepherd, Fairfield Inn, the High Hampton Inn Historic District, and the Mordecai Zachary House.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , all land.

Visitors and vacation home owners from all over the southeast enjoy hiking, mountain biking, golf, and fly fishing during the warm months of the year.

The United States Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy have worked to protect several natural areas near Cashiers, including the biologically diverse Panthertown Valley, Whitewater Falls, and the Tuckaseegee River Gorge. The Chattooga River also rises near Cashiers.

<doc id="127989" wikidata="Q2008768" url="?curid=127989" title="Cullowhee, North Carolina">
<text>Cullowhee () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jackson County, North Carolina, United States. It is located on the Tuckasegee River, and the permanent population was 7,682 at the 2020 census up from 6,228 at the 2010 census.

The community is the home of Western Carolina University, part of the University of North Carolina System. Developing from a high school and normal school, it has 12,000 students and has become a strong influence in community life. The Jackson County Airport is located just outside the CDP limits.

The present community developed at the site of a historic Cherokee town, which was centered around the earthwork Cullowhee Mound. The name was long thought to mean &quot;Valley of the Lilies.&quot; In fact, it is derived from the Cherokee phrase &quot;joolth-cullah-wee&quot;, which translates as &quot;Judacullah&#x27;s Place.&quot; Judacullah, a giant warrior and hunter who the Cherokee believe lived in the area, is an important figure in their religion and culture.

==Geography==
Cullowhee is located in central Jackson County in the valley of the Tuckasegee River. North Carolina Highway 107 runs through the community, leading north to Sylva, the Jackson county seat, and southeast to Tuckasegee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Cullowhee CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Cullowhee typically has a rather mild winter season. In the summer, high temperatures can reach into the 90s Fahrenheit (32-plus degrees Celsius).

==History==
Developed along a mountain river valley and by a creek, Cullowhee was known as a historic Cherokee village centered around an earthwork platform mound estimated to have been built by 1000 CE by people of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture. Archeological evidence from excavations at Cullowhee Mound suggests that this area had been occupied since 3000 BCE by cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee developed a style of public architecture characterized by building large town houses, or council houses, on top of the mounds. This was the center place for the community to gather, and the town elders to meet in council. It expressed the consensus nature of their society.

The Cherokee were forced to cede their land in this area in the early nineteenth century. When European-American settlers moved in, they occupied the site of the former Cherokee village. Cullowhee became one of the first European-American settlements in Jackson County. Residents reportedly founded the first school in the area, a one-room school in 1830. They developed the floodplain area for agriculture. The settlers cleared more land during the 1800s than the Cherokee had cultivated.

In 1883, Roland A. Painter founded Painter Post Office, located in his store on the Old Cullowhee Road. Other businesses clustered there. The post office was renamed as &quot;Cullowhee&quot; in 1908, taking over from another post office in the vicinity of nearby Forest Hills.
In 1889, Cullowhee High School was founded by Robert Lee Madison. It eventually developed as a normal school for teacher training. Later its offerings were expanded into a four-year college curriculum, and ultimately graduate departments supporting today&#x27;s Western Carolina University.

The institution ceased to be named a high school in 1923. A new brick building was opened serving grades 1–11. In 1940, a massive flood caused severe damage to the business district, destroying almost all the buildings on the north side of the river. The buildings on the south side survived, though waterlogged. The flood crested at above Cullowhee Dam, the highest on record.

Since then, dams have been built for flood control on the East and West forks of the Tuckasegee River. When the area rebuilt, buildings were developed on the higher ground around Old Cullowhee Road, and the area closer to the river floodplain was abandoned. The mid-century buildings have since become outdated, particularly compared to newer developments.

Businesses in the Old Cullowhee Road area declined in the late 20th century after it was bypassed by the relocation of highway N.C. 107 in the late 1970s to early 1980s. But, since the 1960s, the development of Western Carolina University has stimulated growth around its large campus. In the 21st century, the university has 12,000 students, and offers a variety of related sports and cultural programs. Cullowhee has also been a destination for retirees and people with second homes, resulting in new residential construction.

The university has proposed a new Town Center to incorporate some of its land. (See &quot;Plans&quot; below). Businessmen are also collaborating on revitalization of Old Cullowhee Road, and many new homes are being built or planned for the area.

As noted, the town has had a public school since 1923, which has been in four buildings. It has always been associated with teacher training at the college (and now university). It was established as Cullowhee Training School, serving until 1939. It was replaced by the McKee Training School, which served until 1964. Both of these buildings were located on what is now the university campus. From 1964 to 1994, the public school was known as Cordelia Camp Laboratory School, still associated with educational programs at the university. The Cullowhee Valley School is the latest structure holding the school, which now serves grades K-8. Students go to Sylva for high school.

The oldest surviving European-American structure in the area is St. David&#x27;s in the Valley church, which was built in 1880. The Joyner Building and Judaculla Rock are each listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A Walton Family Foundation report ranked the Cullowhee micropolitan area (Jackson County) as number 13 in the United States. Reasons included the area&#x27;s status as a tourist destination and &quot; superior job growth, wage increases and young businesses.&quot;

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 5.9% under the age of 18, 72.8% from 18 to 24, 11.0% from 25 to 44, 7.0% from 45 to 64, and 3.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 21 years. Both the overall age distribution and the median age are driven by the presence of Western Carolina University. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.4 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $19,688, and the median income for a family was $36,538. Males had a median income of $26,161 versus $16,607 for females.

About 25.2% of families and 41.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 37.3% of those under age 18 and 9.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Western Carolina University is a constituent campus of the University of North Carolina system. WCU is the fifth-oldest institution in the UNC system. It was founded in 1889 with a few hundred students in a small, one-story wood building. In the 21st century, it has more than 12,000 students, offering approximately 220 majors and concentrations for undergraduates, and more than 45 graduate-level programs of study. The campus covers approximately and takes up much of the Cullowhee Valley.

It has created a Cherokee Studies program, including language immersion study, in collaboration with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribe in the state. It is based in Cherokee, North Carolina, at Qualla Boundary. WCU faculty have also worked with EBCI representatives on surveys of historic town and earthwork mound sites, to create a database of known resources; archeological and anthropological studies conducted with outreach to the Cherokee people to gain their perspective from tribal oral histories, and other programs. More than 50 platform mound sites have been identified in the eleven westernmost counties of North Carolina.

The public K thru 8 school, Cullowhee Valley School, opened in 1994. It replaced a 30-year-old structure on the University&#x27;s Campus. Since 1988, when the town&#x27;s high school closed, students of high school age attend Smoky Mountain High School in nearby Sylva.

==Plans==
Forest Hills, an incorporated village just south of Cullowhee, is considering a WCU plan to incorporate as the town/city of Cullowhee, annexing areas along Old Cullowhee Road and NC 107. The university plan proposes development around Old Cullowhee Road to create a traditional downtown, with mixed-use buildings, a city hall, homes, walkable neighborhoods, supermarket, and trails/parks along the river and throughout the area. The elementary school could be relocated here, as well as the Post Office and other town/city functions. A &quot;town center&quot; to be constructed on some owned by WCU is an area targeted for annexation and development.

The plan is controversial, as it may attract business away from Old Cullowhee Road and would be intended to attract chain stores and businesses, rather than local small businesses. The &quot;town center&quot; is proposed to accommodate as much as of commercial, housing and multi-tenant office space, with parking for 871 vehicles. A 320-space parking garage is proposed on 22 acres of land owned by the university. The land is now the site of the Cordelia Camp Outreach Center (former Cordelia Camp Laboratory School, built in 1964), intramural fields, and several parking lots. The annexation will also include the area that is the business district on Old Cullowhee Road (S.R. 1002) near the old campus entrance.

An alternative vision for redevelopment is offered by the Cullowhee Revitalization Endeavor (CuRvE), made up of local businessmen and activists who also want to rejuvenate the once-thriving commerce center. CuRvE wants to make Cullowhee &quot;a unique and highly attractive area—a mix of residences and businesses along rivers and streams&quot;. According to CuRvE, its vision has more community support than that the Western Carolina University &quot;town center&quot;, because it would allow small businesses. In addition, it would make use of the setting of Old Cullowhee Road along a mountain river.

<text>Dillsboro is a town in Jackson County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 213 at the 2020 census down from 232 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Dillsboro was founded when the Murphy Branch Railroad came to the area in the 1880s. In 1882, the first post office in the area opened. Called the Tunnel Post Office, it was named after the nearby Cowee Tunnel. In 1882, the postmaster, William Allen Dills, built a large home on a hill overlooking the Tuckasegee River, later the home of Charles Joseph Harris and now The Riverwood Shops. The unincorporated village was called Depot, New Webster, and Webster Station until the state legislature had its name officially changed to Dillsboro when the village was incorporated as a town in 1889 to honor William Allen Dills, the town&#x27;s founder (another source names George W. Dill, an early settler.) Railroad executive Alexander Boyd Andrews suggested the town be named Dillsboro.

One of the oldest buildings in the town dates to the 1870s, before the town was officially founded. As of 2024, it serves as a barber shop. The building is one floor and was built on Front Street when the town was largely farmland. Around 1884, the historic Jarrett House hotel was constructed by Dills. In a relatively short time period, Dillsboro became a thriving town; by 1888, it was the most important town on the Murphy Branch of the Southern Railway in the areas of Industry, with two sawmills, two clay mines, a locust pin company, a corundum crushing plant, a chestnut pole yard, a chestnut corkwood yard, two livery stables, six general stores, a large hotel, and a shoemaker.

A rivalry existed between Sylva and Dillsboro in their early days, as the efforts of one town were matched by the other, and the two towns were very much alike, and the same distance from the then-county seat of Webster. But a flood in 1894 ended the milling operations of the Blue Ridge Lumber Company, and near the turn of the century, two back-to-back floods at a tannery construction site in Dillsboro caused owner C.J. Harris to move the factory to the present site of the Jackson Paper Plant in Sylva. Around 1899, Dillsboro was the most-populated non-county seat town in the state west of Asheville with about 750 residents.

Dillsboro&#x27;s population has declined over the years, mostly due to little new housing being built in town limits and the fact that many homes are now shops in the downtown area. Since 1975, when Wade W. Wilson became mayor due to many write-in votes, Dillsboro has made a successful effort to restore many older buildings in the town to their original appearance.

In 2012, the Dillsboro Dam and Powerhouse were demolished to restore the Tuckasegee River&#x27;s ecosystem. Downtown Dillsboro was partially flooded in 2024 during Hurricane Helene.

The Jarrett House and Elias Brendle Monteith House and Outbuildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Gertrude Dills McKee, first woman elected to the North Carolina State Senate, was a native of Dillsboro; she was the daughter of William Allen Dills.

==History==

The area now known as Forest Hills was named for the late 19th-century home of David D. Davies; it was once part of the large estate that he acquired in 1855, buying . His property made up the territory of what is now a large part of the village.

Forest Hill was a large Victorian mansion built with a commanding view of the Cullowhee Valley. Later, the area became known as the Cox Farm, for a later owner. The mansion of Forest Hill was demolished in the 1980s, soon after developers began to construct housing here for the neighborhood to be known as Forest Hills.

Formerly, the Forest Hills Country Club occupied a large swath of land in the village, but this property is now mostly blighted and vacant. A motor lodge was built just above the middle of the golf course. This facility also rents some apartments to students.

<text>Sylva is an incorporated town located in central Jackson County, in the Plott Balsam Mountains of Western North Carolina, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 2,588. It is the county seat, taking over the role from nearby Webster in 1913.

==Etymology==

According to popular accounts, Sylva is named after William D. Sylva, a Danish handyman who spent a month in the home of General E. R. Hampton, who owned much of the land later developed as downtown Sylva. When the town applied for a post office, Hampton asked his young daughter Mae what the town&#x27;s name should be. She liked the handyman so much she said, &quot;Sylva.&quot; This account is disputed: according to a 21st-century investigation, the handyman William D. Sylva was not Danish, and it is likely that his surname was not Sylva. His last name was &quot;Selvey;&quot; the letter that he wrote to the town was likely in Portuguese, not Danish; and he was probably from the Little Canada Community. His daughter&#x27;s maiden last name was Selvey according to genealogical archives. Her daughter (who recently came to the town) said that her grandfather&#x27;s surname was &quot;Selvey&quot; instead.

==History==

The town became the county seat in 1913 after the county voted to move the seat from Webster to Sylva, which gained a railroad station. Subsequently, Webster declined, as the railroad had not established a stop in that town. Many businesses followed the court and railroad to Sylva. The Jackson County Courthouse was constructed in 1914 and is located on a hill at the end of Main Street in downtown Sylva. The building no longer serves as the official courthouse; the Justice Center was constructed in 1994 a few blocks away. Since 2011, the Jackson County Courthouse has been the site of the Jackson County Public Library.

Sylva was once home to Dills Falls (also called Bumgarner Falls and Dills Cove Falls), which was partially destroyed in the early 1970s to build the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway and exists only as a remnant today. Many Sylva residents claim this made Sylva the only town in the US to have a waterfall within its town limits. (This waterfall is not to be confused with Dill Falls, also in Jackson County, NC.) 

The town had the first municipally owned swimming pool west of Asheville. The stone and concrete pool was built in 1938 by the WPA during the Great Depression; it was demolished in 1969 to be replaced by the current pool. Thomas Edison and Franklin D. Roosevelt both traveled through Sylva: Edison in 1911 and FDR in 1936 during his presidency.

The Downtown Sylva Historic District, Dr. D. D. Hooper House, and Jackson County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Sylva is close to the Cherokee Indian Reservation (the Eastern band) and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, both of which are popular, well-known vacation spots.

==History==

Webster was founded in 1851 in order to serve as the county seat of Jackson County. A massive fire and the railroad&#x27;s failure to come to the town caused the larger and more powerful railroading center of Sylva to take over the position of county seat. Webster once had a courthouse and many shops, but few of the buildings that hint at its vibrant past as a thriving county seat survive.

Several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places are within the town. The Lucius Coleman Hall House, the Elisha Calor Hedden House, the Walter E. Moore House, and the old Webster Rock Schoolhouse, built by the Works Progress Administration in 1936, were all listed in 1990. The Webster Baptist Church, built in 1900, and the Webster Methodist Church, next to the old school and built around the same time, were listed in 1989; the former is across the Tuckasegee River outside the town limits but still considered to be in Webster.

<text>Benson is a town in Johnston County, North Carolina, United States, near the intersection of Interstates 95 and 40. Benson celebrates Mule Days on the fourth Saturday of September, a festival that attracts over 60,000 people each year. At the 2020 census, the population was 3,967.

==History==
The town of Benson, which derives its name from early settler Alfred Monroe (&quot;Mim&quot;) Benson, owes much of its historical development to the railroad line which passed through the present location in town in 1886 on its route between Fayetteville and Contentnea. More information on the history of Benson and the surrounding communities may be found at the new Benson Museum of Local History located at 102 W. Main Street, next to the Mary Duncan Library.

Mr. Benson&#x27;s purchase of a tract along the Smithfield-Fayetteville Road in 1874 initiated the settlement of the area now known as Benson. During the 1880s Benson sold portions of his original tract to incoming settlers, many of whom were farmers. Benson was incorporated in 1887 and soon attracted a number of entrepreneurs wishing to take advantage of this new town along an important transportation route.

A prominent early resident of the Benson area was John William Wood Sr. (December 28, 1855 - October 31, 1928) who rode to Benson each morning on a mule and wagon from his home at Peacocks Crossroads near Meadow. After having served on the Board of Education and as a county commissioner, where he was known to be a watchdog of the treasury, he was elected to a term in the State House of Representatives in 1927. Meadow School was built on land donated by him.

The Benson Historic District and Hannah&#x27;s Creek Primitive Baptist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Benson is home to Alpha Company 230th BSB, who were deployed in 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The mayor Jerry Medlin died on at the age of 87 after revealing that he had cancer.

==History==
In 1963, Floyd G. Hinnant, Postmaster of Pine Level, wrote down his history of Pine Level:
In the days of slow transportation this little town, the third oldest in Johnston County, was a trading center for the pioneer turpentine prospectors and merchants who were obligated to feed the workers who followed those who were setting up turpentine distilleries. In 1868 two brothers, Daniel Thomas Oliver and William Berry Oliver migrated from Robinson County in the interest of turpentine, setting up a distillery. Finding the natural setting of pine trees applicable to their need and in a fairly level country, the town found its name, Pine Level.

Some records say Gaston Britt and Bryant Hinnant were merchants at the time the Oliver boys landed. They, too, built two separate stores with supplies for the workers. The D. T. Oliver Store is no longer doing business but the original building is still standing and is used as a workshop by a great grandson. The William Berry Store was purchased by the only surviving son, the late D. B. Oliver, in 1900 and is still in operation by his four sons. The Southern Railroad running through the pine tree growth enabled the turpentine dealers to dispose of the turpentine by the railroad placing a train stop in town. Then a place for a post office was arranged with Mr. Thomas Hinnant being the first recorded post master in 1886. Happy were the people when the Post Office Dept. in Washington, D. C. gave the south the free mail delivery service. Pine Level has an up-to-date post office with efficient service rendered.

During the early nineteen hundreds many more settlers moved into our little town and at this time we have one of the most progressive rural sections in the state. Pine Level has a population of nearly 1,000. It has a bank, oil mill, modern cotton gin, mercantile businesses which service the farmers of a large area, five churches, two civic clubs, a veteran&#x27;s organization and a fine volunteer fire department. Work is now progressing on a modern water system to keep pace with the rapidly growing town.
