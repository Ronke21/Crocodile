<text>Waco ( ) is a city in and the county seat of McLennan County, Texas, United States. It is situated along the Brazos River and I-35, halfway between Dallas and Austin. The city had a U.S. census estimated 2023 population of 144,816, making it the 24th-most populous city in the state. The Waco metropolitan statistical area consists of McLennan, Falls and Bosque counties, which had a 2020 population of 295,782. Bosque County was added to the Waco MSA in 2023. The 2023 U.S. census population estimate for the Waco metropolitan area was 304,865 residents.

==History==
===1824–1865===
Indigenous peoples occupied areas along the river for thousands of years. In historic times, the area of present-day Waco was occupied by the Wichita Indian tribe known as the &quot;Waco&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Hueco&quot; or &quot;Huaco&quot;).

In 1824, Thomas M. Duke was sent to explore the area after violence erupted between the Waco people and the European settlers.
His report to Stephen F. Austin, described the Waco village:
After further violence, Austin halted an attempt to destroy their village in retaliation. In 1825, he made a treaty with them.
The Waco were eventually pushed out of the region, settling north near present-day Fort Worth. In 1872, they were moved onto a reservation in Oklahoma with other Wichita tribes. In 1902, the Waco received allotments of land and became official US citizens.
Neil McLennan settled in an area near the South Bosque River in 1838. Jacob De Cordova bought McLennan&#x27;s property and hired a former Texas Ranger and surveyor named George B. Erath to inspect the area. In 1849, Erath designed the first block of the city. Property owners wanted to name the city Lamartine, but Erath convinced them to name the area Waco Village, after the Indians who had lived there. In March 1849, Shapley Prince Ross, the father of future Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross, built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin, on a bluff overlooking the springs. His daughter Kate was the first settler child born in Waco. Because of this, Ross is considered to have been the founder of Waco, Texas.

===1866–1900===

In 1866, Waco&#x27;s leading citizens embarked on an ambitious project to build the first bridge to span the wide Brazos River. They formed the Waco Bridge Company to build the brick Waco Suspension Bridge, which was completed in 1870. The company commissioned a firm owned by John Augustus Roebling in Trenton, New Jersey, to supply the bridge&#x27;s cables and steelwork and contracted with Mr. Thomas M. Griffith, a civil engineer based in New York, for the supervisory engineering work. The economic effects of the Waco bridge were immediate and large. The cowboys and cattle-herds following the Chisholm Trail north, crossed the Brazos River at Waco. Some chose to pay the Suspension Bridge toll, while others floated their herds down the river. The population of Waco grew rapidly, as immigrants now had a safe crossing for their horse-drawn carriages and wagons. Since 1971, the bridge has been open only to pedestrian traffic and is in the National Register of Historic Places.

Waco was the original intended western terminus of the Texas and St. Louis Railway, with the town having been reached in 1881. However, the line was extended further west to Gatesville a year later. This trackage later became the core of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, commonly known as the Cotton Belt.
In the late 19th century, a red-light district called the &quot;Reservation&quot; grew up in Waco, and prostitution was regulated by the city. The Reservation was suppressed in the early 20th century. In 1885, the soft drink Dr Pepper was invented in Waco at Morrison&#x27;s Old Corner Drug Store.

In 1845, Baylor University was founded in Independence, Texas. It moved to Waco in 1886 and merged with Waco University, becoming an integral part of the city. The university&#x27;s Strecker Museum was also the oldest continuously operating museum in the state until it closed in 2003, and the collections moved to the new Mayborn Museum Complex. In 1873, AddRan College was founded by brothers Addison and Randolph Clark in Fort Worth. The school moved to Waco in 1895, changing its name to Add-Ran Christian University and taking up residence in the empty buildings of Waco Female College. Add-Ran changed its name to Texas Christian University in 1902 and left Waco after the school&#x27;s main building burned down in 1910. TCU was offered a campus and $200,000 by the city of Fort Worth to relocate there.

Racial segregation was common in Waco. For example, Greenwood Cemetery was established in the 1870s as a segregated burial place. Black graves were divided from white ones by a fence which remained standing until 2016.

In the 1890s, William Cowper Brann published the highly successful &quot;Iconoclast&quot; newspaper in Waco. One of his targets was Baylor University. Brann revealed Baylor officials had been trafficking South American children recruited by missionaries and making house-servants out of them. Brann was shot in the back by Tom Davis, a Baylor supporter. Brann then wheeled, drew his pistol, and killed Davis. Brann was helped home by his friends, and died there of his wounds.

In 1894, the first Cotton Palace fair and exhibition center was built to reflect the dominant contribution of the agricultural cotton industry in the region. Since the end of the Civil War, cotton had been cultivated in the Brazos and Bosque valleys, and Waco had become known nationwide as a top producer. Over the next 23 years, the annual exposition would welcome over eight million attendees. The opulent building which housed the month-long exhibition was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1910. In 1931, the exposition fell prey to the Great Depression, and the building was torn down. However, the annual Cotton Palace Pageant continues, hosted in late April in conjunction with the Brazos River Festival.

On September 15, 1896, &quot;The Crash&quot; took place about north of Waco. &quot;The Crash at Crush&quot; was a publicity stunt done by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad company (known as M-K-T or &quot;Katy&quot;), featuring two locomotives intentionally set to a head-on collision. Meant to be a family fun event with food, games, and entertainment, the Crash turned deadly when both boilers exploded simultaneously, sending metal flying in the air. Three people died and dozens were injured.

===20th century===

An African American man named Sank Majors was hanged from the Washington Avenue Bridge by a white mob in 1905. Another man, Jim Lawyer, was attacked with a whip because he objected to the lynching. In both cases the mob was assisted by Texas Rangers.
In 1916, a Black teenager named Jesse Washington was tortured, mutilated, and burned to death in the town square by a mob that seized him from the courthouse, where he had been convicted of murdering a white woman, to which he confessed. About 15,000 spectators, mostly citizens of Waco, were present. The commonly named Waco Horror drew international condemnation and became the &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of the nascent NAACP&#x27;s anti-lynching campaign. In 2006, the Waco City Council officially condemned the lynching, which took place without opposition from local political or judicial leaders; the mayor and chief of police were spectators. On the centenary of the lynching, May 15, 2016, the mayor apologized in a ceremony to some of Washington&#x27;s descendants. A historical marker is being erected.

In the 1920s, despite the popularity of the Ku Klux Klan and high numbers of lynchings throughout Texas, Waco&#x27;s authorities attempted to respond to the NAACP&#x27;s campaign and institute more protections for African Americans or others threatened with mob violence and lynching. On May 26, 1922, Jesse Thomas was shot, his body dragged down Franklin street by a crowd some 6,000 strong and the corpse then burned in the public square behind city hall. In 1923, Waco&#x27;s sheriff Leslie Stegall protected Roy Mitchell, an African American coerced into confessing to multiple murders, from mob lynching. Mitchell was the last Texan to be publicly executed in Texas, and also the last to be hanged before the introduction of the electric chair. In the same year, the Texas Legislature created the Tenth Civil Court of Appeals and placed it in Waco; it is now known as the 10th Court of Appeals.

In 1937, Grover C. Thomsen and R. H. Roark created a soft-drink called &quot;Sun Tang Red Cream Soda&quot;. This would become known as the soft drink Big Red.

On May 5, 1942, Waco Army Air Field opened as a basic pilot training school, and on June 10, 1949, the name was changed to Connally Air Force Base in memory of Col. James T. Connally, a local pilot killed in Japan in 1945. The name changed again in 1951 to the James Connally Air Force Base. The base closed in May 1966 and is now the location of Texas State Technical College, formerly Texas State Technical Institute, since 1965. The airfield is still in operation, now known as TSTC Waco Airport, and was used by Air Force One when former US President George W. Bush visited his Prairie Chapel Ranch, also known as the Western White House, in Crawford, Texas.

In 1951, Harold Goodman founded the American Income Life Insurance Company.
On May 11, 1953, a violent F5 tornado hit downtown Waco, killing 114. As of 2011, it remains the 11th-deadliest tornado in U.S. history and tied for the deadliest in Texas state history. It was the first tornado tracked by radar and helped spur the creation of a nationwide storm surveillance system. A granite monument featuring the names of those killed was placed downtown in 2004.

In 1964, the Texas Department of Public Safety designated Waco as the site for the state-designated official museum of the legendary Texas Rangers law enforcement agency founded in 1823. In 1976, it was further designated the official Hall of Fame for the Rangers and renamed the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum. Renovations by the Waco government earned this building green status, the first Waco government-led project of its nature. The construction project has fallen under scrutiny for expanding the building over unmarked human graves.

In 1978, bones were discovered emerging from the mud at the confluence of the Brazos and Bosque Rivers. Excavations revealed the bones were 68,000 years old and belonged to a species of mammoth. Eventually, the remains of at least 24 mammoths, one camel, and one large cat were found at the site, making it one of the largest findings of its kind. Scholars have puzzled over why such a large herd had been killed at once. The bones are on display at the Waco Mammoth National Monument, part of the National Park Service.

====Waco siege====

On February 28, 1993, a shootout occurred in which six Branch Davidians and four agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms died. After 51 days, on April 19, 1993, the standoff ended when the Branch Davidians&#x27; facility, referred to as Mt. Carmel, was set ablaze, thirteen miles from Waco. 74 people, including leader David Koresh, died in the blaze.

===21st century===
During the presidency of George W. Bush, Waco was the home to the White House Press Center. The press center provided briefing and office facilities for the press corps whenever Bush visited his &quot;Western White House&quot; Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, about northwest of Waco.

On May 17, 2015, a violent dispute among rival biker gangs broke out at Twin Peaks restaurant. The Waco police intervened, with nine dead and 18 injured in the incident. More than 170 were arrested. No bystanders, Twin Peak employees, or officers were killed. This was the most high-profile criminal incident since the Waco siege, and the deadliest shootout in the city&#x27;s history.

==Sports==
The Baylor Bears athletics teams compete in Waco. The football team has won or tied for nine conference titles, and have played in 24 bowl games, garnering a record of 13–11. The women&#x27;s basketball team won the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2005, 2012 and 2019. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2021.

The Waco BlueCats, an independent minor league baseball team, planned to play in the inaugural season of the Southwest League of Professional Baseball in 2019. A new ballpark was planned for the suburb of Bellmead.

The American Basketball Association had a franchise for part of the 2006 season, the Waco Wranglers. The team played at Reicher Catholic High School and practiced at Texas State Technical College.

Previous professional sports franchises in Waco have proven unsuccessful. The Waco Marshals of the National Indoor Football League lasted less than two months amidst a midseason ownership change in 2004. (The team became the beleaguered Cincinnati Marshals the following year.) The Waco Wizards of the now-defunct Western Professional Hockey League fared better, lasting into a fourth season before folding in 2000. Both teams played at the Heart O&#x27; Texas Coliseum, one of Waco&#x27;s largest entertainment and sports venues.

The Southern Indoor Football League announced that Waco was an expansion market for the 2010 season. It was rumored they would play in the Heart O&#x27; Texas Coliseum. However, the league broke up into three separate leagues, and subsequently, a team did not come to Waco in any of the new leagues.

Professional baseball first came to Waco in 1889 with the formation of the Waco Tigers, a member of the Texas League. The Tigers were renamed the Navigators in 1905, and later the Steers. In 1920, the team was sold to Wichita Falls. In 1923, a new franchise called the Indians was formed and became a member of the Class D level Texas Association. In 1925, Waco rejoined the Texas League with the formation of the Waco Cubs.

On June 20, 1930, the first night game in Texas League history was played at Katy Park in Waco. The lights were donated by Waco resident Charles Redding Turner, who owned a local farm team for recruits to the Chicago Cubs.

On the night of August 6, 1930, baseball history was made at Katy Park: in the eighth inning of a night game against Beaumont, Waco left fielder Gene Rye became the only player in the history of professional baseball to hit three home runs in one inning.

The last year Waco had a team in the Texas League was 1930, but fielded some strong semipro teams in the 1930s and early 1940s. During the World War II years of 1943–1945, the powerful Waco Army Air Field team was probably the best in the state; many major leaguers played for the team, and it was managed by big-league catcher Birdie Tebbetts.

In 1947, the Class B level Big State League was organized with Waco as a member called the Waco Dons.

In 1948, A.H. Kirksey, owner of Katy Park, persuaded the Pittsburgh Pirates club to take over the Waco operation, and the nickname was changed to Pirates. The Pirates vaulted into third place in 1948. They dropped a notch to fourth in 1949, but prevailed in the playoffs to win the league championship. The Pirates then tumbled into the second division, bottoming out with a dreadful 29–118, 0.197 club in 1952. This mark ranks as one of the 10 worst marks of any 20th-century full-season team. When the tornado struck in 1953, it destroyed the park. The team relocated to Longview to finish the season and finished a respectable third with a 77–68 record.

Waco has many golf clubs and courses, including Cottonwood Creek Golf Course.

In 2018, Bicycle World Texas IronMan 70.3 Waco held its inaugural event in the city on October 26.

==Parks and recreation==
A seven-mile scenic riverwalk along the east and west banks of the Brazos River stretches from the Baylor campus to Cameron Park Zoo. This multiuse walking and jogging trail passes underneath the Waco Suspension Bridge and captures the peaceful charm of the river. Lake Waco is a reservoir along the western border of the city.

Cameron Park is a urban park featuring playgrounds, picnic areas, a cross-country running track, and a disc golf course. In 2009, the US Department of the Interior designated the Cameron Park Trail System as a National Recreation Trail. The park also contains Waco&#x27;s zoo, the Cameron Park Zoo.

==Government==
Waco has a council-manager form of government. Citizens are represented on the City Council by six elected members; five from single-member districts and a mayor who is elected at-large. The city offers a full line of city services typical of an American city this size, including: police, fire, Waco Transit buses, electric utilities, water and wastewater, solid waste, and the Waco Convention and Visitors Bureau.

The Heart of Texas Council of Governments is headquartered in Waco on South New Road. This regional agency is a voluntary association of cities, counties, and special districts in the Central Texas area.

The Texas Tenth Court of Appeals is in the McLennan County Courthouse in Waco.

The Waco Fire Department operates 13 fire stations throughout the city.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Waco Parole Office in Waco.

The United States Postal Service operates the Waco Main Post Office along Texas State Highway 6. In addition, it operates other post offices throughout Waco.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Interstate 35 is the major north–south highway serving Waco. It directly connects the city with Dallas (I-35E), Fort Worth (I-35W), Austin, and San Antonio. Texas State Highway 6 runs northwest–southeast and connects Waco to Bryan/College Station and Houston. US Highway 84 is the major east–west thoroughfare in the area. It is also known as Waco Drive, Bellmead Drive (as it passes through the city of Bellmead), Woodway Drive or the George W. Bush Parkway. Loop 340 bypasses the city to the east and south. State Highway 31 splits off US 84 just east of Waco and connects the city to Tyler, Longview, and Shreveport, Louisiana.

The first traffic circle in Texas was constructed in Waco in 1933 at the intersections of US 81 and US 77. It was later expanded to include intersections with Valley Mills Dr. and La Salle Ave. Drivers were confused and upset by the circle when it was first constructed, which even led to lawsuits. In 2013 a lone star was added to the center of the circle. Lane markings and new signage were added in 2018 to improve traffic flow and to help guide drivers.

The Waco area is home to three airports. Waco Regional Airport (ACT) serves the city with daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth International via American Eagle. TSTC Waco Airport (CNW) is the site of the former James Connally AFB and was the primary fly-in point for former President George W. Bush when he was visiting his ranch in Crawford. It also serves as a hub airport for L3 and several other aviation companies. McGregor Executive Airport (PWG) is a general-aviation facility west of Waco.

<text>West is a city in McLennan County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,531. It is named after Thomas West, the first postmaster of the city. The city is located in the north-central part of Texas, approximately south of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, 20 miles north of Waco and 120 miles north of Austin, the state&#x27;s capital.

Despite its name, the city is not located within the region of West Texas; area residents sometimes call the community &quot;West comma Texas&quot; to avoid repetition.

 it has one of the largest concentrations of Czech Texans of any city in the state.

==History==
The first settlers of northern McLennan County arrived in the 1840s. They were farm and ranch families drawn from the east by the rich lands made available by the government sale of land to build schools in Texas. The area farmers cultivated the land and grew cotton, wheat, and grain sorghum, and raised cattle. The farming community centered around a freshwater spring that became known as Bold Springs. In 1860, Bold Springs had a population of about 300 and provided services such as a blacksmith, churches, and a post office.

The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad was laid between Hillsboro and Waco in the fall of 1881. The path of the railroad passed through land owned by Thomas West, who had moved to the area in 1859. He farmed land that he had purchased and served as postmaster of Bold Springs. A train depot and station was built on the land he sold to the railroad company and the land running beside the tracks was divided into small sections and sold to people wanting to start businesses. The new depot and station included a post office and since Mr. West served as postmaster the settlement became known as West&#x27;s Station, later West Station, and finally its current name West. Mr. West opened the first general store and became a successful businessman as he later owned a hotel, a furniture store, and a bank.

The railroad brought prosperity to the area during the 1880s. More businesses were opened and more surrounding land was purchased. Czech immigrants came to the area, purchasing the rich lands to farm and start a fresh life in the new world. They also opened businesses, sharing their European culture. By the 1890s, the Czech businesses flourished in West. On June 11, 1892, West was officially organized into a town. It had become the center of commerce for the area. There were cotton gins, grocery stores, churches, schools, and doctors&#x27; offices.

The temporary city Crush, Texas, located just three miles (5 km) south of West, was the location of The Crash at Crush, a head-on collision between two locomotives that was staged on September 15, 1896, as a publicity stunt for the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Over 30,000 spectators gathered at the crash site, named &quot;crush&quot; for MKT passenger agent William Crush, who conceived the idea. About 4 p.m. the trains were sent speeding toward each other. Contrary to mechanics&#x27; predictions, the steam boilers exploded on impact, propelling pieces of metal into the crowd. Two people were killed and many others injured, including Jarvis Deane of Waco, who was photographing the event and lost an eye. Texas Historical Marker 5315, located on Interstate 35 northbound frontage road, between Mangrum and Wiggins Road, commemorates the event.

The turn of the century brought electricity, running water, and natural gas. The population of West and surrounding area grew. Many of the descendants of the original settlers continue to farm the lands and run the businesses today. Czech is still spoken by some of the older residents.

===2013 explosion===

On April 17, 2013, a fire broke out at West Fertilizer Co., a fertilizer plant on the north side of town that stored ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used as an explosive. The fire triggered two explosions milliseconds apart from one another. The massive blast killed 15 people, including 12 first responders, and injured at least 200. It destroyed nearby schools, an apartment complex, and a nursing home and damaged hundreds of homes in the surrounding area.

The explosion, which measured as a 2.1 magnitude earthquake, garnered much media attention. President Barack Obama  and Texas Gov. Rick Perry attended the memorial for first responders.

A month-long investigation ruled the cause of the explosion undetermined because multiple possible causes could not be ruled out. The lingering possibilities include arson, an electrical glitch or a golf cart that overheated.

In 2016 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives concluded that the fire that caused the explosion was set deliberately. However ATF never presented any evidence of arson. A comprehensive investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) publicized in 2016 did not find any evidence of foul play. The causes of the explosion and recommendations for prevention can be found in www.CSB.gov under West Fertilizer Company (Completed Investigations).

<doc id="136368" wikidata="Q982579" url="?curid=136368" title="Castroville, Texas">
<text>Castroville is a city in Medina County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,954 at the 2020 census, up from 2,680 at the 2010 census. It is part of the San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area. Castroville was founded by Alsatian-Texans, who came to Texas during the German emigration period of the mid-1800s. Most Alsatians who came to Castroville spoke Alsatian (a dialect of German origin integrating Celtic, Yiddish, and French words). The Alsatian culture and language are still kept alive by the residents of Castroville. Prior to 1893, Castroville was the first county seat of Medina County.

==History==

Castroville was established in 1844 by Henri Castro, an &quot;empresario&quot; of the Republic of Texas, who brought several dozen European families to the area from Alsace and adjoining Baden to populate his land grant along the Medina River west of San Antonio. The first colonists disembarked at Galveston on January 9, 1843. They were taken by ship to Lavaca Bay and traveled overland to San Antonio, where they took shelter in abandoned buildings until the Texas Rangers were prepared to escort them to their land and protect them from hostile Indians. On September 2, 1844, the first colonists arrived at Castro&#x27;s land grant on the Medina River.

From 1849, Castroville, on the Medina River, was a water stop on the San Antonio-El Paso Road and a stagecoach station on the San Antonio-El Paso Mail Line and San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line.

After a few hard years, the town and surrounding farms flourished, but for generations, the residents remained insular. In Castroville&#x27;s first century, a visitor would be more likely to hear Alsatian—a dialect spoken in Europe before Standard German was prevalent—than English spoken in the town&#x27;s homes, stores, and taverns. Modern Alsatian travelers noted that the dialect spoken in Castroville was more like that which was spoken in the 1840s. The descendants of the original settlers worked diligently to preserve their language, whose usage in Europe has been diminished by the political actions of France and Germany, especially since World War II.

The Steinbach Haus (originally built between 1618 and 1648 in Wahlbach, Alsace) was dismantled and reconstructed in Castroville in 1998. It was opened to the public in 2002.

==Sister cities==
Castroville has two twin towns:

* Ensisheim, (Alsace) France - 2009
* Eguisheim, (Alsace) France - 1975

==Geography==

Later, in the 1940s the sign was changed to &quot;This is God&#x27;s Country, Please Don&#x27;t Drive Through It Like Hell&quot; to satisfy those in the town who were displeased with the tone of the old sign. The sign has been in news and print in many magazines, including on the cover of National Geographic, and in the music video of Little Texas&#x27; song &quot;God Blessed Texas.&quot;

The U.S. Army built an air field in the town in 1942 to train new pilots; at one time the largest air navigation school in the world, Hondo Army Air Field trained over 14,000 navigators for service during World War II before closing in 1946.

<text>Menard is a city in and the county seat of Menard County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,348 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Menard is located along the banks of the San Saba River at the junction of U.S. Highways 83 and 190, approximately 140 miles northwest of Austin and San Antonio in central Menard County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The first settlement at the site of what is now Menard was the Spanish Mission San Sabá and the Presidio of San Luís de Amarillas, both established in April 1757. The presidio was later replaced by the Presidio of San Sabá in 1761. Both were intended to protect New Spain&#x27;s northern frontier from marauding Comanches. Due to the presidio&#x27;s isolation, it suffered repeated attacks, and was finally abandoned in 1770. Stones from the old presidio walls were used by later settlers to build homes and fences. The ruins of the old presidio were reconstructed in 1936.

The community was first known as Menardville when the site was laid out in 1858, after the formation of Menard County. Nearby Fort McKavett was deactivated in 1859, leaving the settlers with little protection from frequent raids from nearby Native Americans. The fort reopened after the Civil War. By 1867, Menardville had a store, a blacksmith shop, and a saloon. The community served as a trading post and overnight stop on north and west cattle trails. A county government was organized in 1871 and a two-story courthouse was built one year later. Menardville had around 150 residents by the mid-1880s. The San Saba River flooded in 1899, causing considerable damage to the community.

In 1910 or 1911, while the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Company was making plans to lay a track through the community, company officials asked residents to rename their town Menard to facilitate the painting of signs. An economic boom followed the arrival of the first train in 1911. The 1920 census recorded 1,164 people living in Menard. For many years, the town served as the principal shipping point for Menard County. Although the community was affected by the Great Depression, both of its banks—the Menard National Bank and Bevans State Bank—remained open. Menard&#x27;s population stood at 1,969 in 1930, 2,375 in 1940, and 2,685 in 1950. That figure began to decline during the 1950s and 1960s, as road improvements made travel and shipping less dependent on rail service. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad discontinued its service to Menard in 1972, but donated the depot to the county for use as a history museum. The Menard County Historical Society began collecting artifacts in 1975 and dedicated the museum in 1978. By 1980, 1,697 people were living in Menard. In 1990, the population fell slightly to 1,606 before rebounding to 1,653 in 2000.

<text>Cameron is a city in Milam County, Texas, United States. Its population was 5,306 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Milam County.

==Geography==

Cameron is located at (30.854544, –96.978716). It is situated at the junction of U.S. Highways 77 and 190, approximately 71 miles northeast of Austin in north-central Milam County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

===Early years===

Soon after Texas became a U.S. state, the Texas Legislature authorized a seven-member commission to find a permanent site for the Milam County seat. The commission purchased a 60-acre tract of Daniel Monroe&#x27;s headright on the Little River in 1846 and named the new community Cameron after Ewen Cameron, a Scottish highlander prominent in the Texas Revolution and a member of the Mier Expedition during the war with Mexico. When the courthouse in Cameron was completed later that year, county records were transferred to Cameron from Nashville—a community situated along the Brazos River that had served as the Milam County seat during the period when Texas was an independent republic. The new town struggled due to its isolated location, with the nearest railroad being 50 miles away. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, several attempts were made to navigate the Little River to give Cameron easier access to trade routes. The most successful attempts occurred in 1850 after heavy rains made the river rise. J.W. McCown Sr. persuaded Captain Basil M. Hatfield to bring his steamboat &quot;Washington&quot; through the upper Brazos up to the Little River. The steamboat and the merchandise it brought caused great excitement among the locals, and a two-day celebration was held when the boat tied up 2.5 miles east of Cameron. Despite this, however, navigation of the river was impractical on a regular basis, and places such as Port Sullivan and Nashville developed into Milam County&#x27;s dominant business centers during the 1850s and 1860s. More competition came in the 1870s when nearby Rockdale was established on the International-Great Northern Railroad. Faced with these challenges, some Milam County residents began to question whether Cameron should remain the county seat instead of the newly prosperous town of Rockdale. Elections were held in 1874 and 1880 on the issue, with the results going in favor of maintaining the status quo.

===Incorporation and growth===
In 1881, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway arrived in Cameron. This improved the local economy and led to population growth. Between 1878 and 1884, the total number of residents increased by 60%, from around 500 to 800. Cameron had attempted to incorporate in 1856, 1866, and 1873, but each time the charter was allowed to lapse. It was officially incorporated in 1889. The San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway arrived in 1890, giving the town another boost. By 1892, the population stood at nearly 2,000.

Although cotton dominated the economy of Cameron during the 19th century, the 20th century brought more diversified industries. The discovery of oil in neighboring Williamson County in 1915 prompted Milam County residents to initiate their own exploration. The Minerva-Rockdale oil field, discovered in 1921, provided new opportunities for investment. In the 1920s and 1930s, several milk-product companies also operated in Cameron, including the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation. At the 1930 census, the population was 4,565. That figure rose to 5,040 in 1940.

===Modern times===
Cameron residents received much-needed job opportunities in the 1950s when the Aluminum Company of America built a plant southwest of Rockdale. Jobs at the plant, as well as the lignite industry that supplied the plant&#x27;s power, revitalized the economy of Milam County. Between 1950 and 1960, Cameron registered an increase of 588 residents, from 5,052 to 5,640.

This level of growth would not continue, however. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad discontinued its track from Cameron south to Giddings. Southern Pacific, which had taken over the Texas and New Orleans, abandoned its track from Cameron north to Rosebud. The population continued to experience slight fluctuations throughout the remainder of the late 20th century. The Alcoa plant closed in 2009.

Since 2010, the annual Burning Flipside festival has been held at the nearby Apache Pastures campground, drawing tourists to the area.

On February 23, 2021, a collision between a flatbed tractor-trailer and a BNSF railroad train on Farm to Market Road 2095 near Cameron caused a derailment. The train&#x27;s petroleum cargo exploded, resulting in the evacuation of nearby homes. At least one structure burned, but no loss of life or injuries were reported. 

Since Oct of 2021, the City of Cameron and the Downtown Square have been experiencing a renaissance as the community has started to renovate the historic buildings and add numerous businesses. The downtown is now bustling with activity. In addition to the Historic Courthouse, The Milam County Museum and Railroad Museum, the downtown square now hosts Shirley Mae&#x27;s renowned bakery, Cameron Coffee Co, ZX Texas Boutique and Wine Bar, General Mercantile Antique, The Venue at Railfan, The Shop on Houston, Central Avenue Bistro, Ginno&#x27;s Italian, The Bling Box Boutique, 44 Farms and many more businesses. The City also hosts numerous downtown festivals, car shows and parades.

<text>Milano is a city in Milam County, Texas, United States, located at the intersection of U.S. Route 79 and State Highway 36, twelve miles southeast of Cameron, the county seat. Its population was 390 at the 2020 census.

On November 5, 1960, country music singer Johnny Horton was killed by a drunk driver on Highway 79 near Milano on his way home from a performance at the Skyline Club in Austin, Texas.

==Geography==

Milano is located at (30.709190, –96.863420).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.51% is water.

==History==
The International-Great Northern Railroad Company laid out the original site of Milano in 1874, about a mile and a half west of the city&#x27;s present site. A United States post office opened there the same year. Soon, a Baptist church was also established in the area. The community around Milano became a voting precinct in 1880.
Local sources offer several possibilities for the origin of the name &quot;Milano.&quot; One story suggests that the town was simply named after Milan, Italy, because of similarities in the climate, but truly, the climate of Milan in Northern Italy, is cold and continental; another says that the name was supposed to have been &quot;Milam,&quot; but the United States Post Office Department either got it wrong or changed it intentionally because another Milam, Texas, already existed.

Nevertheless, when the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad Company built the section of track between Brenham and Belton in 1881, it established the town of Milano Junction at the railway&#x27;s intersection with the International-Great Northern, about two miles east of Milano. As the focus of social and economic life shifted to the new town, Milano became &quot;Old Milano&quot; and Milano Junction became Milano. By the late 1880s, Milano was a commercial hub, with 500 residents, and served as a shipping point for cotton and hides produced in the area. Truck farming became an important industry for Milano in the 1920s, with tomatoes, watermelon, and cantaloupes as the principal crops.

The small city of Milano reached its population peak in 1939, when approximately 920 residents were reported to be living there. The number of local residents began to decline in the early 1940s, and fell to a low of 380 by the early 1970s, before beginning to grow again in the late 1970s.

Within a few years of its arrival in 1952, Rockdale almost doubled in population, changing in character from a predominantly agricultural economy to one heavily driven by manufacturing jobs. Smelting operations were halted at the Alcoa plant in 2008. The Alcoa plant closed in February 2014 when production at the atomizer ceased.

Rockdale was also the site of the Sandow Power Plant, which closed in 2018.

Two cryptocurrency miners, Bitdeer, a division of Bitmain, and Riot Blockchain, formerly known as Bioptix, occupy former Alcoa facilities less than half a mile apart in Rockdale, using electricity transmission lines built to connect smelters to the power plant.

<text>Colorado City ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Mitchell County, Texas, United States. Its population was 3,991 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Colorado City originated as a ranger camp in 1877. It grew into a cattlemen&#x27;s center and has been called &quot;the Mother City of West Texas&quot;. The town acquired a railway station and post office in 1881 and was named the county seat. In the early 1880s it was a center for cattle shipment, with herds driven to Colorado City and loaded onto trains for shipment to the eastern markets. The population was estimated at 6,000 in 1884–1885, but dropped to 2,500 by 1890 after a drought, and dropped further with the growth of nearby San Angelo.

The first school was conducted in a dugout in 1881 and moved to a building the next year. During the late 19th and 20th century, economic activity centered successively on salt mining, then farming, then oil production. By 1910 the town had a new public school, a waterworks, and an electric plant. A city hall was built by 1926.

An oil refinery began operation in 1924 and closed in 1969. Other industries included a meat-packing operation and a mobile home factory.

<text>Nocona is a city along U.S. Highway 82 and State Highway 175 in Montague County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,002 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The city is named for Peta Nocona, the Comanche chief. The area was first known to white settlers as the last stop in Texas before crossing the Red River on the Chisolm Trail. It was founded in 1887 along a particular bend in the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway line, which soon became part of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, connecting Gainesville and Henrietta, and later Wichita Falls. Nocona assumed the role of economic and industrial center of northern Montague County, and many older towns in the area, bypassed by the railroad, and its businesses shuttered. Its citizens moved to Nocona. The city has steadily maintained a population around 3000 since the 1940s, though industries responsible for its growth have come and gone. The &quot;North Field&quot;, an oil field between Nocona and the Red River, contributed to Nocona&#x27;s economy for much of the 20th century and continues to do so on a small scale. The MKT line, which was responsible for Nocona&#x27;s founding, was abandoned in 1969 and the tracks removed in 1971. Nocona also has a proud history of leather works and has been home to Justin Industries, Nocona Boot Company, and the Nocona Belt Company. Nocona Boot Company and Justin Industries have since moved; however, the Montague Boot Company has been established in downtown Nocona, making boots for the Larry Mahan line at Cavender&#x27;s Boot City. Also integral to the Nocona economy is the Nocona Athletic Goods Company (product names are spelled &quot;Nokona&quot;), which manufactures baseball gloves, bats, catcher&#x27;s equipment, and other sports accessories. The Athletic Goods&#x27; facilities burned in July 2006, and production has been moved to a temporary facility. 

Nocona has a lake, about 10 miles north of the city, appropriately named Lake Nocona, or Farmer&#x27;s Creek Reservoir. It is a recreational lake popular with people from across north-central Texas. On Lake Nocona sits Nocona Hills, an attractive gated lakeside &quot;city&quot; with many homes, a hotel, golf course, landing strip, and other amenities. Nocona is also home to an 18-hole golf course, airstrip (FAA identifier F48), hospital, and one of the finest city parks in Texas.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Nocona has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Saint Jo is a city in Montague County, Texas, United States, along the northern border of the state. The population was 881 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Established by primarily European Americans in 1856, the city was originally known as Head of Elm, named for its location at the headwaters of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, one of the four distinct headwaters. Numerous settlers came to this area from the Upper South of Tennessee and Kentucky, attracted to new opportunities in Texas.

Joe Howell was a surveyor who originally laid out the town and is credited as founder. According to one account, Irby Holt Boggess from Tennessee gave leadership in partnership with Howell in or around 1872. This account was displayed in 1986 in the Stonewall Saloon Museum on the town square of Saint Jo. It is incorporated in a story about Boggess.

Howell was said to have opposed alcoholic beverage sales, and was given the pejorative nickname &quot;Saint Jo.&quot; This was also applied to the town he founded. But in 1880 Zachariah T. Haden, who had come from Paducah, Kentucky with his family, was working as a saloon keeper in Saint Jo, perhaps at the Stonewall Saloon.

Saint Jo was located near Red River Station, a trading post on the Red River. In the post-Civil War period, this post became the southern terminus of the Chisholm Trail. As ranchers undertook cattle drives to get their cattle to railheads in Kansas and then shipped East, where they could command high prices, the areas related to the trail began to develop increased populations and businesses. Cowboys were the chief customers for saloons and hotels in these towns. Eventually railroads were constructed into Texas, ending the cattle drives to Kansas, and drawing off business along the trail.

After the United States&#x27; 20th-century Prohibition era, from 1920 to 1933, Saint Jo voted to remain a &quot;dry&quot; city. It was not until May 2009 that residents voted to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption.

Saint Jo has been proud of its Western heritage and encourages tourism related to it. For instance, the Stonewall Saloon has been preserved for use as a museum, and the main street has retained its late 19th-century character.

On May 6, 2017, the Real Chisholm Trail Symposium met in Saint Jo. Program participants included representatives of the West Texas Historical Association, the Trail Drivers Association, and the Fort Sill Museum in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Gary and Margaret Kraisinger, the joint authors of the 2004 book &quot;The Western: The Greatest Texas Cattle Trail, 1874–1886,&quot; also appeared.

The city holds BoHo Saint Jo semiannually, a collaborative event produced with the retail clothing store Panache. The event features local vendors who can showcase their locally sourced goods.

<doc id="136387" wikidata="Q260282" url="?curid=136387" title="Conroe, Texas">
<text>Conroe is a city in and the county seat of Montgomery County, Texas, United States, about north of Houston. It is a principal city in the metropolitan area.

As of 2023, the population was 103,035. Since 2007, the city has increased in size (and population) by annexation, with the city territory expanding from 52.8 to 74.4 square miles. Some communities have attempted to fight such annexation. According to the Census Bureau, Conroe was the fastest-growing large city in the United States between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016.

==History==
The city is named after Isaac Conroe. Born in the North, he served as a Union Cavalry officer and settled in Houston after the Civil War. There he became a lumberman. Conroe founded a sawmill in this area in 1881. The community built its early economy and wealth on the lumber industry. Originally named &quot;Conroe&#x27;s Switch&quot;, the community received an influx of workers and residents in the late 19th century who were attracted to the growth of the lumber industry, which harvested the local piney wood forest.

In 1886, Conroe Mill School was established in the expanding town. Conroe Normal and Industrial College, a school for African Americans, served the area.

Six lynchings were recorded in Montgomery County around the turn of the century, and some suspects were lynched at the courthouse in Conroe. In 1922, a young black man named Joe Winters was lynched, burned alive on the courthouse square for allegedly attacking a young white woman. Within the black community, it was known he was in a consensual relationship with the woman, who denied it when they were discovered.

In 1941 Bob White was shot to death in the courthouse, during his third trial. The African-American man was arrested in 1936 on charges of assaulting a white woman in Livingston, Texas. (Alternative accounts in the black community said they had a standing consensual relationship.) He was first tried there, before an all-white jury. They convicted him. The case was appealed with the help of the NAACP in Houston because he had not been given a lawyer or been able to contact family, and he was tortured in interrogation. The second trial was held in Conroe for a change of venue. Another all-white jury convicted White again. The case reached the United States Supreme Court on appeal, which had just ruled that coerced confessions were unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court for trial. During the proceedings in the courtroom, in front of the judge and numerous witnesses, the husband of the alleged victim shot White in the back of the head and immediately killed him. The husband was arrested and tried the following week, and was acquitted.

In 1931 George W. Strake discovered the Conroe Oil Field. Distillate and natural gas were produced from the Cockfield Formation at a depth of about . cA second well in 1932 produced 1200 BOPD. By 1935, the field had produced 40 million barrels of oil.

During the 1930s, because of oil profits, the city briefly boasted more millionaires per capita than any other U.S. city. After the construction of Interstate 45 in the postwar period improved automobile access, many Houstonians began to follow the highway to new suburban communities that developed around Conroe.

==Geography==
The Office of Management and Budget classifies Conroe as a principal city within the metropolitan area. The city is about north of Houston.

===Annexation===
When Conroe incorporated in 1904, the city limits encompassed a 5.44 square mile area. From 1970 to 2000, the city limits expanded from 7.15 square miles to 42.35 square miles. Beginning in 2007, the city outlined a plan to continue expanding its city limits through annexation. According to Chapter 43 of the Texas Local Government Code, home rule municipalities like Conroe may annex territory that is adjacent to the city&#x27;s current boundaries, with certain restrictions. The city&#x27;s 2007 plan projected doubling its size through a combination of voluntary and involuntary annexations. As of 2022, the city has annexed territory every year since 2007, increasing the city limits from 52.8 to 77.5 square miles.

In April 2015, residents of the gated community of April Sound filed a lawsuit against Conroe after their community was annexed on January 1, 2015. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2017. Involuntary annexations were a major issue in the 2016 mayoral election, the first after April Sound residents were incorporated into the city. Proponents of annexation contended that it was a useful tool to &quot;promote and facilitate growth and progress,&quot; while those in opposition were concerned about whether annexed territories receive a &quot;fair shake&quot; in the negotiations. In 2017, the city council voted in favor of additional involuntary annexations.

===Ecosystem===
Conroe is in the southwest corner of the East Texas Piney Woods. The Piney Woods consist of pine trees and hardwood forests. The most common type of tree in the southwest Piney Woods is the loblolly pine. Shortleaf pine are also abundant. Pockets of blackland prairie vegetation are also present, but are disappearing due to urbanization.

In 1926, the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service purchased 1700 acres of Piney Woods to establish W. Goodrich Jones State Forest. The forest serves as a research and demonstration area for sustainable forestry techniques. The forest also preserves the habitat of the red-cockaded woodpecker, a species classified in the early 21st century as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

In 2017, Texas A&amp;M asked Conroe state senator Brandon Creighton to author a bill setting aside 10 percent of the forest for educational and research-related development. The bill also opened the possibility of commercial development on the land. Public concern over the bill persuaded Creighton to revise it. The final version, which passed the Senate unanimously, protected the entire forest from development.

===Water resources===
The West Fork of the San Jacinto River flows through the western edge of Conroe. The entire city is within the river&#x27;s watershed. The river flows southeast from Lake Conroe, a 19,640 surface acre lake created by a dam in 1973 to establish an alternative source of drinking water for Houston.

Conroe developed over several geologic layers of underground aquifers, which supply the city with fresh drinking water. Due to rapid development in this area, and the increased population of Conroe and the surrounding area, the groundwater supply is being withdrawn faster than it can be replenished. As a result, the Lone Star Groundwater Conservation District, which oversees groundwater usage in Montgomery County, mandated that Conroe reduce its groundwater usage by 30 percent of 2009 amounts by January 1, 2016. As part of the groundwater usage reduction plan, the San Jacinto River Authority began in September 2015 to supplement Conroe&#x27;s groundwater supply with surface water pumped from Lake Conroe. The SJRA charges the city usage fees to cover the cost of pumping and treating the water.

On August 27, 2015, the City of Conroe filed a lawsuit against the Lone Star Groundwater Conservation District, claiming that the LSGCD did not have the authority to limit the city&#x27;s groundwater usage. The city also refused to pay SJRA water usage fee increases in 2016, resulting in a separate lawsuit filed by the SJRA against the city. The LSGCD and Conroe reached a settlement agreement in January 2019. The SJRA case was dismissed in June 2020.

Parts of Conroe surrounding the West Fork of the San Jacinto River are in a floodplain. Significant flooding occurs along the floodplain when rainfall exceeds nine inches in a 48-hour period. The Conroe area has approximately a 10 percent chance of receiving this much rainfall in any given year. Urban development in Conroe and the surrounding area has also exacerbated the risk of flooding. Montgomery County had 500-year floods in three successive years, in May 2015, April 2016, and August 2017. A 500-year flood has a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in a year. In addition, a fourth major flood occurred in May 2016, resulting in two major floods in two months.

The flooding in August 2017 took place during Hurricane Harvey, when nearly 32 inches of rain fell on the city. To protect the integrity of the dam, San Jacinto River Authority officials released 79,100 cubic feet per second of water from Lake Conroe downstream into the West Fork of the San Jacinto River, exacerbating flooding already taking place in the floodplain. Conroe city officials ordered a mandatory evacuation of McDade Estates, a neighborhood on the banks of the river. As a response to the flooding, Montgomery County commissioners in October 2017 requested $1.25 million from the federal government for a flood mitigation study, along with an additional $95.5 million to implement various flood mitigation projects.

==Demographics==

During the first decade of the 21st century, the city attracted many new residents from the Houston area. Renée C. Lee said that Conroe around 2002 was &quot;a sleepy, backwater town&quot; and that at the time, Conroe city officials needed to use financial incentives to attract home developers to Conroe. Between 2003 and 2006, Conroe became a hotbed of construction of new houses. As a result, Conroe&#x27;s population grew from 36,811 in 2000 to 56,207 in 2010.
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 89,956 people, 32,547 households, and 21,369 families residing in the city.

As of the census of 2010, there were 56,207 people, 18,651 households, and 13,086 families residing in the city. Since the 2010 census, Conroe&#x27;s population has continued to grow. Between 2014 and 2015, Conroe was the sixth fastest growing city in the United States. The following year, the US Census Bureau reported that Conroe was the fastest-growing large city in the United States. It had a 7.8% growth rate between 2015 and 2016. New housing developments throughout the city have contributed to the rapid population growth. Conroe&#x27;s annexation of growing communities within its extraterritorial jurisdiction has also contributed to its growth.

The racial makeup of the city was 69.7% White (including Hispanic), 10.3% African American, 1.2% Native American, 1.8% Asian, less than 0.05% Pacific Islander, 13.7% from other races, and 3.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 38.5% of the population. White alone (not Hispanic or Latino) were 48.3% of the total population.

According to the 2016 American Community Survey, the median income for a household in the city was $50,517 and the median income for a family was $60,087. Males had a median income of $44,343 versus $37,747 for females. The per capita income for the city was $28,672. About 12.2% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.4% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over. In response to income inequality, several non-profit groups including the Montgomery County United Way, The Salvation Army, and the Crisis Assistance Center help provide residents of the area with a variety of services ranging from transportation to food and shelter.

== Economy ==
In the early 1980s, Exxon considered consolidating its employees to a site in Conroe. The company ended the plans after the local oil-based economy collapsed.

== Culture ==
Downtown Conroe&#x27;s Central Business District hosts multiple arts venues. The oldest is the Crighton Theatre, which opened on November 26, 1935. The theatre is named after Harry M. Crighton, Conroe&#x27;s mayor from 1932 to 1933. The theatre functioned as the community&#x27;s movie theatre until 1967, at which point it fell into disrepair. In 1979 it was renovated, and it now hosts live theatrical productions. Another theatre, the Owen Theatre, is also located in the district. The Central Business District has outdoor performance venues at Conroe Founder&#x27;s Plaza and Heritage Place, which host multiple festivals throughout the year.

The city supports several arts organizations, including the Greater Conroe Arts Alliance. The Alliance is a network of multiple arts groups in the city such as the Conroe Symphony, the Conroe Art League, and the Montgomery County Choral Society. The Alliance also sponsors, along with the state of Texas, the Young Texas Artists Music Competition. The competition, founded in 1983, showcases young musicians who aspire to careers in classical music. In 2009, the city sponsored the Art Bench Project, which converted 13 stone benches scattered throughout the central business district into works of art. Each bench portrays a different part of Conroe&#x27;s history and culture, from historical figures like George Strake and Charles B. Stewart to contemporary art groups such as the Crighton Players.

=== Parks and recreation ===

The city contains multiple parks which document local history. The Heritage Museum of Montgomery County maintains artifacts of Montgomery County&#x27;s early settlers.

The Lone Star Monument and Historical Flag Park displays the flags that flew over Texas. The flags are positioned in a circle around the park, with a statue of a Texian in the center. Each flag comes with a plaque that describes its connection to Texas history. At the park&#x27;s entrance is a statue of Charles B. Stewart, who is claimed to have designed the lone star flag.

Montgomery County War Memorial Park is a memorial to the 166 soldiers from Montgomery County who have been killed in active duty. The park&#x27;s dedication ceremony was in 1976 and featured a speech by President Gerald Ford. In 2017, the Montgomery County Commissioners Court and the City of Conroe agreed to relocate and expand the memorial, to include the names of up to 50,000 soldiers who have lived in Montgomery County. As of June 2019, the expansion is ongoing.

Lake Conroe, northwest of downtown Conroe, is a site for such water-based activities as boating and fishing. The most common fish in the lake are Largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, white bass, and hybrid striped bass. Crappie may also be found in the early spring and fall.

<text>Cut and Shoot is a city in eastern Montgomery County, Texas, United States, about east of Conroe and north of Houston. Until 2006, Cut and Shoot was considered and called a town. Then, the town council elected for it to be considered and referred to as a city. The population was 1,087 at the 2020 census.

==Name==
According to one local legend, Cut and Shoot was named after a 1912 community confrontation that almost led to violence. According to differing versions of the story, the dispute was over:
*The design of a new steeple for the town&#x27;s only church,
*The issue of who should be allowed to preach there, or
*The conflicting land claims among church members.

Whatever the circumstances were, a small boy at the scene reportedly said he was scared and declared, &quot;I&#x27;m going to cut around the corner and shoot through the bushes in a minute!&quot; This statement apparently stayed in the residents&#x27; minds and was eventually adopted as the town&#x27;s name. &quot;Cut and Shoot&quot; has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

The town of Cut and Shoot gained fame when local boxer Roy Harris, a heavyweight contender, fought Floyd Patterson for the heavyweight title in 1958.

Postal Service granted a franchise post office to the town.

<text>Magnolia is a city in southwestern Montgomery County, Texas, United States within the Houston metropolitan area. It is named for the magnolia trees that grow in the area. The population was 2,359 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlement in the Magnolia area was a town named Mink Prairie, founded in about 1845 when a farmer named Mink built a homestead. By 1850, the town&#x27;s name was shortened to Mink. After the Civil War, Mink&#x27;s population swelled due to an influx of settlers from Kentucky and Tennessee, resulting in a post office being built in 1885. In 1902, the International-Great Northern Railroad (now operated by Union Pacific), decided to build a railroad to the north of Mink, causing most of the residents of Mink to move closer to the railroad line. The new town was named Melton in honor of a wealthy landowner who lived in the area. However, the postal service kept confusing the name with a different town called &quot;Milton,&quot; prompting local officials to change the name to Magnolia.

<text>Montgomery is a city located in Montgomery County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 1,948.

==History==

The town of Montgomery was founded in the middle of the Lake Creek Settlement by W. W. Shepperd in July 1837 on 200 acres of land that had originally been part of the John Corner League. Shepperd had established the first store in the Lake Creek Settlement in 1835. W. W. Shepperd and his partner John Wyatt Moody named the town Montgomery.

Montgomery became the first county seat of Montgomery County shortly after the county was created on December 14, 1837. Montgomery County was the third county formed during the Republic of Texas. The county originally extended from the Brazos River to the Trinity. The city was officially incorporated in 1848 with Judge Nathaniel Hart Davis as mayor.

===Etymology===
Local histories and accounts by 20th century historians held that the city and county of Montgomery were named after a family of early settlers to the area: Andrew Montgomery or Owen and Margaret Montgomery Shannon. However, recent evidence provided by Kameron Searle suggests that it is more likely that the town and county were named after Lemuel P. Montgomery, a major in the U.S. Army during the Creek War. John Wyatt Moody, one of the founders of Montgomery, was County Clerk of Montgomery County, Alabama before moving to Texas. Montgomery County, Alabama, is named for Lemuel P. Montgomery. Sam Houston, the President of the Republic of Texas when the town and county of Montgomery were founded, served in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend with Lemuel P. Montgomery, and witnessed his death in the front lines of the battle. According to Searle, Moody and his partner W.W. Shepperd may have used Houston&#x27;s connection with Lemuel Montgomery to help promote the creation of Montgomery County, with the town of Montgomery as the county seat.

===Birthplace of the Lone Star Flag?===
On July 7, 1922, Edmund B. Stewart, son of the early Montgomery settler Charles B. Stewart, claimed in a letter that his father had drafted the original design of the Lone Star Flag, enclosing what he claimed was his father&#x27;s draft of the flag&#x27;s design. To date, this letter and draft copy, along with claims by Stewart&#x27;s descendants, remain the only evidence currently known that Charles Stewart was the designer of the flag. In particular, the lack of evidence not directly tied to the Stewart family has caused many flag historians to question Stewart&#x27;s claim. As a legacy of the Stewart claim, the city of Montgomery describes itself as the &quot;birthplace of the Texas Lone Star Flag.&quot;

Westland Bunker

Ling-Chieh &quot;Louis&quot; Kung, the nephew of Soong Mei-ling, built an underground bunker in Montgomery, which was completed in 1982. Kung took money that he made from the success of the Westland Oil Development Corp. in the 1970s and used it to build the bunker, since he feared that the Soviet Union or the People&#x27;s Republic of China would launch nuclear weapons towards the United States. Kung bought hundreds of acres of cow pasture on the outskirts of Montgomery and secretly began building the bunker. The two story, bunker could house at least 700 people; Kung intended to have the bunker house his employees, their families, and others in case of a two-month emergency. Melanie Trottmann of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that the bunker &quot;was a source of intrigue and gossip for the town of Montgomery.&quot; After the oil bust in the 1980s, Kung lost the title to the property; Kung died in 1996. Trottman said that the bunker &quot;sat frozen in time&quot; until a group of investors bought the property.

<text>Invariance is a French magazine edited by Jacques Camatte, published since 1968.

It emerged from the Italian left-communist tradition associated with Amadeo Bordiga and it originally bore the subtitle &quot;Invariance of the theory of the proletariat&quot;, indicating Bordiga&#x27;s notion of the unchanging nature of communist theory. Invariance was instrumental in bringing unknown and obscure texts of the Communist Left (Bordiga and the Italian Left, Gorter and Pannekoek from the Dutch-German Left, as well as many others, including Lukacs and Sylvia Pankhurst) to the attention of the &#x27;68 generation. It also played a major -albeit largely unknown- role in the 1970&#x27;s crises and dissolution of councilist organisations such as ICO in France and Solidarity in the UK. However, around 1972-75 it broke with many of the tenets of Bordigism and Marxism per se, arguing that in the aftermath of May &#x27;68 there was no longer any potential for the working class to escape the domination of capital through revolution. Instead it began to take the line that humanity itself had become &quot;domesticated&quot; by the rule of capital and the only solution was to &quot;leave this world&quot;, a view which came to influence Fredy Perlman, John Zerzan and others in their development of Anarcho-primitivism. It was this radical shift in orientation which caused many of its critics to observe: &quot;nothing varies more than &quot;Invariance&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Invariance&quot; is now in its fifth series and appears sporadically. Every cover features the same image of a tree (held to represent that &quot;all is life&quot;), and on the back the phrase: &quot;Time is the invention of men incapable of love&quot;.

<text>Patton Village is a city in Montgomery County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,647 at the 2020 census. It is located in Greater Houston.

==History==
A man named H. L. Patton founded the community. Patton Village was developed, beginning in the 1960s. Patton remained in control of Patton Village during its development and its incorporation as a municipality in 1966.

By 1970, Patton Village reported that it had 667 people. The population steadily increased over the following three decades. Patton Village became a bedroom community for Houston. In the late 1970s, H. L. Patton lost control of the development, due to age. Bruce Nichols of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said that &quot;Several people familiar with the town said troubles began in Patton Village after founding father H.L. Patton [...] lost control.&quot;

In 1985, the city instituted a small property tax. In 1986, after most residents refused to pay the tax, the city repealed it. In 1988, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Devaney, the mayor of Patton Village, said &quot;Property values are zero. Nobody wants to buy here.&quot; H. L. Patton died at age 100 in February 1989.

In 1989, Bruce Nichols of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said that the community &quot;may be the most squabble-prone small town in Texas. Council meetings regularly become shouting matches. Officials frequently resign or are impeached.&quot; Nichols pointed to the firing and rehiring of police chief Bruce Nichols and to a town judge, who later was forced to leave his post, who pleaded no contest to clearing a woman&#x27;s speeding ticket in exchange for solicited sex. In 1988 state prosecutors indicted 76-year-old Floyd Duval, the municipal court judge, for official oppression after soliciting sex from a 21-year-old woman from Splendora as compensation for a traffic ticket fine. Three weeks before Thursday May 26, 1988, the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct suspended Duval&#x27;s license. On May 24, 1988, 36-year-old Lynn Coleman, a lawyer from New Caney and a former Montgomery County assistant attorney, replaced Duval as the municipal court judge. In 1988, a former mayor of Patton Village had been charged with killing his wife and her male companion.

In 2008, Pamela Munoz became the mayor of Patton Village after the previous mayor died. On Tuesday October 4, 2011, federal investigators raided Munoz&#x27;s offices at city hall. A search warrant from Montgomery County said that she had used $1,500 municipal funds to rent large dumpsters that were used at her and her mother&#x27;s houses. Munoz said that the dumpsters had been placed around the city for municipal purposes, and that the investigators were motivated by racism.

On Friday February 24, 2012, Munoz, city secretary Georgia Simons, municipal court clerk Patricia Edmondson, and four municipal police officers were indicted for criminal charges. After a six-month investigation, the Montgomery County District Attorney&#x27;s office accused them of using police cars, which had been purchased with federal grant money, as collateral to get loans which they used for personal purposes. Due to the arrests, Patton Village city hall closed early that day. After the arrests, the remaining municipal government called for a special session. When city residents found that they were not permitted to address the meeting, many residents walked out before the meeting ended. On Friday, May 10, 2013, Munoz was sentenced to five years in prison.

=== &quot;Speed trap&quot; history ===
At one point Patton Village had established a &quot;speed trap&quot; along what is now Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59, the main route between Lufkin and Splendora. It became the main source of revenue for the community. The stretch was annexed by the city in 1971. Originally the town was on a two lane road that Steve Weller of the &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel&quot; said was a &quot;road going nowhere&quot;. Therefore, Patton Village did not have much through traffic. The leaders annexed the stretch of US 59, around west of the highway, so it could have through traffic which it could generate revenues from. At one point Patton Village used unmarked police cars with radar equipment in order to catch cars speeding. Bruce Nichols of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said in 1988 that the community &quot;is probably best known for its reputation as a speed trap, which Patton Village leaders say they&#x27;re trying to overcome.&quot; When the &quot;speed trap&quot; was active, there were 1,100 citations issued by Patton Village authorities per month.

H. L. Patton had criticized the Patton Village for relying on the speed trap. E. A. Ramsey, the municipal judge, agreed with Patton, saying that the stretch of highway in which the speed trap was located was not in the corporate limits of Patton Village. In December 1981 the Patton Village municipal court refused to prosecute motorists who had been ticketed in that speed trap. This caused severe financial issues in the community; the city did not provide W-2 forms for its municipal employees by the designated deadlines. At one point H. L. Patton had sued the city, accusing then current police chief C. B. &quot;Bud&quot; Watson, former town police chief Johnny Naquin, and former police officer Collier Wright of maliciously and willfully confiscating six of Patton&#x27;s vehicles; the municipal government had been using those six. On the week of February 6, 1982, H. L. Patton had won his suit, and the jury awarded him $12,700 in actual damages and $30,000 in exemplary damages. H. L. Patton announced that he would be willing to forfeit the winnings from the lawsuit pay to rescue the Patton Village municipality from the shortfall.

In 1987, a newly passed law limited speeding ticket charges from small towns to $20. According to Texas House of Representatives member Keith Valigura, a Republican of Conroe, said that Patton Village police decided to do roadside inspections with every speeding driver so that the police department could bill drivers for other violations.

The newly elected mayor, 66-year-old Robert Devaney, announced on Tuesday May 17, 1988 that he was going to shut down the municipal court that had processed speeding tickets. Ninety percent of Patton Village&#x27;s revenues had originated from the &quot;speed traps&quot; processed by the court and enforced by the then 20-member Patton Village Police Department. The department had continued to maintain a speed trap along U.S. Route 59. Devaney criticized the community for relying on &quot;speed trap&quot; revenues and said that his community may give amnesty to drivers with speeding tickets and that it may be able to reduce the police budget since it no longer uses the speed trap. Devaney also requested for an audit and an investigation. Devaney and the Patton Village city council members closed the Patton Village marshal&#x27;s office; that agency served warrants. Devaney said that after the audit was completed, the marshal&#x27;s office would reopen with fewer staff members.

In 1989, Valigura promoted House Bill 243, which would force municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents each to only have traffic ticket revenues account for 30% of each municipality budget. Patton Village was in District 16, Valigura&#x27;s district. In response to the proposed bill, Judy Lennon, the Patton Village mayor, lobbied in an attempt to have the bill blocked. On Wednesday May 10, 1989, the Texas House passed the bill with no opposition. Weller said that &quot; jealous citizens of nearby Humble, Conroe and Cut and Shoot&quot; had pressured Texas state legislators into passing the bill. In response, the police chief, David Broussard, engaged in a hunger strike, supposedly only drinking &quot;...coffee, water and an occasional beer...&quot;, for 12 days beginning on May 24, 1989. Broussard hoped to cajole Governor of Texas Bill Clements into vetoing the bill. Lloyd Oliver, the city attorney of Patton Village, threatened to legally challenge Valigura&#x27;s bill in court and said that it &quot;discriminates against towns under 5,000 population.&quot; Ultimately Clements signed the bill into law. The pre-Valigura law 1989 Patton Village budget had a projection of $297,700 in total revenues, with 79%, $236,000, to originate from the municipal court issuing citations. Valigura&#x27;s law took effect on September 1.

Since then, the Patton Village authorities have tried to remake the community&#x27;s image. As of June 1989, police officer vehicles had rooftop lights, and police officers no longer hide in underbrush. From January–October 2016, the city handed out 3,404 tickets and citations, totaling $525,000.

<text>The Woodlands is a special-purpose district and census-designated place (CDP) in the U.S. state of Texas in the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan statistical area. The Woodlands is primarily located in Montgomery County, with portions extending into Harris County. The Woodlands is governed by The Woodlands Township, an organization that provides municipal services and is administered by an elected board of directors. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the township had a population of 114,436 people.

In 2021, The Howard Hughes Corporation estimated the population of The Woodlands was 119,000. The United States Census Bureau defines an urban area separate from the Houston urban area with The Woodlands as a principal city: The Woodlands–Conroe, TX urban area had a 2020 population of 402,454, making it the 103rd largest in the United States.

The Woodlands is located north of Houston along Interstate 45. Though it began as an exurban development and a bedroom community, it has also attracted corporations and has several corporate campuses, most notably Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Chevron Phillips Chemical, Huntsman Corporation, Woodforest National Bank, Baker Hughes, McKesson Specialty Health, and Halliburton. The community won a Special Award for Excellence in 1994 from the Urban Land Institute.

==History==
===Early history===
The area that is now The Woodlands was used by the Akokisa and Bidai peoples, who relied on the fresh water of Spring Creek. In 1984, construction in the Indian Springs neighborhood near the creek discovered Bidai artifacts.

=== Foundation and growth ===
The Woodlands was conceived after the oil industry investor George P. Mitchell attended a symposium by the Rouse Company subsidiary American City Corporation and developer of Columbia, Maryland, on how to develop new towns using the HUD Title VII program. It was dedicated by George P. Mitchell in 1974 and managed by The Woodlands Corporation as an extension of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development. Mitchell, an oil businessman, planned to establish a conference center, hotels, office parks, retail malls, schools, large distribution centers, and golf courses. Houses would range from moderately priced to expensive and large. Bill Schadewald of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said that Mitchell wanted the development to &quot;entice city slickers looking for far-flung suburban quality of life&quot;. Schadewald said that local sources stated that the HUD New Town program, a federally funded program, had a &quot;low survival rate&quot; and questioned whether The Woodlands would succeed.

The Woodlands Corporation was acquired on July 31, 1997, by a partnership between Morgan Stanley and Crescent Real Estate Equities.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEC Filings 7/31/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Rouse Company acquired Crescent&#x27;s interest,&lt;ref name=&quot;SEC Filings 11/12/03&quot;&gt; SEC Edgar document through SECinfo.com. (Link from Google Cache)&lt;/ref&gt; and Rouse was bought by General Growth Properties on November 12, 2004. In 2011, The Woodlands was sold to the Howard Hughes Development Corporation.

The land was previously occupied by the Grogan-Cochran Lumber Mill, hence Grogan&#x27;s Mill and Cochran&#x27;s Crossing neighborhoods, called &quot;villages&quot;. The original planning utilized many of the planning concepts and design consultants employed in other well-regarded new communities of that era such as Columbia, Maryland, Irvine Ranch, California, and Reston, Virginia. The original development plan included environmental design principles espoused by Ian McHarg, a distinguished landscape architect, teacher and author of the seminal work &quot;Design With Nature&quot;.

In 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau designated the area around The Woodlands and Conroe as a &quot;large urbanized transit area&quot;, defined as having over 200,000 residents, making it eligible to receive federal transportation funds.

===Incorporation as a city===
Mitchell&#x27;s original plan was for The Woodlands to be annexed by the city of Houston. However, as the community developed and grew, there was little support for that idea. In the middle part of the 2000s, some residents organized to prevent any annexation, as had happened to the Kingwood development almost a decade before. To counteract any possible move by the city, a movement began to create an independent city government. However, the formation of an independent government would require authorization by the State of Texas and the City of Houston, as Houston held extraterritorial jurisdiction over the area.

In 2007, two state legislators representing The Woodlands, Sen. Tommy Williams and Rep. Robert Eissler, introduced two bills that were enacted in the 2007 Legislature – House Bill 4109 and Senate Bill 1012. HB 4109 called for a vote to allow expansion of an existing improvement district (now The Woodlands Township) and to allow The Woodlands to collect sales tax, while SB 1012 allowed for the creation of regional agreements between governments. The passage of these bills allows an opportunity for The Woodlands to incorporate itself until 2057. Since 2019, there has been formal discussion of The Woodlands to become an incorporated city. However, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these plans were put on hold and resumed in April 2021. In 2020, residents of The Woodlands formed the TownshipFuture PAC. In a referendum on November 2, 2021, residents voted against incorporation by a wide margin, keeping The Woodlands as a township for the foreseeable future.

==Geography==

The Woodlands is primarily in Montgomery County, with a small portion in Harris County, bordering Houston. According to the United States Census Bureau, The Woodlands has an area of , of which are land and , or 1.32%, are water.

The Woodlands is in a heavily forested area, and much of the community has retained trees for shade and decoration. The terrain is essentially flat, with the exception of topographic variations ranging from 125 to 175 feet above sea level between Spring Creek and Flintridge Drive.

=== Villages ===

The Woodlands is organized into eight villages, which are subdivided into neighborhoods. Each village features varying amenities including parks, hike and bike trails, golfing, commercial centers, and a range of residential properties from single family to estates.
The Town Center includes shopping and eating facilities, corporate offices, and a waterway modeled after the San Antonio River Walk. The Research Forest district includes a Park and Ride facility and The Woodlands Township Town Hall.

<doc id="136403" wikidata="Q980252" url="?curid=136403" title="Willis, Texas">
<text>Willis is a city in Montgomery County, Texas, United States, located eight miles north of Conroe in north central Montgomery County. The city began to develop in 1870 after what is now the Union Pacific Railroad built track through the area. As a part of the Piney Woods, the Willis economy has historically been driven by lumber, agriculture, and the manufacture of lumber and agriculture equipment. From the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, it produced tobacco as a commodity crop. Competition from Cuba reduced its contribution to the economy.

As of 2020, the population of Willis was tabulated as 6,431. In 2008, after Willis&#x27;s population passed 5,000, the city established a home rule city charter.

==Geography==

Willis is located at (30.422640, –95.478829).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Before the founding of Willis, most residents in the area lived in a settlement known as Danville, formed in the 1830s four miles west of present-day New Waverly. A few Danville residents in the 1850s settled to the south, founding the new community of what is now Willis.

Several of these early Danville residents were large planters, who held numerous enslaved African Americans to work the labor-intensive tobacco crops on their plantations. In the 1850s, enslaved African Americans outnumbered whites in Danville: there were 600 slaves and 400 whites. After the Civil War, many freedmen and their families moved away from the plantations to the Willis area. There in 1867 they established Thomas Chapel United Methodist Church, which is the oldest church in Willis.

In 1870, the Houston and Great Northern Railroad (now the Union Pacific Railroad) decided to build a railroad through Montgomery County. After residents of Danville refused to allow the railway through their town, Peter J. and Richard S. Willis donated a parcel of their landholdings in Montgomery County so the railroad and station stop could be built there. They founded the town of Willis in the process. Upon the railroad&#x27;s completion in 1872, many residents of Danville, Old Waverly, and Montgomery moved to the new town of Willis.

In 1874, a county election was held to determine whether the county seat of Montgomery County should be transferred from the town of Montgomery to Willis. Although Willis received more votes (788 to 646), it did not gain the requisite two-thirds majority, so the county seat remained officially in Montgomery. A protracted legal battle ended in 1878 when the Supreme Court of Texas ruled in favor of Montgomery. With several county officials and Willis residents refusing to accept the results, another county seat election was held in 1880. That year Montgomery won the vote over Willis, 1308 to 1243. The dispute between the two towns finally ended in 1889, when Conroe was selected as the county seat.

In the 1870s, the main occupations were farming, shipping, and the manufacture of lumber and agricultural products. In 1891, local Willis residents started growing Cuban tobacco, and Willis developed as a center for the production of cigars and other tobacco products. During the early years of the Great Depression, Willis suffered from falling demand in lumber products and a sharp decline in the demand for tobacco products. A man named Tom Payne was lynched in Willis in 1927.

The economy began to recover in 1931 during the Texas oil boom, when oil was discovered in the area. In the 1930s and 40s, the development of U.S. Route 75, along with the recovery of the lumber industry during World War II, fully revitalized the local economy.

In the mid to late 20th century through the present, agriculture and lumber remain vital components of the Willis economy, in addition to the retail, service, and manufacturing industries.

<text>Dumas ( ) is a city and the county seat of Moore County, Texas, United States. The population was 14,501 at the 2020 census. Located approximately 40 miles north of Amarillo, the city is named for its founder, Louis Dumas (1856–1923). Dumas Avenue, the main thoroughfare, is also United States Highways 87 and 287.

Window on the Plains Museum, which offers exhibits on Moore County and the Texas Panhandle, is located on South Dumas Avenue, the main thoroughfare. Dumas is home to Moore County Airport, a general-aviation airport two miles west of the central business district.

<text>Sunray is a city in northeastern Moore County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,707 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Sunray, Texas, was founded by Jack Clarence Collins. He was born in Hartley, Texas, in 1893, and in 1902 moved to Channing with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. E.S. Collins. Jack graduated from Channing High School and later, in 1916, from Texas A&amp;M, where he was class valedictorian and class president in his senior year. Later, he served for several years as cashier of the First National Bank of Channing while extending his family&#x27;s ranch holdings. Mr. Collins was well-known and respected in ranching and financial circles, and was a ranking member of the Republican Party for several years.

Jack Collins did not call the town &quot;Sunray&quot; when he laid it out in 1930. The first lots were sold at $10 each under the name &quot;Altman&quot;, but it was discovered that a town in Rusk County had already appropriated that name, hence, the name &quot;Sunray&quot; was used. A post office was applied for on May 5, 1930, using the name &quot;Altman&quot;, but because of the duplication, &quot;Sunray&quot; was not approved until 1935.

The change to the name &quot;Sunray&quot; came because Sunray Oil Company (later Sunoco) set up a gas-oil refinery near the town on of land originally donated by Mr. Collins to Dana Oil &amp; Gas Royalty Company. Sunray Oil Company bought the holdings of Dana in the early Jones Field in northeastern Moore County, which was near the new town. The townsite location was determined by a new Rock Island Railroad route running from Dalhart to Morse along the northern edge of Mr. Collins&#x27;s townsite survey. At the time, the town was from the Jones Well and from the Morton oil well—both early oil-gas discoveries in Moore County.

On Sunday, July 29, 1956, the nearby industrial plant was the site of a major accident. The McKee refinery fire killed 19 firefighters when a storage tank suffered a vapor explosion.

<text>Omaha is a city in Morris County, northeast Texas, United States. The population as of the 2022 estimates was 1,403.

==History==

This area of Texas had been lightly settled under Spanish and Mexican rule. It was primarily settled after annexation by the United States by migrants from the South, many of whom arrived before the American Civil War. In that period, farmers had established cotton plantations. It was also an area of pine forests.

Omaha was first named as Morristown in 1880 by former Confederate Lieutenant Thompson Morris; it was a stop on the new St. Louis Southwestern Railway, which spurred the town&#x27;s development as a trading center. The US Post Office had changed the name to Gavett. In 1886, a group of seven men from Randolph County, Alabama drew names from a hat to pick a new name; the winner, Hugh Ellis, was allowed to rename the settlement after a town in his home state, and he chose Omaha.

&quot;By 1890 Omaha had three churches, a school, a weekly newspaper, and a population of 450.&quot; The town was incorporated in 1914. A new enterprise of raising vegetable-plant seedlings for sale developed in the area. During the twentieth century, Omaha was the site of a shipping operation that sent millions of these seedlings to destinations throughout the United States. &quot;In 1980 it had a population of 960 and twenty-three rated businesses&quot;, reaching nearly 1,000 by the end of the 20th century.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. There are 966.2 people per square mile.

==Demographics==


As of the 2022 American Community Survey, there were 1,403 people and 492 households in the city, with an average of 2.8 persons per household.

The Matador Ranch was consolidated in 1882 by a Scottish syndicate, and a post office opened at Matador in 1886.

At the end of the 19th century, townspeople freed the community from domination by the Matador Ranch, which was liquidated in 1951, by relocating nonranch families there and electing their own slate of officials.

The community was incorporated in 1912 and made the county seat. The state required that a town have at least 20 businesses. Local ranch hands hence established fraudulent, temporary businesses using ranch supplies. The only real business in Matador at the time was a saloon.

Its highest population, 1,376, was reached in 1940.

==Area attractions==


===Hotel Matador===
Originally the Carter Hotel, the Hotel Matador was built in 1914 by Roy Carter and his wife, the former Jessie Simpson. For a rural area, the hotel had luxurious rooms with a bell hop, a full-time gardener, and laundry service. It had 15 rooms, a dining room, and a large 9-foot, oak-rimmed tub as the only bathroom in the facility. An ice cream parlor, which ran the length of the lobby, operated until the 1920s.

The name &quot;Hotel Matador&quot; was coined in the 1920s. The hotel changed owners several times. Under the direction of Judge C.B. Whitten, it was a community gathering place for meetings, parties, and dances for young people. In 1941, hotelier and barber Warren Clements purchased the property. He turned the ice cream parlor into a barber shop. He also established living quarters for his wife, Faye, and himself, with an apartment behind the hotel. Mrs. Clements maintained an English garden cultivating prize irises, and under her tutelage, the hotel was known for its entertainment.

In 1980, Johnny (Sonny) and Evelyn Jackson purchased the hotel and restyled it into apartments. It later became a single residence, but had been abandoned for five years when three sisters took possession and began reclaiming and restoring the historic facility. The sisters, Marilyn Hicks, Linda Roy, and Caron Perkins, operate the Matador as an eight-unit bed and breakfast. The barber shop was converted to the Circle Cross Heritage suite, with the original tin ceiling and elaborate bathroom fixtures.

===Traweek House===
Albert Carroll Traweek, Sr., (1875–1959) was a physician in Matador, originally from Fort Worth, known as the &quot;pneumonia doctor&quot; for his success in treating patients with that sometimes fatal illness. He was the first Motley County public health officer and established the Traweek Hospital, now the Motley County Historical Museum. In 1915, Dr. Traweek began construction on the Traweek Home, designed by Charles Stephen Oates, Traweek&#x27;s uncle and a noted builder in West Texas. The two-story stuccoed masonry structure was completed in 1916 at a cost of $14,000. It is a hybrid of Classical Renaissance, Prairie, and Classical Revival architecture.
Among the visitors to the Traweek House was Baldwin Parker, a son of Quanah Parker, the last Comanche chief, as well as state and national officials. The house at 927 Lariat Street in Matador remains in the Traweek family. It received an official historical medallion in 1964 and was designated in 1990 as a Texas Historic Landmark. Dr. Traweek and his wife, the former Allie Rainey, had six children. The house was last occupied by their youngest son, Howard Traweek (1912–1988), the county attorney for five decades, and his wife, the former Eleanor Mitchell (1922–1998).

===Bob&#x27;s Oil Well===
Luther Bedford &quot;Bob&quot; Robertson (1894–1947), a native of Greenville, Texas, came to Matador in the 1920s. Originally a service-station attendant, he opened his own Conoco gasoline business, which he topped with a decorative wooden oil derrick. He patented his design, and in 1939, he replaced the wooden derrick with one of steel. It stood 84 ft in height and was lighted.

Robertson advertised his business in unusual ways, having maintained a cage of live rattlesnakes for the amusement of tourists. He later added a small zoo of lions, monkeys, and coyotes, and a white buffalo. He paid long-distance truckers to place advertising signs at strategic points across the United States. The signs noted the mileage to Bob&#x27;s Oil Well in Matador. Matador is equidistant from Dallas and Carlsbad, New Mexico, and 9 miles (14 km) closer to Denver than to El Paso. Robertson soon expanded his operation to include a grocery store, café, and garage. He was also a Matador civic leader who sought to recognize returning veterans from World War II.

Robertson died in 1947, two weeks before a high wind toppled the steel derrick that had been his trademark. His widow, the former Olga Cunningham (1904–1993), restored it in 1949 with even more prominent lights. Ultimately, the business failed, and attempts by others to revive it were short-lived. At the intersection of U.S. Route 70 and State Highway 70, the site serves as a reminder of a time when bold roadside architecture was only beginning, and of a man who promoted his adopted hometown in extraordinary ways.

<doc id="136419" wikidata="Q970482" url="?curid=136419" title="Nacogdoches, Texas">
<text>Nacogdoches ( ) is a city in East Texas and the county seat of Nacogdoches County, Texas, United States. The 2020 U.S. census recorded the city&#x27;s population at 32,147. Stephen F. Austin State University is located in Nacogdoches and specializes in forestry and agriculture. Nacogdoches is also known as &quot;The Oldest Town in Texas&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===

Evidence of settlement in the area dates back to 10,000 years ago. Nacogdoches is on or near the site of Nevantin, the primary village of the Nacogdoche tribe of Caddo Indians. 

The name, Nacogdoches, originates from the Caddo-speaking Native American tribe &quot;Nacogdoche&quot;, and the area remained a Caddo Indian settlement until the early 19th century. In 1716, Spain established a mission there, Misión Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, the first European construction in the area. The &quot;town&quot; of Nacogdoches got started after the French had vacated the region (1760s, following the French and Indian War), and Spanish officials decided that maintaining the mission was too costly. In 1772, they ordered all settlers in the area to move to San Antonio. Some were eager to escape the wilderness, but others had to be forced from their homes by soldiers. It was one of the original European settlements in the region, populated by Adaeseños from Fort Los Adaes.
Colonel Antonio Gil Y&#x27;Barbo, a Spanish trader, emerged as the leader of the settlers, and in the spring of 1779, he led a group back to Nacogdoches. Later that summer, Nacogdoches received designation from Spain as a &quot;pueblo&quot;. Y&#x27;Barbo, as lieutenant governor of the new town, established the rules and laws for local government. He laid out streets with the intersecting El Camino Real (now State Highway 21) and La Calle del Norte/North Street (now Business U.S. Highway 59-F) as the central point. On the main thoroughfare, he built a stone house for use in his trading business. The house, or Old Stone Fort as it is known today, became a gateway from the United States to the Texas frontier.

===1800s===

The city has been under more flags than the state of Texas, claiming nine flags. In addition to the Six Flags of Texas, it also flew under the flags of the Magee-Gutierrez Republic, the Long Republic, and the Fredonian Rebellion. People from the United States began moving to settle in Nacogdoches in 1820, and Texas&#x27;s first English-language newspaper was published there.
However, the first newspaper published (in the 1700s) was in Spanish. An edition of that newspaper is preserved and shown at the local museum.

In 1832, the Battle of Nacogdoches brought many local settlers together, as they united in their stand to support a federalist form of government. Their successful venture drove the Mexican military from East Texas.
Thomas Jefferson Rusk was one of the most prominent early Nacogdoches Anglo settlers. A veteran of the Texas Revolution, hero of San Jacinto, he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence and was secretary of war during the Republic of Texas. He was president of the Texas Statehood Commission and served as one of the first two Texas U.S. Senators along with Sam Houston. He worked to establish Nacogdoches University, which operated from 1845 to 1895. The Old Nacogdoches University Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Rusk suffered from depression as a result of the untimely death of his wife and killed himself on July 29, 1857.

Sam Houston lived in Nacogdoches for four years prior to the Texas Revolution (1836) and opened a law office downtown. He courted Anna Raguet, daughter of one of the leading citizens, but Anna rejected him after finding that he was not divorced from his first wife Eliza Allen of Tennessee.

William Goins (Goyens, Goings, Going), the son of a white mother and black father, operated a local inn, trucking service, and blacksmith works and maintained a plantation outside Nacogdoches on Goins Hill. He was married to a white woman and owned slaves. He was appointed as an agent to trade with the Cherokees and was prominent in providing assistance to the Texas Army during the Revolution.
Adolphus Sterne was a merchant of German Jewish extraction who maintained the finest home in town. His frequent visitors included Sam Houston, Thomas Rusk, Chief Bowles and David Crockett, so his diary is one of the best sources for early Nacogdoches history.

Nacogdoches also contains one of the last surviving family-owned homestead plantations in East Texas, the August Tubbe Plantation, owned and operated by the same family which established it in 1859. August Tubbe was a German-born immigrant, who with his elderly mother, left Germany in 1858 and arrived in Nacogdoches by 1859. Their lives are recounted in several books, including a historical fiction novel by Gisela Laudi entitled &quot;I am Justina Tubbe&quot;. Tubbe plantation is historically significant in the formation of early life in East Texas, not only in its cotton and sugarcane, but also because it later played an important part in milled-lumber production. Tubbe Sawmill was actually the first water-, and then steam-powered, sawmill in Nacogdoches. During renovations of the Cason-Monk buildings in the early 21st century, boards stamped with Tubbe Mill logos made dating the building possible. The estate contains one of the largest privately-owned genealogical archives pertaining to the Tubbe family in existence, providing important insight into early settlers&#x27; life during the 19th century. The family has been featured in a number of German museums including the Expo2000 in Bremerhaven Germany. The estate and archives are privately owned and maintained by a descendant of its original founder, and are currently available for study through private appointment only. The Tubbe family is considered to be one of the &quot;founding families&quot; of Nacogdoches, making their mark in many ways spanning over 150 years. August Tubbe was responsible for not only his large plantation, sawmill, and participation in Milam Masonic Lodge, but also is credited with bringing the now defunct Texas and New Orleans Railroad spur into town. Tubbe estate as a whole is now owned and managed by Thomas VonAugust Tubbe-Brown, the fifth-generation grandson of August Tubbe.

In 1859, the first oil well in Texas began operation here, but it was never so well known as Spindletop, drilled in 1901 near Beaumont. Lyne Taliaferro Barret began this operation, which was interrupted by the American Civil War. However, after the war, Barret returned to Oil Springs, an area about east of Nacogdoches, to resume his project by acquiring another drilling contract in 1865. Barret struck oil on September 12, 1866, at a depth of . The well produced around 10 barrels of oil per day, but was recorded to produce a range of 8 to 40 barrels. In 1868, the price of oil dropped so low that Barret lost his financial backing, and was forced to resign from the project. The fields then lay dormant for another 20 years, until 1889, when various drilling companies had 40 wells on the site. The site was never very productive, only yielding 54 barrels in 1890. However, it remains the first and oldest oil well in Texas, with production being recorded into the 1950s.

===1900s–present===
In 1912, the Marx Brothers came to town to perform their singing act at the old Opera House (now the SFA Cole Art Center). Their performance was interrupted by a man who came inside shouting, &quot;Runaway mule!&quot; Most of the audience left the building, and when they filed back in, Julius (later known as Groucho) began insulting them, saying &quot;Nacogdoches is full of roaches!&quot; and &quot;The jackass is the flower of Tex-ass!&quot; Instead of becoming angry, audience members laughed. Soon afterward, Julius and his brothers decided to try their hand at comedy instead of singing, at which they had barely managed to scrape together a living. A plaque commemorating the event is posted in downtown Nacogdoches. 

On January 4, 1946, a violent tornado devastated part of the city, killing ten people and injuring 200 others. Tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis estimated the intensity of the tornado to have been F4 on the Fujita scale.

In the edition of March 8, 1950, of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, Marx said, &quot;I was once pinched in Nacogdoches for playing euchre on the front porch of a hotel. It happened to be on a Sunday. You&#x27;re not allowed to play euchre in Nacogdoches on a Sunday. As a matter of fact, the way I played it they shouldn&#x27;t have allowed it on Saturday, either.&quot; Marx would often mention Nacogdoches in the show if any contestant came from Texas.
In 1997, singer Willie Nelson came to Nacogdoches to perform with his friend, Paul Buskirk, a mandolin player. During his stay, Nelson recorded a number of jazz songs at Encore Studios. In 2004, he released those recordings on an album called &quot;Nacogdoches&quot;.

On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; broke up during re-entry, depositing debris across Texas. Much of the debris landed in the Nacogdoches area, and much of the media coverage of the recovery efforts focused on Nacogdoches.

On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita struck Nacogdoches as a category-1 hurricane. Nacogdoches experienced the same problems Houston was having because of the unprecedented number of people evacuating the Houston-Galveston area. The city&#x27;s local shelters were already overwhelmed with evacuees who had come from New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina. Long lines at gas stations and shortages of supplies, food, and fuel were widespread. Many Houstonians took the Eastex Freeway (U.S. Highway 59) (future Interstate 69) out of Houston to evacuate through East Texas. As a result of Hurricane Rita, U.S. Highway 59 has been designated as an evacuation route by TXDOT, with all of its lanes to be used for contraflow traffic. Nacogdoches was designated as the north-end terminus of the contraflow/evacuation route.

On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike struck Nacogdoches as a category-1 hurricane.

Nacogdoches hosts the Texas Blueberry Festival on the second Saturday in June. The community is one of the first Texas Certified Retirement Communities. The community celebrates a host of other events year round which can be found by going to visitnacogdoches.com

Once a Democratic stronghold, Nacogdoches has in recent years moved steadily toward the Republican Party, being represented in the United States Congress and the Texas State Legislature by Republicans. The city, in general, is very moderate with the co-existence of students of Stephen F. Austin with a liberal left-of-center persuasion and conservative right-of-center city residents.

Nacogdoches has been in the Texas Main Street Program since 1998. Nacogdoches&#x27; downtown was named the &quot;Best Historic Venue&quot; by &quot;Texas Meetings and Events&quot; magazine. Nacogdoches was nominated as one of the &quot;Friendliest Towns in America&quot; by Rand McNally and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

Nacogdoches is the headquarters of the Texas Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, the Air Force Auxiliary.

<text>Corsicana is a city in and the county seat of Navarro County, Texas, United States. It is located on Interstate 45, 50 miles southeast of Dallas. Its population was 25,109 at the 2020 census. Corsicana is considered an important agribusiness center.

==History==

Founded in 1848, Corsicana was named by José Antonio Navarro after the Mediterranean island of Corsica, the birthplace of his father. He had died when Navarro and his many siblings were young. The first school opened shortly afterwards in 1849.

Women&#x27;s groups have had a strong role throughout the history of the city. They established the Corsicana Female Literary Institute, a school that operated from 1857 through 1870. The first public library in Corsicana opened in 1901 by effort of the women&#x27;s clubs of the city. A 1905 library matching gift by Andrew Carnegie gave the library a permanent home and its first full-time, professionally trained librarian. The library today is housed in a dedicated building downtown and boasts more than 52,283 books, 6,306 audio materials, 783 video materials, and 122 serial subscriptions.

The Corsicana YMCA was founded in 1884, and has grown with patron funding. In its earliest days, it was supported by George Taylor Jester (1847–1922), a wealthy dry-goods and cotton distributor, banker, and politician. He served as lieutenant governor of Texas (1895–1899), and his son Beauford H. Jester served as governor (1947–1949).

Oil was accidentally discovered in June, 1894, by the American Well and Prospecting Company, hired by the Corsicana Water Development Company, when oil seeped into an artesian well being drilled within the city limits. In October 1895, the first commercial oil well was drilled by the Corsicana Oil Development Company, founded by Ralph Beaton, H.G. Damon, and John Davidson. It was the first commercially significant oilfield find in Texas. A refinery was in operation by January 1899, through the efforts of Joseph S. Cullinan. The Powell oil field was discovered in 1900, a few miles east of Corsicana. Rotary drilling, used to drill water wells, was introduced to the oil industry by M.C. Baker and C.E. Baker, with tools manufactured by the American Well and Prospecting machine shop, owned by N.G. Johnson, E.H. Akin, and Charles Rittersbacker.

During World War II, an airman flying school called Corsicana Air Field trained thousands of pilots.

<text>Kerens is a city in Navarro County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,505 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Kerens was established in 1881 when the St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas was built through the county, according to the Texas Handbook of History, and was named for Judge Richard C. Kerens of St. Louis. The railroad bypassed the nearby settlement of Wadeville, and within a short time all of the businesses from Wadeville moved to the new town. By the mid-1890s, the handbook said, the town had three cotton gin-mills, four grocery stores, two hotels, two drug stores, a wagonmaker, and a weekly newspaper named the &quot;Navarro Blade&quot;.

Big Tex, the giant icon of the State Fair of Texas, had his beginnings in Kerens. In 1949, residents built a Santa Claus constructed from iron drill casing and papier mache to help encourage holiday sales. In 1951, State Fair president R. L. Thornton purchased Santa&#x27;s components for $750 and had Dallas artist Jack Bridges transform them into a cowboy for the annual fair.

<text>Mustang is a town in Navarro County, Texas, United States. Its population was zero according to the 2020 census. It is one of 9 incorporated communities in the United States with no reported residents. In December 2021, Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, purchased the town for roughly $2 million.

==Geography==

Mustang is situated at the northeastern corner of the junction of Interstate 45 and FM 739 in central Navarro County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

Mustang was incorporated in 1973 for the purpose of selling alcohol in what was then a dry Navarro County. The incorporation effort was led by partners William &quot;Bill&quot; McKie, a former Corsicana city attorney, and Harold &quot;Mack&quot; McElhenney, a businessman. On October 30, 1973, the town approved beer sales. In a March 25, 1975, election, residents voted 20–0 in favor of selling hard liquor, as well as mixed beverages. Mustang had a population of 12 in the 1980 Census, which grew to 35 in 1990. By the mid-1990s, the town lost its status as the primary alcohol stop in the county, as other nearby communities began to repeal their blue laws.

The population of Mustang rose to 47 in 2000. Town founder Bill McKie negotiated a deal to sell Mustang to Tommy Sinclair, who leased a club in the community, on June 5, 2005, for $600,000. The transaction was not completed, however, and Sinclair filed a lawsuit in October 2005 for the right to buy the property. McKie died on November 11, 2005, and his wife Marsha took over legal proceedings on her late husband&#x27;s behalf. Since McKie&#x27;s death, legal wrangling over ownership of the town and financial issues have plagued Mustang. In November 2006, the city of Angus threatened to cut off water service to the community over an unpaid bill that totaled $3,400. Mrs. McKie, acting on the town&#x27;s behalf, personally paid the bill. The case over ownership went back to court in April 2007. Four months later, Sinclair was given possession of Mustang, but not the deed. He promptly evicted many of the town council, as well as the city secretary and fire chief. The evictions went to court in November 2007 and a majority of the council left town, but refused to resign their posts. In February 2008, the two council members living in residence called for an election to be held that coming May. The town&#x27;s disputed ownership status led to the holding of two separate council elections on May 10, 2008. The first election, endorsed by Tommy Sinclair, elected a mayor and five aldermen. The vote was canvassed on May 17. In the second called election, three aldermen positions were left open. Those results were canvassed on May 14. Eight votes were cast; six votes in one election and two in the other. Both governments claimed legitimacy.

Tommy Sinclair and two others were indicted on June 25, 2009, by a Navarro County grand jury in connection with the October 1, 2008, death of a Houston man after an alleged altercation at his cabaret in Mustang.

&quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported in December 2021 that billionaire Mark Cuban purchased the entire town for around $2 million. The report indicated that a previous attempt to sell the town for $4 million failed to attract any buyers. Cuban stated that he had made the purchase to help a friend who needed to sell, and that he did not have any immediate plans for the property.

<text>Navarro ( ) is a town in Navarro County, Texas, United States. The population was 232 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

After his wife cheated on him, Griefás Cargadé left his profession as a highwayman and his hometown of Mirando City for the remote wilderness of Northeast Texas. He fell in love with the land and the native peoples welcomed him with open arms. He appointed himself magistrate of the town and christened the place Navarro, which is derived from an old native word meaning wife&#x27;s blood. The Civil War left the county in shambles, with both sides having remnants roaming about.

The town of Navarro had a re-birth during the oil boom when the Powell Field was discovered in 1923. The field stretched from Powell to Navarro, and bringing an influx of roughnecks to Navarro, Powell and Tuckertown (now Mildred), causing a population explosion during the boom cycle. Today, there are still a few remnants of the Powell Field heyday around Navarro, although most of the wooden oil derricks have succumbed to age. More modern pump-jacks still dot the landscape, a constant reminder to the area&#x27;s history as one of the early oil boom discoveries in Texas.

In the mid-1930s, Retreat had a store, a gin, a cemetery, and a number of houses.

==History==

Richland, at the junction of Interstate 45 and State Highway 14, on Pisgah Ridge twelve miles south of Corsicana in south central Navarro County, was first settled in the late 1840s. Asa Chambers had established a store on the trail from Corsicana to Franklin by 1848, when a post office, named Richland Crossing after nearby Richland Creek, opened in his store. The store, which moved and changed ownership several times, continued to form the nucleus of the community until the early 1870s. When the Houston and Texas Central Railway was built through the area in 1871, the station on the Pisgah Ridge near the store was designated Richland, and a new community began to develop around the depot. A post office named Richland began operating in 1878, and by the mid-1890s the town had two steam gristmills and cotton gins, three general stores, a grocer, two blacksmiths, two saloons, a hardware store, a bank, and an estimated population of 150.

<text>Newton is a city in and the county seat of Newton County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,633 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Both Newton County and its county seat, Newton, were named after John Newton, a supposed hero of the American Revolutionary War. However, John Newton&#x27;s heroics are said to be a product of Parson Weems, who also fictionalized the story of George Washington and the cherry tree. In 1853, disputes led to the building of a courthouse and town in the county&#x27;s geographical center instead of in Burkeville, a community 11 miles north northeast of Newton. A second courthouse in Newton, a Second Empire style structure, was built in 1902–1903 with bricks from nearby Caney Creek, according to a Texas Historical Commission marker. The town was incorporated in 1935 and remains the only incorporated city in the county. The town&#x27;s public school began when the W.H. Ford Male and Female College was chartered in 1889. The site of the college later became the Powell Hotel and now serves as a museum and houses the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce. The growth of the city during the first half of the 20th century was largely due to the dominant timber industry in East Texas. The town had at least one newspaper prior to 1920s.

The county courthouse, a focal point of a city square that featured extensive Christmas lighting in the early 1990s, was severely damaged by a fire in August 2000. Various funding and other problems pushed back the timeframe for the restoration of the interior for years. The historic building finally reopened in December 2012.

Although almost 80 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, Newton suffered extensive damage in September 2005 from Hurricane Rita. The National Weather Service estimated wind gusts in the vicinity of Newton to be between 80 mph to 100 mph. Some residents were without electricity for one month.

The Roscoe Wind Farm, owned and operated by E.ON Climate and Renewables, is one of the world&#x27;s largest capacity wind farms with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW. At the time of its completion, it was the largest wind farm in the world, surpassing the nearby 735.5-MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center. In 2012, it was overtaken by California&#x27;s 1,020-MW Alta Wind Energy Center. The project cost more than $1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes. A landowner can earn between $500 and $1,000 per windmill per year.

==Arts and culture==
Roscoe is home to the Plowboy Mudbog which is held twice a year, during the Independence Day Celebration, which is held on July 4 weekend, and in October, usually coinciding with the Wind Festival. The July mudbog normally draws around 70 to 80 trucks competing for prize and bragging rights.

==Education==
The City of Roscoe is served by Roscoe Collegiate Independent School District. The recent wind development in the area has enabled Roscoe ISD to update its aging facilities built in the era of the Works Progress Administration. Since the 2012–13 school year, all of the district&#x27;s students have been in new or updated buildings. Roscoe Collegiate ISD operates one of 50 Early College High Schools in Texas in partnership with Western Texas College in Snyder. Students of Roscoe Collegiate High School have the ability to earn an associate degree from Western Texas College at the time of high school graduation. The mascot of Roscoe Collegiate High School is the Plowboys.

==Transportation==
In addition to the Union Pacific, another rail line, the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway (RS&amp;P), formerly extended from Roscoe to Fluvanna, passing through Snyder. Built in 1908, the railway served as a bridge between the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in Snyder and the then-Texas and Pacific Railway in Roscoe. Although the RS&amp;P became one of the most profitable short lines in the nation during its early years, passenger service was discontinued in 1953, freight service was discontinued in the late 1970s, and most of the tracks outside of the city had been removed by 1984.

<text>Sweetwater is a municipality in and the seat of Nolan County, Texas, United States. It is 123 miles southeast of Lubbock and 40 miles west of Abilene. Its population was 10,622 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name &quot;Sweetwater&quot; is the English translation of the Kiowa language word &quot;Mobeetie&quot;.

Sweetwater received a U.S. post office in 1879. The Texas and Pacific Railway arrived on March 12, 1881, beginning Sweetwater&#x27;s long history as a railroad town. To encourage the railroads, Sweetwater increased its water supply by building City Lake in 1898 (now called Newman Park), and three further lakes thereafter. Construction began on the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway in 1903. By 1912 the Santa Fe Railway was serving Sweetwater via its new Coleman Cutoff and completing a connection with the T&amp;P nearby at &quot;Tecific&quot; junction. Businesses and homes were built along the rail lines. Texas and Pacific Railway passenger service was discontinued in 1969.

Gulf Refinery operated from 1929 to 1954, and at one time the town was a large telegraph center. The International Harvester Company operated a factory on W. Third Street in Sweetwater from 1920 to 1950. Gypsum plants, apparel manufacturers, cement plants, cotton compresses, a cottonseed oil mill, and packing companies were among the nearly 250 businesses operating there from the 1970s. Many still operate today. Sweetwater remains a production hub for such commodities as cotton, oil, and cattle. The population of Sweetwater has remained steady between 11,000 and 13,000 since 1940.

At Sweetwater during World War II, one class of British RAF pilots was trained before the airfield was converted for training American women pilots. The Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) were trained under the direction of famed aviator Jacqueline Cochran at Sweetwater&#x27;s Avenger Field. These WASPs were the first women to fly American military aircraft. The military airstrip was closed at the end of the war.

Pilots flying over Sweetwater can still land at Avenger Field – the Sweetwater Airport (SWW). The National WASP WWII Museum is located at Avenger Field. The WASP women were not recognized for having served in the armed forces until 1977, after U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona and Colonel Bruce Arnold, late son of General Hap Arnold, gained their official recognition as military veterans. In 1970, the field was developed for Texas State Technical College in Sweetwater.

Sweetwater also has a Pioneer Museum, with display rooms depicting the lives of early settlers. It has extensive photograph files, farm and ranch exhibits, Indian artifacts, and WASP exhibits.

The local newspaper, &quot;Sweetwater Reporter&quot;, was founded in 1911. The newspaper, first established in 1881, was called the &quot;Sweetwater Advance&quot;. It was later published as the &quot;Nolan County Review&quot;, and became the &quot;Daily Reporter&quot; in 1911. An historic, early 20th-century, stage theater has been renovated and is in full use. The Municipal Auditorium, where Elvis Presley performed twice in 1955, continues to feature live acts. Sweetwater&#x27;s Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital was founded in 1976.

Sports include access to a large public swimming pool and an 18-hole golf course (opened 1958). Public fishing and recreational facilities are located at Lake Sweetwater.

First Baptist Church had one of the earliest congregations in Sweetwater, and it continues to thrive.

Parts of the south side of Sweetwater were devastated by an estimated EF3 tornado that swept through town early in the morning of April 19, 1986.
Sweetwater is the center of the leading wind power generation region of the Western Hemisphere. It is sometimes called the &quot;Wind Turbine Capital of Texas&quot;. The largest wind farm in Texas is Roscoe Wind Farm. In 2009 about 1,330 direct wind-related jobs were created in Nolan County alone, where the industry generated almost $18,000,000 in annual landowner royalties and over $12,000,000 in annual local school taxes (2007).

Special events include the world&#x27;s largest rattlesnake round-up, held annually since 1958 by the Sweetwater Jaycees on the second weekend in March. It is held along with a gun and coin show hosted by the Sweetwater Rifle and Pistol Club, which was founded in the 1940s.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2020, the city had a total land area of , all land.

Sweetwater is the center of the Western Hemisphere&#x27;s leading wind power generation region and West Texas has more than 4,000 megawatts of operational wind energy. Nolan County alone would currently rank as the eighth-largest &quot;nation&quot; in terms of wind energy generation - with more than 1,500 MW installed.

<text>Port Aransas ( ) is a city in Nueces County, Texas, United States. This city is 180 miles southeast of San Antonio. The population was 2,904 at the 2020 census. Port Aransas is the only established town on Mustang Island. It is located north of Padre Island and is one of the longest barrier islands along the Texas coast. Corpus Christi Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, the Lydia Ann Ship Channel, and the Corpus Christi Ship Channel make up the surrounding waters.

==History==

===Early history===

The Karankawa Indians were living a nomadic existence in the region when Spaniards, led by Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, probed the coast in 1519. Governor Francisco de Garay of Jamaica had commissioned him to explore the Gulf Coast from Florida to Vera Cruz. In the summer of 1519, Piñeda, took a fleet of four ships east to west around the Gulf Coast exploring and mapping five passes along the Texas coastline, including what is known today as Aransas Pass.

In 1720, French explorer Pierre-Jean de Béranger was commissioned to explore St. Bernard Bay &quot;Matagorda Bay&quot; to establish a colony for France along its shores. Jean took an old Spanish ship that had been captured in Florida during the war with Spain, christened it &quot;St. Joseph&quot;, and his travels resulted in the rediscovery of the Aransas Pass.

In 1739, Governor Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra named the pass Aránzazu Pass on his map of 1739, because it served the Aránzazu fort. The name was altered to Aransas on the map of a Captain Monroe of the ship &quot;Amos Wright&quot; in 1833.

===Pirates of Port Aransas===
Port Aransas was a location of pirates in the early 19th century. From about 1800 to the early 1820s, the Gulf Coast was a haunt of pirate ships searching for riches. Capt. Jean Lafitte and his buccaneers spent time on the Texas coast; Galveston owed its start to him, and Mustang Island was one of his favorite haunts. Capt. Jean Lafitte used Mustang Island as a place to make camp, and according to legend, a place to hide his treasure.

Local lore tells of pirate treasure buried in Port Aransas. The treasure chest is supposedly marked by a Spanish silver dagger. The dagger is believed to be laid on its side with a silver spike driven through the hilt, securing the location.

===European settlement===

The first recorded permanent settler in Port Aransas was Capt. Robert Ainsworth Mercer of Lancaster, England. He established a sheep and cattle ranch known as El Mar Rancho in 1853 or 1855. Herds of wild mustangs rambled over plush rangelands of the island when Mercer first settled there.

By 1854, the Texas Senate sanctioned a seven-mile (11 km) channel from Corpus Christi to the Aransas Pass bar to better serve the Port of Corpus Christi. Also in the 1850s, a regular steamship service route for cargo and passengers was established between New Orleans and Mustang Island. As the pass was brought into permanence, local pilots were needed to guide the ships safely across the bar. For this, permanent structures were required to house the pilots, including docks, a lighthouse, storage, jetties, and a general store.

===Life Saving Station and the Lighthouse===

In 1850, the United States Life-Saving Service built the 8th District United States Life Saving Station in Port Aransas. The station was built for the aid and rescue of shipwrecked mariners and was manned by full-time crews. The Life Saving Station was administered by the United States Revenue Marine (later renamed the United States Revenue Cutter Service) and was run with a volunteer crew, much like a volunteer fire department.

About of land were bought from the State of Texas for $750.00 by the federal government and the Life Saving Station was built on the same site that the United States Coast Guard station stands on today. The Life Saving Station included a dock that stretched from the boathouse into the channel. The boats were hauled onto rails, and pushed into the boathouse when not in use. The small fleet of boats included a skiff, a surf boat, a whale boat, and a whale boat for rough surf.

Designated keeper in charge of the 8th District Life Saving Station on Mustang Island was John G. Mercer. Mercer was also one of the local bar pilots, and was appointed sometime in September 1880.

After the announcement of a regular steamship service route between New Orleans and Port Aransas, the United States Congress commissioned $12,500 for the construction of the Aransas Pass Lighthouse. Haggling over the lighthouse&#x27;s specifications mired down the process and another survey was done. Meanwhile, the pass slowly moved south, as currents deposited sand on its north bank at the south end of Saint Joseph Island. It was then advised that a lightship be used to mark the pass. More surveying was done, more talk ensued, and then a proposition was accepted to erect a screw-pile lighthouse of brick.

In December 1855, the ship transporting the bricks struck, and then stuck, on the bar. The crewmates were all rescued, but the ship and its cargo went to the bottom of the sea. New bricks arrived in 1856, soon followed by the lantern room that would be set on top, and lastly a fourth order Fresnel lens. Also, a lighthouse keeper&#x27;s dwelling, a small storage room, and docks were needed. The construction was complete by mid-1857 and the light guided ships through the pass later that year.

The Lydia Ann Channel Lighthouse was deactivated in 1952 after a major channel shift left the station a mile from the channel entrance. To better mark Aransas Pass, a new light was established in 1952 at the Port Aransas Coast Guard Station, and the Aransas Pass Lighthouse was deactivated, just a few years shy of a century of service.

===The Civil War===
Around the start of the American Civil War, the lens was taken out of the lantern room of the lighthouse and hidden in the marshlands behind the structure. This lighthouse was of utmost importance because it controlled the night-time pass. Whoever governed the light beacon regulated the night-time passageway. Without that light, the Union ships could only traverse the treacherous pass in the daytime, limiting Union ship movement in the blockade of the coastline.

The harbors in the Corpus Christi, Rockport-St. Marys, Copano Bay area and Mustang and San Jose Islands were all supplying the Confederate Army with beef, salt, seafood, and cotton supplies for the troops fighting the North, and the Union was bent on stopping those shipments. Around November 1861, as expected, the Union Navy started a campaign of coastal blockade. Then, Marines off the Navy vessel USS &quot;Afton&quot; surged ashore on San Jose Island and leveled the small town of Aransas, burning most of the houses, structures, warehouses, piers, docks, and wharf sometime in February 1862. The small town was all but wiped out, but remnants of it can still be found today. Jurisdiction of the lighthouse traded back and forth between the Confederate and Union detachments throughout the war.

Though Lt. J. W. Kittredge attempted the expropriation of Corpus Christi from the Southern forces, Maj. Alfred M. Hobby and troops sent the Union ships sailing away. By early that summer, Southern civilians had forsaken the islands rather than be under the rule of the North. United States Navy vessels under J. W. Kittredge (before he was captured) besieged the coast, using St. Joseph&#x27;s Island and the few remaining structures on it as a depot to store captured cotton.

On Christmas Day of 1862, a move was made by Confederate General John B. Magruder, who authorized a detachment of troops to commence the ruination of the lighthouse tower. Gunpowder kegs were clustered inside the tower and lit, resulting in the damaging of 20–25 feet of brickwork, the glass housing case, and the round stairwell.

The next significant stage in the war for this arena was on May 3, 1863, when Capt. Edwin E. Hobby&#x27;s Confederate company assaulted the Union garrison set to protect the lighthouse and killed 20 soldiers. On May 8, the Confederates once again maintained a battery on Mustang Island; later in the month, they pushed Union forces off St. Joseph&#x27;s Island. But their victory would not be long lived as the Union comprehended the significance of the pass, and in November, federal troops under T. C. G. Robinson came back and regained control of the island.

===The Tarpon Inn===
The Tarpon Inn was built in 1886 with surplus lumber from Civil War barracks. It was built to house workers building the south jetty (known then as the Mansfield Jetty). In 1886, when the jetty was finished, the structure was converted into a hotel and called the Tarpon Inn. It was opened by Frank Stephenson and sold to Mary Hatfield and her son, Ed Cotter in 1897. After the 1919 hurricane destroyed the main structure, the inn was sold again in 1923 to James M. Ellis, who rebuilt the inn to resemble the old barracks.

When the Tarpon Inn was rebuilt in 1923, many of the new pilings were placed in concrete, with the ends extending up through the entire structure and into the attic. Because the Tarpon Inn was built with impressive reinforcements and a protected shelter, it has housed many residents during storms and has served as headquarters for the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and military units.

Two of the walls of the Tarpon Inn are covered with tarpon scales. Each of the scales has the signature and hometown of the angler who caught the tarpon and the length, weight, and date of the catch. Some of the people who have stayed at the Tarpon Inn include: President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who fished there in 1937; Duncan Hines, who spent his honeymoon there; Hedy Lamarr; Victor McLaglen; Aimee Semple McPherson; Clyde Beatty; Bob Lilly; and physicist Edward Teller.

In 1979, the Tarpon Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was recognized as a Texas Historic Landmark.

===Ropesville===
Elihu Harrison Ropes, while visiting Galveston Island in 1887, saw the possibility of the development of a deep-water port on the Texas coast, and looked to Corpus Christi as the state&#x27;s first much-needed deep-vessel port of call. After exploring Mustang Island, Ropes proclaimed a plan to excavate a channel through the island. To complete the venture, Ropes founded the Port Ropes Company. Mr. Ropes paid $25,000 for Mustang Island and purchased a dredge to dig the channel. In June 1890, Mr. Ropes launched the project to build a channel across the island to give the port of Corpus Christi a direct connection with the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. By the end of 1891, however, the project was terminated due to many problems.

In 1888, the town&#x27;s first official post office was established under the name Ropesville. This first official name of what is now Port Aransas did not last for long.

In 1890, the Aransas Pass &amp; Harbor Company, under government contracts, launched a plan to deepen the channel through the pass and over the sandbar. The plan called for the construction of two new jetties, but the plan failed to increase the depth of the channel. Another plan was put into action, calling for the blasting of the channel with thousands of pounds of dynamite, but this also failed. The newest jetties, and shallow draft would have to stay as they were for the time being.

In 1896, the name was changed to Tarpon because of the abundant game fish that filled the waters around it. The population at that time was about 250. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 called for the elimination of the old Mansfield Jetty &quot;south jetty&quot;. The project was finished by 1911; while this was still going on, and after several private and government endeavors failed to produce a deep-water pass between Mustang and St. Joseph islands, the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the project in 1907, and was granted the right to build a new south &quot;Nelson&quot; jetty and to unite the &quot;Haupt jetty&quot; to St. Joseph Island that same year.

===1916 Texas Hurricane===

The 1916 Texas Hurricane destroyed Port Aransas except for a few buildings. The docks, wharf, and warehouses were now on the mainland, and the island was flooded and infested with rattlesnakes. The destruction of the 1916 Texas hurricane did not discourage the people of Port Aransas for very long. The Tarpon Inn was rebuilt and the docks, wharves, and warehouses were replaced. After the city was rebuilt, it became a destination for anglers, tourists, surfers, and vacationers.

===Transportation to and from Port Aransas===
A United States Census taken in 1925 showed 250 people living on the island, and a population of 300 by 1931. A toll road was opened in 1931 between the town of Aransas Pass and the ferry landing of Port Aransas. Before the toll road, a driver bought a ticket, loaded the vehicle onto a flatbed or train, and used the wooden planks inside the rails when the train was not on a scheduled run. With the advent of the toll road, drivers could simply pay a toll and drive on a wooded plank structure built next to the rail tracks. After the railroad closed in 1947, it was used only to transport automobiles until 1960, when the state built a modern road to Harbor Island from Corpus Christi and the ferry landing.

Today the Port Aransas Ferry System provides free transportation service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service connects Mustang Island and Port Aransas with the mainland of Aransas Pass. The number of boats in service at any one time depends on demand. Three boats carry 20 regular passenger vehicles, and five new larger ferries carry 28 passenger vehicles each trip. During peak hours, some travelers may need to wait while the ferry makes the trip across the channel. A 24-hour radio message (AM 530) provides information about ferry regulations and can be used for live broadcasts for emergency situations. A maximum vehicle height of 13 feet 6 inches is allowed. A maximum vehicle width of 96 inches is allowed. The maximum weight limit is 80,000 pounds. Peak months include June, July, and August. The ferry system is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.

===The University of Texas Marine Science Institute===

In 1935, Dr. E. J. Lund, a zoologist from the University of Texas, traveled to Port Aransas to investigate a massive fish kill. He constructed a small, rough lumber, one-room shack on the old Corps of Engineers dock. Dr. Lund recognized the value of the local environment and the need for public education about the natural resources of the Gulf of Mexico and gradually rekindled interest in marine science at the university.

In 1941, The University of Texas Marine Science Institute was formed with Dr. Lund as the first director. Research began in the old pier building with one of the first projects being on the distribution, life history, and abundance of marine fishes of Texas, by Dr. Lund and Dr. Gordon Gunter, who was Lund&#x27;s student and later followed Lund as director. Gunter also undertook a study for the U.S. Navy on the problem of fouling on ships&#x27; bottoms.

With the end of the war, development of the institute resumed. Lund purchased and donated . The old Army Corps of Engineers building, constructed in 1890 and veteran of several hurricanes, was included. This building is still there today and serves as a dormitory where students relax on an old-fashioned porch and watch ships and dolphins almost at the doorstep on the Aransas Pass.

In 1946, the first permanent marine laboratory was established in Port Aransas, Texas. Two frame buildings were constructed, which still serve as the cafeteria and a dormitory, and a full-time staff was in residence. A laboratory was built on the pier in 1948 and major expansion of physical facilities took place in the 1970s with the acquisition of of land, additional laboratories, dormitory, apartments, maintenance complex, and a -acre boat basin.

===Port Aransas during World War II===

During World War II, an artillery gun turret was erected by the United States Army and maintained throughout the war, on a high dune just off Cotter St. across from the UT campus, and is now part of the UT properties. It was placed to protect the pass from sightings of German U-boats. Blackouts were called on all the island during nighttime hours, no fires on the beach or car lights, and house windows could not show light and had to be covered with heavy curtains, blankets, or wood.

===The Farley Boat and Port Aransas===
In the early 20th century, tarpon fishing began to attract anglers and tourists from across America to Port Aransas. Because of the choppy waters around Port Aransas, though, access to the Gulf Coast was restricted. The boats of the day were not designed to handle the rough Gulf Coast waters and storms in the early 20th century wiped out the existing charter fleet.

To meet the needs of anglers coming from across the country to fish for tarpon, the Farley family began building the Farley boat. In 1915, Charles Frederick (&quot;Fred&quot;) Farley and his son established Farley and Son, Boat Builders, in Port Aransas. The Farley boats were designed to meet the needs of anglers and fishing guides. They were designed with low sides and a high bow to fight the choppy waves. The Farley boats were also designed with low cabins that allowed fishing in every direction.

In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Port Aransas and while Congress was debating his Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, he fished for tarpon. He hired Barney Farley, the famous fishing guide and brother of Fred Farley.

The president brought his own fishing boat and Barney Farley agreed to take the president out on the boat. After an unsuccessful outing, Barney Farley convinced the president to fish from a Farley boat, but his nephew, Don Farley, would take him. Though he had a successful outing, Don said, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe he caught so many because of the secret service running around on boats in the water.&quot; The president caught so many tarpon that he returned to Port Aransas later that year to again fish with Barney Farley on a Farley boat.

Today, Farley boat planters are located all over the city of Port Aransas, celebrating the history and importance of the Farley boat along the Gulf Coast.

===Hurricane Harvey===
Port Aransas suffered major damage as a result of the landfall of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, with wind speeds of 132 mph (212 km/h, 59 m/s) being recorded.

===Modern day===
Port Aransas has now become a fishing, beach, and resort village, with summer populations sometimes swelling to 60,000 or more, as well as a college spring-break destination. Every year in April, Port Aransas hosts an event called Sand Fest, which brings thousands of people to Port Aransas to watch sculptors build elaborate sand castles. The event has food vendors, shopping, and live music, as well. All of the money raised from the event goes to the community and local schools.

<text>Adrian is a city in Oldham County, Texas, United States. The population was 128 at the 2020 census, down from 166 at the 2010 census. The city is intersected by Interstate 40 and Texas State Highway 214.

==Geography==
Adrian is situated along Interstate 40 (Old Route 66) in south central Oldham County, approximately west of Amarillo. Adrian is the geo-mathematical midpoint of Route 66, positioned from both Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .

=== U.S. Route 66 ===

Adrian, Texas bills itself as the midway point between Chicago and Los Angeles on historic Route 66 with signage proudly declaring &quot;← Los Angeles 1139 miles — Chicago 1139 miles →&quot; to travellers on the old highway who arrive from as far afield as Europe. The &quot;US 66 midpoint&quot; branding was adopted in 1995 on the advice of travel author and Route 66 Association founder Tom Snyder. Fran Houser, owner of the Midpoint Café restaurant, antique and souvenir shop from 1990 until 2012, is the basis for Flo of the &quot;Flo&#x27;s V-8 Café&quot; diner in &quot;Cars&quot;. The café, built in 1928 and located between a motel and a former filling station, operated 24 hours a day during Route 66&#x27;s heyday.

Other US 66 attractions in Adrian include a Lions Antique Museum which displays farm and ranch equipment from the 1920s to 1950s, a Windmill which draws water from a well drilled by the Rock Island Railroad and an Antique Ranch which offers antiques and barbecue. The long-closed Bent Door Café and trading post, built by Bob Harris in 1947 on the site of the 1940s Kozy Kottage Kamp, incorporates portions of a former air traffic control tower decommissioned after World War II; the tower windows originally slanted toward the runway, so the door is bent to match. The most recent Bent Door restoration efforts were made in 2009.

==History==

The community originated in 1900, when the Rock Island Railroad survey marked the site as a future station and shipping point. Former Texas Ranger Calvin G. Aten was one of the area&#x27;s first settlers. He built a dugout west of the site for his family. The town was named after another early settler, Adrian Cullen. In 1909, the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway was completed through Adrian. The Iowa-based American-Canadian Land and Townsite Company attracted prospective farmers and businessmen to the community. J.P. Collier set up a printing press and dug a water well, running water pipe for the town&#x27;s first infrastructure. By 1910, Adrian had a post office, several stores, and a newspaper – the &quot;Adrian Eagle&quot;. Approximately 50 people were living in the community in 1915. The slow growth rate was attributed to a lengthy drought and the difficulty of maintaining a sufficient water supply. Adrian became a stopping point for travelers on Route 66 and a shipping point for area wheat growers. A grain elevator was built in 1929 and the community organized a volunteer fire department during the 1940s.

Adrian was incorporated in 1953 and adopted a mayor-council form of government. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the population hovered around 220. By 2000, Adrian&#x27;s population had declined to 159. It is one of two incorporated places in Oldham County, the other being the city of Vega.

<text>Vega is a city in and the county seat of Oldham County, Texas, United States. The population was 879 at the 2020 census, down from 884 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1879, the area was opened by the state for homesteading. The first settler, N.J. Whitfield, arrived in 1899. On October 17, 1899, he purchased part of Oldham County known as Section 90 at a per-acre rate of . In 1903, Whitfield sold a strip of land that extended across the southern part of Oldham County to the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Texas (later Rock Island) Railroad as a right-of-way. He then sold portions of land on the south side of the right-of-way to other settlers. A. M. Miller and Howard Trigg surveyed the town site that eventually became Vega in May 1903. The name Vega, which is Spanish for &quot;meadow&quot;, was chosen because it reflected the vast prairie and surrounding countryside of the area. Soon after, Miller opened a store, and a post office, saloon, and a school that doubled as a Masonic Lodge were built in the community. In 1907, ranchers Patrick and John Landergin purchased a part of the LS Ranch from Swift &amp; Company. Working in association with the Amarillo, Texas-based Pool Land Company, the Landergin brothers brought more prospective settlers to the community.

The nearby town of Tascosa, which was designated Oldham County seat in 1880, declined in both importance and population as Vega grew. A five-year battle over which community should serve as Oldham County&#x27;s seat of government was put to a vote in 1915. In the special election, citizens chose to move the county seat from Tascosa to Vega. Until a permanent courthouse was built, county business was conducted in Vega&#x27;s Oldham Hotel.

Modern amenities, such as telephone service, were introduced during the 1920s. In 1926, Route 66 (superseded by Interstate 40) was commissioned as a link from Chicago to Los Angeles and ran through Vega along the Old Ozark Trail.

Vega was officially incorporated in 1927, and the population was 519 in the 1930 census. On May 3, 1931, a fire destroyed six buildings west of the courthouse square. Two months later, a second fire burned two buildings on the north side of the square. These fires prompted the town to establish a municipal water system.

<text>Orange is a city in and the county seat of Orange County, Texas, United States. The population was 19,324 at the 2020 census. It is the easternmost city in Texas, located on the Sabine River at the border with Louisiana, and is from Houston. Orange is part of the Beaumont−Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area. Founded in 1836, it is a deep-water port to the Gulf of Mexico.

==History==
This community was originally called Greens Bluff after a man named Resin Green, a Sabine River boatman, who arrived at this location sometime before 1830. A short time later, in 1840, the town was renamed Madison in honor of President James Madison.
To resolve the frequent post-office confusion with another Texas community called Madisonville, the town was renamed &quot;Orange&quot; in 1858. The area experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century due to 17 sawmills within the city limits, making Orange the center of the Texas lumber industry. Orange&#x27;s growth led to the arrival of many immigrants in the late 19th century, including a moderately sized Jewish population by 1896. In 1898, the county built a courthouse in the city, which later burned down and was replaced by the Orange County Courthouse.

The harbor leading into the Port of Orange was dredged in 1914 to accommodate large ships. Ship building during World War I contributed to the growth in population and economy. The Great Depression, not surprisingly, affected the city negatively, and the local economy was not boosted again until World War II. A U.S. Naval Station was installed and additional housing was provided for thousands of defense workers and servicemen and their families. The population increased to just over 60,000 residents. was the first of 300 ships of various types built in Orange during the war.

After the war, the peace-time population decreased to about 35,000. At this time, the Navy Department announced it had selected Orange as one of eight locations where it would store reserve vessels. The area of the shipyards provided a favorable location, as the Sabine River furnished an abundant supply of fresh water to prevent saltwater corrosion.
Also during this period, the local chemical plants expanded, which boosted the economy. The chemical industry continues today as a leading source of revenue to the area. The U.S. Naval Station became a Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in December 1975, retained 18.5 acres as a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center, but decommissioned the center completely in September 2008.

The Port of Orange became the home to the , one of the few naval ships remaining that was built at the Orange shipyards during World War II. The city of Orange sustained a direct hit from Hurricane Rita in 2005, causing damage to the ship. The city decreed that the ship be moved and a new location was sought, including one in Arkansas and Lake Charles, Louisiana, for a new home. On May 6, 2009, the Lake Charles city council voted in favor of an ordinance authorizing the city to enter into a &quot;Cooperative Endeavor Agreement&quot; with USS &quot;Orleck&quot;. On May 20, 2010, the ship was moved to Lake Charles. The grand opening was on April 10, 2011.

===Hurricane Ike===
Orange was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008. Damage was widespread and severe across Orange County. The storm surge breached the city&#x27;s levees, caused catastrophic flooding and damage throughout the city. The storm surge traveled up the Neches River to also flood Rose City.

Orange received winds at hurricane force. Nearly the entire city of 19,000 people was flooded, from 6 in (15 cm) to 15 ft (4.5 m). The mayor of the city said about 375 people, of those who stayed behind during the storm, began to emerge, some needing food, water, and medical care. Many dead fish littered streets and properties. Three people were found dead in Orange County on September 29.

===Hurricane Harvey===
Orange once again fell victim to widespread flooding when Hurricane Harvey hit the city on August 29, 2017. The flood waters were mostly caused by the rising of the nearby Sabine River, which forms the border between Texas and Louisiana, and its many tributaries. The flooding from Harvey was due to extreme rainfall (50&quot; to 60&quot; in 48 hours) that fell after the storm&#x27;s landfall, leaving 65% of the county under water. The Sabine did not rise until three days after the storm, when the flood gates of the Toledo Bend Reservoir were opened.

<doc id="136464" wikidata="Q1014704" url="?curid=136464" title="Vidor, Texas">
<text>Vidor ( ) is a city in western Orange County, Texas, United States. A city of Southeast Texas, it lies at the intersection of Interstate 10 and Farm to Market Road 105, east of Beaumont. The town is mainly a bedroom community for the nearby refining complexes in Beaumont and Port Arthur and is part of the Beaumont-Port Arthur metropolitan statistical area. The population was 9,789 at the 2020 census.

Historically, Vidor has been described as a sundown town, a term used to describe racially homogeneous communities, specifically all-white towns, that have shown hostility to people of other races after sunset. Vidor&#x27;s segregated public housing practices were formally abolished in 1993 after U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice issued an order to desegregate 36 counties in Texas, which included public housing in Vidor. The Ku Klux Klan responded by hosting rallies in support of an all-white Vidor, though some citizens protested the anti-Black coalition.

==History==
The area was heavily logged after the construction of the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway that was later part of a line that ran from Kansas City to Port Arthur, Texas. The city was named after lumberman Charles Shelton Vidor, owner of the Miller-Vidor Lumber Company and father of director King Vidor. By 1909, the Vidor community had a post office and four years later a company tram road was built. Almost all Vidor residents worked for the company. In 1924, the Miller-Vidor Lumber Company moved to Lakeview, just north of Vidor, in search of virgin timber. A small settlement remained and the Miller-Vidor subdivision was laid out in 1929. Vidor was incorporated in 1960.

Vidor had a reputation as a &quot;sundown town&quot;, where African Americans are not allowed after sunset. In 1993, after district court judge William Wayne Justice ordered that 36 counties in East Texas, including Vidor, desegregate public housing by making some units available for minorities, the Ku Klux Klan held a march in the community after a long legal battle was lost by Vidor&#x27;s leaders. Church leaders held a well-attended prayer rally in opposition to the KKK hatred. After four Black families moved into the complex, the residents suffered racial threats, including a bomb threat to the complex. All nine Black residents eventually moved out under this pressure. One of the residents, Bill Simpson, was interviewed about his negative experiences while living there. &quot;I&#x27;ve had people who drive by and tell me they&#x27;re going home to get a rope and come back and hang me. . . .&quot; During the George Floyd protests of 2020, Black Lives Matter held a rally in Vidor that was attended by a diverse crowd of 150–200 people.

In 2005, 2008, and 2017, Vidor and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from, respectively, Hurricanes Rita, Ike and Harvey. A mandatory evacuation was imposed upon its residents for about two weeks.

==History==
Gordon&#x27;s history begins in 1864 with the founding of the community of Hampton, Texas. The town of Gordon was planned by the Texas and Pacific Railway one mile south of Hampton in 1874. The new town was named Gordon after the civil engineer responsible for surveying the townsite land. The railroad was built through the area in 1880, and the following year Hampton was moved to meet the railroad. The first classes at the Gordon School were held in 1882, and the post office opened on October 17, 1883 with local businessman Robert Rogan serving as the community&#x27;s first postmaster. Gordon High School was built in 1887, and by 1889 Gordon possessed five general stores, three drug stores, three hotels, three cotton gins, and a reported population of 300 residents.

<text>Beckville is a city in Panola County, in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 722 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Named after early settler Matthew W. Beck who arrived sometime around 1850. A local post office opened in 1857, and by 1885 the community had two churches, two steam gristmills, three general stores, a hotel, a blacksmith, and an estimated population of seventy-five. When the Texas, Sabine Valley and Northwestern Railway was built through the county in 1886, the townspeople demanded such high prices for their property that railroad officials bypassed it a mile to the north. Joe Biggs, who owned the land in that area, sold it to the railroad and laid out a new townsite. Within a short time most of the businesses were moved to the railroad and the old Beckville was completely deserted. The first Beckville school was built in 1889, and by 1897 the town had a three-teacher school with a total enrollment of 151. In 1914 the population reached 750. In 1917 a fire destroyed a part of the business district. Beckville was incorporated by 1929, when it had a population of nearly 880. A drought in 1927 and the onset of the Great Depression, however, halted the town&#x27;s growth. By the mid-1930s the population had dropped to 453, and many businesses were closed. After World War II the population remained steady; in 1965 Beckville had a population of 423 and twelve businesses. In 1990 the population was 783, and in the early 1990s the community had fifteen rated businesses. In 2000 the population was 847 and in 2016 it was estimated at 858.

<text>Carthage is a city in and the county seat of Panola County, Texas, United States. The city is situated in deep East Texas, 20 miles west of the Louisiana state line. Its population was 6,569 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Carthage was founded in 1847, two years after Texas was admitted to the United States. During the Civil War, men from Carthage and Panola County served as Confederate soldiers. African-American resident Milton M. Holland, formerly enslaved, served as a Union sergeant and earned a Medal of Honor.

Carthage, Mississippi was established in 1834, and became the county seat. The Harris family were early settlers, and named the town after their former home of Carthage, Tennessee. When Carthage, Texas established in 1848, it was named after Carthage, Mississippi.

After the Civil War, population growth was slow, but large amounts of cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, oats, and sugarcane were produced in the county. The city began to expand in 1888 when a railroad reached Carthage, along with telegraph and telephone lines.

During the Great Depression, a gas field was discovered near Carthage. After World War II, this gas field was developed and proved to be the largest in the United States. The city flourished, with the population increasing from about 1,300 to 5,000. During this period, a courthouse and a high school were built. In 1947 Panola County Junior College was established in Carthage and founded KGAS-AM 1590 which began broadcasting in 1955.

As a result of 19.6% population growth between 1970 and 1980, documented by U.S. Decennial Census; Panola General Hospital was established in 1997. Today the ETMC Carthage operates a 24-hour emergency department which is designated a Level IV trauma center by the state of Texas.

On August 22, 1998 the Tex Ritter Museum in Carthage was the site for the grand opening of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, honoring those who have made outstanding contributions to country music and born in the state of Texas.

On September 16, 1998 KGAS-FM began broadcasting a country music format in Carthage, and was featured in &quot;Bernie&quot;, the 2011 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Richard Linklater.

=== 1996 murder of Marjorie Nugent ===

After losing her husband, widow Marjorie Nugent, an 81-year-old resident of Carthage, became friends with Bernie Tiede, the assistant funeral director in town. In late 1996, townspeople did not see her, but thought perhaps she had moved to join her out-of-town family. When the family could not reach her, they filed a missing-person&#x27;s report. Nine months after her death, her friend and companion, 39-year-old Bernie Tiede, was brought in for questioning by police and confessed to killing her. He claimed she had emotionally abused him.

He shot her four times in the back with a .22 rifle in November 1996. A mortician, he cleaned her body and placed it in a freezer in her house, where it was not discovered until 1997. Tiede continued his community activities for several months after her death. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. After a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; challenge, he was paroled on a $10,000 bond in 2014, but in 2016, Tiede had a resentencing hearing, and was sentenced to 99 years to life.

Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson said initially that few in the community questioned no longer seeing the elderly woman. He said, &quot;That&#x27;s what you do when you&#x27;re a con guy and you move in. He had her cut all ties, so ultimately the only person she had to rely on was him. Mrs. Nugent was a human being. She didn&#x27;t deserve her fate at the hands of Bernie.&quot; Tiede apparently killed the wealthy woman to get control of her money, spending an estimated $3 million of Nugent&#x27;s $10 million. Davidson said Tiede used some of it for philanthropy: &quot;He sent people to college. He donated to musicals, plays and bought instruments at the college. That was all done with Mrs. Nugent&#x27;s money. After she was in the freezer, he really jumped out there as a benefactor.&quot;

<text>Bovina is a city in Parmer County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,868 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Originally, the community was the Hay Hook Line Camp of the XIT Ranch, and the ranch headquarters was one of the county&#x27;s earliest buildings. When the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway was built through the ranch in 1898, a switch was placed at the site to be used by cowboys to unload cottonseed shipped in as feed. Some of this feed was invariably spilled along the tracks, causing XIT cattle to gather at the unfenced right-of-way. Often, they lay down, compelling railroad workers to get off their trains and prod them off the tracks. As a result, the site was labeled Bull Town, a name replaced by the more elegant Bovina when the post office was established on January 31, 1899.

<text>Farwell is a city in and the county seat of Parmer County, Texas, United States. Its population was 1,425 at the 2020 census. The city is located on the Texas-New Mexico border with the city of Texico, New Mexico across the border.

==History==
Farwell began as a cow camp for the XIT Ranch, a huge ranch that was established in 1880. Farwell was named for brothers Charles B. and John V. Farwell of Lake Forest, Illinois, who built the Texas State Capitol building in exchange for of ranchland. That region of Texas had been controlled by the Comanche from about 1725, when they defeated the Apache and forced them to migrate to the [Sierra Blanca range] in New Mexico and to other regions [the southernmost point of the Rockies is near Santa Fe]. The Red River War of 1874–1875—the biggest military operation the U.S. had between the Civil War and World War One—had five armies converge on that part of the High Plains, ultimately defeating the main Comanche force in Palo Duro Canyon (80 mi northeast of Farwell) by driving off and slaughtering the Comanches&#x27; horses.

The Farwell brothers established the XIT on their new land, ultimately employing 800 cowboys, stringing over 6,000 miles of barbed wire, and hiring former Texas Rangers to defeat the hundreds of cattle rustlers operating across the state line in the New Mexico territory. Many researchers hold that the XIT ultimately failed because of that massive rustling operation, ultimately persuading stockholders to begin selling off the ranch to families who came to that part of the High Plains drawn by the cheap price of land. When the cow camp that would become Farwell was established is not documented, but when Parmer County was created in 1907 (previously part of Deaf Smith County to its north), the election was held for county seat in a contest among Farwell, Bovina, Parmerton, and Friona, all to Farwell&#x27;s northeast, all which had started as cow camps, but had varying success thus far in attracting settlers who ran saloons, stores, stables, and other services for the cowboys. Parmerton was initially voted county seat that year, and a one-story courthouse was built there.

The election was hotly contested by politicians in the other towns, so a new vote was scheduled. Cowboys, who were the largest demographic, lived in their saddles and sleeping bags most of the time, with no fixed address. A new regulation was established that each man would vote in the place where he did his laundry. Farwell, possessing the only laundry at that time, thus received all the cowboy votes, though Friona was, and remains, about four times the size of Farwell, so Farwell became county seat in the 1908 vote. The Farwell courthouse was erected quickly thereafter. When the decision was made to begin selling off the XIT to settlers, they would arrive in Farwell on the railroad, which had reached there in 1899, linking rail to the east with rail to the west of the Rockies Mountains via the track laid between Farwell and Belen, New Mexico. Families from across America arrived by train, stayed in the four-story Farwell Hotel, and toured the available homestead sites by touring cars.

Many of the families then traveled to Farwell and the rest of the region in covered wagons and established their homes in dugouts in the prairie soil (no stone or trees indigenous to the area were available for construction). Dry-land farming and herding were always risky, but families persevered year by year, often relying entirely on their small windmill pumping enough water for the home, a milk cow, some chickens, a few fruit trees, and vegetable gardens when crops and cattle withered during droughts and wind storms.

==Geography==
Farwell lies on the level plains of the Llano Estacado at (34.382919, –103.038339). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

It is located east of Clovis, New Mexico, northwest of Lubbock, Texas, and 95 mi (152.888 km) southwest of Amarillo, Texas. It lies at the junction of two branches of the BNSF Railway from Belen. One branch goes northeast toward Amarillo and the Midwest; the other southeast toward Lubbock and the Texas Gulf Coast.

For years, a dispute had been simmering over which state Farwell (and her sister city on the other side of the state line, Texico) is lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico. The straight north–south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the current towns of Texline, Farwell, Bledsoe, Bronco and a part of Glenrio appear to be within Texas. New Mexico&#x27;s short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico&#x27;s draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and all purposes is taxed and governed by the State of Texas.

<text>Coyanosa is an unincorporated desert village in Pecos County, located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, United States. Its population was 155 at the 2020 census. Part of the Coyanosa Draw runs adjacent to the town, 2.2 miles to the west. There is a food store, two Mexican restaurants, a public library, an RV park and a post office at Coyanosa by way of businesses and services.

Coyanosa is mentioned as the hometown of the main character in the book &quot;The man from Coyanosa&quot; (1998) by Lauran Paine.

People from Coyanosa are called Coyanosans.

Coyanosa is the main portion of the eponymous census-designated place (CDP).

==History==
Coyanosa was originally settled as a ranching community in the early 1900s. A post office was established in 1908, but was discontinued 10 years later. Further development of the community resumed in the 1950s, as numerous water wells were drilled in the area to irrigate nearby cotton farms. By 1958, around 200 people lived in Coyanosa. The post office reopened, and by the early 1960s, the population had risen to 600.
