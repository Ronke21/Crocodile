<text>Pulaski is a city in and the county seat of Giles County, which is located on the central-southern border of Tennessee, United States. The population was 8,397 at the 2020 census. It was named after Casimir Pulaski, a noted Polish-born general on the Patriot side in the American Revolutionary War. 

==History==

Pulaski was founded in 1809. During the Civil War, after the Union took control of Tennessee in 1862, thousands of African Americans left plantations and farms to join their lines for refuge. The Army set up a contraband camp in Pulaski to help house the freedmen and their families, feed them, and put them to work. In addition, education classes were started. The vicinity of Pulaski was the site of a number of skirmishes during the Franklin–Nashville Campaign. Union troops occupied the state from 1862, and hundreds of African Americans left plantations even before the Emancipation Proclamation to join their lines.

In 1863, Confederate courier Sam Davis was hanged in Pulaski by the Union Army on suspicion of espionage.

After the war, in late 1865, six Tennessee veterans of the Confederate Army founded a secret society, later known as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). This was the first chapter. These men, John C. Lester, John B. Kennedy, James R. Crowe, Frank O. McCord, Richard R. Reed, and J. Calvin Jones, established the KKK on December 25, 1865. They created rules for a secret, hierarchical society devoted to suppressing freedmen and their white allies, and maintaining white supremacy.

The white insurgents were determined to fight secretly against the political advancement of freedmen and of sympathetic whites. Chapters of the KKK quickly were organized in other parts of the state and the South. KKK members often attacked their victims at night, to increase the intimidation of threats and assaults. Other incidents of racial violence against blacks also took place. The Pulaski riot was a race riot initiated against blacks that took place in the city in the winter of 1868, following a heated election season.

Martin Methodist College was founded in Pulaski in 1870 as a private college for white students. Martin Methodist College was merged with the UT System in 2021 to become the new campus under the University of Tennessee System. It is now known as University of Tennessee Southern and is a public university.

<doc id="135192" wikidata="Q979819" url="?curid=135192" title="Blaine, Tennessee">
<text>Blaine, formerly known as Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads, is a city in Grainger County, Tennessee, United States, and a suburb of neighboring Knoxville. It is part of both the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,084 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Blaine was originally known as Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads (sometimes spelled &quot;Blain&quot;). During the early 19th century, it was located at the intersection of several important roads, including the eastern terminus of the Emory Road (present day SR 61), which traversed northern Knox County, the northern terminus of Indian Ridge Road, and the Great Indian Warpath, present-day U.S. Route 11W. Shields&#x27; Station, a popular tavern and store, had been built in Blaine by the early 1830s. Blaine later served as a stop along the Knoxville and Bristol Railroad, also known as the Peavine Railroad, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

During the American Civil War, Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads served as the site of retreat of Confederate forces following General James Longstreet&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Bean&#x27;s Station. Longstreet and his forces attempted to siege westward into Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads, as part of the Knoxville campaign to capture the city of Knoxville. Union army forces retreating from Bean&#x27;s Station moved into Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads, making a stronger defense at the community for Union military forces. Overmatched by the strength of the Union Army, Longstreet and his forces retreated at Blaine&#x27;s Crossroads, ending the Confederacy&#x27;s attempt at controlling Knoxville.

Around 1890, a Pennsylvania native named Robert Blaine opened and operated a general store in the community. As the community grew, Blaine was chosen as the namesake of the city.

In the late 19th to the early 20th century, Blaine was a stop on the Knoxville and Bristol Railroad, commonly known by locals as the &quot;Peavine Railroad.&quot; The line ran from the City of Morristown in Hamblen County, through the Richland Valley to the bedroom community of Corryton, north of Blaine in unincorporated Knox County. With the creation of the railroad, Blaine saw a significant change from a small turnpike town, to a bustling railroad town.

On December 31, 1952, country music singer Hank Williams was spotted during his last ride in Blaine following his departure from the Andrew Johnson Hotel in downtown Knoxville. Falling severely ill after a dinner at the hotel, Williams asked his driver, Charles Carr, drive him from Knoxville to Charleston, West Virginia for a concert in the same day. Arriving in Blaine, Williams&#x27; car was stopped by a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper for speeding. The state trooper had seen Williams lying motionless in the back of the car during the stop and assumed that he was dead. Carr insisted that Williams was sedated from a Knoxville doctor&#x27;s order. The trooper fined Carr $25 for speeding, and later paid this fine at the Grainger County Courthouse in Rutledge.

In 1978, waste management company Browning-Ferris Industries announced plans for a large sanitary landfill to service the needs of Knoxville in Blaine. The proposal would prompt community members to petition and vote to incorporate Blaine into a city in the same year. Blaine residents would also use acts of vandalism (notably arson) and violence against Browning-Ferris and construction companies contracted to build the landfill to oppose the project. The largest of these acts resulted in the destruction of the Knoxville office of Browning-Ferris via bomb, costing the company $50,000.

In 2007, the city received $520,560 in funding from the Economic Development Administration, and $867,600 towards developing the city&#x27;s sewage treatment system for proposed commercial and industrial sites. The project created nearly 175 jobs in the city and the potential of $12.525 million in private investment. In 2010, the Blaine City Council moved forward with the sewer project despite previous hurdles with local opposition.

==Economy==
In its retail and commercial markets, Blaine has a small amount of restaurants, stores and professional services. A Food City supermarket that opened in 2015, is the only grocery store in Blaine.

Economic growth and development has appeared to make significant gains in the city after the construction of sewage treatment plant on the easternmost part of the city near the unincorporated community of Lea Springs. Since the wastewater system project&#x27;s completion in the early 2010s, Blaine has seen a massive boost in commercial development and population growth, both of which were contributed to the project, the planning of a business park site, and the city&#x27;s proximity to Knoxville appealing to commuters.

<text>Rutledge is a city in and the county seat of Grainger County, Tennessee. The city is part of both the Knoxville metropolitan area and the Morristown metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 1,321.

==History==
Rutledge was established and incorporated in 1797 and named for General George Rutledge, a prominent citizen in nearby Sullivan County. At the time of its incorporation, it became the first municipality to have its own police department in Grainger County. In 1801, Rutledge became the official county seat of Grainger County, a distinction that had been shared by several communities since the county&#x27;s formation in 1796. Rutledge prospered in the early 19th century in part due to its situation along the Federal Road (present day US 11W), which connected New Orleans and Virginia. The road intersected the Wilderness Road (present day US 25E) at Bean Station, just east of Rutledge.

In the 1820s, President Andrew Johnson, who worked as a tailor in Greeneville, briefly operated a tailor shop in Rutledge. In 1976, a replica of Johnson&#x27;s tailor shop was erected on the Grainger County Courthouse lawn.

During the U.S. Civil War, guerilla warfare largely paralyzed Grainger County. In December 1863, Confederate General James Longstreet, who had earlier failed to wrest Knoxville from Union forces, passed through Rutledge en route to winter quarters at Russellville. On December 14, in what became known as the Battle of Bean&#x27;s Station, Longstreet attacked a Union detachment that had been pursuing him. The Confederates failed to exploit the element of surprise, and the Union forces were able to hold out until reinforcements arrived. While Longstreet was victorious, Union forces were able to retreat to fortifications at Blaine, and Longstreet subsequently abandoned the assault and continued eastward to Russellville.

In May 1955, following efforts from the community&#x27;s Lions Club, Rutledge would vote to reincorporate into a city in an overwhelming 192 in favor compared to 21 against incorporation. Following the reincorporation, the city would construct sewage treatment and waterworks systems to promote economic development with funding given from the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s Rural Development Program.

==Geography==
Rutledge is situated near the center of Richland Valley, a narrow valley that stretches for some along the southern base of Clinch Mountain between Blaine and Bean Station. Richland Creek traverses most of the valley en route to its confluence along the Cherokee Lake impoundment of the Holston River, approximately downstream from Rutledge. Cherokee Lake&#x27;s Ray Creek embayment is located approximately east of Rutledge.

Rutledge is centered around the junction of U.S. Route 11W, which connects the city to Kingsport to the east and Knoxville to the west, and State Route 92, which connects the city to Jefferson County, Interstate 40, and Interstate 81 to the south. U.S. Route 25E, which traverses Clinch Mountain, intersects US-11W in nearby Bean Station.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Greeneville is a town in and the county seat of Greene County, Tennessee, United States. The population as of the 2020 census was 15,479. The town was named in honor of Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, and it is the second oldest town in Tennessee. It is the only town with this spelling in the United States, although there are numerous U.S. towns named &quot;Greenville&quot;. The town was the capital of the short-lived State of Franklin in the 18th-century history of East Tennessee.

Greeneville is known as the town where United States President Andrew Johnson began his political career when elected to be an alderman and transitioned from his trade as a tailor. He and his family lived there for most of his adult years. It was an area of strong abolitionist and Unionist views and yeoman farmers, an environment that influenced Johnson&#x27;s outlook.

The Greeneville Historic District was established in 1974.

The U.S. Navy was named in honor of the town.

Greeneville is part of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==Geography==

Greeneville lies in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. These hills are part of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province, which is characterized by fertile river valleys flanked by narrow, elongate ridges. Greeneville is located roughly halfway between Bays Mountain to the northwest and the Bald Mountains— part of the main Appalachian crest— to the southeast. The valley in which Greeneville is situated is part of the watershed of the Nolichucky River, which passes a few miles south of the town.

Several federal and state highways now intersect in Greeneville, as they were built to follow old roads and trails. U.S. Route 321 follows Main Street through the center of the town and connects Greeneville to Newport to the southwest. U.S. Route 11E (Andrew Johnson Highway), which connects Greeneville with Morristown to the west, intersects U.S. 321 in Greeneville and the merged highway proceeds northeast to Johnson City. Tennessee State Route 107, which also follows Main Street and Andrew Johnson Hwy, Greeneville to Erwin to the east and to the Del Rio area to the south. Tennessee State Route 70 (Lonesome Pine Trail) connects Greeneville with Interstate 81, and Rogersville to the north and Asheville, North Carolina to the south. Tennessee State Route 172 (Baileyton Road) connects Greeneville with Interstate 81 and Baileyton to the north.

Tennessee State Route 93 (Kingsport Highway) connects Greeneville to Interstate 81, Fall Branch and Kingsport to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

===Early history===

Native Americans were hunting and camping in the Nolichucky Valley as early as the Paleo-Indian period (c. 10,000 B.C.). A substantial Woodland period (1000 B.C. - 1000 A.D.) village existed at the Nolichucky&#x27;s confluence with Big Limestone Creek (now part of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park). By the time the first Euro-American settlers arrived in the area in the late 18th century, the Cherokee claimed the valley as part of their hunting grounds. The Great Indian Warpath passed just northwest of modern Greeneville, and the townsite is believed to have once been the juncture of two lesser Native American trails.

The permanent European settlement of Greene County began in 1772. Jacob Brown, a North Carolina merchant, leased a large stretch of land from the Cherokee, located between the upper Lick Creek watershed and the Nolichucky River, in what is now the northeastern corner of the county. The &quot;Nolichucky Settlement&quot; initially aligned itself with the Watauga Association as part of Washington County, North Carolina. After voting irregularities in a local election, however, an early Nolichucky settler named Daniel Kennedy (1750–1802) led a movement to form a separate county, which was granted in 1783.

The county was named after Nathanael Greene, reflecting the loyalties of the numerous Revolutionary War veterans who settled in the Nolichucky Valley, especially from Pennsylvania and Virginia. The first county court sessions were held at the home of Robert Kerr, who lived at &quot;Big Spring&quot; (near the center of modern Greeneville). Kerr donated for the establishment of the county seat, most of which was located in the area currently bounded by Irish, College, Church, and Summer streets. &quot;Greeneville&quot; was officially recognized as a town in 1786.

===State of Franklin===
In 1784, North Carolina attempted to resolve its debts by giving the U.S. Congress its lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, including Greene County, abandoning responsibility for the area to the federal government. In response, delegates from Greene and neighboring counties convened at Jonesborough and resolved to break away from North Carolina and establish an independent state. The delegates agreed to meet again later that year to form a constitution, which was rejected when presented to the general delegation in December. Reverend Samuel Houston (not to be confused with the later governor of Tennessee and Texas) had presented a draft constitution that restricted the election of lawyers and other professionals. Houston&#x27;s draft met staunch opposition, especially from Reverend Hezekiah Balch (1741–1810) (who was later instrumental in the creation of Tusculum College). John Sevier was elected governor, and other executive offices were filled.

A petition for statehood for what would have become known as the State of Franklin (named in honor of Benjamin Franklin) was drawn at the delegates session in May 1785. The delegates submitted a petition for statehood to Congress, which failed to gain the requisite votes needed for admission to the Union. The first state legislature of Franklin met in December 1785 in a crude log courthouse in Greeneville, which had been named the capital city the previous August. During this session, the delegates finally approved a constitution that was based on, and quite similar to, the North Carolina state constitution. However, the Franklin movement began to collapse soon thereafter, with North Carolina reasserting its control of the area the following spring.

In 1897, at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in Nashville, a log house that had been moved from Greeneville was displayed as the capitol where the State of Franklin&#x27;s delegates met in the 1780s. There is, however, nothing to verify that this building was the actual capitol. In the 1960s, the capitol was reconstructed, based largely on the dimensions given in historian J. G. M. Ramsey&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Tennessee&quot;.

===Greeneville and the abolitionist movement===
Greene County, like much of East Tennessee, was home to a strong abolitionist movement in the early 19th century. This movement was likely influenced by the relatively large numbers of Quakers who migrated to the region from Pennsylvania in the 1790s. The Quakers considered slavery to be in violation of Biblical Scripture and were active in the region&#x27;s abolitionist movement throughout the antebellum period. One such Quaker was Elihu Embree (1782–1820), who published the nation&#x27;s first abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The Emancipator&quot;, at nearby Jonesborough.

When Embree&#x27;s untimely death in 1820 effectively ended publication of &quot;The Emancipator&quot;, several of Embree&#x27;s supporters turned to Ohio abolitionist Benjamin Lundy, who had started publication of his own antislavery newspaper, &quot;The Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot;, in 1821. Anticipating that a southern-based abolitionist movement would be more effective, Lundy purchased Embree&#x27;s printing press and moved to Greeneville in 1822. Lundy remained in Greeneville for two years before moving to Baltimore. He would later prove influential in the career of William Lloyd Garrison, whom he hired as an associate editor in 1829.

Greenevillians involved in the abolitionist movement included Hezekiah Balch, who freed his slaves at the Greene County Courthouse in 1807. Samuel Doak, the founder of Tusculum College, followed in 1818. Valentine Sevier (1780–1854), a nephew of John Sevier who served as Greene County Court Clerk, freed his slaves in the 1830s and offered to pay for their passage to Liberia, which had been formed as a colony for freed slaves. Francis McCorkle, the pastor of Greeneville&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, was a leading member of the Manumission Society of Tennessee.

===Civil War===
In June 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, thirty counties of the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention met in Greeneville to discuss strategy after state voters had elected to join the Confederate States of America. The convention sought to create a separate state in East Tennessee that would remain with the United States. The state government in Nashville rejected the convention&#x27;s request, however, and East Tennessee was occupied by Confederate forces shortly thereafter. Thomas Dickens Arnold, a Greeneville resident and former congressman who attended the convention, advocated the use of violent force to allow East Tennessee to break away from Tennessee, and taunted other members of the convention who advocated a more peaceful set of resolutions.

Several conspirators involved in the pro-Union East Tennessee bridge burnings lived near what is now Mosheim, and managed to destroy the railroad bridge over Lick Creek in western Greene County on the night of November 8, 1861. Two of the conspirators, Jacob Hensie and Henry Fry, were executed in Greeneville on November 30, 1861.

A portion of James Longstreet&#x27;s army wintered in Greeneville following the failed Siege of Knoxville in late 1863. Confederate general John Hunt Morgan was killed in Greeneville during a raid by Union soldiers led by Alvan Cullem Gillem on September 4, 1864.

===Andrew Johnson===
Andrew Johnson, the 17th President of the United States, spent much of his active life in Greeneville. In 1826, Johnson arrived in Greeneville after fleeing an apprenticeship in Raleigh. Johnson chose to remain in Greeneville after learning that the town&#x27;s tailor was planning to retire. Johnson purchased the tailor shop, which he moved from Main Street to its present location at the corner of Depot and College streets. Johnson married a local girl, Eliza McCardle, in 1827. The two were married by Mordecai Lincoln (1778–1851), who was Greene County&#x27;s Justice of the Peace. He was a cousin of Abraham Lincoln, under whom Johnson would serve as vice president.

In the late 1820s, a local artisan named Blackstone McDannel often stopped by Johnson&#x27;s tailor shop to debate issues of the day, especially the Indian Removal, which Johnson opposed. Johnson and McDannel decided to debate the issue publicly. The interest sparked by this debate led Johnson, McDannel, and several others to form a local debate society. The experience and influence Johnson gained in debating local issues helped him get elected to the Greeneville City Council in 1829. He was elected mayor of Greeneville in 1834, although he resigned after just a few months in office to pursue a position in the Tennessee state legislature, which he attained the following year. As Johnson rose through the ranks of political office in state and national government, he used his influence to help Greeneville constituents obtain government positions, among them his long-time supporter, Sam Milligan, who was appointed to the Court of Claims in Washington, D.C.

Whilst Andrew Johnson was away from home, during his vice-presidency, both Union and Confederate armies often used his home as a place to stay and rest during their travel. Soldiers left graffiti on the walls of Johnson&#x27;s home. Confederate soldiers left notes on the walls expressing their displeasure, to put it delicately, of Johnson. Evidence of this can still be seen at the Andrew Johnson home. Andrew Johnson had to almost completely renovate his home after he returned home from Washington, D.C.

The Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, located in Greeneville, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1963. Contributing properties include Johnson&#x27;s tailor shop at the corner of Depot and College streets. The site also maintains Johnson&#x27;s house on Main Street and the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery (atop Monument Hill to the south). A replica of Johnson&#x27;s birth home and a life-size statue of Johnson have been placed across the street from the visitor center and tailor shop.

===Indian Wars===
Buffalo Soldiers originally were members of the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed on September 21, 1866, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This nickname was given to the Black Cavalry by Native American tribes who fought in the Indian Wars. The term eventually became synonymous with all of the African-American regiments formed in 1866. Greeneville was home to at least four men who bravely served the country as &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;.

===George Clem School===
In 1887, with assistance from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the George Clem School was organized as Greeneville College. In 1932, the Greeneville Board of Education leased the property to provide public education for Negroes. Three years later, George Clem was appointed principal. Consisting of grades one through ten, the school was renamed Greeneville College High School. In 1937, the 11th grade was added. A year later, the school became an accredited four-year school. In 1939, the city purchased the school and renamed it the George Clem School. A decade later, the original building was demolished and the present building was erected in 1950. The school closed in 1965 when the public schools desegregated, and it became the location of the Greeneville City Schools Central Office. The George Clem School is often overlooked when talking about Greeneville history. Topics such as Sam Doak, the death of General Morgan, and Andrew Johnson are often the focal points when learning about Greeneville. The George Clem School is something the town should promote and be proud of. This history shows the accomplishments of the black community in Greeneville through the years. There is now a non profit organization in Greeneville by the name of George Clem Multicultural Alliance that helps honor the history of the school. The George Clem Multicultural Alliance is a non-profit 501(c)(3), public benefit, &amp; exclusively charitable organization dedicated to supporting civic pride &amp; cultural diversity awareness through various means within Wesley Heights community, and Greeneville/Greene County at large 

===Magnavox===
From 1947 to 2005, Magnavox—an electronics manufacturer best known for its television sets—operated its main three facilities in Greeneville. Magnavox was at one time the largest employer of Greeneville, employing more than 5,000 workers. Eight years after the first plant opened, Magnavox workers voted to form a union through the IBEW. In 1974, the facilities and the Magnavox company were acquired by the electronics giant Philips. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the Greeneville facility saw a fluctuation and drops in employment. In 1997, Phillips sold its facilities to Knoxville-based company Five Rivers Electronic Innovations. In 2005, Five Rivers closed the former Magnavox plant after declaring bankruptcy. Before its shuttering, the Five Rivers facility was the site of the last television manufactured in the United States, which is now on display in the Greeneville-Greene County History Museum.

===2011 tornado outbreak===
On April 27, 2011, the rural community of Camp Creek south of Greeneville was severely affected by an EF3 tornado in the 2011 Super Outbreak. Six people were killed and 220 were injured by the tornado that either damaged or destroyed over 175 homes. Two hours later, Horse Creek, southeast of Greeneville, was also hit by an EF3 tornado, with the path travelling alongside and later crossing the earlier Camp Creek event as it moved into Washington County. Another 60-65 homes were either damaged or destroyed, and around 25 farms sustained heavy structural damage. Two more people were killed by that tornado, with an estimated 70 more being injured. A total of seven were killed in Greene County, with an eighth fatality in Washington County.

===Downtown revitalization===

In 2018, town officials, with the cooperation of a development and urban design firm, began efforts towards the redevelopment of the central business district of Greeneville. The project is projected to operate in several phases, projects proposed include: a farmer&#x27;s market pavilion, a greenway along Richland Creek, an alley park, improved access for pedestrians and cyclists, parking garages, and the conversion of Depot Street into a street fair area. In October 2021, construction work began on a complete street-approach to Depot Street between Main Street and Irish Street in downtown Greeneville with enhanced pedestrian access. The project was completed in November 2023.

The town is home to the Street Dance on Davis celebration, which is held annually on the weekend before Aug. 8, in remembrance of Aug. 8, 1863, the date when Andrew Johnson freed his personal slaves at his home in Greeneville. This street dance is a celebration that includes live music, dancing in the streets, kids zones, and most importantly open dialogue that supports black history. In recent years, The George Clem Multicultural Alliance has been the host of this celebration. Although the celebration started as primarily involving the local African-American community, the event has expanded to celebrate the African-American community of East Tennessee.

The fair was also an inspiration for The Band Perry&#x27;s song &quot;Walk Me Down The Middle&quot;, which was featured on their eponymous debut album.

==Sports==
Greeneville is home to the Greeneville Flyboys, a collegiate summer baseball team of the Appalachian League, which was started in 2021. The team&#x27;s home stadium is Pioneer Park on the campus of Tusculum College.

Professional baseball was first played in Greeneville by the Greeneville Burley Cubs in the Appalachian League in 1921. They remained in the league through 1925 and returned for a second stretch from 1938 to 1942. The Burley Cubs won the league championship in 1925 and 1938. They were followed in the same league by the Greeneville Astros, who played in the city from 2004 to 2017. They won the Appalachian League championship in 2004 and 2015. The Houston Astros, parent club of Greeneville, withdrew their affiliate from the Appalachian League after the 2017 season. The circuit&#x27;s vacancy was filled by the Cincinnati Reds, who placed a Rookie-level affiliate in Greeneville known as the Greeneville Reds. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Reds were replaced by the Flyboys, a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshmen and sophomores.

<text>Mosheim (pronounced Moss-hime) is a town in Greene County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 2,479 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Mosheim (also pronounced &quot;MOSS-eyem&quot; without the &quot;h&quot; sound) originally called &quot;Blue Springs&quot; after a spring that flows through the town, was settled &quot;circa&quot; 1800. Many of its initial settlers were German Lutherans. In 1872, the Lutherans established a local college at Blue Springs known as Mosheim Institute, after the German theologian, Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (1693–1755). That same year, the name of the town was officially changed to &quot;Mosheim&quot;, after the college.

The Civil War Battle of Blue Springs was fought near Mosheim on October 10, 1863. The town of Mosheim held reenactments of this battle every year from 1991 until 2008, but ceased performing the reenactment due to financial obligations. Several participants of the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy, including noted potter Alex Haun, hailed from a community known as &quot;Pottertown,&quot; which was located just outside Mosheim.

The original Mosheim Volunteer Fire Department station 2700 is the oldest fire department in Greene County being chartered in 1961. In 1998, the Mosheim Volunteer Fire Department station 2700 split into two separate departments.

<text>Altamont is a town in and the county seat of Grundy County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,117 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Altamont was established in 1848 as a county seat for Grundy County, which had been created in 1844. General Adrian Northcutt, a prominent local farmer and military officer, was the prime advocate for the site&#x27;s selection. The town&#x27;s name comes from combining &quot;alto&quot; (meaning &quot;altitude&quot;) and &quot;mont&quot; (meaning &quot;mountain&quot;). Although the Civil War somewhat stunted the town&#x27;s growth, by 1870 Altamont&#x27;s population had grown to 217.

Altamont has one of the oldest Mormon congregations in the southeastern United States. The congregation was formed in the 1890s, and a Mormon chapel was built in Northcutt Cove just north of Altamont in 1909. Shortly thereafter, several members of the congregation migrated to Altamont. A Mormon chapel was completed along Main Street in 1947, and a newer chapel was completed just off Viola Road in 1981.

In 1988, Altamont&#x27;s school building was renovated and now houses the Altamont City Hall and the Altamont Library and Museum. The building was renamed the &quot;Florence R. Scruggs Municipal Building&quot; in 1996, after a long-time teacher at the school.

==Geography==

Altamont is located in north-central Grundy County at (35.433954, -85.732428).

Altamont is surrounded by hills on all sides, and the central area of the town itself straddles a flattened-out hillslope.

Several state highways intersect at the center of Altamont. Tennessee State Route 56 (Main Street) connects Altamont to Beersheba Springs and McMinnville to the north and Coalmont, Tracy City and Monteagle to the south.

<text>Beersheba Springs is a town in Grundy County, Tennessee, United States, in the south central part of the state. The population was 477 at the 2010 census. A prominent resort town in the 19th century, Beersheba Springs was developed in 1854 by retired wealthy slave trader, John Armfield, who bought property in the area. It became a destination for wealthy guests from Nashville and other cities. 

Tennessee author Mary Noailles Murfree later regularly stayed at the complex in the summer. The town now serves as a major summer meeting center for the Tennessee United Methodist Church.

== History ==

In 1833 Beersheba Porter Cain discovered a chalybeate spring. The spring and surrounding area, located above Collins River Valley, were incorporated in 1839. Upon its incorporation, Beersheba Springs was developed as a summer rural resort with a small hotel and log cabins. It was notable for its mineral waters, which were thought to have health-giving properties. The resort would be popular with stagecoach traffic that would travel between Chattanooga and McMinnville. 

Eventually Louisiana planters also moved into the area, leaving behind the notoriously hot and humid summers of their home state. Beersheba Springs served as the summer home for Tennessee authorMary Noailles Murfree.
===Beersheba Springs resort===
In 1854 Colonel John Armfield, a planter and former slave trader based in Alexandria, Virginia and New Orleans, Louisiana, acquired the property. He transported upwards of 100 slaves to Beersheba Springs to develop the property as a resort destination with a new luxury hotel, cabins and grounds to accommodate 400 guests. The resort also featured laundry facilities, ice houses, billiard rooms, and bowling alleys. French chefs were brought in to serve guests, as were musical acts from New Orleans.

Enslaved African Americans built a wooden observatory at the front of the hotel. From the observatory, white guests could watch Confederate and Union armies battle during the Civil War. Eventually the threat of war, raids, and plundering caused a decline in visitors to Beersheba Springs. It was sold to Northern investors.

The resort re-opened in the 1870s during the Reconstruction era, but it never returned to its former glory. In 1940, the Methodist Church purchased the resort and re-opened it for assembly and summer camps. 

Architecturally the resort remains largely unchanged, although in the late 20th century, parts of the hotel were &quot;modernized&quot; or restored. The camp now serves as the site of the annual Beersheba Springs Arts and Craft Fair. It is still a site for Methodist Church assemblies and summer camps.

In 1980 the resort area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Gruetli-Laager ( ) is a city in Grundy County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,813 at the 2010 census. As its name implies, Gruetli-Laager consists of two communities— Gruetli and Laager— incorporated as a single city.

==History==
Gruetli was founded by German-speaking Swiss immigrants in 1869. The town was part of a greater initiative— conducted by an organization known as the Tennessee Kolonisation Gesellschaft— to establish Swiss colonies atop the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. Gruetli was probably named after a commune in the Swiss canton of Glarus. Peter Staub, a member of Knoxville&#x27;s thriving Swiss community, helped purchase the initial tract of land for Gruetli. The land was advertised in Switzerland, where the opportunity for a new start appealed to many families struggling with difficult economic conditions in Europe.

Although over 100 Swiss families moved to the Gruetli area in the 1870s, many were disappointed by the land&#x27;s poor quality and relative isolation, and thus relocated to nearby cities. Nevertheless, by 1880, Grundy County had the largest Swiss population of any county in Tennessee. Prominent early settlers at Gruetli included Christian Marugg, who operated an inn along the stagecoach road between Chattanooga and McMinnville, and Melchior Thoni, Jr. (1849–1926), a woodcarver whose work was displayed in the old Governor&#x27;s Mansion and the Christ Church in Nashville.

Throughout the early 1900s, railroads were constructed in the hills east of Gruetli to accommodate various coal mining operations in the area. Laager was established as a railroad stopover (initially known as &quot;Henley&#x27;s Switch&quot;) in 1918. Gruetli and Laager merged and incorporated in 1980.

==Geography==
Gruetli-Laager is located southeast of the center of Grundy County at (35.373152, -85.623617). The city is situated atop the southern Cumberland Plateau, roughly halfway between the plateau&#x27;s Sequatchie Valley escarpment to the east and its Highland Rim escarpment to the west. Just north of the city, the Collins River and its upper watershed slice a gorge known as &quot;Savage Gulf&quot; as the river descends the plateau en route to its confluence with the Caney Fork at Rock Island.

Gruetli-Laager stretches for several miles along Tennessee State Route 108 (SR 108). The highway connects the area with the Sequatchie Valley and Chattanooga area to the southeast. Just west of Gruetli-Laager, SR 108 intersects SR 56, which connects the area to Monteagle and Interstate 24 to the southwest and McMinnville to the northwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Tracy City is a town in Grundy County, Tennessee, United States. Incorporated in 1915, the population was 1,481 at the 2010 census. Named after financier Samuel Franklin Tracy, the city developed out of railroad and mining interests after coal was found in 1840. In 2010 the people of Tracy City elected a dead man, Carl Robin Geary, as mayor.

==History==

In 1840 local boys digging a groundhog out of the ground discovered coal. In the early 1870s Tracy City an experimental blast furnace was built by Samuel Jones and owned by the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The furnace, called &quot;Fiery Gizzard&quot;, was built to see if local coal would be used to produce iron. The furnace made 15 tons of iron before the stovepipe fell on the third day. The former location of the furnace is marked with a historical marker. The coke ovens at Tracy City supplied railroad and industrial fuel and workers and their families moved into the area in great numbers from 1875 until 1900. By 1910 the industry faded due to problems invoked by labor unions and convict labor. Tracy City is also home to the oldest family bakery in Tennessee, Dutch Maid Bakery. In 1987 the coke ovens were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Tracy City was incorporated in 1915.

Tracy City has featured prominently in Grundy County&#x27;s history of arson. Ten buildings in the business district were set alight in 1935. The 100-year-old L&amp;N Depot, 86-year-old James K. Shook School, various waterworks, schools, a lumber yard, and a doctor&#x27;s clinic were also torched in the 20th century. This tradition has continued into the 21st century.

The town developed southeast of Vann&#x27;s Ferry (Vann Town), a ferry crossing established by James Vann, a prominent Cherokee trader and planter.

The first post office was opened on June 16, 1841. In 1870 the Hamilton County Courthouse was moved from Harrison to Chattanooga.

Harrison&#x27;s borders were once larger than today. When the Chickamauga Dam was completed on the Tennessee River by the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1940, much of the city was flooded, as portrayed in the 1960 movie &quot;Wild River&quot;. Some parts of the old city, such as old building foundations, roads, and guard rails, can still be seen, especially in and around Harrison Bay, named for the submerged town. Harrison Bay State Park is a TVA-built park in the area now.

<doc id="135217" wikidata="Q3287278" url="?curid=135217" title="Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee">
<text>Soddy-Daisy is a city in Hamilton County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 13,070 at the 2020 census and estimated to be 13,619 in 2022. The city was formed in 1969 when the communities of Soddy (to the north) and Daisy (to the south), along with nearby developed areas along U.S. Route 27, merged to form Soddy-Daisy. It is becoming a bedroom community of nearby Chattanooga and is part of the Chattanooga Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sequoyah Nuclear Generating Station is located in Soddy-Daisy.

==History==
Soddy-Daisy is an incorporated city, comprising the former Tennessee cities of Soddy and Daisy. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

Soddy-Daisy was home to Hamilton County&#x27;s first courthouse and government seat, Poe&#x27;s Tavern. The tavern, built in 1819, was the home of Soddy-Daisy resident Hasten Poe. In 1838, the tavern served as a way station for 1,900 Cherokees who were on the Trail of Tears. During the Civil War, Poe&#x27;s Tavern served as a hospital for both Union and Confederate troops. Though the original Poe&#x27;s Tavern was torn down in 1911, the city of Soddy-Daisy has reconstructed a replica of the building a block away from the original site.

There are two popular stories about how the city of Soddy got its name. The first is that the word &quot;Soddy&quot; is an anglicization of &quot;Tsati&quot;, a shorter form of the Cherokee word ᎠᏂ ᎫᏌᏘ Ᏹ (&quot;Ani-Kusati-yi&quot;), referring to the Muskogean Koasati people who lived there in the 18th century prior to Cherokee migration to the area after 1776. The second theory is that Soddy was named for William Sodder, who ran a trading post in the city. Others claim that Soddy&#x27;s name is a reference to Soddy Creek, which is believed to have originated from the Cherokee word &quot;Sauta&quot;, which is derived from &quot;Echota&quot;. Soddy was a very small town until the Soddy Coal Company began mining in 1867.

Daisy is rumored to have taken its name from Daisy Parks, the daughter of Thomas Parks. Thomas Parks was vice-president of the Tabler-Cleudup Coal &amp; Coke Company, and founded the Daisy Coal Company in April 1881.

The two cities incorporated in April 1969 along a stretch of U.S. 27.

<text>Sneedville is the only city in and the county seat of Hancock County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,282 per the 2020 census.

==History==
Settlement began in the 1790s, following the American Revolutionary War, as migrants moved into the area from the Piedmont frontiers of Virginia and North Carolina. Such migrants had formed families in colonial Virginia. Among them was a multi-racial group of settlers who became known as Melungeons. They have been documented as having primarily European and sub-Saharan African ancestry. They also have a lesser amount of Native American heritage.

The county historical society asserts that French traders noted encountering the Melungeons in the late 1600s in the area that is now east Tennessee. Such early settlement is not supported by the research of Edward Price, a cultural geographer who wrote a 1950 dissertation on the Melungeons; Dr. Virginia DeMarce, a professional genealogist; and Paul Heinegg, a genealogist; each of whom has documented the migration of ancestors of the first families known as Melungeon from Virginia and North Carolina in the late eighteenth century

When Hancock County was formed from parts of Hawkins and Claiborne counties in the 1840s, Greasy Rock was chosen as the county seat. The city was renamed in honor of William Henry Sneed (1812–1869), a Confederate and attorney from Knoxville who helped legally defend the new county when several residents sued in an attempt to block its creation.

<text>Hickory Valley is a town in Hardeman County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 99 at the 2010 census. Hickory Valley&#x27;s origin dates back to the blending of three independent pioneer settlements in the area that were founded by three men: William Shinault in 1820, Drury Wood in 1826 and William Barnett in 1827.

==History==

Hickory Valley&#x27;s origin dates back to the blending of three independent pioneer settlements in the area that were founded by three men: William Shinault in 1820, Drury Wood in 1826 and William Barnett in 1827. The Shinault Settlement formed before Hardeman County was organized and featured the first school in Hardeman County, which operated as early as 1823. The main buildings of the settlement were located one mile southwest of the present town and a former Indian trail and the historical Boliver-LaGrange Road are still visible in some places south of Hickory Valley. In 1826 Drury Wood migrated to the area and founded the Hickory Valley settlement; a cemetery for the Wood family is still located in the area and marks the original site of the settlement. William Barnett would move into the area in 1827 and would establish Mt. Comfort Church and a campground about two miles west of the present town. The Chickasaw also resided in the area.

The construction of the railroad into the area in the 1850s brought a growth in population. A railroad levee that runs through the town is still visible, and is believed to have been built by slaves from a plantation owned by Darius Robinson. Railroad engineer Casey Jones was a frequenter of the town during his travels.

Hickory Valley was deeply affected by the Civil War. The railroad fell under the control of the Union Army after being abandoned by the Confederate Army. Skirmishes were fought in the area as well. In 1873 the city was laid out again and the city began to revive until the yellow fever epidemic of 1878. The town&#x27;s population was described by the &quot;Bolivar Bulletin&quot; as &quot;fleeing from the scourge&quot;. The town was also quarantined in 1882 due to a smallpox outbreak.

<text>Hornsby is a town in Hardeman County and McNairy County, Tennessee. The population was 303 at the 2010 census. The town is just east of Bolivar along U.S. Highway 64.

==History==

Before 1820, Dr. Daniel Smith Webb started a gristmill and sawmill along the Little Hatchie River in Wade Creek Valley. The area would come to be known as Webb&#x27;s Mill, and in the 1820s, Joel and William Crain, two Revolutionary veterans, moved to the area and founded a port and supply depot near Webb&#x27;s Mill. The area would eventually have a two churches, a subscription school, a stagecoach stop and an inn between Bolivar and Purdy. This town would be called Crainville. Crainville would become a railroad town in the early 1900s and a new train depot was built by the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad on a farm owned by Kimborough Hornsby. An artesian well was drilled in 1915 near the depot and was the first of its kind in the United States. On October 16, 1920, Hornsby&#x27;s charter was written and a new government was formed. The first home was built by Finley Holyfield in 1919 and by 1923 the town had earned the name &quot;the village of artesian wells,&quot; with nine in total.

In 1971, a tornado hit Hornsby, destroying a number of homes. A number of early 20th century homes still stand in the area and the remains of Crainville are still visible just east of town.

<doc id="135224" wikidata="Q2647632" url="?curid=135224" title="Saulsbury, Tennessee">
<text>Saulsbury is a town in rural Hardeman County, Tennessee. It is located along State Highway 57 in southwest Hardeman County. The population was 99 at the 2000 census and 81 at the 2010 census showing a decrease of 18. Saulsbury is the least-populated incorporated municipality in Tennessee.

==History==

Saulsbury&#x27;s historical roots stem from a former settlement named Berlin, Tennessee, which was located one mile south of the current location of Saulsbury. Two regional mail roads—one from Bolivar to Ripley, Mississippi, and another from LaGrange to Corinth, Mississippi. These mail roads met at an intersection which would form into a trading center. In 1839 a post office was established there, and Berlin would be incorporated in 1846, and within five years it would be home to 351 people. Upon the completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, Berlin was bypassed due to one landowner&#x27;s refusal to sell their property to the railroad. A track was instead laid one mile north of Berlin, on land that was owned by Burrell Sauls and Berry Futrell. The finished railroad station and track would be called Sauls-Berry Depot. Eventually Berlin would be deserted as people moved to the new settlement and in 1856 Saulsbury was incorporated.

===Civil War===

Just after the taking of Memphis in 1862, the Union Army took Saulsbury. Skirmishes continued throughout the area, and eventually Saulsbury would return to Confederate control. Confederate soldiers used Saulsbury as a rally point to travel to Corinth to join their regiments. After the Civil War, Saulsbury maintained itself as a town, unlike others in the area which barely survived the war. Saulsbury&#x27;s cotton production survived the war as well, and Saulsbury emerged as a leader in cotton production in the region. The town also became a producer of eggs, turkeys, poultry and hogs; which were often sent to Memphis for sale. Sand mining became a major industry in the 1870s, providing 47 different types of sand for brass molding.

===1999 Tornado===
On January 17, 1999, an F1 tornado formed just southwest of Saulsbury, and moved northeast until dissipating near Rogers Springs. One person was killed, four others were injured. Fourteen houses and mobile homes were destroyed, and twenty-seven others were damaged. Power lines and trees also sustained significant damage.
As a result, the town of Saulsbury installed a tornado siren at the local fire station, the only one in the area at the time.

==Climate==

Saulsbury&#x27;s climate is generally similar to the rest of the Mid-South. The summer months are persistently hot and humid with afternoon temperatures frequently above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Afternoon thunderstorms are frequent during some summers, but usually brief, lasting no longer than an hour. Early autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can remain hot until late October. Abrupt but short-lived cold snaps are common. Late autumn is rainy and colder, December being the third rainiest month of the year. Winters are mild, but cold snaps can occur. Snowfall is not abundant but does occur during most winters, with usually one or two major winter weather events occurring by the end of March. Spring often begins in late February or early March, following the onset of a sharp warmup. This season is also known as &quot;severe weather season&quot; due to the higher frequency of tornadoes, hail, and thunderstorms producing strong winds. Average rainfall is slightly higher during the spring months (except November) than the rest of the year. Historically, April is the month with the highest frequency of tornadoes, though tornadoes have occurred every month of the year. Saulsbury-area historical tornado activity is above Tennessee state average. It is 155% greater than the overall U.S. average. The area is sunny about 62.5% of the time.

==Arts and culture==

In the 1970s the Saulsbury Methodist Church, which was built in 1913, was deeded to town for the community library. Upon the completion of fundraising, the town was able to renovate the building; they installed heating and air conditioning, and made it accessible. A number of antebellum homes and buildings are preserved in Saulsbury. The town has three active community clubs: the Saulsbury Community Club, the Nifty Needles Women&#x27;s Club, and the Friendship Club.

===Annual cultural events===

Saulsbury hosts three major events each year: a Christmas tree-lighting, the Community Celebration, and a home decorating contest, all in December. The community also hosts year round bake-off, a fish fry in June, and an annual stew sale in October; all which benefit community projects.

===In popular culture===

The final destination for the principal characters, Lena Grove and Byron Bunch, in William Faulkner&#x27;s novel, &quot;Light in August&quot;, is Saulsbury.

<text>Saltillo is a town in Hardin County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 420 at the 2020 census. Saltillo is located on the left bank of the Tennessee River, about 12 miles north of Savannah.

==History==

Saltillo was founded by Thomas Shannon in October 1822. He had left Davidson County, Tennessee and arrived in the area on a keelboat with enough provisions to last one year, two men, Colonel John Holland and Parkerson Mitchell, to assist him, and four black men. The men arrived via Tennessee River and built camp about half a mile from the river. Shannon&#x27;s wife and seven children came by land with a drive of forty cattle. This cattle would serve as the starting point for Shannon to raise cattle for income, but the cattle were unable to adapt to the change in their environment and feeding. Within three months of grazing, 39 of the 40 cattle were dead. Shortly after the Shannon family&#x27;s arrival, Shannon and his sons built a log cabin in 1825, serving as the first house built in Saltillo. Shortly thereafter a store-house was built by Smith Hawkins for dry goods to be distributed, which were sold out within three months. The area where this store-house was built is now called Hawkin&#x27;s Landing.

More settlers came to the area and another store was built a quarter mile south of the first store by Hawkin&#x27;s brother, Perry. The first man to be killed in town was Simpson Lee, who was thrown off his horse. Barges began regularly delivering goods and residents would travel as far as the Duck River for a grist mill. In 1842 Thomas Davy purchased the land once owned by Thomas Shannon and it was named Davy&#x27;s Landing. In 1849 Davy leased the land to Scott Terry, who renamed the area Saltillo. The town was named Saltillo after Saltillo, Mexico by Terry, who was a veteran of the Mexican–American War. The Saltillo post office was opened in 1850. Saltillo was incorporated in 1870.

<text>Mount Carmel is a city in Hawkins County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,429, an increase of 634 since the 2000 census. It is part of the Kingsport-Bristol-Bristol, TN-VA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==
Mount Carmel is in Hawkins County, which was once called Spencer county, and was a part of the State of Franklin. The State of Franklin comprised eight counties in western North Carolina in the late 1700s. Governed by John Sevier, it operated as an independent state for four years before it ultimately rejoined North Carolina.

Mount Carmel once garnered national attention in the mid-2000s because of a CBS News story stating the town&#x27;s geography is situated on only one side of the main highway through the area. Since then, the city has secured property on the other side of the road and has built a cemetery.

Since the 1980s, the community has faced economic hardship due to political turmoil in its government operations, and the outsourcing of its retail and municipal services to neighboring Church Hill and Kingsport. In 2020, the city would begin discussions of connecting to either of the two cities&#x27; sewer systems following the Mount Carmel sewer plant going insolvent. Calls for Mount Carmel to merge into Kingsport or Church Hill have been raised since 2021 because of the financial instability.

<text>Rogersville is a town in and the county seat of Hawkins County, Tennessee, United States. It was settled in 1775 by the grandparents of Davy Crockett. It is named for its founder, Joseph Rogers. Tennessee&#x27;s second oldest courthouse, the Hawkins County Courthouse, first newspaper &quot;The Knoxville Gazette&quot;, and first post office are all located in Rogersville. The Rogersville Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Rogersville is part of the Kingsport-Bristol-Bristol, TN-VA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Tri-Cities region.

The population of Rogersville as of the 2010 census was 4,671.

==History==

===Settlement background===

In 1775, the grandparents of Davy Crockett, a future member of the United States Congress from Tennessee and hero of the Alamo, settled in the Watauga colony in the area in what is today Rogersville near the spring that today bears their name. After an American Indian attack and massacre, the remaining Crocketts sold the property to a Huguenot named Colonel Thomas Amis.

In 1780, Colonel Amis built a fort at Big Creek, on the outskirts of the present-day town, with the assistance of fellow Scots-Irish settler John Carter. That same year, about above downtown Rogersville, Amis erected a fortress-like stone house, around which he built a palisade for protection against Native American attack. The next year, Amis opened a store, erected a blacksmith shop, and built a distillery. He also eventually established a sawmill and a gristmill. From the first he kept a house of entertainment.

===Founding of the town===
In 1785, the State of Franklin organized Spencer County (which includes the area of present-day Hawkins County, Tennessee) and declared the seat of county government to be located at what is today Rogersville. Thomas Henderson was chosen county court clerk and colonel of the militia. William Cocke and Thomas King were elected representatives to the Franklin General Assembly. The remaining county officers are unknown.

In November 1786, North Carolina began once more to contend with the Franklin government for control over the area, and that state&#x27;s General Assembly passed an act creating Hawkins County. It included within its limits all the territory between Bays Mountain and the Holston and Tennessee rivers on the east to the Cumberland Mountains on the west. The county court was organized at the house of Thomas Gibbons. As had the state of Franklin, North Carolina set the new county seat about the property of Joseph Rogers.

===Joseph Rogers===

Joseph Rogers (August 21, 1764 – November 6, 1833) was born near Cook&#x27;s Town, Ireland, the son of James Rogers and his wife, Elizabeth Brown. He traveled to the area, by then known as the State of Franklin (which had been carved out of far west North Carolina), by 1785. During a stay at a tavern adjacent to Colonel Thomas Amis&#x27; home, Rogers met the colonel&#x27;s daughter, Mary Amis, whom he wed, on October 24, 1786. Her father ceded the lands near Crockett Spring to his son-in-law— the same land that Colonel Amis had purchased from the heirs of David Crockett.

When North Carolina considered where to establish the county seat for its new Hawkins County, Rogers successfully lobbied to have the government located near his home. He volunteered his tavern, which had been established about 1784–85, as the first county courthouse, where it was finally established in 1787. With the help of other local settlers, Rogers laid out a plan for the town, and the town of Rogersville was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1789. The plan included a public square, deeded to the town government, which would host the town&#x27;s public well and a county courthouse.

In November 1792, Rogers was appointed the first postmaster at Rogersville. The town&#x27;s second post office, built by Rogers c. 1815, still stands at the corner of east Main Street and south Hasson Street.

Rogers was the father of fourteen children with Mary. He died on November 6, 1833, at Rogersville, and is buried in Rogers Cemetery. His wife, Mary, died a month later.

===A town divided===
In November 1863, during the Civil War, Rogersville was the site of a battle between occupying Federal forces and invading Confederate troops. Union forces had encamped just outside the town. The Confederates, led by Brigadier General William E. Jones, were able to surprise the Union forces and pursue them across the Holston River and into Greene County. The Confederates held the town for the remainder of the war.

Sentiment in Rogersville was divided. Many supported the efforts of twenty-six East Tennessee counties seceding from the state (much as the State of Scott had done) and re-joining the Union. Others saw President Lincoln&#x27;s invasion of Tennessee as an unprecedented invasion of their homes and an incursion by Federal power; these people became strong Confederates. Rogersville was spared destruction during the war. In fact, structures such as the Hale Springs Inn were used by the different occupying armies.

===Cradle of Tennessee journalism===

George Roulstone was Tennessee&#x27;s first printer. He was encouraged to settle in Rogersville by William Blount, the new governor of the Southwest Territory. Roulston printed Tennessee&#x27;s first newspaper on November 5, 1791. Because Knoxville, the intended seat of the new territorial government, had not yet been established, Roulstone published the first year of his paper near the Rogers tavern. Roulstone called the newspaper &quot;The Knoxville Gazette&quot; and in October 1792, he moved his press to Knoxville, where he continued to publish the &quot;Gazette&quot; as well as other papers until his death in 1804. After the &quot;Gazette&quot; was moved, there was no newspaper in the area until 1813, when John B. Hood began publishing &quot;The East Tennessee Gazette&quot; at Rogersville. Other papers shortly followed, including &quot;The Western Pilot&quot;, c. 1815, and &quot;The Rogersville Gazette&quot; from the same era.

Specialty publications emerged during these early days, including &quot;The Rail-Road Advocate&quot;, &quot;The Calvinistic Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Holston Watchman&quot;. Numerous other newspapers have been published in Rogersville over the years, most surviving only a short time and having modest circulation. Among them were &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Rogersville Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Reporter&quot;, &quot;The Rogersville Gazette&quot;, &quot;Rogersville Press and Times&quot;, &quot;Holston Journal&quot;, &quot;Hawkins County Republican&quot;, &quot;Hawkins County Telephone&quot;, and &quot;The Rogersville Herald.&quot;

Rogersville&#x27;s longest-lasting newspaper is &quot;The Rogersville Review&quot;, which began publication as &quot;The Holston Review&quot; in 1885 by William T. Robertson. A year later, Robertson changed the name to the present banner. The &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s closest competitor in lifespan was &quot;The Rogersville Herald&quot;, which was published from 1886 to 1932.

The town&#x27;s printing heritage is chronicled by the Tennessee Newspaper and Printing Museum, located in the town&#x27;s historic Southern Railway train depot, c. 1890.

===Modern day===
In 2020, the Rogersville Town Council acquired a three-acre site of a vacant shopping center with plans to turn the site into a civic service campus, consisting of a new community center, town hall, and a concessions area for users of Rogersville town park, which borders the complex site.

<text>Brownsville is a city in and the county seat of Haywood County, Tennessee, United States. Its population as of the 2020 census was 9,788. The city is named after General Jacob Jennings Brown, an American officer of the War of 1812.

==History==
Brownsville was a trading center that developed in association with cotton plantations and commodity agriculture in the lowlying Delta of the Mississippi River around Memphis, Tennessee and West Tennessee. It is located north of the Hatchie River, a tributary of the Mississippi, which originally served as the main transportation routes to markets for cotton. The land was developed by planters for cotton plantations, and worked by large numbers of enslaved persons of African ancestry who made up a majority of the town and county population.

=== Early history and settlers ===
Brownsville was designated the county seat of Haywood County by the legislature on October, 16, 1824, and the town was legally incorporated in 1826. The town was named for General Jacob Jennings Brown due to a local legend that he has established a trading post just southeast of what is now the town square prior to the treaty with the Chickasaw people allowing settlement in Western Tennessee. Fifty acres of land were deeded for Brownsville on December, 14 1825 for a sum of one dollar and the choice of lots. By 1832, Brownsville had grown to a population of 400. The town continued to flourish until the major financial depression of 1837. Only two of the town&#x27;s ten stores survived this period. During this time, the area was also struck with repeated flooding and a number of earthquakes.

Bradford&#x27;s Landing was founded in 1824 by brothers Hiram and Miles Bradford. Hiram would later establish the first cotton gin and store in Brownsville in 1825. This storefront was later purchased by early Jewish settler Emil Tamm, and operated as Emil Tamm &amp; Sons Department Store for 96 years. 

The Tabernacle Campground was founded in 1826 by Reverend Howell Lewis Taylor and his five sons. This settlement contained Haywood County&#x27;s first schoolhouse. It now serves as the site of an annual camp meeting for over 700 descendants of Taylor.

James Bond arrived in Brownsville in 1836 and acted as a benefactor for many of the city&#x27;s institutions. Bond owned in excess of 17,000 acres in Haywood County alone and owned as many as 600 slaves. He provided the land for the establishment of both Brownsville Baptist Female College in 1850 and Brownsville Baptist Church in 1870. He also invested heavily in various mercantile ventures in Brownsville and the Memphis and Ohio Railroad which would connect Haywood County to Memphis upon its completion. During the Union occupation of Haywood County in June 1862, Bond swore loyalty to the Union.

One of Brownsville&#x27;s earliest Jewish settlers was Jacob Felsenthal who arrived in the United States in 1840 from Bavaria. He arrived in Brownsville in 1847 and opened a retail store by the name of Felsenthal Bros. and Sons. This store would later be renamed Felsenthal&#x27;s Department Store and served the community until it was destroyed by a fire in 1980.

In the mid to late 19th century, German Jewish immigrants also settled in Brownsville. They founded a congregation in the 1860s, and built Temple Adas Israel in 1882. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is believed to be the oldest synagogue in Tennessee, and is a rare example of a synagogue built in the Gothic Revival style.

The town is notable for its many well-preserved homes owned by wealthy planters before the Civil War, and multi-generational family-owned farms. Notable among these include James Bond&#x27;s home, which was moved to nearby Dyersburg in 1975, the Eader House constructed in 1865, which is now used as an event venue, Lucerne, a former plantation constructed in 1855 which is now on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Joshua K. Hutchison House, also on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Civil War ===
The Haywood Blues were organized in Brownsville in spring 1861, consisting of approximately 100 men and captained by G.C. Porter. This company was mustered into service in May 1861 and was assigned as Company A of the 6th Tennessee Infantry. This regiment, and likewise Company A, fought in the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, Stones River, Chickamauga, Franklin, Nashville, and took part in the Atlanta campaign. They were surrendered to United States forces in North Carolina.

The Haywood Rifles were also organized in Brownsville in spring 1861. The company consisted of around 100 men with Robert S. Russell served as captain. In May 1861 they were assigned their position as Company B of the 9th Tennessee Infantry.

Company L of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry of the Confederate Army was organized in Brownsville in April 1862. Upon organization, James Allen Taylor served as captain, Alex Duckworth served as first lieutenant, and Frank Pugh served as third lieutenant.The unit consisted of roughly another 65 non-commissioned officers and privates. The company remained in Brownsville until May 12, 1862 when they were ordered to report to Fort Pillow, staying there until the fort&#x27;s fall and then were ordered to report to Colonel William Hicks Jackson. In the fall of 1862, Taylor resigned as captain citing ill health and thus Duckworth was made captain in spring 1863. They continued under this regiment until the end of the war when it was surrendered by Nathan Bedford Forrest in May 1865. Brownsville and Haywood County produced many other companies to the secessionist army, including two to the 7th Cavalry, two to the 14th Cavalry, three to the 15th Cavalry, and four to the 9th Infantry.

Following President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation, a known 112 African Americans of Brownsville and Haywood County joined the Union Army across 20 different regiments, primarily the 3rd Regiment Heavy Artillery USCT and the 4th Regiment Heavy Artillery USCT. In addition, the area also produced one dedicated unit for the Union Army, a company for the 13th Cavalry. Another company of about 60 men was raised for the Union in Haywood County by Captain J.L. Poston. The majority of these men were killed during the Fort Pillow massacre. Despite the formation of these units and numerous prominent Unionists in the area at the time, a monument dedicated solely to the Confederate dead was erected in 1909. There have since been calls to see the monuments removal, but no action has been taken by the county.

=== Reconstruction ===
Through the late 19th century, whites worked to re-establish supremacy after Reconstruction and impose Jim Crow and second-class status on African Americans. Tennessee effectively disenfranchised most blacks in the state after the turn of the 20th century, excluding them from the political system and destroying what had been a competitive system. The state&#x27;s congressional delegation and elected officials became predominantly white Democrats with the exception of East Tennessee, where white Republicans formed the majority. The region of yeomen farmers had been mostly Unionist-leaning during the Civil War.

Brownsville was struck by the yellow fever epidemic of 1878. The city saw 844 reported cases of the disease and suffered more than 200 deaths. Members of the Howard Association supplied much needed assistance to Brownsville during this time. Many victims of the epidemic were buried in Brownsville&#x27;s Oakwood Cemetery. Due to the limited workforce available to bury each victim individually, several of them were buried in an unmarked mass grave.

===Lynchings===
From the late 19th into the early 20th century, whites lynched three African-American men in Brownsville, two in the 20th century.

In 1939, with Haywood County&#x27;s black majority disenfranchised, a number of blacks in Brownsville founded a local NAACP chapter. They worked to assert their right to register and vote in the presidential election of 1940. In June 1940 threats were made against the group, and Elisha Davis was kidnapped by a large white mob. They demanded the names of NAACP members and their plans. He fled town, followed by his family, losing his successful service station and all their property.

On June 20, 1940, Elbert Williams, secretary of the NAACP chapter, and Elisha&#x27;s brother Thomas Davis were questioned by police. Thomas Davis was released, but Williams was never seen alive again. His body was found in the Hatchie River a few days later, with bullet holes in his chest. He is considered to be the first NAACP member to have been lynched for civil rights activities; he is the last recorded lynching victim in the state. Several other NAACP members were run out of town by police, fearing for their lives.

Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP conducted an investigation of Williams&#x27; murder and appealed to the Department of Justice to prosecute the case, providing affidavits of witnesses. FBI agents were sent to the town in September to protect blacks wanting to register to vote, but the local people were fearful because there had been no prosecution of Williams&#x27; killers. In October 1940, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the magazine of the NAACP, reported that no blacks registered to vote. Thomas Davis and his family moved North and resettled in Niles, Michigan. The DOJ closed the Williams case in 1942.

In 2015, a historical marker honoring Elbert Williams was dedicated in Brownsville.

The Tennessee College of Applied Technology-Jackson operates an extension branch in the city. Additionally, the University of Tennessee system operates an Institute of Agriculture extension in Brownsville in collaboration with an extension from Tennessee State University&#x27;s College of Agriculture.

In the past, Brownsville was home to institutes of higher education. The Brownsville Female Seminary was founded in 1842 by Presbyterian settlers. The Brownsville Baptist Female College was established in 1850 by the Tennessee Baptist Convention and opened in 1851. This was the only one of 18 colleges within a 60 mile radius of Brownsville to survive the Civil War. There were a limited number of male graduates of this female college, but among them was future governor of Missouri Joseph Folk. Former president of Wake Forest College John Brown White served as president of the Brownsville Baptist Female College briefly until 1855. This college survived until 1897 and the campus remained empty until 1911 when it was purchased by the county to house Haywood High School until the opening of the current location in 1970. Organized in 1869, the Wesleyan Female College was formed, offering courses in languages, music, and other academic disciplines. Wesleyan survived until the 1890s when it was closed by its trustees and thereafter became the home of the Ogilvie Training School for Boys. 

Brownsville also operated Dunbar School, established in the 1890s to serve the African American population. Dunbar School burned in the 1919 and was replaced by Haywood County Training School, later renamed George Washington Carver High School. Also in the late 19th century, Brownsville Public School was opened, operating as a grammar school and offering high school courses until the establishment of Haywood High School. This school building was destroyed by a fire in the late 1920s. Haywood County Memorial Hospital was built in its place and served the community between 1931 and 1974, before being replaced by Haywood Park General Hospital. Additionally, a private school, Tennessee Academy was formed in 1969 to house grades K-12. In 1985 Tennessee Academy was purchased by the county and became Haywood Junior High School, now Haywood Middle School. 

Brownsville was considered by the Tennessee General Assembly in 1963 to receive one of the state&#x27;s first three community colleges. However, the college was ultimately given to nearby Jackson and became Jackson State Community College, the first of its kind in West Tennessee. 

Brownsville is served by the Elma Ross Public Library. The library finished construction in 1992 after funding was raised jointly by the county, city, and local philanthropist David William Ross. Brownsville was previously served by a Carnegie Library, established after Brownsville mayor John O. Bomer received a $7,500 grant in 1909. This library finished construction in 1912 and was renamed the Brownsville-Haywood County Library in 1957. This library began to become overcrowded in the late 1980s, prompting the construction of the current library. The Carnegie Library building is now used by the Brownsville-Haywood County Chamber of Commerce.

Brownsville&#x27;s only local newspaper is the &quot;Brownsville States-Graphic&quot;. The &quot;States-Graphic&quot; was formed by a merger between &quot;The States Democrat&quot; and &quot;The Graphic&quot; in 1900. The &quot;States Democrat&quot; itself was formed from a merger of &quot;The States&quot; and &quot;The Democrat&quot; in 1886. The first newspaper to be printed in Brownsville was &quot;The Phoenix&quot; in 1837. This paper was used primarily to print partisan papers during political campaigns. 

==Arts and culture==
The Tina Turner Museum—dedicated to singer Tina Turner, born in Brownsville in 1939—is located in a renovated schoolhouse Turner attended. Located alongside the Tina Turner Museum is the relocated childhood home of local blues musician Sleepy John Estes.

The Ann L. Marks Performing Arts Center is located in the College Hill Historic District. The theater is named for local writer Ann Liberman Marks who made substantial contributions to the arts during her lifetime. The theater houses 420 attendees and was built in 1920.

Brownsville is home to The Mindfield, the largest sculpture in Tennessee. It has been single-handedly constructed by local author and artist Billy Tripp every year since 1989. The sculpture is 127 feet at its tallest and approximately 300 feet in length.

In 2017, construction was completed on an amphitheater in downtown Brownsville. The venue plays host to numerous events, including concerts, fundraisers, and public celebrations. Free weekly concerts are held regularly in the summer to showcase local talent.

Brownsville was previously home to a spacious three-story opera house. This venue saw many traveling companies throughout the years, and also hosted various local programs, talent shows, and dances. Notable performances at the opera house were done by W. C. Handy and John Philip Sousa. The opera house was destroyed by a fire that had started in a restaurant nearby in December of 1931.

<text>Stanton is a town in Haywood County, Tennessee. The population was 615 as of the 2000 census and 452 at the 2010 census, showing a population decrease of 163.

==Geography==
Stanton is located at (35.462463, -89.401253).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==

Joseph Blackwell Stanton purchased the land that is now the town of Stanton in the early 1830s for roughly $3.50 per acre. Stanton used his influence in the area to ensure the railroad line ran through his land, and thereafter numerous families moved to the community from the nearby Wesley community some four miles to the west. Initial businesses in the area were a depot operated by Corydon Spencer and a store operated by F.W. Chaney, who also served as the small town&#x27;s first postmaster. Stanton passed soon after this influx of population, and his property passed to his daughter, the wife of Colonel Nathan Adams of the 254th Transportation Battalion. The couple began selling lots in town and saw many of the remaining businesses and homes of Wesley move to Stanton. Mrs. Adams was a staunch prohibitionist and ensured the establishment of a clause barring the sale of whiskey in the town. A now defunct hotel was housed in the downtown area soon after, along with the establishment of the Baptist church being built on land granted by Chaney. This church housed the town&#x27;s first school. The Methodist church was later built on land given by a Mr. Somervell, consisting of the congregation from Wesley&#x27;s Methodist church. The Presbyterian church was built in 1872 and the Church of Christ was established in 1952. The Masonic Lodge was constructed in 1871, with the top floor being used by the Masons while the bottom floor operated as a school.

Stanton provided many soldiers to the Confederate Army during the Civil War. During the war, Union general W. H. L. Wallace and his troops camped near the property of Corydon Spencer, before being fired upon by secessionist troops. In retaliation, Wallace is said to have given the order to raze the town, but was talked down by Spencer. Despite this aversion, the town faced two disastrous fires in the coming years. In 1874 a fire destroyed the lower part of the business section, much of which was rebuilt in brick. The other section, however, was not updated alongside these renovations and was itself destroyed in large part during a fire in 1922. The town also suffered during the Lower Mississippi Valley yellow fever epidemic of 1878. While facing minimal fatalities due to the epidemic, mass hysteria ensued and many families fled the area. One notable fatality was John J. Ashe, a former Stanton resident who had since moved to Memphis, who had come back to the town to nurse the sick. Ashe had previously been arrested, and later cleared, on charges relating to complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Shortly before the assassination, Ashe had sent a postcard stating that Lincoln &quot;... ought to be killed&quot; which he sent through the mail.

Following these hardships, the town recovered and continued to grow, seeing many new homes and businesses built. In 1927 the town was formally incorporated into Haywood County. The town had previously petitioned for incorporation in the 1880s but this charter would ultimately be abolished.

==Economy==
A tract in southwestern Haywood County near Stanton has been designated for a state-supported industrial &quot;megasite,&quot; intended for a large-scale industrial or business development such as an automobile assembly plant. In September 2009, Tennessee&#x27;s State Building Commission authorized spending of $40 million for purchase of the land.

On September 27, 2021, it was announced that Ford and SK Innovation would construct a complex at the megasite called &quot;Blue Oval City&quot; to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries. The facility, which is expected to be operational in 2025, will cost approximately $5.6 billion, making it the most expensive single investment in state history, and employ approximately 5,700.

<text>Lexington is a city in Henderson County, Tennessee, United States. Lexington is midway between Memphis and Nashville, lying south of Interstate 40, which connects the two cities. The population was 7,956 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Henderson County.

==History==
Shortly after the 1821 creation of Henderson County, a site near its center was chosen as a county seat, and was named in honor of Lexington, Massachusetts, site of the first battle of the American Revolution. Land Grant holder Samuel Wilson gave the land for the town, retaining a lot on the square where his house was already situated. The square is oriented so the corners point to the cardinal points on the compass. The first county courthouse was built in 1823; Lexington was incorporated in 1824 and by 1830 had a population of 260.

As the lead-up to the Civil War began, Henderson County voted against secession. As the war progressed, both Union and Confederate regiments were recruited in the county. The area in and around Lexington was the site of a skirmish on December 18, 1862. Union Colonel Robert Ingersoll sent his troops to destroy a bridge over Beech Creek to disallow the Confederate army moving into the area. However, Ingersoll&#x27;s troops did not destroy the bridge, and General Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s troops headed into Lexington. Forrest&#x27;s troops overtook the Union soldiers, taking over 140 men, including Colonel Ingersoll, and collected artillery and supplies left behind by Union soldiers who escaped.

In 1918, an African-American man called Berry Noyse who was accused of killing the sheriff was lynched by a mob in the courthouse square and burned in the street.

<text>Paris is a city in and the county seat of Henry County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 10,316.

A replica of the Eiffel Tower stands in the southern part of Paris.

==History==
The present site of Paris was selected by five commissioners appointed to the task of choosing a county seat at the December 1822 session of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions of Henry County. Their choice was a site, of which were owned by Joseph Blythe and owned by Peter Ruff; both men donated the land to the county to have the seat there. A public square, streets, alleys, and 104 lots were laid off, and the lots were sold at auction over a two-day period in either March or April 1823.

Paris was incorporated on September 30, 1823. It was the first town incorporated in West Tennessee, followed by Lexington on October 9, 1824, and Memphis on December 19, 1826. The city was named after Paris, France, in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolutionary War.

As the county seat, Paris was a center of trade for the rural county, which was largely devoted to agriculture and particularly the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. The planters depended on a large workforce of enslaved African Americans. In 1927, a man named Joseph Upchurch was lynched in Paris.

Between about 1970 and 1990, Paris became the center of the Old Beachy Amish. Beachy Amish from different regions moved there to maintain their traditional ways. Because of internal conflicts, most Old Beachy Amish left the region in the early 1990s and had completely vacated it by 2000.

Since the American Civil War, Paris has had an African American community of around 15%. Prior to the early 1960s, young black children attended segregated schools. But beginning in the 1960s, the town of Paris worked in conjunction with Henry County to consolidate all schools, busing all children from the periphery of the county to consolidated, integrated schools in Paris. The process was largely peaceful. Also beginning in the 1960s, there was a gradual process of integration of the races in business around the town, also largely peaceful.

<text>Waverly is a city in and the county seat of Humphreys County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 4,297 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Waverly was established by Steven Pavatt as a stop along the stagecoach road between Nashville and Memphis in the early 19th century. Pavatt was a fan of the author Sir Walter Scott, and named the community after Scott&#x27;s Waverley Novels. When Humphreys County was created in 1803, Reynoldsburg, located northwest of Waverly along the Tennessee River, was chosen as the county seat. However, when county lands on the west bank of the Tennessee split off to become part of the newly created Benton County in 1835, the Humphreys County seat was moved to Waverly, which had become the more central location in the county. A courthouse was built in 1836, and the town was officially incorporated in 1838.

Like most of Middle and West Tennessee, Waverly was staunchly pro-Confederacy during the American Civil War. Humphreys County voted unanimously in favor of secession in 1861. Union troops occupied the town in 1863 to guard the railroad between White Bluff and Johnsonville (now Old Johnsonville), the latter being a Federal supply depot and transfer station. The Union troops managed to build a fort at the courthouse square, although they were constantly harassed by Confederate guerillas. On November 4, 1864, Confederate troops under Nathan Bedford Forrest attacked and destroyed the Federal depot in what became known as the Battle of Johnsonville. The battle occurred approximately west of Waverly at the mouth of Trace Creek.

Hurricane Mills, located a few miles south of Waverly along TN-13, was the site of a substantial mill and carding factory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A Mississippian-era prehistoric village (known as the Duck River Temple Mounds or Link Farm Site) and a farm owned by Jesse James were both located near the Link farm site in the vicinity of Hurricane Mills.

On February 24, 1978, a propane tank car explosion occurred in downtown Waverly after an L&amp;N train derailed. The explosion, which killed 16 people, led to an overhaul of the methods used by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency when responding to hazardous material spills. It also led to various strengthened standards and regulations (e.g., for design and construction of rail cars) by the National Transportation Safety Board.

During the morning of August 21, 2021, very heavy rainfall and totals of over caused Trace Creek to overflow in the middle of town, leading to catastrophic flooding in Waverly. Floodwaters impacted many homes and businesses, electric, telephone, and water services, churches, and Waverly Elementary School. Many structures were flooded with up to of water, with numerous homes washed completely off their foundations. All roads in and out of town were made impassable, and 20 people were killed in Humphreys County.

==Geography==
Waverly is located at (36.085847, −87.786917). The city is situated in the Trace Creek Valley, just over east of the creek&#x27;s confluence with the Kentucky Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River. The low ridges that &quot;wall in&quot; Waverly to the north and south represent the fringe of the western section of the Highland Rim.

Waverly is centered on the junction of U.S. Route 70, which connects the city to Nashville to the east and Memphis to the west, and State Route 13, which connects the city to Hurricane Mills and Interstate 40 to the south and the rural areas around Erin to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Dandridge is a town in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Tennessee. It had a population of 3,341 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Morristown, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Jefferson and Hamblen counties.

It is considered a suburb of Knoxville based on its proximity to the city, and the connection between the two via Interstate 40.

Dandridge bills itself as the &quot;second oldest town in Tennessee&quot; (behind only Jonesborough in Washington County). Most of the downtown area of Dandridge sits below the high level water mark of Douglas Lake and is protected by a levee made out of stone.

==History==
In the 16th century, a substantial Native American chiefdom known as Chiaha was located on Zimmerman&#x27;s Island, just southwest of Dandridge along the French Broad River. Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto spent several weeks at Chiaha in 1540, and Juan Pardo built a small fort near the chiefdom&#x27;s main village in 1567. Both expeditions were en route to the chiefdom of Coosa in what is now Georgia. Zimmerman&#x27;s Island is now submerged by Douglas Lake.

The first American settlers arrived in Dandridge in 1783. In 1793, the town was officially named the county seat of Jefferson County, which had been created the previous year. The town was named for Martha Dandridge Washington, the wife of the first president of the United States.

On December 24, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, a skirmish occurred at Dandridge as Confederate General James Longstreet and Union General Ambrose Burnside struggled for control of Knoxville. As Longstreet&#x27;s army retreated to Morristown, a detachment of his army intercepted and routed a pursuing Union brigade just north of Dandridge. The Union troops were forced to fall back to New Market.

The construction of Douglas Dam on the French Broad River in 1942 proposed to flood almost all of downtown Dandridge, which was situated below the proposed reservoir&#x27;s high-water mark. Residents of the town successfully petitioned then First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, pointing out that Dandridge was the only town in the United States named for the wife of George Washington. The Tennessee Valley Authority constructed a levee between downtown Dandridge and the reservoir. The levee rises almost immediately behind the Town Hall, and runs roughly parallel to Main Street.

In 1975, Interstate 40 would be completed north of Dandridge, prompting town officials to annex the corridor of I-40 at exit 412 where it shares an interchange with SR 92.

In 2015, the Town of Dandridge began efforts to revitalize its downtown area and its waterfront. These plans include a public dock across the SR 92 bridge in Dandridge on TWRA owned land, improved bicycle and pedestrian access, a floating amphitheater, civic space, a swimming area, a farmer&#x27;s market pavilion, commercial development space, and a hotel-conference center. The project is expected to be complete in the early to mid 2020s.

==Geography==
Dandridge is located south of the center of Jefferson County at (36.028493, -83.424010). The town is situated along the northern bank of the Douglas Lake impoundment of the French Broad River, approximately upstream by river from its confluence with the Holston and Tennessee rivers at Knoxville, and approximately upstream from Douglas Dam.

By highway, Dandridge is south of Jefferson City, southwest of Morristown, northwest of Newport, 18 miles northeast of Sevierville, and east of Knoxville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Dandridge has a total area of , of which are land and , or 8.21%, are water.

<text>Jefferson City (originally named Mossy Creek) is a city in Jefferson County, Tennessee, United States. It is part of the Morristown Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census the population was 8,419.

==History==
Heading southwest along the Holston River from Virginia, Adam and Elizabeth Peck arrived on the banks of Mossy Creek in 1788, soon settling the area with a fort, a house of worship, and a gristmill.
It is suggested that the original name of the city, Mossy Creek, originated due to the first settlers&#x27; description of the &#x27;vivid&#x27; green moss developed around a creek near the settlement. By 1797, Mossy Creek had around 75 to 100 families with a four-mile-radius of the city.

Around the beginnings of the American Civil War in September 1861, Union Army General Ambrose Burnside liberated the city from the Confederacy, but was attacked in an unsuccessful siege by Confederate General James Longstreet. Several skirmishes took place around Mossy Creek, most notably the Battle of Mossy Creek on December 19, 1863.

In the later 19th century, two communities formed around Mossy Creek, Frame Addition and Carsonville. In 1890, the historically segregated African American school of Nelson Merry College was founded in Mossy Creek. In 1901, Mossy Creek merged with the two communities, incorporating as Jefferson City.

In 1940, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began purchasing property in Jefferson City for the construction of Cherokee Dam and the impounding of the Holston River for Cherokee Lake. Many residents reluctantly gave up their farms and homes for the promise of flood control and electricity offered by the TVA. Construction brought many new residents to the city, and Cherokee Lake made Jefferson City a popular recreational hub for locals and tourists alike.

In the late 20th century, Jefferson City became industrialized with the zinc mining industry after geologists discovered valuable zinc ore deposits around the city earlier in the century.

Since 2010, redevelopment and revitalization efforts have been underway in the downtown district of Jefferson City. The Mossy Creek Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, was established in 2012 to advance these efforts, receiving funding a for a public park with a mock train depot pavilion on the original site of the Mossy Creek station, and facade grants for existing structures downtown.

==Geography==

<text>New Market is a town in Jefferson County, Tennessee, United States. It is part of the Morristown metropolitan area. The population was 1,334 at the 2010 census and 1,349 at the 2020 census.

==History==
On September 24, 1904, two passenger trains collided head-on near New Market, killing a large, unknown number of passengers. Different sources give different values for the number of deaths, ranging from 54 to 113.

There are many historical buildings in New Market, including the New Market Presbyterian Church which was built in 1885. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

Citing concerns of annexation by Jefferson City, New Market would reincorporate as a town in 1977.

New Market is the current home of the Highlander Research and Education Center.

===Norfolk Southern intermodal project controversy===
In 2009, Norfolk Southern Railway released plans of a proposed intermodal freight transport truck-and-train facility in New Market as a part of the Crescent Corridor project in a private-public partnership with state and Jefferson County officials. The proposed facility if completed would have generated 77 on-site jobs, 1,700 related-industry jobs in Jefferson and surrounding counties, and the potential of an annual income of dollars a year. The project received extensive NIMBY backlash from an organized group of affected property owners and farmers, citing the massive loss of land as a negative impact on Jefferson County&#x27;s agricultural industry.

The project would also have required the funding of at least dollars in off-site costs, such as transportation and utility infrastructure upgrades. Those in opposition to the project spread misinformation suggesting that Jefferson County would have pay the total amount in infrastructure upgrades for the project from tax increases. Norfolk Southern officials corrected this falsehood, saying that the company would fund the infrastructure upgrades rather than any government entity.

In 2011, Norfolk Southern acquired several parcels of land in New Market and proposals for an on-site logistics park were dropped after a developer pulled out of its deal with Norfolk Southern.

The project status has remained stagnant since 2015, as Norfolk had no plans of constructing the facility in the short-term future, but plans on having the site property as a &quot;long-term investment&quot; according to a press release by the company&#x27;s public relations director.

==Geography==

<text>Mountain City is a town in and the county seat of Johnson County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 2,415 at the 2020 census. It is the northeasternmost county seat in Tennessee. In addition, at an elevation of , it has the distinction of being the highest incorporated city in the state.

==History==

When the first European explorers arrived in what is now the Mountain City area in the late 17th century, well-worn Native American trails passed through the area. In 1949, workers at the Maymead quarry (just south of Mountain City) discovered a cave with several early Mississippian-era (ca. 1000 A.D.) burials inside. The Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673 is believed to have passed through the area, making use of the gap at Trade to the south. Explorer Daniel Boone made use of the same gap on an expedition to what is now Kentucky in 1769, and today part of the Daniel Boone Heritage Trail—which follows Boone&#x27;s route—passes through Mountain City.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the Mountain City area in the late 18th century, among them Leonard Shoun and Revolutionary War veteran Alexander Doran. The area was initially part of Carter County, but the difficulty of reaching Elizabethton (the county seat) led to the creation of Johnson County in 1836. That year, a county seat for the new county was platted on land purchased from William Vaught and named Taylorsville after Colonel James P. Taylor. The name of the town was changed to &quot;Mountain City&quot; in 1885, presumably at the urging of Roderick R. Butler, a prominent citizen and U.S. Congressman who wanted the town&#x27;s name to reflect its situation amidst one of the highest valleys in Tennessee. Butler&#x27;s mansion, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, still stands near the center of the town.

In May 1925, Mountain City was the site of a musical gathering, the first Mountain City Fiddlers Convention, that is considered a landmark event in the modern history of Appalachian music. The gathering contributed significantly to the development of country music and is commemorated every summer at the Old Time Fiddler&#x27;s Convention in nearby Laurel Bloomery.

Since 1982, Mountain City has been home to a luxury inn and country club, now known as the RedTail Mountain Resort. It is the northeasternmost gated community in Tennessee.

==Geography==

Mountain City is located at (36.468444, -81.803856). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.6 km2), all land. At just over , Mountain City is situated in one of the highest valleys in the state of Tennessee. Doe Mountain rises to the southwest, Forge Mountain rises to the east, and the Iron Mountains rise prominently to the north. The Tennessee-North Carolina border runs opposite Forge Mountain approximately east of Mountain City, and the Tennessee-Virginia border passes about to the north.

U.S. Route 421 (Shady Street) connects Mountain City with Bristol, Tennessee, to the northwest and Boone, North Carolina, to the southeast. Tennessee State Route 67 traverses the Doe Creek Valley on the north side of Doe Mountain and connects Mountain City with Carter County and the Watauga Lake areas to the west. State Route 167 follows the Roan Creek Valley on the south side of Doe Mountain, rejoining S.R. 67 at Shouns in the southern part of Mountain City. Tennessee State Route 91 connects Mountain City to Laurel Bloomery, Tennessee, and Damascus, Virginia, to the north (the road becomes Virginia State Route 91 at the state line).

<text>Knoxville is a city in and the county seat of Knox County, Tennessee, United States, on the Tennessee River. As of the 2020 United States census, Knoxville&#x27;s population was 190,740, making it the largest city in the East Tennessee Grand Division and the state&#x27;s third-most-populous city after Nashville and Memphis. It is the principal city of the Knoxville metropolitan area, which had a population of 879,773 in 2020.

First settled in 1786, Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee. The city struggled with geographic isolation throughout the early 19th century; the arrival of the railroad in 1855 led to an economic boom. The city was bitterly divided over the issue of secession during the American Civil War and was occupied alternately by Confederate and Union armies, culminating in the Battle of Fort Sanders in 1863. Following the war, Knoxville grew rapidly as a major wholesaling and manufacturing center. The city&#x27;s economy stagnated after the 1920s as the manufacturing sector collapsed, the downtown area declined and city leaders became entrenched in highly partisan political fights. Hosting the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair helped reinvigorate the city, and revitalization initiatives by city leaders and private developers have had major successes in spurring growth in the city, especially the downtown area.

Knoxville is the home of the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee, whose sports teams, the Tennessee Volunteers, are popular in the surrounding area. Knoxville is also home to the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s courthouse for East Tennessee, and the corporate headquarters of several national and regional companies. As one of the largest cities in the Appalachian region, Knoxville has positioned itself in recent years as a repository of Appalachian culture and is one of the gateways to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

==History==

===Early history===
The first people to form substantial settlements in what is now Knoxville were indigenous people who arrived during the Woodland period ( 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.). One of the oldest artificial structures in Knoxville is a burial mound constructed during the early Mississippian culture period ( 1000–1400 A.D.). The earthwork mound has been preserved, but the campus of the University of Tennessee developed around it.

Other prehistoric sites include an Early Woodland habitation area at the confluence of the Tennessee River and Knob Creek (near the Knox–Blount county line), and Dallas phase Mississippian villages at Post Oak Island (also along the river near the Knox–Blount line), and at Bussell Island (at the mouth of the Little Tennessee River near Lenoir City).

By the 18th century, the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people, had become the dominant tribe in the East Tennessee region; they are believed to have migrated centuries before from the Great Lakes region. They were frequently at war with the Creek and Shawnee. The Cherokee people called the Knoxville area &quot;kuwanda&#x27;talun&#x27;yi&quot;, which means &quot;mulberry place&quot;. Most Cherokee habitation in the area was concentrated in what the American colonists called the Overhill settlements along the Little Tennessee River, southwest of Knoxville.

The first white traders and explorers were recorded as arriving in the Tennessee Valley in the late 17th century. There is significant evidence that Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto visited Bussell Island in 1540. The first major recorded Euro-American presence in the Knoxville area was the Timberlake Expedition, which passed through the confluence of the Holston and French Broad into the Tennessee River in December 1761. Henry Timberlake, an Anglo-American emissary from the Thirteen Colonies to the Overhill settlements, recalled being pleased by the deep waters of the Tennessee after his party had struggled down the relatively shallow Holston for several weeks.

===Settlement===

The end of the French and Indian War and confusion brought about by the American Revolution led to a drastic increase in Euro-American settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. By the 1780s, white settlers were already established in the Holston and French Broad valleys. The U.S. Congress ordered all illegal settlers out of the valley in 1785 but with little success. As settlers continued to trickle into Cherokee lands, tensions between the settlers and the Cherokee rose steadily.

In 1786, James White, a Revolutionary War officer, and his friend James Connor built White&#x27;s Fort near the mouth of First Creek, on land White had purchased three years earlier. In 1790, White&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles McClung—who had arrived from Pennsylvania the previous year—surveyed White&#x27;s holdings between First Creek and Second Creek for the establishment of a town. McClung drew up sixty-four lots. The waterfront was set aside for a town common. Two lots were set aside for a church and graveyard (First Presbyterian Church, founded 1792). Four lots were set aside for a school. That school was eventually chartered as Blount College and it served as the starting point for the University of Tennessee, which uses Blount College&#x27;s founding date of 1794 as its own.

In 1790, President George Washington appointed North Carolina surveyor William Blount governor of the newly created Territory South of the River Ohio. One of Blount&#x27;s first tasks was to meet with the Cherokee and establish territorial boundaries and resolve the issue of illegal settlers. This he accomplished almost immediately with the Treaty of Holston, which was negotiated and signed at White&#x27;s Fort in 1791. Blount originally wanted to place the territorial capital at the confluence of the Clinch River and Tennessee River (now Kingston), but when the Cherokee refused to cede this land, Blount chose White&#x27;s Fort. Blount named the new capital Knoxville after Revolutionary War General and Secretary of War Henry Knox, who at the time was Blount&#x27;s immediate superior.

Problems immediately arose from the Holston Treaty. Blount believed that he had &quot;purchased&quot; much of what is now East Tennessee when the treaty was signed in 1791. However, the terms of the treaty came under dispute, culminating in ongoing violence on both sides. When the government invited Cherokee chief Hanging Maw for negotiations in 1793, Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee against orders, killing the chief&#x27;s wife. Peace was renegotiated in 1794.

===Antebellum era===
Knoxville served as capital of the Southwest Territory and as capital of Tennessee (admitted as a state in 1796) until 1817, when the capital was moved to Murfreesboro. Early Knoxville has been described as an &quot;alternately quiet and rowdy river town&quot;. Early issues of the &quot;Knoxville Gazette&quot;—the first newspaper published in Tennessee—are filled with accounts of murder, theft, and hostile Cherokee attacks. Abishai Thomas, a friend of William Blount, visited Knoxville in 1794 and wrote that, while he was impressed by the town&#x27;s modern frame buildings, the town had &quot;seven taverns&quot; and no church.

Knoxville initially thrived as a way station for travelers and migrants heading west. Its location at the confluence of three major rivers in the Tennessee Valley brought flatboat and later steamboat traffic to its waterfront in the first half of the 19th century, and Knoxville quickly developed into a regional merchandising center. Local agricultural products—especially tobacco, corn, and whiskey—were traded for cotton, which was grown in the Deep South. The population of Knoxville more than doubled in the 1850s with the arrival of the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in 1855.

Among the most prominent citizens of Knoxville during the Antebellum years was James White&#x27;s son, Hugh Lawson White (1773–1840). White first served as a judge and state senator, before being nominated by the state legislature to replace Andrew Jackson in the U.S. Senate in 1825. In 1836, White ran unsuccessfully for president, representing the Whig Party.

===American Civil War===


Anti-slavery and anti-secession sentiment ran high in East Tennessee in the years leading up to the Civil War. William &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow, the radical publisher of the Knoxville Whig, was one of the region&#x27;s leading anti-secessionists (although he strongly defended the practice of slavery). Blount County, just south of Knoxville, had developed into a center of abolitionist activity, due in part to its relatively large Quaker faction and the anti-slavery president of Maryville College, Isaac Anderson. The Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church was reportedly a station on the Underground Railroad.

Business interests, however, guided largely by Knoxville&#x27;s trade connections with cotton-growing centers to the south, contributed to the development of a strong pro-secession movement within the city. The city&#x27;s pro-secessionists included among their ranks J. G. M. Ramsey, a prominent historian whose father had built the Ramsey House in 1797.

Thus, while East Tennessee and greater Knox County voted decisively against secession in 1861, the city of Knoxville favored secession by a 2–1 margin. In late May 1861, just before the secession vote, delegates of the East Tennessee Convention met at Temperance Hall in Knoxville in hopes of keeping Tennessee in the Union. After Tennessee voted to secede in June, the convention met in Greeneville and attempted to create a separate Union-aligned state in East Tennessee.

In July 1861, after Tennessee had joined the Confederacy, General Felix Zollicoffer arrived in Knoxville as commander of the District of East Tennessee. While initially lenient toward the city&#x27;s Union sympathizers, Zollicoffer instituted martial law in November, after pro-Union guerrillas burned seven of the city&#x27;s bridges. The command of the district passed briefly to George Crittenden and then to Kirby Smith, who launched an unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky in August 1862. In early 1863, General Simon Buckner took command of Confederate forces in Knoxville. Anticipating a Union invasion, Buckner fortified Fort Loudon (in West Knoxville, not to be confused with the colonial fort to the southwest) and began constructing earthworks throughout the city. However, the approach of stronger Union forces under Ambrose Burnside in the summer of 1863 forced Buckner to evacuate Knoxville before the earthworks were completed.

Burnside arrived in early September 1863, beginning the Knoxville campaign. Like the Confederates, he immediately began fortifying the city. The Union forces rebuilt Fort Loudon and erected 12 other forts and batteries flanked by entrenchments around the city. Burnside moved a pontoon bridge upstream from Loudon, allowing Union forces to cross the river and to build a series of forts along the heights of south Knoxville, including Fort Stanley and Fort Dickerson.

As Burnside was fortifying Knoxville, a Confederate army under Braxton Bragg defeated Union forces under William Rosecrans at the Battle of Chickamauga (near the Tennessee-Georgia line) and laid siege to Chattanooga. On November 3, 1863, the Confederates sent General James Longstreet to attack Burnside at Knoxville and prevent him from reinforcing the Union at Chattanooga. Longstreet wanted to attack the city from the south, but lacking the necessary pontoon bridges he was forced to cross the river further downstream at Loudon on November 14 and march against the city&#x27;s heavily fortified western section. On November 15, General Joseph Wheeler unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge Union forces in the heights of south Knoxville, and the following day Longstreet failed to cut off retreating Union forces at the Battle of Campbell&#x27;s Station (now Farragut).

On November 18, Union General William P. Sanders was mortally wounded while conducting delaying maneuvers west of Knoxville, and Fort Loudon was renamed Fort Sanders in his honor. On November 29, following a two-week siege, the Confederates attacked Fort Sanders but failed after a fierce 20-minute engagement. On December 4, after word of the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga reached Longstreet, he broke his siege of Knoxville. The Union victories in the Knoxville campaign and at Chattanooga put much of East Tennessee under Union control for the rest of the war.

===Reconstruction and the Industrial Age===
After the war, northern investors such as brothers Joseph and David Richards helped Knoxville recover relatively quickly. The Richards brothers convinced 104 Welsh immigrant families to migrate from the Welsh Tract in Pennsylvania to work in a rolling mill. These Welsh families settled in an area now known as Mechanicsville. The Richards brothers also co-founded the Knoxville Iron Works beside the L&amp;N Railroad, also employing Welsh workers. Later, the site was used as the grounds for the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair.

Other companies that sprang up during this period were Knoxville Woolen Mills, Dixie Cement, and Woodruff&#x27;s Furniture. Between 1880 and 1887, 97 factories were established in Knoxville, most of them specializing in textiles, food products, and iron products. By the 1890s, Knoxville was home to more than 50 wholesaling houses, making it the third largest wholesaling center by volume in the South. The Candoro Marble Works, established in the community of Vestal in 1914, became the nation&#x27;s foremost producer of pink marble and one of the nation&#x27;s largest marble importers. In 1896, Knoxville celebrated its achievements by creating its own flag. The Flag of Knoxville, Tennessee represents the city&#x27;s progressive growth due to agriculture and industry.

In 1869, Thomas Humes, a Union sympathizer and president of East Tennessee University, secured federal post-war damage reimbursement and state-designated Morrill Act funding to expand the college, which had been occupied by both armies during the war. Charles Dabney, who became president of the university in 1887, overhauled the faculty and established a law school in an attempt to modernize the scope of the university. In 1879, the state changed its name to the University of Tennessee, at the request of the trustees, who hoped to secure more funding from the Tennessee state legislature.

The post-war manufacturing boom brought thousands of immigrants to the city. The population of Knoxville grew from around 5,000 in 1860 to 32,637 in 1900. West Knoxville was annexed in 1897, and over 5,000 new homes were built between 1895 and 1904. In 1901, train robber Kid Curry (whose real name was Harvey Logan), a member of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch was captured after shooting two deputies on Knoxville&#x27;s Central Avenue. He escaped from the Knoxville jail and rode away on a horse stolen from the sheriff.

===Progressive Era and the Great Depression===
Knoxville hosted the Appalachian Exposition in 1910 and 1911 and the National Conservation Exposition in 1913. The latter is sometimes credited with giving rise to the movement to create a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains, some south of Knoxville. Around this time, several affluent Knoxvillians began purchasing summer cottages in Elkmont and began to pursue the park idea more vigorously. They were led by Knoxville businessman Colonel David C. Chapman, who, as head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, was largely responsible for raising the funds for the purchase of the property that became the core of the park. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened in 1933.

Knoxville&#x27;s reliance on a manufacturing economy left it particularly vulnerable to the effects of the Great Depression. The Tennessee Valley also suffered from frequent flooding, and millions of acres of farmland had been ruined by soil erosion. To control flooding and improve the economy in the Tennessee Valley, the federal government created the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933. Beginning with Norris Dam, TVA constructed a series of hydroelectric dams and other power plants throughout the valley over the next few decades, bringing flood control, jobs, and electricity to the region. The Federal Works Projects Administration, which also arrived in the 1930s, helped build McGhee Tyson Airport and expand Neyland Stadium. TVA&#x27;s headquarters, which consists of twin high rises built in the 1970s, were among Knoxville&#x27;s first modern high-rise buildings.

In 1947, John Gunther dubbed Knoxville the &quot;ugliest city&quot; in America in his best-selling book &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot; Gunther&#x27;s description jolted the city into enacting a series of beautification measures that helped improve the appearance of the downtown area.

===1982 World&#x27;s Fair and 20th century===

Knoxville&#x27;s textile and manufacturing industries largely fell victim to foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s, and after the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville&#x27;s industrial growth—began to decline. The rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s drew retail revenues away from Knoxville&#x27;s downtown area. While government jobs and economic diversification prevented widespread unemployment in Knoxville, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by attempting to annex neighboring communities. Knoxville annexed the communities of Bearden and Fountain City, which were Knoxville&#x27;s largest suburbs, in 1962. Knoxville officials attempted the annexation of the neighboring Farragut-Concord community in western Knox County, but the city failed following the incorporation of Farragut in 1980. These annexation attempts often turned combative, and several attempts to consolidate Knoxville and Knox County into a metro government failed, while school boards and the planning commissions would merge on July 1, 1987.

With further annexation attempts stalling, Knoxville initiated several projects aimed at boosting revenue in its downtown area. The 1982 World&#x27;s Fair—the most successful of these projects, with eleven million visitors—became one of the most popular expositions in U.S. history. The Rubik&#x27;s Cube made its debut at this event. The fair&#x27;s energy theme was selected because Knoxville was home to TVA&#x27;s headquarters and for its proximity to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Sunsphere, a steel truss structure topped with a gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of Knoxville&#x27;s most prominent structures, along with the adjacent Tennessee Amphitheater.

During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the city would see one of its largest expansions of its city limits, with a reported 26 square miles of &quot;shoestring annexation&quot; under the administration of Mayor Victor Ashe. Ashe&#x27;s efforts were controversial, largely consisting of annexation of interstate right-of-ways, highway-oriented commercial clusters, and residential subdivisions to increase tax revenue for the city. Residents voiced opposition, citing claims of urban sprawl and government overreach.

===21st century and economic renaissance===

Knoxville&#x27;s downtown has been developing, with the opening of the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention Center, the redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a regional history museum, a Regal Cinemas theater, several restaurants and bars, and many new and redeveloped condominiums. Since 2000, Knoxville has successfully brought business back to the downtown area. The arts in particular have begun to flourish; there are multiple venues for outdoor concerts, and Gay Street hosts a new arts annex and gallery surrounded by many studios and new businesses as well. The Bijou and Tennessee Theatres underwent renovation, providing an initiative for the city and its developers to re-purpose the old downtown.

Development has also expanded across the Tennessee River on the South Knoxville waterfront. In 2006, the city adopted the South Waterfront Vision Plan, a long-term improvement project to revitalize the 750-acre waterfront fronting three miles of shoreline on the Tennessee River. The project&#x27;s primary focus is the commercial and residential development over a 20-year timeline. Knoxville Baptist Hospital, located on the waterfront, was demolished in 2016 to make room for a mixed-use project called One Riverwalk. The development consisted of three office buildings, including a headquarters for Regal Entertainment Group, a hotel, student housing, and 300 multi-family residential units.

In June 2020, the Knoxville City Council announced the investment of over $5.5million in federal and local funds towards the development of a business park along the Interstate 275 corridor in North Knoxville. The project was first proposed by a study prepared Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission in 2007. In August 2020, UT President and Tennessee Smokies owner Randy Boyd announced plans of a mixed-use baseball stadium complex in the Old City neighborhood.

KUB purchases its electricity from the Tennessee Valley Authority.

===Transportation===
====Highways====
The two principal interstate highways serving Knoxville are Interstate 40, which connects the city to Asheville (directly) and Bristol (via I-81) to the east and Nashville to the west, and Interstate 75, which connects the city to Chattanooga to the south and Lexington to the north. The two interstates merge about west of Downtown Knoxville near Dixie Lee Junction and diverge as they approach the Downtown area, with I-40 continuing on through the Downtown area and I-75 turning north. Interstate 640 provides a bypass for I-40 travelers, and Interstate 275 provides a faster connection to I-75 for Downtown travelers headed north. A spur route of I-40, Interstate 140 (Pellissippi Parkway), connects West Knoxville with McGhee Tyson Airport and Maryville.

Prior to its reconstruction for the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair tourism traffic, the interchange of I-75 (now I-275) and I-40 was known as &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;, because its consistent state of traffic jammed throughout daily.

Knoxville&#x27;s busiest road is a stretch of U.S. Route 129 known as Alcoa Highway, which connects the Downtown area with McGhee Tyson Airport and Maryville. A merged stretch of US-70 and US-11 enters the city from the east along Magnolia Avenue, winds its way through the Downtown area, crosses the U.T. campus along Cumberland Avenue (&quot;The Strip&quot;), and proceeds through West Knoxville along Kingston Pike. US-11 splits into US-11E and 11W in Downtown, with the former connecting Knoxville to Jefferson City and Morristown, and the latter with Rutledge and Bean Station. US-441, which connects Knoxville to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, passes along Broadway in North Knoxville, Henley Street in the Downtown area, and Chapman Highway in South Knoxville. US-25W, which enters from the east concurrent with US-70, connects Knoxville with Clinton.

State Route 158 (SR 158) loops around the Downtown area from Kingston Pike just west of UT&#x27;s campus, southward and eastward along Neyland Drive and the riverfront, and northward along the James White Parkway before terminating at I-40. SR 62 (Western Avenue, Oak Ridge Highway), connects Downtown Knoxville with Oak Ridge to the west. SR 168, known as Governor John Sevier Highway, runs along the eastern and southern periphery of the city. SR 162 (Pellissippi Parkway) connects West Knoxville with Oak Ridge. SR 331 (Tazewell Pike) connects the Fountain City area to rural northeast Knox County. SR 332 (Northshore Drive) connects West Knoxville and Concord. SR 33 (Maryville Pike, Maynardville Pike) traverses much of South Knoxville southward, and connects to the suburbs of Halls Crossroads and Maynardville northward.

Four vehicle bridges connect Downtown Knoxville with South Knoxville, namely the South Knoxville Bridge (James White Parkway), the Gay Street Bridge (Gay Street), the Henley Street Bridge, or Henley Bridge (Henley Street), and the J. E. &quot;Buck&quot; Karnes Bridge (Alcoa Highway). Two railroad bridges, located between the Henley Street Bridge and Buck Karnes Bridge, serve the CSX and Northfolk Southern railroads. Smaller bridges radiating out from the downtown area include the Western Avenue Viaduct and Clinch Avenue Viaduct, the Robert Booker Bridge (Summit Hill Drive), the Hill Avenue Viaduct, and the Gay Street Viaduct.

====Mass transit====
Public transportation is provided by Knoxville Area Transit (KAT), which operates over 80 buses, road trolleys, and paratransit vehicles, and transports more than 3.6million passengers per year. Regular routes connect the Downtown area, U.T., and most residential areas with major shopping centers throughout the city. KAT operates using city, state, and federal funds, and passenger fares, and is managed by Veolia Transport.

====Airports====
Knoxville and the surrounding area is served by McGhee Tyson Airport (IATA:TYS), a airport equipped with two runways, one a runway, and the other a runway. The airport is located 10 miles south of Knoxville in Alcoa, but is owned by the non-profit Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority (MKAA). McGhee Tyson offers eight major airlines serving 19 non-stop destinations, and averages 120 arrivals and departures per day. The airport includes the Air Cargo Complex, which serves FedEx, UPS, and Airborne Express. The McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base, located adjacent to the civilian airport, is home to the Tennessee National Guard&#x27;s 134th Air Refueling Wing.

The MKAA also owns the Downtown Island Airport, a general aviation facility located on Dickinson&#x27;s Island in southeast Knoxville. This airport is equipped with a runway, and averages about 225 operations per day. Over 100 aircraft, mostly single-engine planes, are based at the airport.

====Railroads====

Rail freight in Knoxville is handled by two Class I railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, and one shortline, the Knoxville and Holston River Railroad. Railroads account for about 12% of the Knoxville area&#x27;s outbound freight and 16% of the area&#x27;s inbound freight. The city has two major rail terminals: the Burkhart Enterprises terminal at the Forks of the River Industrial Park just east of the city, and the TransFlo facility adjacent to the U.T. campus. Knoxville&#x27;s two old passenger stations, the Southern Terminal and the L&amp;N Station, now serve non-railroad functions.

Norfolk Southern, which controls about of tracks in the Knoxville area, averages 35 freight trains through the city per day, and operates a major classification yard, the John Sevier Yard, just east of the city. The company uses a small rail yard near the I-40/I-275 interchange in Downtown Knoxville for a staging area. The Norfolk Southern system includes spur lines to the coal fields around Middlesboro, Kentucky, and the ALCOA plants in Blount County.

CSX controls about of tracks in the Knoxville area, much of which is located along an important north–south line between Cincinnati and Louisville to the north and Chattanooga and Atlanta to the south. Minor switching operations for CSX occur at the TransFlo facility near the U.T. campus. The CSX system includes spur lines to TVA&#x27;s Bull Run Fossil Plant and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Anderson County, and the ALCOA plants in Blount County.

The Knoxville and Holston River Railroad (KXHR) is a subsidiary of Gulf and Ohio Railways, a shortline holding company headquartered at the James Park House in Downtown Knoxville. The KXHR operates a line between the Burkhart terminal at Forks of the River and the Coster Yard in North Knoxville, where the freight is transferred to CSX and Norfolk Southern lines or transloaded onto trucks. The KXHR also manages the Knoxville Locomotive Works at the Coster Yard, and operates the &quot;Three Rivers Rambler&quot;, a tourist train that runs along the riverfront.

=====Historic passenger service=====
Until the mid-20th century three railroads and their stations operated regular trains, serving points north, east, south and west: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad&#x27;s L&amp;N Station (last train operating there, 1968), the Smoky Mountain Railroad&#x27;s station and the Southern Railway&#x27;s Southern Terminal (last train operating there, 1970).

====River transport====
Knoxville is an international port connected via navigable channels to the nation&#x27;s inland waterways and the Gulf of Mexico. The city&#x27;s waterfront lies just under 700 river miles from the Mississippi River (via the Tennessee and Ohio rivers), and just under 900 river miles from Mobile, Alabama, on the Gulf of Mexico (via the Tennessee River and Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway). TVA maintains a minimum channel on the entirety of the Tennessee River. The minimum size of locks on Tennessee River and Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway dams is by .

Most commercial shipping on the Tennessee River is provided by barges, which deliver on average half a million tons of cargo to Knoxville per year, mostly asphalt, road salt, and steel and coke. Burkhart Enterprises operates the city&#x27;s most active public barge terminal at its Forks of the River facility, handling approximately 350,000 tons of barge cargo per year. Knoxville Barge and Chattanooga-based Serodino, Inc., provide barge shipping services to and from the city.

Recreational craft that frequent the river include small johnboats, fishing boats and yachts. Boat slips and a marina are located at Volunteer Landing in the Downtown area. The VOL Navy, a flotilla of several dozen boats, swarms the river during weeks when the U.T. football team plays at Neyland Stadium. Cruise lines operating in the city include the &quot;Volunteer Princess&quot;, a luxury yacht, and the &quot;Star of Knoxville&quot;, a paddlewheel riverboat.

==In popular culture==
Knoxville has appeared in music, literature and television. Film director Quentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville, and the city and East Tennessee are frequently mentioned in his films, such as in the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, in which Bruce Willis&#x27; character (and the watch given to him by Christopher Walken&#x27;s character) is from Knoxville.

In literature, author Cormac McCarthy is from Knoxville, and several of his books feature the city, such as &quot;Suttree&quot;, a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel. James Agee also lived in the city, and his 1957 posthumous autobiographical novel &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; provides a portrait of life in Knoxville, while also wrestling with the death of Agee&#x27;s father in a car accident, and the impact this had on his family.

Mark Twain wrote about a gunfight in downtown Knoxville involving Joseph Mabry Jr., owner of the city&#x27;s antebellum Mabry-Hazen House in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; from 1883. Several other books take place in fictionalized versions of the city, such as the 1915 Anne W. Armstrong novel, &quot;The Seas of God&quot;, and David Madden&#x27;s 1974 novel, &quot;Bijou&quot;, is set in a fictional city known as &quot;Cherokee&quot;, based on Knoxville.

The first part of James Herman Robinson&#x27;s 1950 autobiography, &quot;The Road Without Turning&quot;, takes place in Knoxville, and &quot;The Man in the Overstuffed Chair&quot;, a 1985 short story by playwright Tennessee Williams, gives a brief description of the death of Williams&#x27; father, Cornelius, at a Knoxville hospital, and his subsequent burial at Old Gray Cemetery.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Peter Taylor&#x27;s last novel in 1994, &quot;In the Tennessee Country&quot;, refers to a &quot;Knoxville cemetery&quot; where the main character&#x27;s grandfather (a fictitious politician) is buried. This may refer to Old Gray Cemetery, where Taylor&#x27;s own grandfather, Governor Robert Love Taylor, was originally buried in 1912.

Swiss travel writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach visited Knoxville in the 1930s, and wrote an essay about the city, &quot;Auf der Schattenseite von Knoxville&quot;, which was published in the December 1937 edition of the Swiss magazine, &quot;National Zeitung&quot;.

A number of songs and music compositions are about or feature Knoxville as well. &quot;The Knoxville Girl&quot;, first recorded in 1924, is traditional Appalachian ballad. Classical composer Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;&quot; from 1947 is a voice &amp; orchestra piece based on 1938 short prose by James Agee. Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler recorded a song entitled &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gone to Knoxville&quot; on his 2002 solo album, &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot; by Robert Mitchum references Knoxville&#x27;s Bearden community, and other musicians such as Steve Earle, Ronnie Milsap, and Hank Williams, Jr. have mentioned the city in lyrics. Hank Williams, Hank Jr.&#x27;s father, spent his last day alive in Knoxville as well. Country singer Kenny Chesney is from Knoxville.

A number of early country music songs were recorded in Knoxville as the &quot;St. James Sessions&quot; in 1930, such as &quot;Satan is Busy In Knoxville&quot; by Leola Manning.

<text>Mascot is a census-designated place (CDP) in Knox County, Tennessee. The population was 2,760 at the 2020 census, up from 2,411 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Mascot community was first reported to be established around 1796, when settler John Erwin purchased 150 acres of land by the United States government, but the expansion of the community would not occur until the 19th and 20th centuries.

Early 19th century settlement in the Mascot area may have centered on a ford across the Holston River which was known as Saylor&#x27;s Ford. In 1838, Dr. George Arnold, a physician and planter, constructed a Georgian-style house known as &quot;Chesterfield&quot; along Old Rutledge Pike in what is now northern Mascot. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1884 a railroad line was constructed through the area and a post office was established under the name &quot;Meek,&quot; apparently the surname of a local family. Knoxville&#x27;s Daily Sentinel listed Mascot as the name of the new railroad station between McMillians and Strawberry Plains, near the resort Lea Springs in 1887.

The Mascot community was formed in the early 20th century as a company town centered on the mine. The Holston Zinc Company established a mine locally in 1906, but some mining may have occurred earlier. The &quot;Mascot&quot; name is recorded from as early as 1904. Reports suggest the name came from an acronym for the Mining and Smelting Company of Tennessee, which once operated the mines in Mascot.

Tiptonville was the scene of the surrender of Confederate forces at the end of the 
1862 Battle of Island Number Ten in the American Civil War. The monument for this battle is located on State Route 22 approximately three miles north of Tiptonville, since the island itself, the focal point of the battle, has been eroded by the flow of the Mississippi River and no longer exists.

=== Early 1900&#x27;s ===
On March 19, 1901, Tiptonville was destroyed by a fire three days after a mob of white townsmen had lynched Ike Fitzgerald, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Whites speculated that the blaze, which burned 30 buildings and residences, including all of the stores on the main street, had been deliberately set by African Americans in reprisal for Fitzgerald&#x27;s lynching.

In 1904, the Dyersburg Northern Railroad was chartered. This line connected Dyersburg to Hickman, KY, via Tiptonville, and began operating in 1910. The company changed their name to the Chicago, Memphis, &amp; Gulf Railroad in 1909.

<text>Henning is a town in Lauderdale County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 945 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Founded in the late 1800s, the town is named after prominent businessman and railway official William H. Henning. The infamous Battle of Fort Pillow, a Civil War victory for the Confederates, took place near Henning. Here, nearly 300 black troops serving in the Union Army were massacred after surrendering by Confederates under the command of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The Confederate refusal to treat these troops as traditional prisoners of war infuriated the North, and led to the Union’s refusal to participate in prisoner exchanges. Union survivors’ accounts, later supported by a federal investigation, concluded that African-American troops were massacred by Forrest’s men after surrendering.

In 1900, a local black man, Anderson Gause, was lynched by a mob.

<doc id="135264" wikidata="Q2069460" url="?curid=135264" title="Ethridge, Tennessee">
<text>Ethridge is a town in Lawrence County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 465 at the 2010 census, down from 536 at the 2000 census.

==History==

Ethridge began as a railroad stop known as Hudson Springs, which stood a few miles south of the present site of the town, in the 1880s. A political booster and store owner at the stop successfully petitioned the railroad to name the stop in honor of Emerson Etheridge, a prominent mid-19th century politician and post-Civil War candidate for governor. The current site of Ethridge, meanwhile, was located at the intersection of two mid-19th century cattle drovers&#x27; roads. When the railroad constructed a station at this site in the late 1890s, it was named Wayne Station. After constant confusion resulted in passengers bound for Wayne Station winding up at Ethridge, a prominent real estate broker in the area convinced the railroad to close the Ethridge stop and rename the Wayne Station stop &quot;Ethridge.&quot;

By 1914, Ethridge&#x27;s population had grown to 400, and the town was thriving as a lumber transloading station. At that time, Ethridge contained at least four lumber mills and one lumber finishing mill. Lumber from these mills and mills further out in the countryside was hauled to Ethridge and loaded onto trains. During this period, Ethridge had five grocery stores, a meat market, two barber shops, a post office, a hotel, and a tire pump factory. The town declined, however, following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the gradual supplanting of rail traffic by vehicle traffic in later years. Ethridge was incorporated in 1973, and is known for its concentration of Swartzentruber Amish.

==Geography==
Ethridge is located at (35.321229, -87.302304). The town is situated at the intersection of U.S. Route 43 and a county road, Red Hill Road (signed as Main Street in Ethridge).

<text>The city of Lawrenceburg is the county seat of Lawrence County, Tennessee, United States, The largest city on the state&#x27;s southern border between Chattanooga and Memphis, it lies on the banks of Shoal Creek. The population was 11,633 at the 2020 United States Census. The city is named after War of 1812 American Navy officer James Lawrence.

Located around southwest of Nashville at the junction of U.S. Routes 43 and 64, Lawrenceburg is called the &quot;Crossroads of Dixie.&quot;

==History==
According to a recent theory, the Lawrenceburg area is the likely site of &quot;Chicasa&quot;—the place where Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and his men wintered in 1540–41 (though earlier theories have suggested this campsite to have been in northern Mississippi). The Chickasaw Nation sold the area to the US in 1816.

Upon moving from East Tennessee into the region around 1817, David Crockett served as a justice of the peace, a colonel of the militia, and a state representative. David Crockett established a powder mill on Shoal Creek originally called the Sycamore River. This area is now home to David Crockett State Park. Crockett was elected as a commissioner and served on the board that placed Lawrenceburg west of the geographic center of Lawrence County. Crockett was opposed to the city being located in its current location, largely out of fear of flooding. He and his family lived in Lawrenceburg for several years before moving to West Tennessee after a flood destroyed his mill.

After World War II, the Murray Ohio Manufacturing Company, a U.S. producer of bicycles and outdoor equipment, moved its manufacturing operations to Lawrenceburg, building a new factory and assembly plant. Over the next several decades, the Murray factory grew to be one of the largest in the United States: under roof.

A flood struck Lawrenceburg in July 1998, killing two people on Shoal Creek.

Following the flood, the city undertook a 10-year flood control project that dramatically reduced risk for major flooding that had plagued the town since the days of Davy Crockett.

==Geography==

<doc id="135266" wikidata="Q2101328" url="?curid=135266" title="Loretto, Tennessee">
<text>Loretto is a city in Lawrence County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,714 at the 2010 census, and 1,739 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Loretto began as a stagecoach station known as &quot;Glen Rock&quot; in the early 19th century. In 1870, a number of German Catholic immigrants settled in the Loretto area, and a new city was established shortly afterward. Some sources suggest the name &quot;Loretto&quot; was inspired by the Loreto region in Italy, while others say the city was named for a sainted nun. The congregation the immigrants formed, the Sacred Heart Church of Jesus, still exists, and their church (built in 1912) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With the arrival of the railroad in the 1880s, Loretto thrived as a lumber town.

Other historic buildings include the Bank of Loretto building, which was built in the 1920s. The Bank of Loretto building was renovated in 2013. Next door to the old Loretto bank building was Weathers Store and Myers Store. They sold general merchandise to generations of families. Steps down the street lies the Loretto Milling Company, established in 1895 and still open for business, making it one of the oldest family-run businesses in the city. Other businesses located in this district included a doctor&#x27;s office, cobbler&#x27;s shop, cafes, hotels, and a funeral home. There was also a stage coach stop, and then later on a bus depot. The historic downtown area began to decline following the construction of U.S. Route 43 to the east of the district in the 1940s, when its commercial activity shifted to the new highway. Like many Southern towns, Loretto is applying for grants to help revive the older historic district.

Loretto is the home of the Loretto High School Mustangs.

<text>Hohenwald is a city in and the county seat of Lewis County, Tennessee. The population was 3,757 at the 2010 census. The name &quot;Hohenwald&quot; derives from German meaning “High Forest&quot;.

Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, died and was buried seven miles east of the town at Grinder&#x27;s Stand in 1809. Rod Brasfield, an old Grand Ole Opry comedy star, made his home in Hohenwald and referred to it in his routines.

The town was founded in 1878 and later merged with a town named &quot;New Switzerland&quot; to the south. New Switzerland was founded in 1894 by Swiss immigrants in conjunction with the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. The railway&#x27;s extension to Hohenwald served as a catalyst for the towns early economic growth. This rail link enabled the export of timber and agricultural products, key to the local economy, transforming Hohenwald into an important commercial center in Lewis County. This significantly influenced Hohenwald&#x27;s demographic expansion and urban development, illustrating the profound impact of rail infrastructure on the growth of small American towns during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Landmarks==

===Old Stone Bridge===
One of the most famous landmarks of Fayetteville is the remains of the Stone Bridge, commonly known by the locals of Fayetteville as the “Old Stone Bridge”. It was in 1860 that John Markum and Patrick Flannery, the architects and contractors, began the building of the bridge. Consisting of six arches, the bridge was completed in January 1862 with a final cost of $40,000. In 1863, during the Civil War, the bridge was ordered burned by General William T. Sherman, but this order was disobeyed because the river was easily forded at the bridge&#x27;s base. The bridge stood until 1969, when it collapsed due to flooding.

===Lincoln County Courthouse===
The first courthouse for Lincoln County, which was made of logs, was completed in 1815. It was used as local headquarters by Union troops during the Civil War. The building was replaced by an Italianate structure in 1874. This second courthouse was demolished and replaced by the current Colonial Revival-style building in 1970.

===Camp Blount Monument===
The Camp Blount marker, erected in 1998, stands along Huntsville Highway (US-431) near the WalMart shopping center. The camp was located along the Elk River and was a meeting point for the Tennessee soldiers who were serving under General Andrew Jackson in the Creek War of 1813–1814. Camp Blount also was a meeting point for soldiers during the Seminole Wars in 1818 and 1836, and for both Confederate and Federal troops during the Civil War.

==Attractions==

===Lincoln County Fair===
The Lincoln County Fair grounds are located in Fayetteville Tennessee. The Lincoln County Fair Association was issued its charter in 1906 and is a nonprofit organization with all profits going back into maintaining the fair grounds. In 1980, the fair became a district fair, serving five counties and paying over $10,000 in agriculture premiums.

As far back as 1889, there are records for the harness racing that takes place still today at the fairgrounds. The racetrack was made of red clay until 1978 when it was converted to an all weather track by grading it and covering it in limestone dust. Other elements of the fair include a demolition derby, rides, food vendors, a cattle showing, pageants, art competition, and concerts.

<doc id="135270" wikidata="Q2064169" url="?curid=135270" title="Greenback, Tennessee">
<text>Greenback is a city in Loudon County, Tennessee, United States. Its population was at 1,102, according to the 2020 census. It is included in the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Early history===
Located near modern-day Greenback, Morganton Ferry (initially called Wear&#x27;s Ferry) was an important crossing of the Little Tennessee. It was established in the late 18th century, and had grown into a small community known as &quot;Portville&quot; by 1810. The community was chartered as &quot;Morganton&quot; after local merchant Gideon Morgan in 1813. Around this time, the Tellico agent relocated to Fort Southwest Point (now Kingston), and a road quickly developed between this fort and Maryville. Since the road crossed the Little Tennessee at the Morganton Ferry, the road became known locally as Morganton Road.

In the years leading up to the Civil War, a cave in the Morganton and Greenback area is believed to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad, perhaps reflecting the area&#x27;s ties to abolitionist-heavy Blount County. The William H. Griffitts House, located just outside Greenback, was also a stop on the Underground Railroad.

In 1859, entrepreneur Jesse Kerr established a hotel and health resort at the mineral-rich Sulphur Springs near the base of Chilhowee Mountain several miles southeast of Morganton (the resort was located near the modern junction of US-129 and TN-336). The resort was connected to Morganton Road by a stagecoach road which roughly paralleled what is now Highway 95. This resort was purchased by Indiana businessman Nathan McCoy in 1885, and a new 3-story, 60-room hotel was completed the following year. The resort was renamed &quot;Allegheny Springs.&quot;

===Founding and later history===

In 1876, Lorenzo Thompson established Thompson&#x27;s Stand, a general store located a few miles east of modern Greenback. In 1882, Thompson applied for federal post office. He initially hoped to use the name &quot;Thompson&#x27;s Station,&quot; but the name was already in use. After several other names were rejected, Thompson settled on &quot;Greenback,&quot; a name inspired by the local Greenback Party politician, Jonathan Tipton.

In the late 1880s, the Knoxville Southern Railroad (not to be confused with the larger Southern Railway) began building a rail line connecting Knoxville with Blue Ridge, Georgia. Developers bought up the land surrounding this railroad&#x27;s intersection with Morganton Road with plans to develop a town, initially known as &quot;Allegheny&quot; after the resort hotel to the south. Lots were sold, and a depot was constructed in 1891. Thompson moved his post office, still known as &quot;Greenback,&quot; to the Swanay Brothers Store in the new town. The name &quot;Greenback&quot; gradually came to be favored over &quot;Allegheny,&quot; and the railroad changed the name of the station to &quot;Greenback&quot; in 1897.

By the late 1890s, Greenback had three stores, a barbershop, blacksmith shop, school, livery stables, a hotel, and two baseball teams (segregated between white and black players). The Knoxville Southern was purchased by the Marietta and North Georgia Railroad, which was in turn purchased by the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad in 1895. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N), which was building a rail line between Cincinnati and Atlanta, purchased the Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern in 1902. The L&amp;N&#x27;s Greenback Depot, completed in 1914, still stands in Greenback, and has since been remodeled by Ron Edmondson as a community events center. The Greenback Drug Company, opened in 1923, still stands and has served as a community restaurant and diner for the past few decades. Locals still call it &quot;the drugstore&quot; and meet there for food and community.

Prior to the Great Depression, thirty-four commercial buildings were constructed in Greenback. Over half of these, however, were destroyed in a series of six major fires during this period. Though the community&#x27;s growth slowed, Greenback was officially incorporated in 1957, with Glenn McTeer as its first mayor. A community center— built by the town&#x27;s residents with no outside help or outside funding— was completed in 1978. It now houses a library, the city hall, and recreational facilities.

On September 22, 1964, one of the first confrontations between the Tennessee Valley Authority and conservation groups over the proposed Tellico Dam project took place in a meeting at Greenback High School. TVA had called the meeting in hopes of gaining the support of locals, and the agency was surprised when most of the 400 or so in attendance vehemently opposed the project. TVA Chairman Aubrey Wagner, who spoke on the Authority&#x27;s behalf, was continuously interrupted throughout his speech. At one point, Wagner was shouted down by legendary Monroe County judge Sue K. Hicks, who as president of the Fort Loudoun Association feared the destruction of the historic fort&#x27;s site by the proposed dam&#x27;s reservoir.

In 2011, H&amp;R Block featured Greenback in its national advertising campaign. The campaign, known as &quot;Greenbacks for Greenback,&quot; included a review of many of the citizens&#x27; taxes - a program H&amp;R Block calls &quot;second look.&quot; The campaign saved locals more than $14,000 in taxes. The savings were revealed in a celebration with the community at Greenback School. Television, radio and print advertising featured the historic Greenback Depot, the Greenback Drugstore Diner, Greenback School and the Greenback Historical Society as well as many people who call Greenback home.

==Geography==
Greenback is situated around the junction of Tennessee State Route 95 and Morganton Road, with the greater community extending to U.S. Route 411 to the south and U.S. Route 321 to the north, and along Morganton Road westward to East Tellico Parkway (which follows the shores of Tellico Lake). A small commercial area is located around the intersection of Highway 411 and Highway 95.

The relatively flat land in and around Greenback is part of a valley carved by Baker Creek, a tributary of the Little Tennessee River. Chilhowee Mountain and the Great Smoky Mountains are visible to the south. The Red Knobs, part of a heavily dissected ridge typical of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley range, rise just north of Greenback&#x27;s city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.80%) is water.

<text>Lenoir City is a suburban city located in Loudon County, Tennessee. The population was 10,117 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Knoxville metropolitan area in East Tennessee, along the Tennessee River southwest of Knoxville.

==History==
Native Americans were living in the Lenoir City area for thousands of years before the arrival of the first European settlers. On Bussell Island, which lies across the Tennessee River to the south, archaeologists have discovered evidence of habitation dating to as early as the Archaic Period (8000–1000 B.C.). The island is also believed to have been the location of &quot;Coste&quot;, a village visited by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540.

The Cherokee called the Lenoir City area &quot;Wa&#x27;ginsi&quot; and believed it to be the home of a large serpent that brought bad luck to anyone who saw it. By the early 19th century, an early East Tennessee pioneer, Judge David Campbell, had laid claim to part of what is now Lenoir City, where he built a log cabin and a gristmill.

In the early 19th century, the state of North Carolina granted General William Lenoir a tract of land—which included what developed as Lenoir City—as payment for his services in the American Revolutionary War. David Campbell and another early settler, Alexander Outlaw, filed a case against Lenoir in court, arguing they had already laid claim to parts of the Lenoir tract. After the case was settled in favor of Lenoir in 1809, Lenoir deeded the tract to his eldest son, William Ballard Lenoir. In 1810 the younger Lenoir moved to the tract with his wife and established a large plantation. His workforce was composed of enslaved African Americans. Lenoir&#x27;s agricultural enterprise included producing hams from a herd of Berkshire hogs. He also developed several small-scale industries, including a sawmill and flour mill. In the early 1830s, he built the Lenoir Cotton Mill—one of the earliest in the South—sited along the banks of Town Creek, a tributary of the Tennessee River.

After Lenoir&#x27;s death, his estate was divided among his children. His sons formed the William Lenoir and Brothers Company to manage the family&#x27;s businesses. When the railroad reached the Lenoir plantation in 1855, a depot was constructed. The community of Lenoir Station developed around it.

During the Civil War, the Lenoirs supported the Confederacy, due in part to associations with Confederate-leaning business interests in Knoxville. (One of Lenoir&#x27;s sons was married to the daughter of J. G. M. Ramsey, a Knoxville historian and banker, and an ardent Confederate). On June 20, 1863, a Union scouting expedition led by General William P. Sanders arrived at Lenoir Station after having failed to destroy the railroad trestle at Loudon. Sanders burned the depot and the Lenoirs&#x27; sawmill and flour mill. He spared the cotton mill because there were few such mills in the area to provide cloth for the army. In addition, both he and the Lenoirs were Masons.

===Lenoir City Company===

In the late 1880s, an abundance of financial capital, the popularity of social theories regarding planned cities, and a thriving coal mining industry in East Tennessee&#x27;s Cumberland Plateau region led to the development of several company towns to support coal mining throughout the upper Tennessee Valley. Most of these were funded by investors from the Northeastern United States or Knoxville.

In 1889, Knoxville railroad magnate Charles McClung McGhee and his friend and associate Edward J. Sanford formed the Lenoir City Company. They believed the Lenoir plantation would be the ideal location to develop such a town. The company incorporated in April 1890 with $800,000 in stock and purchased the Lenoir estate, which then consisted of , for $300 per acre. When the company issued the stock to the public, the investors each received stock in the company and a lot in the planned town.

Lenoir City was laid out in a grid pattern with four quadrants, west of Town Creek and north of the railroad tracks. The city&#x27;s northwest quadrant was planned for middle class and affluent residents, whereas the northeast quadrant would be for the city&#x27;s wage-workers. The southwest quadrant would contain heavy industry, such as blast furnaces, steel works, and other large factories, while the southeast quadrant would contain woodworking, furniture, and canning factories. Influenced by late 19th-century reform movements that stressed health and temperance, the developers set aside several lots for public parks, and a large garden area was planned between the railroad tracks and the river.

A recession in the early 1890s froze financial markets. By 1892, the company had sold only 144 of the town&#x27;s 3,448 lots. McGhee and Sanford persisted, however, and while Lenoir City never developed as fully as they had conceived, it survived. McGhee convinced a rail car company to open a factory in Lenoir City, and a short time later a knitting mill was established. Both establishments still employed several hundred workers in 1910.

===20th century===
Beginning in the 1930s during the Great Depression, a series of federal government projects provided a needed boost to Lenoir City&#x27;s economy and invested in regional infrastructure. The Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s construction of Fort Loudoun Dam and reservoir, which began in 1940, provided hundreds of locals with jobs. It also resulted in numerous road improvements and generation of hydropower for electrification of the region.

In the 1950s and 1960s, construction associated with the Interstate Highway System resulted in building I-75 and I-40—two trans-national highways that intersect just northeast of Lenoir City. U.S. Highway 321 was built through Lenoir City in the 1980s primarily to provide greater access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, some southeast.

On February 21, 1993, an F-3 tornado touched down in eastern Roane County (just west of town) and tracked east-southeast directly toward the city. The tornado devastated parts of the city. Parts of downtown, as well as the area near A Street and 5th Avenue, were destroyed. The Lenoir City High School/Middle School property suffered major damage (it was redeveloped as River Oaks Place). The tornado continued east-southeastward, going through the town of Friendsville before lifting in western Maryville. One person died in Lenoir City, and 55 people were injured.

In March 1998, a historic landmark, the William B. Lenoir Hotel, the block of Broadway (US 11) between A and B streets, was destroyed by a massive fire. The entire block was lost as it had been built with a common attic and basement, meaning there were no firewalls between buildings. Wilburn&#x27;s Barbershop, the Lenoir City Public Library, a Mexican grocery, offices for &quot;TV Readers&quot; magazine and Habitat for Humanity, a school photography company and photo finishing lab, and several apartments, were all destroyed by the blaze. This block was redeveloped for Roane State Community College, Tennessee Career Center, and a new Lenoir City Public Library.

===21st century===
In the early 2000s, Lenoir City&#x27;s economy expanded and many new businesses developed along U.S. Highway 321. Fort Loudoun Medical Center was built to replace the old Fort Sander&#x27;s Loudon Hospital in nearby Loudon. In the late 2000s, two major commercial developments were announced. Creekwood Park is located parallel to I-75 between US-321 and US-70. A new four-lane road was built between the two highways. A luxury apartment complex was built on part of the site. In 2014, business development finally started in the area, with a few medical offices completed. From 2016 to 2017, the city constructed a new community center called &quot;The Venue&quot;, and a new headquarters here for the Lenoir City Utilities Board here.

Dr. Bob Overholt, a local physician and TV personality, announced another development: The Market at Town Creek, planned to connect US-321 and Harrison Road near the Lenoir City High School and Middle School property. In 2013 Town Creek Parkway, a four-lane road connecting US-321 and Harrison Road, was completed. In 2016, the city inaugurated its first female city councilwoman, Jennifer Wampler. She was appointed to complete the remainder of the term vacated by the death of her late husband, Harry Wampler.

==Geography==

The Tennessee River and TVA&#x27;s Fort Loudoun and Watts Bar reservations provide the city&#x27;s southern boundary. Four major federal highways pass through Lenoir City: U.S. Route 11, which runs roughly parallel to the river shore, traverses the city east-to-west; U.S. Route 321, which crosses Fort Loudon Dam south of the city, traverses the city north-to-south. Interstate 75 and U.S. Route 70 intersect US-321 in the northern part of the city. I-75 provides access to the city from exit 81, and leads northeast to downtown Knoxville (via a connection with I-40), and southwest to Chattanooga. U.S. 321 runs through the center of town from southeast to northwest, leading northwest to I-40 at exit 364 (the highway&#x27;s northern terminus), and east to Maryville. U.S. 70 runs to the north of the city, leading northeast to Farragut and northwest to Kingston. U.S. 11 runs through the center of the city, leading northeast to Farragut and Knoxville, and southwest to the city of Loudon.

Lenoir City is traditionally spread out along US-11, west of the road&#x27;s junction with US-321. This section of the city still roughly follows a grid plan laid out in the 1890s. In recent decades, Lenoir City has annexed a corridor of land along US-321 between its US-11 intersection and I-40 intersection. This corridor contains the city&#x27;s newer, commercial area which caters to the high volume of traffic brought to the area by I-75 and I-40.

<text>Red Boiling Springs is a city in Macon County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 1,205 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Founding===

The area was originally known as Salt Lick Creek due to a salt lick that was located approximately four miles northwest of current day Red Boiling Springs. The salt lick attracted animals, American Indians, and other people. Among the people who came to hunt the animal trails was Daniel Boone, who reportedly carved his name and the year 1775 into a beech tree in a nearby community.

The area was first surveyed, and land grants were first awarded in the mid-1780s. The first post office was established in 1829 and named the Salt Lick Creek post office. In 1847, the post office was renamed &quot;Red Boiling Springs.&quot; Sometime in the 1830s, a farmer named Jesse Jones noticed red-colored sulphur water bubbling up from springs on his farm. In 1844, a businessman named Samuel Hare, realizing the springs&#x27; commercial potential, purchased a plot of the Jones farm surrounding the springs, and constructed an inn. The inn&#x27;s remote location and the region&#x27;s poor roads likely doomed the venture, and the inn was gone by the 1870s.

&quot;Aunt Sooky&#x27;s Salve&quot; was a widely distributed product that was manufactured in Red Boiling Springs under the supervision of &#x27;Aunt&#x27; Sooky Goad, who also claimed to be the original discoverer of the benefits of the Red Boiling Springs water. Early in life, she had dropsy and claimed to be cured by drinking the sulphur water. In 1914, a Nashville man wrote an article stating that Shepherd Kiby (Kirby), the brother of Goad, discovered that washing his eyes with the spring water reduced eye irritation, but Goad&#x27;s use of the water seems to have preceded that of Kirby.

===Tourist attraction===

In 1873, a stagecoach line was established between Red Boiling Springs and Gallatin, where there was a railroad stop. This likely led to renewed commercial interest in the springs, and by 1876, a general store owner named James Bennett had purchased the springs tract and had built a hotel. Bennett&#x27;s hotel consisted of a row of log cabins flanking a central frame dining hall. In the late 1870s, Nashville newspapers first started mentioning Bennett&#x27;s hotel and its guests&#x27; activities, as it was vogue during the Gilded Age for newspapers to report on daily happenings at upper class and upper-middle class resorts.

The 1880s saw a boom in the development of mineral springs resorts as &quot;summer getaways,&quot; due in part to the publicity received by places such as Saratoga Springs in New York. During this decade, New York businessman James F. O. Shaugnesy purchased the Red Boiling Springs tract and began development of the area as a resort. In 1889, the town first made the Nashville newspapers&#x27; front pages when former Tennessee Governor John C. Brown died of a hemorrhage at one of the hotels. The papers emphasized that due to the isolation of the town and a lack of a telephone or telegraph, there was no way to get help. During the following decade, a railroad line was extended to Hartsville, and the railroad established a stagecoach line to Red Boiling Springs. With the continued rise in the number of visitors, two local general store owners— Zack and Clay Cloyd— opened the Cloyd Hotel during this period.

In 1905, several investors formed the Red Boiling Springs Water and Realty Company, and the following year purchased the original springs tract from Shaughnesy. By 1916, the company had replaced Shaughnesy&#x27;s hotel with a lavish 64-room structure named &quot;The Palace.&quot; During this same period, road improvements allowed the stagecoach lines to be replaced with automobile taxis, reducing the travel time from the railroad to just three hours. In 1918, there were four hotels in town— the Palace, the Cloyd, the Donoho, and the Central Hotel; a decade later, that number doubled and soon after, over a dozen hotels and at least that many boarding houses had been erected to take advantage of tourism. The hotels all followed a similar design plan— two stories with elegant verandas spanning the facade and interiors containing large dining halls and 50 to 60 rooms (some later doubled or tripled their roomspace with annexes).

While most mineral water resorts fell out of favor as medical science began to question the healing properties of mineral springs, Red Boiling Springs persisted, reaching its peak in the 1920s and 1930s. The resort was visited by many famous personages in the first half of the 20th century. The hotel registers included the names of judges, lawyers, heads of business and industry, famous musicians and singers, and politicians, among them Jo Byrns; Al Gore, Sr.; Nathan Bachman; Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who sent a beautiful French tapestry that hung in the main lobby of the Donoho Hotel; and most notably President Woodrow Wilson. Although the Great Depression destroyed many Americans&#x27; disposable incomes and hence budget for travel, Red Boiling Springs still had large numbers of visitors. The Summer of 1936 brought over 14,000 people to the little hamlet of approximately 800.

===The mineral springs and daily life in the resort period===
Almost uniquely, five different types of mineral waters are found at Red Boiling Springs. These springs are &quot;mineralized&quot; by their contact with exposed black shale, from which iron sulfate is dissolved into the waters. Some were named for the color they would turn a silver coin; two, dubbed &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;, were from springs which were capped off and then piped throughout the town to a series of wells with manually operated pumps on both public and private property. Along with iron and sulphur, Red and Black waters both contained relatively high amounts of calcium and magnesium. The flavor of the &quot;Red&quot; water was only somewhat sulfurous and seemed to be at least slightly agreeable to many; the &quot;Black&quot; was very-strongly flavored, off-putting to the novice, and an acquired taste (at best) for most. &quot;White&quot; was used only to cure dyspepsia. &quot;Freestone&quot; water contained none of the trace minerals that brought the crowds to the springs but it was by far the most palatable. The most mineralized water, known as &quot;Double and Twist,&quot; was named for the effect it had on the person drinking it. &quot;Double and Twist&quot; was advertised as the &quot;only water of its kind in the United States.&quot;

&quot;Taking the waters&quot; at Red Boiling Springs generally consisted of more than merely ingesting them; steam and tub baths featuring the waters and their alleged therapeutic properties were often featured. The bathhouses followed the hydrotherapy regimen developed by John Harvey Kellogg at his Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan, which was very popular at the time. The various waters contained several minerals but sulfur was predominant, giving the waters the scent (and some would say, the flavor) of rotten eggs. There were medical doctors on hand to prescribe which treatments would work for a particular ailment. The mineral waters, either from ingesting them or bathing in them, were touted as cures for diseases such as dyspepsia, hydropsy, diabetes, rheumatism, neuralgia, kidney stones, gonorrhea, and various eye and skin diseases. An advertising brochure claimed &quot;sickness among the year &#x27;round residents is practically an unknown thing.&quot; 
As the resort grew, it became the stopping point for minstrel shows, circuses and other entertainments to a far greater degree than typical for towns of its small size. The town boasted a number of &quot;diversions&quot;: bowling alleys, tennis courts, shuffle board, croquet, a ballroom, swimming pools, a small golf course, theatre, and an amusement park. The hotels also provided picnics and barbecues. Dancing was the most popular nighttime activity, and many of the hotels had their own orchestras for nightly ballroom dances. String bands also frequented the town, playing mostly at the many taverns scattered around the town&#x27;s periphery.

===Decline===
Several factors contributed to the town&#x27;s decline as a major resort. One was a general loss of confidence and interest in the purportedly curative powers of mineral waters by Americans as the 20th century progressed. A new highway system made it easier for people to travel, but it also meant they could travel to other places as well, such as the state parks that were opening. Those who had promoted tourism and the mineral resorts had retired or died and the next generation was not as interested. Some of the hotels had been left in the hands of managers that did not reinvest the profits in the upkeep of the buildings. A number of the hotels burned and were not rebuilt. The townspeople were hesitant to support tourism. The area&#x27;s general remoteness began to work against it; this was greatly aggravated by World War II and the resultant gasoline rationing. Tourism focus shifted within Tennessee to more highly developed areas such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

By the time the postwar period had arrived, most of the hotels had closed and the area was a shell of its former self. There was a slight rebirth during the 1950s. The town was incorporated on April 27, 1953. A booster club was formed, two of the hotels were restored and new attractions were added. A drive-in billed as the only one of its kind in Middle Tennessee outside of Nashville joined the local theatre. By the early &#x27;60s only five hotels remained, then, by the end of the decade, it was back down to three. One of the hotels was lost to a fire and a nursing home bearing the name of the original hotel was later erected on the cleared site.

===1969 flood===

At 3:30 AM on the morning of June 23, 1969, raining began. Area newspapers reported that by 6:00 AM, the water had risen &quot;about 5 feet above maximum flood level&quot;. In six hours the entire Salt Lick Valley was under water. An unofficial report stated that 10 inches of rain fell in 6 hours. Overall, 15 businesses and 35 houses were either heavily damaged or destroyed, and a Trailways bus had been swept approximately 500 feet into a steel-concrete bridge. Whole houses and many cars floated through town. Two young girls, sisters, Renah Louise Bilbrey, 8, and Jennifer Rae Bilbrey, 2, daughters of Grady and Frances Bilbrey, were killed in the flood. Both girls were found by search parties composed of their relatives and town residents. The girls&#x27; uncle was one of the members to find both bodies. One was not found until seven days later after being swept 4 miles downstream. A brother, 5, survived and the Bilbreys went on to have two more children, including a daughter. An aunt who aided in the search later died during childbirth as a result of hepatitis contracted from the flood waters. In the years following this, several sites including a town park, a housing development, and a dam built to prevent another such flood from happening again were named in memory of the two sisters. Many years later, Nashville Channel 4 WSMV meteorologist Nancy VanCamp and team produced a documentary that recounted the events and the family of the girls were interviewed. The documentary resulted in an Emmy award to the station.
Two songs about the tragedy were produced, one of which, &quot;The Tragedy of Red Boiling Springs&quot;, garnered extensive airplay and resulted in a hit for the producers, artists, and writers involved. The Bilbrey family refused to have anything to do with either record and would not accept any proceeds resulting from sales. The graduating class of the elder sister, Renah, dedicated the annual yearbook to her memory.
State and Federal grant money aided businesses, built watershed dams and help the townsfolk rebuild. One dam was named in memory of the young victims. By the late 1970s the town began to revisit its history in earnest with an eye to marketing it a tourist destination again, if only on a small scale. Two covered bridges were built, and park lands were developed. Later, a library was built on the site of a former hotel. A park was constructed in the early 2000s close to the site of the home of the young victims and was named in their memory. A dedication ceremony honored the surviving family members and rescue workers who aided in finding their bodies.

===Present day===
At the beginning of the 21st century, a large water bottling plant was built on the outskirts of town by Nestlé, where water is bottled from Bennet Hill Springs, a source of Freestone water. The plant removes all the natural minerals from the water by reverse osmosis and later adds a specific mixture of minerals to give it a consistent taste.

The old hand pumps that stood on public land were made inoperable because of liability issues that could occur. The hand pumps can still be seen on private property around town, and some people still believe in the curative powers of the mineral waters. , three of the historic hotels were in operation, with The Armour&#x27;s Hotel still offering a full complement of steam treatment, mineral tub baths, and therapeutic massage.

One of the surviving hotels has undergone several name changes and two fires, the first fire in the 1920s completely destroyed the structure, but it was rebuilt; the second fire in the 1990s destroyed one wing, which was also rebuilt. Names it has operated under include the Cloyd Hotel, and it is currently known as The Thomas House. The hotel gained notoriety in the early half of the 2010s when it became the subject of the popular SyFy channel television program Ghost Hunters. Monthly &quot;ghost hunts&quot; have since remained a popular tourist attraction for the town.
