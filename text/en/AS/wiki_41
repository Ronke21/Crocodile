<text>Louisville () is a city in Stark County, Ohio, United States. The population was 9,521 at the time of the 2020 census. Located northeast of Canton, it is a suburb in the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area.

==History==
On October 8, 1834, Louisville was formally settled by Henry Lautzenheiser, from Germany, and Henry Fainot, a French Huguenot. The city was named after Lautzenheiser&#x27;s son, Lewis, and called Lewisville, Ohio. The name of the town was also considered appropriate because it was initially surveyed by the similar-sounding name of Lewis Vail. When the post office was established in 1837, with Sam Petree as its first postmaster, it was discovered Ohio already had a Lewisville, so the spelling was changed to Louisville.

Within Louisville&#x27;s early days, the town competed with the fellow Nimishillen Township community of Harrisburg (also known as Barryville) for growth. Harrisburg initially flourished due to its accessibility as a stagecoach stop between Canton, Alliance, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, Louisville also grew, due to its location upon the east branch of the Nimishillen Creek, which flows toward Canton. However, when the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway was laid through Louisville in 1852, Louisville began to grow more quickly than Harrisburg, which struggled with the difficulty of hauling its main product, wheat, by barge. Today, Harrisburg is now an unincorporated community, marked only by a handful of businesses and a Roman Catholic parish.

On April 1, 1872, Louisville was officially incorporated as a village, with George Violand elected as Louisville&#x27;s first mayor. By the late 19th Century, Louisville contained many quickly growing businesses, including: a plow manufacturing company, a wooden mill, a brewery, a basket factory, flour mills, tanneries, a brick yard, two hotels, a shoe factory, and a number of taverns/saloons (Louisville had twenty saloons at one point, giving the town a rather notorious reputation). Two of these businesses, Star Mill and the Town Tavern, remain open to this day. Furthermore, many of the buildings constructed within Louisville during this time period are listed upon the National Register of Historic Places. Such locations include Saint Louis Catholic Church, which was completed in 1870 and dedicated in 1878, and the city&#x27;s historic downtown district, roughly bordered by Chapel Street, Lincoln Court, St. Louis Court, Nickelplate Street, East Gorgas Street, and Center Court. The city&#x27;s current weekly newspaper, &quot;The Louisville Herald&quot;, was first published in 1887. For a brief time, the town also had a Roman Catholic college, established by the Reverend Louis Hoffer, located across the street from St. Louis Church. Called Saint Louis College, it opened in 1866 under the operation of the Diocese of Cleveland. The Congregation of St. Basil of Toronto assumed control of the college the following year, and Saint Louis College closed in 1873, due to lack of funds and transportation difficulties for the students. After briefly serving as an all-girls academy and a school for deaf mutes, The building became an orphanage under the guidance of the Vincentian Sisters of Charity. The Saint Louis Orphan Asylum closed in 1925, and became a hospice for the elderly, named St. Joseph&#x27;s, in 1927. The old red brick building was razed in 1975, as St. Joseph&#x27;s moved across the street from St. Thomas Aquinas High School. A McDonald&#x27;s is now located upon the site.

The early 1880s saw the arrival of telephone toll lines to Louisville. Louisville&#x27;s first public street lights, twelve oil burners, were lit downtown for Christmas 1884. In 1894, a public water system was established for Louisville, and a sewage system installation followed in 1910. The town&#x27;s Main Street became Louisville&#x27;s first fully paved road in 1914. In 1960, Louisville&#x27;s residents voted for the village to become a city.

=== Constitution Town ===
Louisville is also known as the &quot;Constitution Town&quot; because a resident of Louisville, Olga T. Weber, petitioned for the establishment of Constitution Day for the United States in 1952. Her lobbying led the Ohio General Assembly to proclaim September 17 as a statewide &quot;Constitution Day,&quot; under a law signed by then-governor Frank J. Lausche. The following year, Weber urged the United States Senate to declare the week of September 17–23 as &quot;Constitution Week&quot;. Her request was approved by both the Senate and the United States House of Representatives, and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. On April 15, 1957, Louisville&#x27;s City Council officially declared itself &quot;The Constitution Town.&quot; The city continues to hold a &quot;Constitution Week&quot; celebration annually during the week of September 17.

<text>Massillon is a city in western Stark County, Ohio, United States, along the Tuscarawas River. The population was 32,146 at the 2020 census. Massillon is a principal city of the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area, which includes all of Stark and Carroll counties and had a population of 401,574 in 2020.

Massillon is located approximately west of Canton, south of Akron, and south of Cleveland. 

==History==
===19th century===

The original settlement of Kendal was founded in 1812 by Thomas Rotch, a Quaker originally of New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut. James Duncan of New Hampshire first settled in Kendal before recording the plot for Massillon on December 6, 1826. Duncan, known as the city&#x27;s founder, named the town after Jean-Baptiste Massillon, a French Catholic bishop, at the request of his wife. The town plat was established along the east bank of the Tuscarawas River, which was the surveyed route for the Ohio and Erie Canal being constructed to connect Lake Erie with the Ohio River. The canal section spanning from Cleveland to Massillon was completed in 1828. Among the leading merchants were the Wellman brothers Hiram and Marshall. Marshall Wellman was the grandfather of the American author Jack London. Massillon quickly became a major port town along the canal route, known as the Port of Massillon, following the canal&#x27;s completion in the 1832. The first telegraph lines would reach Massillon in 1847, and the Ohio &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad would extend its rails to Massillon in 1852. Massillon incorporated as a village in 1853. In 1868, Massillon incorporated as a city when the populated reached 5,000.

The Ohio Women&#x27;s Convention met at Massillon on May 27, 1852. The president of the convention was Hannah Tracy Cutler. The meeting was held in Massillon Baptist Chapel. Attendees voted to establish the Ohio Women&#x27;s Rights Association (OWRA), which held its first meeting the following year in Ravenna.
The C. M. Russell &amp; Company, formed in 1848 by Charles. M. Russell and his brothers, Nahum Russell and Clement Russell, manufactured threshing machines and other agricultural implements in Massillon. The company began producing train cars in 1852 and incorporated in 1864 as Russell &amp; Company Inc. In 1884, Russell &amp; Company began producing its famed steam traction engines and quickly became one of the largest producers of industrial and agricultural equipment. A merger with the Griscom-Spencer company in 1912 created the Griscom-Russell Company. Griscom-Russell produced heat exchangers for the United States Navy during World War II. The company closed in 1962.

The Massillon Iron Bridge Company was founded by Joseph Davenport in 1869 after moving to Massillon from Boston to work at the C. M. Russell &amp; Company. Davenport also invented and built the first locomotive &quot;cowcatcher&quot; and cab in Massillon. The company incorporated in 1887 as The Massillon Bridge Company. The Massillon Bridge Company designed and built steel truss bridges up through the mid-1900s, many of which stand today.
The Massillon State Hospital for the Insane opened in 1898 on 240 acres of land given to the state of Ohio for the purpose of constructing the hospital. The hospital was established by Ohio governor William McKinley. By 1950 there were 3,100 patients in the hospital. Today it is known as Heartland Behavioral Healthcare.

===20th century===
The Forest City Motor Company was founded in Cleveland in 1906 but relocated to Massillon that same year. Forest City produced approximately 1,000 of their Jewel automobiles in Massillon between 1906 and 1909. The name of the company was changed to the Jewel Motor Car Company but the company eventually ceased production in 1909.

Although steelmaking and fabrication is found throughout its history, some say Massillon&#x27;s steel age didn&#x27;t start until 1909, when the first sheet of steel was rolled at the Massillon Rolling Mill Company. Massillon Rolling merged into the Central Steel Company in 1914, and lit its first open hearth furnace in 1915. Central Steel eventually became known as the Central Alloy Steel Company. In April 1930, Central Alloy merged with Republic Steel, becoming the third largest steel company in the world, with its Massillon operations employing nearly one-half of the city&#x27;s workforce by 1959. This included other Massillon divisions like Massillon Union Drawn Steel and its stainless steel division Enduro Stainless. In 1984 Republic Steel was purchased by LTV Steel. Enduro closed in 1985, and it and other stainless plants went through several ownership changes over the following 15 years. The main Republic facilities on the southwest side of Massillon closed by 2002.

Stanley Macomber designed the open-web steel joist in 1921 while working for Massillon&#x27;s Central Steel Company. Macomber left Central Steel and founded the Massillon Steel Joist Co. in 1923. His open-web steel joist, patented in 1924, was known as the Massillon Steel Joist. Macomber&#x27;s invention was a revolutionary assembly of steel joists with a top slab used to support of floors, ceilings and roofs. The basis of Macomber&#x27;s steel joist design is still used today. Stanley Macomber was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2011.
Lincoln Highway, the first U.S. highway to run from coast to coast, was envisioned in 1913 and followed Main Street through the center of Massillon. Main Street was eventually renamed Lincoln Way in recognition of the new highway. In 1928, the federal government renamed Lincoln Highway to U.S. 30. A controlled access freeway was constructed in 1971, bypassing U.S. 30 around to the city&#x27;s most southern part. The old Lincoln Highway that runs through Massillon and Canton was reassigned as State Route 172.

Massillon was a site where one of the most tragic instances of anti-union violence in the history of the United States occurred, during the Little Steel strike of 1937. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee began an attempt to organize workers at Republic Steel in the spring of 1937, following the unionizing of workers at the country&#x27;s two largest steel companies US Steel and Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel. In retaliation, Republic Steel expelled over 1000 union supporters at plants in Canton and Massillon. On May 26, the union eventually called for all workers at Republic Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel (together known as Little Steel) to strike in response to the treatment of workers in Massillon and Canton. On the night of July 11, 1937, a car failed to dim its headlights as it approached a police barricade near a picket line at one of the Massillon plants. City police assumed the worst and without warning opened fire with rifles and shotguns. Police then used this infraction to raid a peaceful crowd that was gathered in front of the union headquarters. Police pumped tear gas canisters and opened fire into the fleeing crowd. Joined by National Guardsmen, the police destroyed the union hall and arrested every suspected unionist they could find. Three men were killed and hundreds were injured during this incident.

Ohio Historical Marker #18-76 was erected in 2004 in front of the Massillon City Hall in memory of the Little Steel Strike of 1937.

Jacob S. Coxey, Sr., sometimes known as General Coxey of Massillon, was an American politician who ran for elective office several times in Ohio. He twice led Coxey&#x27;s Army, in 1894 and 1914, consisting of a group of unemployed men that he led on marches from Massillon to Washington, D.C., to present a &quot;Petition in Boots&quot; demanding that the Congress allocate funds to create jobs for the unemployed. Although his march failed, Coxey&#x27;s Army was an early attempt to arouse political interest in an issue that grew in importance until the Social Security Act of 1935 encouraged the establishment of state unemployment insurance programs. Jacob Coxey was elected mayor of Massillon in 1931 and served one year.

==Arts and culture==
===Museums===

The Massillon Museum was established in 1933 in order to preserve the city&#x27;s rich history. The museum was accredited in 1972 by the American Alliance of Museums and is currently located downtown in the historic Gensemer Brothers Dry Goods building. The museum&#x27;s collection encompasses approximately 100,000 objects in 94 categories, 60,000 photographs, and 18,000 archival and reference documents. The Immel Circus is one of the museum&#x27;s most interesting collections. The 100-square foot miniature circus contains 2,620 pieces: thirty-six elephants, 186 horses, 102 assorted animals, ninety-one wagons, seven tents, and 2,207 people. Most of the pieces were hand-carved by Dr. Robert Immel of Massillon using tools from his dental practice.

Spring Hill Historic Home is the home of Thomas and Charity Rotch, the founders of Kendal, Ohio (the precursor to Massillon). In 1973, the home of the Rotch-Wales families was turned into a historic home and opened to the public. Today, they focus on the Underground Railroad work that Thomas and Charity did while living in the house. The house is a member of the Ohio Friends of Freedom Society, and became a site on the National Park Service&#x27;s Network to Freedom in 2006. Perhaps one of the most exciting parts of their Underground Railroad history is a letter written by George Duncan, a freedom seeker who was still on the run, to Thomas and Charity. George trusted the Rotches to help reunite him with his companion Edy, who was waiting for safer passage before escaping herself. George&#x27;s letter is one of only a few written by a formerly enslaved person while they were still on the run.

The Ohio Military Museum is operated by the Ohio Society Of Military History and is home to thousands of artifacts and tributes to the men and women of Ohio who served in the armed forces. The museum moved to the MAPS Air Museum in 2016.

===Lions Lincoln Theatre===

The 1915 landmark movie theatre, designed by Guy Tilden, was saved from demolition by the local Lions International club in 1982. The theatre is thought to be one of the oldest purpose-built movie houses in the country still in operation. One of the theatre&#x27;s two arc-lamp 35mm projectors was replaced by a digital projector in 2013. Today the theatre hosts community events, and screens classic and second-run movies on weekends. The stage also hosts live theatre. In 1989, the play &quot;Dear Mother and All&quot;, a World War I play based on letters of Massillon native Charles Vernon Brown and his friends and family, debuted at the theatre.

==Parks and recreation==
The City of Massillon Parks &amp; Recreation Department operates a recreation center, senior center, and 35 parks and open spaces. Massillon&#x27;s municipal golf course, The Legends of Massillon, opened in 1995. The city maintains the Stark County section of the Sippo Valley Bike &amp; Hike Trail, leading trail users to Dalton in Wayne County. The Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail also passes through the city.

==Football==

Football has long been one of the most prominent contributions to the culture of Massillon. In July 2008 Massillon was nominated as one of only twenty cities nationwide as a finalist in ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Titletown U.S.A.&quot; contest. On July 21, a rally was held at Paul Brown Tiger Stadium while ESPN filmed a segment that was aired on SportsCenter. Massillon finished fourth in the voting behind Valdosta, Georgia; Parkersburg, West Virginia; and Green Bay, Wisconsin.

===High School football===
The name Massillon is most notably associated with the Massillon Washington High School football team, the Tigers. Distinguished Massillon alumni include former Ohio State University, Cleveland Browns, and Cincinnati Bengals coach Paul Brown, and former Ohio State University player and former NFL All-Pro linebacker Chris Spielman. The Tigers are historically one of the winningest high school football teams in the United States, second only to Valdosta High School in Valdosta, Georgia. Along with the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs, the Tigers represent one half of what many consider to be the greatest high school football rivalry in the nation. Both Massillon and their fierce rivalry with Canton are subjects of the 2001 documentary film &quot;Go Tigers!&quot;.

The construction of Paul Brown Tiger Stadium in Massillon was completed in 1939 through the Works Progress Administration program. The stadium currently holds 16,884 people and is named after former Tiger player and head coach Paul Brown. Besides being the regular season home of the Massillon Tiger Football team, the stadium hosts numerous Ohio High School Athletic Association state football playoff games as well as divisional championship games. The stadium also hosts the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame drum and bugle corps competition. The stadium is marked with a historical marker dedicated to Paul Brown and his contribution to the sport 

Massillon&#x27;s Paul L. David Athletic Training Center was built in 2008 by local philanthropist Jeff David in honor of his late father. The 3 million dollar, 80,000 square foot building is the largest indoor football practice facility in the state of Ohio, 20,000-square-feet larger than the facility used by the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns.

The Massillon Tigers have accumulated 25 “state AP championships” and 9 “national AP championships” during the school&#x27;s history. As of 2012, the Tigers have accumulated an overall record of 837-249-35, a record not approached by any other Ohio high school football team. In the years since the Ohio high school playoff system was instituted in 1972, the Tigers have accumulated a current record of 316-117-4. The Tigers have made the playoffs 19 times, the final four six times, and the final championship game three times. There have been 23 professional players, 3 NFL coaches, and 14 collegiate all-Americans that have graduated from Massillon Washington High School.
Washington High School previously held the record for the most playoff appearances by a high school football team without actually winning a state championship since 1970. The Tigers won 7-2 against Archbishop Hoban High School on 30 November 2023 to clinch the OHSAA D-II state football championship, thus ending a 53 year drought.
====Tiger Swing Band====
The 1915 Washington High School annual notes of the Massillon Football Band being a group of students bringing their instruments to the football games and playing to cheer on the team and pep up the fans. The name &quot;The Massillon Tiger Swing Band&quot; and the swing elements were created by George &quot;Red&quot; Bird in 1938 during the Paul Brown era of Massillon football. The band became known as &quot;The Greatest Show in High School Football&quot; and is still a very important part of the Massillon football tradition. The band&#x27;s swing style includes moving formations and musicians marching with a swing step. Mr. Bird invented the 6 to 5 step. The Tiger Swing band begins every home football game with the traditional hometown songs of &quot;Massillon Will Shine&quot;, &quot;Stand Up and Cheer&quot; (to acknowledge the other team), the National Anthem, &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and the &quot;WHS Alma Mater&quot;. At the beginning of each half time show, they perform what is known as &quot;Opening Routine&quot;, this tradition that goes back for decades and consists of the band&#x27;s entrance (&quot;Turn Arounds&quot;) followed by &quot;Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; and &quot;Carry On&quot;. This entire routine is marched at 180 beats per minute. The band also learns and performs a new show for every home game.
===Professional football===
While the first players known to be paid to play football are believed to have played for club teams in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, perhaps the first great professional football rivalry was between the Massillon Tigers and Canton Bulldogs from 1903 to 1906 and 1915 to 1919. This rivalry predates both the NFL and the aforementioned rivalry between the Massillon and Canton high schools which continue to use the nicknames of these early professional teams. The Professional Football Researchers Association (PFRA) web site includes articles about the early years of this rivalry, as well as articles about the history of football through the 1970s.

The first upright vacuum cleaner was invented in June 1908 in North Canton by department store janitor James M. Spangler.

==Superfund Site==
A pit from prior sand and gravel mining was turned into a landfill in 1966, the so called Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL), which accepted solid and liquid waste of Akron&#x27;s rubber industry as well as black shale and coal ash, military waste, and various other industrial wastes including plutonium, according to former landfill owner Charles Kittinger. The 30 acre landfill closed in 1980 and left soil and groundwater contamination behind, with recurring plumes of toxic vapors for years to come. In 1983, concerned citizens raised the issue of health effects from IEL&#x27;s contamination. EPA listed IEL as a Superfund site in 1984. They determined that a toxic plume moved in a radial pattern away from the site in all directions. A soil vapor intrusion control system was installed in areas where residents could not be evacuated. In 1989, EPA hired Tetra Tech to conduct cleanup efforts. In 2004, EPA considering the clean-up finished and shut down monitoring wells.

<text>Akron () is a city in and the county seat of Summit County, Ohio, United States. At the 2020 census, the city proper had a total population of 190,469, making it the fifth-most populous city in Ohio and 136th-most populous city in the U.S. The Akron metropolitan area, covering Summit and Portage counties, had a population of 702,219. It is located on the western edge of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau in Northeast Ohio about south of downtown Cleveland.

First settled in 1810, the city was founded by Simon Perkins and Paul Williams in 1825 along the Little Cuyahoga River at the summit of the developing Ohio and Erie Canal. The name is derived from the Greek word (), signifying a summit or high point. It was briefly renamed South Akron after Eliakim Crosby founded nearby North Akron in 1833, until both merged into an incorporated village in 1836. In the 1910s, Akron doubled in population, making it the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing city.

A long history of rubber and tire manufacturing, carried on today by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, gave Akron the nickname &quot;Rubber Capital of the World&quot;. It was once known as a center of airship development. Today, its economy includes manufacturing, education, healthcare, and biomedical research; leading employers include Akron Children&#x27;s Hospital, Gojo Industries, FirstEnergy, and Summa Health. Other significant institutions include the Akron Art Museum, Akron Civic Theatre, Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens, and University of Akron.

Notable historic events in Akron include the passage of the Akron School Law of 1847, which created the K–12 system; the popularization of the church architectural Akron Plan, the foundation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the Akron Experiment into preventing goiters with iodized salt, the 1983 Supreme Court case &quot;City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health;&quot; and portions of the 2014 Gay Games. A racially diverse city, it has seen noted racial relations speeches by Sojourner Truth in 1851 (the Ain&#x27;t I A Woman? speech), W. E. B. Du Bois in 1920, and President Bill Clinton in 1997. Episodes of major civil unrest in Akron have included the riot of 1900, rubber strike of 1936, the Wooster Avenue riots of 1968, and the 2022 protests surrounding the killing of Jayland Walker.

==History==
The first settler in the Akron area was Major Miner Spicer, who came from Groton, Connecticut. He built a log cabin in the forest in 1810, and became the region&#x27;s first citizen. In June 1811, Spicer sent for his family, who came that same year by ox teams accompanied by Capt. Amos Spicer and Paul Williams.

In 1811, Paul Williams settled near the corner of what is now Buchtel Avenue and Broadway. He suggested to General Simon Perkins, who was surveyor of the Connecticut Land Company&#x27;s Connecticut Western Reserve, that they found a town at the summit of the developing Ohio and Erie Canal. The name is adapted from the Greek word (), meaning summit or high point. It was laid out in December 1825, where the south part of the downtown Akron neighborhood sits today. Irish laborers working on the Ohio Canal built about 100 cabins nearby.

After Eliakim Crosby founded &quot;North Akron&quot; (also known as Cascade) in the northern portion of what is now downtown Akron in 1833, &quot;South&quot; was added to Akron&#x27;s name until about three years later, when the two were merged and became an incorporated village in 1836. In 1840, Summit County formed from portions of Portage, Medina, and Stark Counties. Akron replaced Cuyahoga Falls as its county seat a year later and opened a canal connecting to Beaver, Pennsylvania, helping give birth to the stoneware, sewer pipe, fishing tackle, and farming equipment industries. In 1844, abolitionist John Brown moved into the John Brown House across the street from business partner Colonel Simon Perkins, who lived in the Perkins Stone Mansion. The Akron School Law of 1847 founded the city&#x27;s public schools and created the K–12 grade school system, which currently is used in every U.S. state. The city&#x27;s first school is now a museum on Broadway Street near the corner of Exchange.

===1850s–1890s: Summit City===
When the Ohio Women&#x27;s Rights Convention came to Akron in 1851, Sojourner Truth extemporaneously delivered her speech named &quot;Ain&#x27;t I A Woman?&quot;, at the Universalist Old Stone Church. In 1870, a local businessman associated with the church, John R. Buchtel, founded Buchtel College, which became the University of Akron in 1913.

Ferdinand Schumacher bought a mill in 1856, and the following decade mass-produced oat bars for the Union Army during the American Civil War; these continued to sell well after the war. Akron incorporated as a city in 1865. Philanthropist Lewis Miller, Walter Blythe, and architect Jacob Snyder designed the widely used Akron Plan, debuting it on Akron&#x27;s First Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872. Numerous Congregational, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches built between the 1870s and World War I use it. In 1883, a local journalist began the modern toy industry by founding the Akron Toy Company. A year later, the first popular toy was mass-produced clay marbles made by Samuel C. Dyke at his shop where Lock 3 Park is now. Other popular inventions include rubber balloons, ducks, dolls, balls, baby buggy bumpers, and little brown jugs. In 1895, the first long-distance electric railway, the Akron, Bedford and Cleveland Railroad, began service. On August 25, 1889, the Boston Daily Globe referred to Akron with the nickname &quot;Summit City&quot;. To help local police, the city deployed the first police car in the U.S. that ran on electricity.

===1900s–1990s: Rubber Capital of the World===
The Riot of 1900 saw assaults on city officials, two deaths, and the destruction by fire of Columbia Hall and the Downtown Fire Station (now the City Building since 1925). The American trucking industry was birthed through Akron&#x27;s Rubber Capital of the World era when the four major tire companies B.F. Goodrich (1869), Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (1898), Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (1900), and General Tire &amp; Rubber Company (1915) were headquartered in the city. The numerous jobs the rubber factories provided for deaf people led to Akron being nicknamed the &quot;Crossroads of the Deaf&quot;. On Easter Sunday 1913, of rain fell, causing floods that killed five people and destroyed the Ohio and Erie Canal system. From 1916 to 1920, 10,000 schoolgirls took part in the successful Akron Experiment, testing iodized salt to prevent goiter in what was known as the &quot;Goiter Belt&quot;.

In 1914, Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association in Kingston, Jamaica; its Akron branch opened in 1921.

Rubber companies responded to housing crunches by building affordable housing for workers. Goodyear&#x27;s president, Frank A. Seiberling, built the Goodyear Heights neighborhood for employees. Likewise, Harvey S. Firestone built the Firestone Park neighborhood for his employees. During the 1910–1920 decade, Akron became a boomtown, being America&#x27;s fastest growing city with a 201.8% increase in population. Of the 208,000 citizens, almost one-third were immigrants (also Clark Gable) and their children from places including Europe and West Virginia. In 1929 and 1931, Goodyear&#x27;s subsidiary Goodyear-Zeppelin Company manufactured two airships for the United States Navy, USS &quot;Akron&quot; (ZRS-4) and USS &quot;Macon&quot; (ZRS-5). Goodyear built a number of blimps for the Navy during WWII and later for advertising purposes.

Akron again grew when Kenmore was annexed by voter approval on November 6, 1928. Found hiding under a bed at one of his hideouts in the city, notorious bank robber Charles Arthur &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd was arrested under the name &quot;Frank Mitchell&quot; in March 1930. Goodyear became America&#x27;s top tire manufacturer after merging with the Kelly-Springfield Tire Company in 1935. Lasting five weeks and consisting of roughly 5,000 strikers including union sympathizers from other factories and neighboring states, the Akron Rubber Strike of 1936 successfully used the &quot;sit-down&quot; tactic to force recognition of the United Rubber Workers. During the 1950s–60s Akron surged as use of the automobile did. The historic Rubber Bowl was used by the National Guard of the United States as a base during the racial Wooster Avenue Riots of 1968. Like many other industries of the Rust Belt, both the tire and rubber industries experienced major decline. By the early 1990s, Goodyear was the last major tire manufacturer based in Akron.

===2000s: City of Invention===

Despite the number of rubber workers decreasing by roughly half from 2000 to 2007, Akron&#x27;s research in polymers gained an international reputation. It now centers on the Polymer Valley which consists of 400 polymer-related companies, of which 94 were located in the city itself. Research is focused at the University of Akron, which is home to the Goodyear Polymer Center and the National Polymer Innovation Center, and the College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering. Because of its contributions to the Information Age, &quot;Newsweek&quot; listed Akron fifth of ten high-tech havens in 2001. In 2008 &quot;City of Invention&quot; was added to the seal when the All-America City Award was received for the third time. Some events of the 2014 Gay Games used the city as a venue. In 2013, the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company opened its new global headquarters on Innovation Way, further cementing the company&#x27;s relationship with the city. Bridgestone built a new technical center with state-of-the-art R&amp;D labs, and moved its product development operations to the new facility in early 2012.

The city also continues to deal with the effects of air and soil pollution from its industrial past. In the southwestern part of the city, soil was contaminated and noxious PCB-laden fumes were put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation that existed from the 1930s to the 1960s. Cleanup of the site, designated as a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency, began in 1987 and concluded in 2000. The area remains restricted with regular reviews of the site and its underground aquifer.

===Racial history===

City founder Simon Perkins negotiated a treaty with Native Americans to establish a mail route from the Connecticut Western Reserve to Detroit in 1807, an early example of historic humanitarian affairs in Akron. Aside from being part of the Underground Railroad, when active, John Brown was a resident, today having two landmarks (the John Brown House and the John Brown Monument) dedicated to him. During the 1851 Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, Sojourner Truth delivered her speech entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t I A Woman?&quot;. In 1905, a statue of an Indian named Unk was erected on Portage Path, which was part of the effective western boundary of the White and Native American lands from 1785 to 1805. The Summit County chapter of the Ku Klux Klan reported having 50,000 members, making it the largest local chapter in the country during the 20th century. At some point the sheriff, county officials, mayor of Akron, judges, county commissioners, and most members of Akron&#x27;s school board were members. The Klan&#x27;s influence in the city&#x27;s politics eventually ended after Wendell Willkie arrived and challenged them. Race played a part in two of Akron&#x27;s major riots, the Riot of 1900 and the Wooster Ave. Riots of 1968. Others giving speeches on race in the city include W. E. B. Du Bois (1920) and President Bill Clinton (1997). In 1971, Alpha Phi Alpha Homes Inc. was founded in Akron by the Eta Tau Lambda chapter, with James R. Williams as chairman. The centerpiece, Henry Arthur Callis Tower, is located in the Channelwood Village area of the city. In 2008, 91-year-old Akron native, Addie Polk, became the poster child of the Great Recession, after shooting herself. In 2022, Akron resident Jayland Walker was killed by police after shooting at them while fleeing, sparking days of protest and the institution of a police review board.

===Neighborhoods===

Akron consists of 21 neighborhoods, with an additional three that are unincorporated but recognized within the city. The neighborhoods of the city differ in design largely because of expansions such as town merging, annexation, housing construction in various time periods, and rubber era.

Maple Valley covers the west end of Copley Road, before reaching I-77. Along this strip are several businesses using the name, as well as the Maple Valley Branch of the Akron-Summit County Public Library. Spicertown falls under the blanket of University Park, this term is used frequently to describe the student-centered retail and residential area around East Exchange and Spicer streets, near the University of Akron. West Hill is roughly bounded by West Market Street on the north, West Exchange Street on the south, Downtown on the East, and Rhodes Avenue on the west. It features many stately older homes, particularly in the recently recognized Oakdale Historic District.

===Suburbs===
Akron&#x27;s suburbs include Barberton, Cuyahoga Falls, Fairlawn, Green, Hudson, Mogadore, Montrose-Ghent, Munroe Falls, Norton, Silver Lake, Stow, and Tallmadge.

In 1999, Akron ranked as the 94th-most-dangerous city (and the 229th safest) on the 7th Morgan Quitno list. Preliminary Ohio crime statistics show aggravated assaults increased by 45% during 2007.

Historically, organized crime operated in the city with the presence of the &quot;Black Hand&quot; led by Rosario Borgio, once headquartered on the city&#x27;s north side in the first decade of the 20th century and the &quot;Walker-Mitchell&quot; mob, of which Pretty Boy Floyd was a member. Akron has experienced several riots in its history, including the Riot of 1900 and the Wooster Avenue Riots of 1968.

The distribution of methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;) in Akron greatly contributed to Summit County becoming known as the &quot;Meth Capital of Ohio&quot; in the early 2000s. The county ranked third in the nation in the number of registered meth sites. During the 1990s, motorcycle gang the Hells Angels sold the drug from bars frequented by members. Between January 2004 and August 2009, the city had significantly more registered sites than any other city in the state. Authorities believed a disruption of a major Mexican meth operation contributed to the increase of it being made locally. In 2007, the Akron Police Department (APD) received a grant to help continue its work with other agencies and jurisdictions to support them in ridding the city of meth labs. The APD coordinates with the Summit County Drug Unit and the Drug Enforcement Administration, forming the Clandestine Methamphetamine Laboratory Response Team.

==Economy==

Many industries in the United States either began or were influenced by the city. After beginning the tire and rubber industry during the 20th century with the founding of BFGoodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and also the Goodyear merger with The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company, Akron gained the status of &quot;Rubber Capital of the World&quot;. Akron has won economic awards such as for City Livability and All-America City, and deemed a high tech haven greatly contributing to the Information Age. Current Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the city include Goodyear and FirstEnergy. In addition, the city is the headquarters to a number of other notable companies such as GOJO, Advanced Elastomer Systems, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Myers Industries, Acme Fresh Market, and Sterling Jewelers. Goodyear, America&#x27;s biggest tire manufacturer and the fifth-largest private employer in Summit County, recently built a new world headquarters in the city. The project, Akron Riverwalk, will feature a large retail and commercial development area. The project began in 2007, but was put on hold because of the Great Recession. Bridgestone built a new technical center with research and development labs, and moved its product development operations to the new facility in early 2012. The Eastern Ohio Division of KeyBank, which has six branches in the city, built a regional headquarters downtown. The city has a free WiFi corridor centered in downtown. Neighborhoods in range include Goodyear Heights, East Akron, North Hill, Firestone Park, Kenmore, and West Akron.

===Polymer Valley===
Northeast Ohio&#x27;s Polymer Valley is centered in Akron. The area holds forty-five percent of the state&#x27;s polymer industries, with the oldest dating to the 19th century. During the 1980s and 1990s, an influx of new polymer companies came to the region. In 2001, more than 400 companies manufactured polymer-based materials in the region. Many University of Akron scientists became world-renowned for their research done at the Goodyear Polymer Center. The first College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering was begun by the university. In 2010, the National Polymer Innovation Center opened on campus.

===Hospitals===

Akron has designated an area called the Biomedical Corridor, aimed at luring health-related ventures to the region. It encompasses of private and publicly owned land, bounded by Akron General on the west and Akron City on the east, and also includes Akron Children&#x27;s near the district&#x27;s center with the former Saint Thomas Hospital to the north of its northern boundaries. Since its start in 2006, the corridor added the headquarters of companies such as Akron Polymer Systems.

Akron&#x27;s adult hospitals are owned by two health systems, Summa Health System and Akron General Health System. Summa Health System operates Summa Akron City Hospital and the former St. Thomas Hospital, which in 2008 were recognized for the 11th consecutive year as one of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Hospitals&quot; by U.S. News &amp; World Report. Summa is recognized as having one of the best orthopaedics programs in the nation with a ranking of 28th. Akron General Health in affiliation with the Cleveland Clinic operates Akron General Medical Center, which in 2009, was recognized as one of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Hospitals&quot; by U.S. News &amp; World Report. Akron Children&#x27;s Hospital is an independent entity that specializes in pediatric care and burn care. In 1974, Howard Igel and Aaron Freeman successfully grew human skin in a lab to treat burn victims, making Akron Children&#x27;s Hospital the first hospital in the world to achieve such a feat. Akron City and Akron General hospitals are designated Level I Trauma Centers.

===Architecture===

As a result of multiple towns merging, and industry boom, Akron&#x27;s architecture is diverse.

Originally a canal town, the city is divided into two parts by the Ohio and Erie Canal, with downtown being centered on it. Along the locks, the city has a path paved with rubber.

Akron was awarded with the City Livability Award in 2008 for its efforts to co-purpose new school buildings as community learning centers. In 2009, the National Arbor Day Foundation designated Akron as a Tree City USA for the 14th time.

Many of the city&#x27;s government and civic buildings, including City Hall and the Summit County Courthouse are from pre-World War Two, but the Akron-Summit County Public Library, and John S. Knight Center are considerably newer. The library originally opened in 1969, but reopened as a greatly expanded facility in 2004. The Knight Center opened in 1994.

The First Methodist Episcopal Church first used the Akron Plan in 1872. The plan later gained popularity, being used in many Congregationalist, Baptist, and Presbyterian church buildings.
The city is home to a historic 1920s atmospheric movie palace, the Akron Civic Theatre. One of the building&#x27;s features is a starry sky with clouds that drift over it when the lights are dimmed.

Completed in 1931, Akron&#x27;s tallest building, the Huntington Tower, features the art deco style and is covered in glazed architectural terra-cotta. Standing tall, it is built on top of the Hamilton Building, completed in 1900 in the neo-Gothic style. Near the turn of the millennium the tower was given a $2.5 million facelift, including a $1.8 million restoration of the tower&#x27;s terra-cotta, brick, and limestone. The top of the building has a television broadcast tower formerly used by WAKR-TV (now WVPX-TV) and WAKR-AM. The antenna reaches . Located on the University of Akron campus, the Goodyear Polymer Center consists of glass twin towers connected by walkways. The university also formerly used the old Quaker Oats factory as a dormitory, including using it as a quarantine center during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. For many years it had been a shopping center called Quaker Square. There had also been a hotel there.

The Akron Art Museum commissioned Coop Himmelblau to design an expansion in 2007. The new building connects to the old building and is divided into three parts known as the &quot;Crystal&quot;, the &quot;Gallery Box&quot;, and the &quot;Roof Cloud&quot;.

The contrasting neighborhoods of Goodyear Heights and Firestone Park were built during the rubber industry to house workers and their families. Both are communities filled with houses based on mail-order plans.

==Government==

The mayor of Akron is elected in a citywide vote. In 2023, the city elected its 63rd mayor. The city is divided into 10 wards, each elect a member to the Akron City Council, while an additional 3 are elected at large. The mayor&#x27;s cabinet currently consist of directors and deputy directors of administration, communications, community relations, economic development, intergovernmental relations, labor relations, law, planning &amp; urban development, planning director – deputy, public safety, and public service. The city adopted a new charter of the commissioner manager type in 1920, but reverted to its old form in 1924.

The current mayor is Shammas Malik, who succeeded Dan Horrigan after the 2023 election. Longtime Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic announced on May 8, 2015, that he would resign on May 31 after 28 years as mayor and 41 years of service to the city. On May 31, 2015, Garry Moneypenny was sworn in as the new mayor at East High School. Moneypenny was former Chief Deputy and Assistant Sheriff of the Summit County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, former Springfield Township Police Department Chief of Police, and former Akron City Council President.

On June 5, 2015, less than a week after he took office, Mayor Moneypenny announced he would not run for a full term because of inappropriate contact with a city employee. Three days later, Moneypenny announced he would resign effective at midnight on June 10. Council president Jeff Fusco assumed the duties of mayor on June 11, 2015. Fusco ran for and was elected to an at-large council seat, rather than seeking a full term as mayor. Fusco also announced he would temporarily step down as Chair of the Summit County Democratic Party, because the city charter calls for the Mayor to devote his full attention to the city.

As of July 1, 2015, three Democrats and one Republican were running for Mayor of Akron. The Democratic candidates were Summit County Clerk of Courts and former ward 4 Councilman Dan Horrigan; at-large Councilman Mike Williams; and Summit County Councilman Frank Communale. Horrigan won the Democratic primary, held on September 8. In the general election, he faced the lone GOP candidate, Eddie Sipplen, an African-American criminal defense attorney.

==Education==
Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the Akron City School District. Planning of the district began in 1840, when Ansel Miller suggested to build free public schools for all children in the city, paid for by property taxes. After enduring much opposition by citizens, in 1843 Miller joined with Rev. Isaac Jennings. Three years later, Jennings became the chairman of a committee of citizens who discussed how to improve the school system. On November 21, 1846, their plan was approved unanimously by the citizens. The Ohio Legislature adopted the plan, called &quot;An act for the support and better regulation of the Common Schools of the Town of Akron&quot; on February 8, 1847. Akron&#x27;s first public schools were established in the fall of 1847 and were led by Mortimer Leggett. The first annual report showed that it cost less than $2 a year to educate a child. In 1857 the cost of running the schools for a year was $4,200 (~$ in ). The primary schools were taught by young women, which the Akron Board of Education justified because they could be paid less and were under the supervision of a male superintendent. From 1877 to 1952, Akron graduated students semi-annually instead of annually. 9% of the city&#x27;s school-aged population were born in other countries in 1888. In the 1920s, an Americanization program was designed to help the many Akron students who were first-generation Americans. Classes were in the rubber companies and some of the schools. A &quot;continuation school&quot; began for working boys and girls who were required by law to have at least four hours of schooling a week. In 1924, Akron&#x27;s platoon schools attracted visitors from all over the country. Being a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan during the decade, the majority of school board and government officials were members. Their influence ended with the arrival of Wendell Willkie. During the city&#x27;s 1950s boom town phase, Akron schools grew eight times faster than the city&#x27;s population. In 1967, Kenmore launched the Air Force JROTC. In 1971, Jennings piloted the middle school model, which moved ninth-graders to the senior high school. In 1984, all-day kindergarten was piloted at Seiberling, Rankin and Hatton schools, and Ellet, East and Garfield high schools piloted the in-school suspension program. The district received an A+ evaluation from the state in 1987.

Akron was served by the Akron Digital Academy from 2002 to 2018, when it shut down.

As part of his charitable foundation&#x27;s initiatives in the city, LeBron James founded the I Promise School, which serves underprivileged kids.

The city is home to the University of Akron. Originally Buchtel College, the school is home of the Goodyear Polymer Center and the National Polymer Innovation Center.

All Akron Public Schools are currently going through a 15-year, $800 million rebuilding process. In recent times the city&#x27;s schools have been moved from &quot;Academic Watch&quot; to &quot;Continuous Improvement&quot; by the Ohio Department of Education. Akron also has many private, parochial and charter schools.

The 2015 film &quot;Room&quot; is set in Akron, filmed in Toronto with staging to signify Akron.

==Transportation==
===Airports===

The primary terminal that airline passengers traveling to or from Akron use is the Akron–Canton Airport, serving nearly 2 million passengers a year. The Akron-Canton Airport is a commercial Class C airport located in the city of Green, roughly southeast of Akron operated jointly by Stark and Summit counties. It serves as an alternative for travelers to or from the Cleveland area as well. Akron Executive Airport is a general aviation airport located in and owned by the City of Akron that serves private planes. It first opened in 1929 and has operated in several different capacities since then. The airport had commercial scheduled airline service until the 1950s and it is now used for both cargo and private planes.
It is home of the Lockheed Martin Airdock, where the Goodyear airships, dirigibles, and blimps were originally stored and maintained. The Goodyear blimps are now housed outside of Akron in a facility on the shores of Wingfoot Lake in nearby Suffield Township.

===Railroads===
Akron Northside Station is a train station at 27 Ridge Street along the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.

Because of the city&#x27;s large rubber industry, Akron was once served by a variety of railroads that competed for the city&#x27;s freight and passenger business. The largest were the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Erie Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Smaller regional railroads included the Akron, Canton, and Youngstown Railroad, Northern Ohio Railway, and the Akron Barberton Belt Railroad. Today, the city is served by CSX Corporation, the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, and their subsidiary Akron-Barberton-Cluster, which operate out of the W&amp;LE&#x27;s Akron Yard near Brittain Road on the eastern end of the city.

From 1891 to 1971 passenger service to points throughout the Midwest, as well as Washington and New York City, was provided at Akron Union Station. The last legacy passenger trains were the Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s &quot;Lake Cities&quot; (ended, 1970) and the B&amp;O&#x27;s &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (ended, 1971). There is currently no passenger rail transportation with the elimination of Amtrak&#x27;s former &quot;Three Rivers&quot; service in 2005. The nearest Amtrak service is in Alliance, Ohio or Cleveland.

===Bus and public transit===

Public transportation is available through the METRO Regional Transit Authority system, whose fleet of over 200 buses and trolleys operates local routes and commuter buses into downtown Cleveland. Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) also has a bus line running between Canton and Akron and the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) runs an express route connecting the University of Akron with Kent State University.
Metro RTA operates out of the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center on South Broadway Street. This facility, which opened in 2009, also houses inter-city bus transportation available through Greyhound Lines.

===Freeways===
Akron is served by two major interstate highways that bisect the city. Unlike other cities, the bisection does not occur in the Central Business District, nor do the interstates serve downtown; rather, the Akron Innerbelt and to a lesser extent Ohio State Route 8 serve these functions.
* Interstate 77 connects Marietta and Cleveland, Ohio. In Akron, it has 15 interchanges, four of which permit freeway-to-freeway movements. It runs north–south in the southern part of the city to its intersection with I-76, where it takes a westerly turn as a concurrency with Interstate 76.
* Interstate 76 connects Interstate 71 to Youngstown, Ohio, and farther. It runs east–west and has 18 interchanges in Akron, four of which are freeway-to-freeway. The East Leg was rebuilt in the 1990s to feature six lanes and longer merge lanes. The concurrency with Interstate 77 is eight lanes. The Kenmore Leg is a four-lane leg that is slightly less than two miles (3 km) long and connects to Interstate 277.
* Interstate 277 is an east–west spur that it forms with US 224 after I-76 splits to the north to form the Kenmore Leg. It is six lanes and cosigned with U.S. 224.
* The Akron Innerbelt is a six-lane, spur from the I-76/I-77 concurrency and serves the urban core of the city. Its ramps are directional from the interstates, so it only serves west side drivers. ODOT is considering changing this design to attract more traffic to the route. The freeway comes to an abrupt end near the northern boundary of downtown where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The freeway itself is officially known as &quot;The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Freeway&quot;. The freeway was originally designed to connect directly to State Route 8, but plans were laid to rest in the mid-1970s because of financial troubles.
* Ohio State Route 8 is an original state highway that is a limited access route that connects Akron&#x27;s northern suburbs with Interstates 76 and 77. State Route 8&#x27;s southern terminus is at the central interchange, where it meets I-76 and I-77. The second freeway in Akron to be completed, it went through a major overhaul in 2003 with new ramps and access roads. In 2007 ODOT began a project to upgrade the road to interstate highway standards north of Akron from State Route 303 to I-271, providing a high speed alternative to Cleveland.

==Notable people==
Akron has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields. Its natives and residents are called &quot;Akronites&quot;. The first postmaster of the Connecticut Western Reserve and president of its bank, General Simon Perkins (1771–1844), co-founded Akron in 1825. His son, Colonel Simon Perkins (1805–1877), while living in Akron during the same time as abolitionist John Brown (1800–1859), went into business with Brown. Wendell Willkie, the Republican nominee for president in 1940, worked in Akron as a lawyer for Firestone. Pioneering televangelist Rex Humbard rose to prominence in Akron. Beacon Journal publisher John S. Knight ran the national Knight Newspapers chain from Akron. Broadcaster Hugh Downs was born in Akron. In the mid- to late 1940s, pioneering rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll DJ Alan Freed was musical director at Akron&#x27;s WAKR. Watergate figure John Dean was born in Akron.

Poet Rita Dove was born and grew up in Akron. She went on to become the first African-American United States Poet Laureate. Many of her poems are about or take place in Akron, foremost among them Thomas and Beulah, which earned her the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.

Owner of over 400 patents, native Stanford R. Ovshinsky invented the widely used nickel-metal hydride battery. Richard Smalley, winner of a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering buckminsterfullerene (buckyballs) was born in the city during 1943. Another native, the second U.S. female astronaut in space, Judith Resnik, died in the 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and has the Resnik Moon crater named in her honor.

The Silver Screen, which came to symbolize Hollywood&#x27;s movie entertainment industry, was invented by Kenmore resident and projectionist Harry Coulter Williams. First used in Akron&#x27;s Majestic Theater and then Norka Theater, the &quot;Williams Perlite&quot; tear-proof, vinyl plastic indoor motion picture screen was installed in all the major movie houses, including the rapidly expanding theaters built by Warner Bros. of nearby Youngstown OH. Williams&#x27; unique silver-painted screens were adapted for CinemaScope, VistaVision, and later 3-D movies. They provided a brighter picture at all angles with top reflectivity at direct viewing and extra diffusion for side seats and balconies.

Carol Folt, the 11th chancellor and 29th chief executive, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was born in Akron in 1951. She was previously provost (chief academic officer) and interim president of Dartmouth College. She assumed her duties on July 1, 2013, and is the first woman to lead UNC.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Thomas and Beulah&quot;, a 1986 book of poetry written by native and former Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, Rita Dove, tells the story of her grandmother and grandfather, who separately moved from the South to the city, where they lived through the Great Depression and the rest of their lives. The city is also the setting for the 2005 novel &quot;The Coast of Akron&quot;, by former editor of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Adrienne Miller. To reflect Akron&#x27;s decline during the 1980s, Akron native Chrissie Hynde wrote the 1982 Pretenders song &quot;My City Was Gone&quot;. The Black Keys&#x27; 2004 album title &quot;Rubber Factory&quot; refers to the former General Tire &amp; Rubber Company factory in which it was recorded. Akron serves as a setting in the 2002 first-person-shooter PC platform video game &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot;.

<text>Barberton is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 25,191 at the 2020 census. Located directly southwest of Akron, it is a suburb of the Akron metropolitan area.

== History==
Barberton was founded in 1891 by industrialist O.C. Barber, who planned the town according to his vision of industry, progress and community. In 1894 he moved the manufacturing operations of the Diamond Match Company, which he formed from a merger of 11 companies, from Akron to Barberton. He soon was producing 250 million matches a day. In the valley running parallel to the Tuscarawas River and the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal, he oversaw the construction of factories, residential neighborhoods and a compact commercial downtown. In the center of the new city was Lake Anna, named after Barber&#x27;s only daughter, Anna Laura Barber.

Barberton became known as the &quot;Magic City&quot; because of its rapid population growth during its formative industrial years, at a time of waves of immigration from eastern and southern Europe. In 1891, when Barberton was incorporated, the scattered farms that had originally characterized the landscape were transformed into a fledgling city of 1,800. When an &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; reporter revisited Barberton in 1893, he noted that since 1891, it had grown so quickly that it appeared to have grown by magic (hence its nickname). Many new immigrants were attracted to its industrial jobs, which provided a path to assimilation.

In 1908, on a high hill on the east side of town, Barber began construction of an experimental farm and estate, which he called Anna–Dean Farm. It included his 52-room, French Renaissance Revival-style mansion, completed in 1909, and lush gardens, dozens of barns and other structures in the same style, and greenhouses. Barber built 35 structures for the Anna-Dean Farm, all in the French Renaissance Revival style. The farm covered 3500 acres. Believing farming could be as efficient as an industry, Barber intended the farm to be the basis of an agricultural college, but he did not complete its financing before his death. He willed the farm to Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University). It later sold much of the property.

In May 1939, forty students were injured when a temporary school in the town exploded. News reports at the time indicated three children were not expected to survive. Firefighters suspected an accidental gas leak caused the blast.

Today, five of the eight primary buildings and associated property of the farm complex are owned by the Barberton Historical Society. These buildings are constructed of red brick edged in white concrete block, with royal blue trim and red tile roofing. The most significant of the remaining buildings is Barn No. 1, the former Dairy Barn, restored in 1985 and now the world headquarters of the Yoder Brothers Corporation, horticulturists. The building has castle tower-like silos, visible from much of the east side of the city. The other barns have been structurally stabilized and at least partially restored. All but one may be renovated for other economic uses. The Creamery has been restored as a residence for the same family since 1943 and served as the birthplace for the Apostolic Church of Barberton founded in 1950. After sale by Western Reserve University following World War 2, most of the 40-acre Barber estate was broken up and redeveloped for suburban residential housing. The mansion was demolished in 1965.

&quot;The Magics&quot; became the mascot name of the Barberton High School athletic teams. As Barberton High School colors are purple and white, &quot;purple pride&quot; marks local enthusiasm for the school. The city&#x27;s schools have also improved academic performance since the 1980s.

During the 1980s Barberton suffered a precipitous economic decline due to restructuring in heavy industry and job losses, similar to much of the rest of the industrial American Midwest. It was in many ways representative of a typical Rust Belt city. During this period, the city lost a large part of its economic base as factories shuttered and stores went vacant. &quot;The Magic City: Unemployment in a Working-Class Community&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1989) documents the consequences of the migration of major industries from the region and the responses of residents to such dramatic changes. In 1985, key business stakeholders and government leaders created the Barberton Community Development Corporation (BCDC). The BCDC has facilitated the creation of over 2,000 jobs, and in excess of $100 million in business expansion projects. They have stimulated the creation of three mini-industrial parks and 25 new construction projects.

The Barberton Community Foundation facilitated the construction of a new Barberton High School, located on reclaimed swampland in the northwest section of the city.

<text>Cuyahoga Falls ( or ) is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 51,114. The second-largest city in Summit County, it is located directly north of Akron and is a suburb of the Akron metropolitan area. The city was founded in 1812 by William Wetmore and was originally named Manchester, but renamed for the Cuyahoga River and the series of waterfalls that run along the southern boundary of the city.

== History ==
Cuyahoga Falls was formed in 1812 near the junction of what was then Northampton, Stow, Tallmadge, and Portage townships. The focus was the series of Cuyahoga River waterfalls that provided power for manufacturing.

In 1812, Kelsey and Wilcox built a dam on the Cuyahoga River at a place where a railroad bridge crossed it in 1876. They then built a flour mill, an oil mill, and a saw mill. This led to the construction of a number of houses. This area was known as the old village. Development moved downstream, though, when the power was discovered to be better there. The old village was eventually destroyed in 1826, when a dam built by William Wetmore flooded the dam at the old village and its mills were torn down.

The earliest settlers of Cuyahoga Falls included Joshua Stow and William Wetmore. In 1815, a saw mill was operating near Gaylord&#x27;s Grove, using power generated by a dam on the Cuyahoga River there.

The town was initially called Manchester, but was renamed Cuyahoga Falls at the request of the Post Office since several other Manchesters were already in Ohio.

The village proper was first laid out in 1826 by Judge Richardson.

The town was incorporated in 1836, occupying 240 rods from Stow and Tallmadge townships. In 1853, seeing that the village and township of Cuyahoga Falls occupied the same territory, the village council disbanded and the community was only a township until 1868.

In 1841, the Summit County Board of Commissioners named Cuyahoga Falls the county seat. The state legislature then intervened and put the location of the county seat up to a popular vote. Akron won and has been the county seat ever since. In spite of being named the county seat, Cuyahoga Falls never really functioned as such.

In March 1851, the township of Cuyahoga Falls was created out of the village limits. They covered the same territory, so the village council voted to adjourn &quot;sine die&quot;, letting the village be run under township jurisdiction until June 3, 1868, when the municipal government returned.

In 1939 the first Lawson Convenience Store was established in Cuyahoga Falls.

On July 31, 1940, the Doodlebug Disaster train wreck killed 43 people, the worst disaster in the history of the city.

In 1985, a referendum of merger between the city and neighboring Northampton Township was approved by local voters. In 1986, Cuyahoga Falls merged with Northampton Township, the first merger of a city and township in Ohio.

Cuyahoga Falls had been founded as an industrial city, taking advantage of the river power. By the middle of the twentieth century, it had become largely residential. Don Robart, mayor from 1986 to 2013, promoted the merger with Northampton Township because of the additional land that could be used for development. Parts of that area have since been used for industrial development. Commercial development has also picked up, especially in the Howe Avenue area at the southern border of the city.

The city had one professional sports team, the Cuyahoga Falls Cougars, of the International Basketball League. They moved to Akron in 2006 and became the Akron Cougars.

The Cathedral of Tomorrow, founded by televangelist Rex Humbard in 1958, was in Cuyahoga Falls. It is now the church of pastor/evangelist Ernest Angley and was renamed Grace Cathedral.

Blossom Music Center, an outdoor concert venue and the summer home of the Cleveland Orchestra since 1968, is situated on 800 acres of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Cuyahoga Falls.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Cuyahoga Falls is bordered by Akron to the south and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to the northwest.

==Demographics==
Cuyahoga Falls is part of the Akron, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area and of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton Combined Statistical Area.

Cuyahoga Falls is mainly served by two school districts. The original area of the city makes up nearly all of the Cuyahoga Falls City School District; its high school, Cuyahoga Falls High School, is located on Fourth Street in downtown. The neighboring village of Silver Lake is also part of Cuyahoga Falls City Schools.

The northwest portion of the city (the former Northampton Township) is served by the Woodridge Local School District, which also serves the portions of Akron that lie within the former Northampton Township boundaries, as well as most of Boston Township (including Peninsula). That district&#x27;s high school, Woodridge High School, is also located in Cuyahoga Falls (albeit with a Peninsula mailing address); this makes Cuyahoga Falls one of the few communities in Ohio that is home to the sole high school for two separate school districts.

A small area in the northeast of the city is zoned to Hudson City School District, and another small area, in the far northwest of the city, is part of the Revere Local School District.

<text>Green is a city in southeastern Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 27,475 at the 2020 census. It is a suburban community between Akron and Canton and is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

==History==
Green Township was first created in 1809 as part of Stark County. Green Township became part of Summit County after that county&#x27;s establishment in 1840. Green had several unincorporated hamlets, most notably Greensburg. By 1900, five unincorporated settlements were in Green Township, surrounded by farmlands with valuable crops and areas of coal. The local economy transitioned from farming to business and manufacturing. By 1950, farmers began to sell their lands to developers for residential housing. The increased development in the community led to discussions about becoming a city. Voters approved the merger of the village with the rest of the township in 1991. In the beginning of 1991, Green Township was incorporated as the Village of Green. The village was declared a city in 1992, with the first city mayor being John Torok.

The City of Green is also notable for its legal battle against the NEXUS Pipeline, which runs close to residential neighborhoods, endangered wetlands, and the Comet Lake Dam. Construction began in 2018 after a settlement of $7.5 million was reached with the city&#x27;s government.

===Flag===
The flag of Green was created as a result of a contest targeted towards school-age residents; due to similar design, there was a tie between two creators, Matt Pitzo and Justin Callahan. The motto for the city was created by Carrie West: &quot;A township from the past, a city of the future.&quot; The flag can be viewed at the Central Administration Building (CAB), Boettler Park, and Akron General, all of which are along Massillon Road.

=== Roundabouts ===
In 2009, the city opened the first two-lane roundabout in Summit County at the intersection of State Route 241 and Steese Road. As of 2024, there are 11 roundabouts in the city, notably six running along SR-241.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Post office===

<text>Hudson is a city in northern Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 23,110 at the 2020 census. It is a suburban community in the Akron metropolitan area. John Brown made his first public vow to destroy slavery here and the city later became part of the Underground Railroad. The Village of Hudson and Hudson Township were formerly two separate governing entities that merged in 1994.

==History==

The city is named after its founder, David Hudson, who settled there from Goshen, Connecticut, in 1799, when it was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The village of Hudson, located in the center of Hudson Township, was incorporated in 1837. In Hudson, David Hudson built the first log house in Summit County, Ohio. There is a marker at the intersection of Baldwin Street and North Main Street (Ohio State Route 91), on the right when traveling east on Baldwin Street. The marker is embedded in the west face of the boulder.

Hudson, which had a distinctly New England character from its early settlers, was the home of Western Reserve College and Preparatory School, founded in 1826 by David Hudson among others. It was spoken of as the &quot;Yale of the West&quot;. The college moved to Cleveland in 1882 and later, as Western Reserve University, merged with the Case Institute of Technology to form the modern Case Western Reserve University. The Yale-inspired red brick buildings are now the Western Reserve Academy. The Loomis Observatory was built in 1838 and is the oldest observatory in the U.S. still in its original location.

The Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad began service to Hudson in 1852. In 1861, President-elect Abraham Lincoln spoke to about 6,000 people for 2 to 3 minutes from the last train car at the old Hudson Depot, near the south end of College Street. The railroad ended passenger service at Hudson in 1965. A former train station (built in the 1910s) that was located near the intersection of West Streetsboro and Library Streets was demolished in 2013.

East of Morse Road, there is an unfinished Clinton Air Line Railroad bridge (over Hurricane Creek near the power line from Morse Road to W. Prescott Road).

There was a fire on the west side of Hudson&#x27;s Main Street in 1892. The fire destroyed the buildings between Park Lane and Clinton Street. A. W. Lockhart&#x27;s saloon and the Mansion House [Hotel] burned. The Hudson-born Pennsylvania coal mine owner James Ellsworth assisted in the rebuilding of Main Street after the street had been destroyed by fire in 1903. Ellsworth also refinanced the bankrupt Western Reserve Academy, housed on the former campus of Western Reserve College, which had been closed from 1903 until 1916.

In 1882, Gustave H. Grimm established the G.H. Grimm Manufacturing Company to build and sell corrugated tin-pan evaporators for use in maple syrup production. That area, now called &quot;The Evaporator Works&quot;, is on the south of Ravenna Street and just east of Ohio Route 91.

The Hudson Clock Tower was built in 1912 by James Ellsworth who was born in Hudson in 1849. The original clock movement was supplied by the E. Howard Clock Company of Boston. The energy from 3000-pound weights powered the movement of the clocks and Westminster chimes. The town marshall was responsible for entering the tower every few days and winding (lifting) the weights.

Lincoln Ellsworth was the son of James Ellsworth. Lincoln Ellsworth is the only Hudsonite on a U.S. postage stamp. The Ellsworth Mountains are named after Lincoln Ellsworth. Lincoln was born in Chicago and lived in Hudson when he was a child. Lincoln was awarded two Congressional Gold Medals.

From 1957 until the late 1980s, General Motors had a factory of almost one thousand workers in Hudson that built crawler tractor earth-moving equipment. The factory was beside and east of Ohio State Route 91 and it was south of Terex Road. The original 1958 factory had 660,000 square feet. In 1961, GM added 340,000 square feet for a total of 1 million square feet of factory. In 1970, GM renamed their earth-moving equipment division as Terex. Currently Jo-Ann Stores uses most of the former GM factory. Hudson had an airport from mid-1920s until 1957, known as the Hudson Mid-City Airport, near the former General Motors Euclid Division.

On November 28, 1973, a large area of the village, &quot;roughly bounded by College, Streetsboro, S. Main, and Baldwin&quot; streets, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hudson Historic District. The historic district was expanded on October 10, 1989, to also include the area &quot;roughly bounded by Hudson St., Old Orchard Dr., Aurora St., Oviatt St., Streetsboro St., and College St. to Aurora (street)&quot;. In addition to the Hudson Historic District, there are several additional properties in Hudson listed on the Register. The City of Hudson came about in 1994 when voters approved the merger of Hudson Township and Hudson Village, which had previously been two separate governing entities.

In July 2003, Hudson received over of rain from three storm events within 24 hours. Hudson had flood damage within all its three watersheds ... Mud Brook, Brandywine Creek and Tinker&#x27;s Creek. The Brandywine Creek Watershed experienced the most flood damage in 2003. Two men drowned in an underground parking garage of a condominium complex on July 21, 2003. State Routes 91 and 303 flooded where the highways dip low to pass under the train tracks and the highways were closed by 7:40 PM on July 21.

===Morse Controls===
John F. Morse, Jr. establish the Morse Instrument Company, later renamed Morse Controls, in Hudson. The company manufactured aviation, automotive, and maritime devices, and by 1969, employed over 600 individuals, with annual sales of $12 million. The plant closed in 2020.

===An abolitionist center===
Ohio&#x27;s Western Reserve &quot;was probably the most intensely antislavery section of the country&quot;. Hudson, with the Reserve&#x27;s first college, was for a time its intellectual capital. The founders of Hudson were abolitionists, although founder David Hudson favored the soon-to-be-discarded strategy of &quot;colonization&quot;: sending free Blacks &quot;back to Africa&quot;. Another founder, Owen Brown, father of John Brown, also from Connecticut, was a fervent abolitionist. The latter, who arguably did more to end slavery in the United States than any other person, grew up and was educated in Hudson from 1805 to 1825. There is a marker at the site of his family&#x27;s home, at the intersection of Ravenna and South Main Streets.

There is also a historical marker at the location of the first meetinghouse of the First Congregational Church, at East Main and Church Streets, reading: &quot;In August, 1835, church members unanimously adopted a resolution declaring that slavery is &#x27;a direct violation of the law of Almighty God.&#x27; At a November 1837 prayer meeting, church member and anti-slavery leader John Brown made his first public vow to destroy slavery.&quot;

Thousands of fugitive slaves, heading for freedom in Canada, passed through Hudson; it was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Owen Brown was very active in assisting the fugitives. As of 2019, 21 locations in and around Hudson associated with the Underground Railroad have been identified. and in 1992 there appeared a book by James Caccamo, &quot;Hudson and the Underground Railroad&quot;.

Hudson&#x27;s period of anti-slavery leadership ended in the early 1830s. Beriah Green, the lone professor of theology at the college, was influenced by William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s new newspaper, &quot;The Liberator,&quot; and his &quot;Thoughts on African Colonization&quot;. He preached four fiery anti-slavery sermons, which so inflamed the college that nothing else was being discussed, the president said, and the town was torn apart. Green, expecting to be fired, left to become president of the Oneida Institute, on condition Blacks be admitted on the same terms as whites. Oneida, near Utica, New York, replaced Hudson as the nation&#x27;s leading abolitionist center.

===Retail===
*Most of Hudson&#x27;s retail outlets are located in concentrated areas. Most notable are the two downtown blocks of historic buildings located on North Main Street. The original center of business in Hudson, the stores and offices located &quot;downtown&quot; still stand today in continued commercial use.
*In 1962, the first part of the Hudson Plaza shopping center opened on West Streetsboro Street. It has always been anchored by the Acme grocery store, which moved there from its former location on North Main Street. Expansions of the plaza continued through the 1990s. A unique McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, resembling a house, opened in 1985. The original building, housing Acme, was extensively renovated in 2000.
*2004 marked the opening of First &amp; Main, a mixed-use development just west of North Main Street. The Hudson Library &amp; Historical Society relocated there in 2005.

==Parks and recreation==
The Hudson Park Board oversees more than one thousand acres (4 km2) of parkland in the city. The most prominent property is Hudson Springs Park, which has a 50-acre lake open to kayaks, canoes and small motorized boats. Boat storage is available to residents only for an annual fee. The lake is stocked with fish and encircled by walking trails based around a 1.8 mile loop that ventures into the woods that stretch along a large portion of the lake. The park also has a disc golf course, docks, sand volleyball pit and permanent corn-hole boards (bring your own bean bags). Cascade Park, Barlow Farm Park, and Colony Park are large neighborhood parks used for sports and general family recreation. Other properties, such as Doc&#x27;s Woods, MacLaren Woods, Trumbull Woods, and Bicentennial Woods, are kept as forested nature preserves. The first Hudson Park, Wildlife Woods, is actually located west of the city in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

Ohio&#x27;s State Route 303, State Route 91, and State Route 8 pass through Hudson. Interstate 480 cuts through the extreme northeast corner of the city, and Interstate 80, the Ohio Turnpike, bisects the city from west to east.

Hudson, unlike many surrounding communities, has retained two-lane roadways in much of its downtown. This has helped preserve the open spaces, historical buildings, and trees that the city values. Much of Hudson is accessible by foot or bike. Hudson was recognized as a Bike Friendly America Bronze City in 2016, and connectivity has improved through successive iterations of what&#x27;s now known as the Walk &amp; Bike plan.

Downtown is serviced by Metro RTA Bus Route 32, while the Park-and-Ride along Route 8 is serviced by Route 31. The Cleveland Line (Norfolk Southern) runs from Rochester, Pennsylvania to Cleveland, Ohio going through locations such as Ravenna, Hudson, and Maple Heights. There is a spur rail line for local freight from Little Tikes.

===Healthcare===
The University Hospitals Hudson Health Center, affiliated with University Hospitals of Cleveland, offers primary and specialty care services, laboratory and general diagnostic radiology services. Also located at this facility are outpatient rehabilitation services.

=== Public Safety ===

==== Fire Department ====
The City of Hudson is protected by a combination volunteer and full-time fire department. Hudson Fire holds the title to many firsts in Summit County. The department was founded in 1849, the first volunteer fire department in Summit County, and celebrated its 175th Anniversary in 2024. Prior to 1886, Hudson Fire was one of two fire departments in all of Summit County, and was the first department in the county to be mechanized, purchasing a hand-powered, horse-drawn pumper in 1859. Unlike most other departments in the area, the Hudson Fire Department does not provide Emergency Medical Services, this service is provided by Hudson EMS, a separate, third-service department, similar to the City of Cleveland. This model provides the benefit of allowing EMS and Fire resources to operate independently; units responding to EMS calls have no negative effect on Fire Department staffing or response, and Fire unit deployment does not deplete EMS resources. Hudson Fire utilizes a primarily on-call response model, where part-time firefighters respond to the station in their personal vehicles before deploying to the scene of an emergency. In 2024, the City of Hudson hired a consultant to review Fire/EMS staffing and facility needs and make recommendations for future operations. 

==== Emergency Medical Service ====
Prior to 1977, emergency ambulance service was not available locally in Hudson, requiring a response from Akron instead. After the Police and Fire Departments expressed little interest or ability to aid in the creation of an ambulance service, several women in the area collaborated on the idea that led to the foundation of Hudson Volunteer Medical Service in 1977. In the beginning, volunteer EMTs fielded calls from a single station in the center of town. Unlike the Fire Department, EMS staffing has always been around-the-clock, with at least one crew on station 24/7. As of 2024, Hudson EMS remains a volunteer department, staffed by volunteer EMTs and supported by career and part-time Paramedics. 

==== Police ====
As of January 2025, the Hudson Police Department employs 32 full-time police officers and also operates the City of Hudson&#x27;s 911 call center. Hudson Police dispatchers take 911 calls for Hudson and parts of Twinsburg Township, Boston Heights, Boston Township, and the Village of Peninsula. The dispatch center handles calls and dispatching for all Police, Fire, and EMS units as well as Valley Fire District. In addition to patrol and detective service, the Hudson Police Department also provides School Resource Officers to the local schools, as well as numerous community services such as Safety Town, prescription medication disposal, a vacation watch program, and the SAFER Hudson program for senior citizens. The current Police Chief is Perry Tabak.

<text>Munroe Falls is a city in east-central Summit County, Ohio, United States, along the Cuyahoga River. The population was 5,044 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Akron and is part of the Akron metropolitan area.

== History ==
Like much of the Connecticut Western Reserve, the area that makes up present-day Munroe Falls was previously inhabited by various tribes of American Indians. When the Western Reserve began being surveyed in 1796, what is now Munroe Falls was mostly in the southern part of the survey township Town 3, Range 10 (later to be Stow Township), then a part of Washington County before being placed in the new Jefferson County the following year. In 1800, it was made part of Trumbull County, which followed the boundaries of the Western Reserve, and in 1808, the area was made part of Portage County. The first settlers in present-day Munroe Falls, a group of around 40 people including Francis Kelsey and William Stow, came in 1809. William Stow built a log house to serve as his residence at what is now the northwest corner of Ohio State Route 91 and Munroe Falls Avenue. Kelsey built a sawmill on the south side of the Cuyahoga River and a gristmill was built on the north side. The initial name of the new village was Kelsey&#x27;s Mills (also Kelsey Mills). The first school in Munroe Falls was built in 1816. In 1817 a wooden dam was built to provide power for both mills and the name of the village was changed to Florence. Around 1836, William and Edmund Munroe (also spelled Monroe) from Boston arrived and purchased the two mills and approximately of land around them to lay out a new village, which they named Munroe Falls. The village was incorporated October 26, 1838. The Munroes had great plans for the village to become a center of commerce and an important city, but these plans never worked out. The &quot;Munroe Falls Manufacturing Co.&quot; was granted a charter by the Ohio Legislature in April 1837 in order to cultivate and manufacture cotton, flour, paper, silk, sugar and wool, including machinery and tools towards these purposes. The keys to their plans were to found a silk industry, which involved cultivating mulberry trees and silkworms. The trees thrived, the worms did not. Shortly after its founding the Munroe Falls Manufacturing Co. founded a bank, which issued various, unbacked currency. For the next few years the local economy thrived under the nearly unlimited credit afforded to its customers by the Company and its Bank, but ultimately the macroeconomics of the period prevailed, and both the Company and Bank failed, leaving many local residents holding worthless currency. After about 10 years, which included the economic instability of the Panic of 1837, the Munroes, who had arrived wealthy, defaulted to many of the creditors and the properties they owned were taken over by other individuals.

The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal opened in 1840 and passed through Munroe Falls, the first boats landing on August 6 of that year arriving from New Castle, Pennsylvania. It closed around 1870. Also in 1840, Munroe Falls was made part of the new Summit County. In 1866, the old gristmill was purchased by the Cleveland Paper Company and refitted for paper manufacturing. The building burned down approximately 1–2 years later and the present factory - today owned by Sonoco Products - was built on the same site. In 1884 railroad tracks were laid in the former canal bed as part of a single line owned by the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad. These tracks were doubled in 1900 following the purchase of the railroad by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

In 1921 the community applied for and was granted village status. This action was taken in order to avoid becoming a part of neighboring Stow, which was applying for similar status and had included sections of Munroe Falls in its application. Finding that as a village there was not enough population to maintain self-sufficiency, the village held city officer elections for the first time in 1925 in order to revoke the village charter and receive county services.

The village got a new town hall in the 1960s. This building, which continues to serve as City Hall, was constructed in 1885 to serve as the Munroe Falls Schoolhouse, serving its original purpose until 1916.

Munroe Falls converted to city status in 1991.

In the early 2000s, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Summit County determined that the oxygen levels were too low in the Cuyahoga River, due mostly to the stagnant pool behind the Munroe Falls dam. The solution was to lower the dam, which dated to 1903. Eventually, the entire dam was removed after workers discovered a natural ledge underneath the existing dam. This project, begun in August 2005 and completed in October 2006, was part of a larger project along much of the river in the city that included cleanup and restoration.

Munroe Falls is also home to SGS Tool Company, the worlds’ largest manufacturer of round solid carbide cutting tools. SGS Tool Company&#x27;s corporate headquarters and R&amp;D centers are located in Munroe Falls, while their manufacturing operations are located in Cuyahoga Falls. SGS is the largest employer in Munroe Falls, and is the largest percentage of the corporate tax base.

<text>Peninsula is a village in northern Summit County, Ohio, United States, along the Cuyahoga River. The population was 536 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Akron metropolitan area. Peninsula is located in the middle of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The Boston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resorts are located near Peninsula.

==History==
Peninsula was first settled in 1818 and was plotted in 1837 by Herman Bronson. It was a canal boat stop and home to several mills, stone quarries and boat yards, five hotels and 14 bars until 1887. 

More than 20 places in Peninsula are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dominant Greek Revival architecture reflects popular tastes amongst settlers to the Connecticut Western Reserve from New England. The Gothic Revival Bronson Memorial Church, originally constructed in 1835 as the Bethel Church, according to William Perrin&#x27;s History of Summit County (1881) was an attempt to “introduce moral and religious tactics among the vicious and unlawful practices of the canal boatmen.” In 1889, the church was remodeled in the Gothic Revival style. 

A notable high style example of the village&#x27;s Greek Revival architecture is the 1824 Bronson House, built of locally quarried sandstone blocks. Several canal-era houses are typical of the popular Western Reserve New England building type called the Upright-and-Wing, particularly suitable for the early 19th-century Ohio frontier. 

Other architectural styles include Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Stick and Colonial Revival. The 1886 Stick-style Boston Township Hall originally functioned as the village high school. The three-story hip-roofed building contains a pyramidal roof tower with an open belfry. The Township Hall is now the Cuyahoga Valley Historical Museum.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Boston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort just north of Peninsula is one of the few skiing locations in Ohio. Peninsula is bordered on the east by Boston Heights. It is a part of Boston Township.

<text>Stow is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States. The population was 34,483 at the 2020 census. It is a suburban community within the Akron metropolitan area.

==History==

Stow is named for Joshua Stow, its original proprietor. Joshua Stow was a member of the party led by Moses Cleaveland to survey the lands of the Connecticut Western Reserve around present-day Cleveland in 1796. He was a native of Middletown, Connecticut, however, and never lived in Stow, though he spent both time and money developing the township and is quoted as saying it was &quot;one of the prettiest and most romantic spots in the Western Reserve.&quot; The land that would eventually be known as Stow Township was the survey township &quot;Town 3, Range 10&quot; of the Western Reserve and was initially . It was purchased by Joshua Stow for $14,154. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area around what is now Stow was inhabited by a tribe of Seneca Native Americans at a small settlement in the area that is now part of the neighboring village of Silver Lake.

The first settler in Stow Township was William Walker, who arrived in 1802. Walker built a cabin just south of the land of his father Robert in Hudson Township mistakenly believing he was building in Hudson. In 1804, when Stow Township was separated from Hudson Township and surveyed into lots by Joseph Darrow, it was discovered his house was actually in Stow Township. Walker purchased the lot his home was on and continued to live there. Darrow had been hired by Joshua Stow&#x27;s land agent William Wetmore, a settler also from Middletown, Connecticut, who moved to Stow in 1804 with his family and several other settlers. The Wetmores built a cabin in July 1804 near the center of Stow Township and the present-day intersection of Darrow Road and Kent Road. In 1808, the Wetmores built a home near the Seneca settlement in what is now Silver Lake. The house overlooked a small lake, known as Silver Lake since 1874, that was known earlier as Wetmore Pond or Stow Lake. Stow Township was formally organized in 1808 with the first election held in 1811. 1808 was also the year it was made part of the original Portage County. It remained as part of Portage County until it was included in the new Summit County in 1840.

Most of the original township is part of the present city of Stow, but parts of the original township form all or part of three neighboring communities. Munroe Falls was settled in 1809 as &quot;Kelsey Mills&quot; in the southern part of Stow Township and incorporated as a village in 1838. Cuyahoga Falls was developed on land owned by Wetmore and Joshua Stow beginning in 1825 in the southwestern part of the township and became a town in 1837. In 1851, Cuyahoga Falls Township was created, taking the southwest corner of Stow Township along with parts of three neighboring townships. Cuyahoga Falls incorporated as a village in 1868 and later annexed additional portions of Stow Township in the 19th and 20th centuries, as did Munroe Falls. Silver Lake incorporated as a village in 1918 on land that had previously been part of Stow Township. The remainder of Stow Township incorporated in 1957 as a village and became a city following the 1960 United States Census.

Many of the early settlers were farmers from New Jersey who cleared the forested area for crop production. A post office called Hubbard was established in 1826. Until 1861, Hubbard was a relatively small town, but the development of the local coal and iron industries rapidly developed the town over the decade.

<doc id="129873" wikidata="Q1810800" url="?curid=129873" title="Leavittsburg, Ohio">
<text>Leavittsburg ( ) is a census-designated place in Trumbull County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,571 at the 2020 census. Located directly west of Warren, Ohio, it is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==
Leavittsburg is named for the Leavitt family of Suffield, Connecticut, a prominent early mercantile New England family originally from Hingham, Massachusetts. Thaddeus Leavitt Esq. was one of the eight original purchasers of the Western Reserve lands from the state of Connecticut. (Leavitt and Suffield businessmen Oliver Phelps, Gideon Granger, Luther Loomis and Asahel Hatheway owned between them one-quarter of all the lands in the Western Reserve assigned to Connecticut.) Leavitt was married to Elizabeth King, the daughter of William King and Lucy (Hatheway), two prominent Suffield families. Leavitt had a fleet of ships that traded as far afield as the British West Indies and was a selectman for the town of Suffield. He was also the inventor of an early cotton gin.

Humphrey H. Leavitt, a U.S. congressman from Ohio born in Suffield, was a member of this family, as was John Leavitt, the owner of the first inn in Warren. Another member of the extended family was Henry Leavitt Ellsworth who traveled to Ohio in 1811 to investigate family lands in the region. (Ellsworth&#x27;s father Oliver Ellsworth had purchased over in the Western Reserve, including most of present-day Cleveland.) The resulting volume was entitled &quot;A Tour to New Connecticut in 1811&quot;, and was published later after the manuscript was discovered in the Yale University library. A young Yale graduate of 19 when he made his first trip to New Connecticut (Ohio), Ellsworth went on to make several more trips to the west. Author Washington Irving accompanied Ellsworth on a subsequent trip over 20 years later, calling his journal &quot;A Tour on the Prairies&quot;.

A post office with the name Leavittsburgh was established March 15, 1864; the spelling was amended to Leavittsburg with effect from July 19, 1893. Leavittsburg was designated as the market town of Trumbull County, but Warren supplanted Leavittsburg, which remains mostly woodland.

<text>Newton Falls is a village in southwestern Trumbull County, Ohio, United States. The population was 4,557 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area. The city takes its name from the two sets of waterfalls within the village, each on different branches of the Mahoning River. The city is known for its notable ZIP code (44444) and for its covered bridge, which is the second oldest in the state of Ohio.

==History==
It is believed that early property owners of Newton Township spent time in Newtown, Connecticut before departing for the Ohio Country and that the name Newton may be a corruption of Newtown. The village&#x27;s name stems from its location on the falls on the Mahoning River. It grew in to a home of the steel manufacturing industry, as did much of the region, aided by its location along the river and the proximity of the nearby Ravenna Training and Logistics Site.

On May 31, 1985, an F5 tornado struck the city as part of the 1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak, a deadly series of tornadoes that swept through Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ontario. The tornado that hit Newton Falls was the only F5 in Ohio that day, and damaged most of the downtown, destroying many homes and businesses, and damaging the senior and junior high schools (it destroyed the gymnasium and rendered the junior high unusable). There were between 70 and 80 injuries, and 400 families were left homeless. The Ohio Army National Guard credited warning sirens for the lack of fatalities. A monument was erected in 2022 memorializing the devastation. It is situated at the corner of Broad and Center Streets. 

On July 6, 2012, the city was shaken by a shooting rampage in the East River Gardens apartment complex. Robert Brazzon murdered four people, including a 15-year-old boy, before taking his own life in a city cemetery.

===Covered Bridge===

Newton Falls is home to the early 19th-century Newton Falls covered bridge, which was constructed over the Mahoning River in 1831. A walkway was added to the side of the bridge in 1921–1922. In 1985 the bridge was repaired after being damaged by the Niles/Wheatland tornado. In December 2007 the bridge was reopened after a two-year restoration funded by government grants. In July 2009 a delivery truck damaged the bridge and rendered it out of service until repairs could be made. It reopened in 2010. The Newton Falls bridge is considered the second oldest existing covered bridge in Ohio, the oldest covered bridge in use on its original site, the only covered bridge in the state with a covered crosswalk, and the last surviving covered bridge in Trumbull County. Built on the Town Lattice truss plan, the bridge is 123 feet long and twenty-four feet wide. It has a clear span of 101 1/2 feet and a sixteen-foot-wide roadway.

<doc id="129879" wikidata="Q548790" url="?curid=129879" title="Niles, Ohio">
<text>Niles is a city in southern Trumbull County, Ohio, United States. The population was 18,443 at the 2020 census. Located at the confluence of the Mahoning River and Mosquito Creek, Niles is a suburb in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

Niles is best known as the birthplace of William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States. Located in the nation&#x27;s former industrial belt, the city&#x27;s economy focused initially on iron manufacturing but later diversified to include steel and glass production. After the decline of heavy industry in the region in the 1970s, Niles became a retail hub for the northern Mahoning Valley, with development centered around the Eastwood Mall complex and along the U.S. Route 422 corridor. The Mahoning Valley Scrappers baseball team plays at Eastwood Field in Niles.

==History==
Niles was founded in 1806 by James Heaton, who owned one of the first iron-ore processing plants in Ohio. The town originally went by the name of Heaton&#x27;s Furnace but was later renamed Nilestown, after Hezekiah Niles (editor of the &quot;Niles Register&quot;, a Baltimore newspaper). In 1843, the name was shortened to Niles. In the early 19th century, Heaton built a forge and, later, a charcoal blast furnace in the area just east of what is now the city&#x27;s central park, on the west side of Mosquito Creek. Heaton is credited with producing the first bar iron in Ohio.

Niles&#x27; iron industry thrived until the late 19th century, when the economic depression of 1873 brought about the closure of the community&#x27;s largest industrial firm, James Ward and Company. Plans to restore the local iron industry floundered because of the exorbitant cost of modernizing outdated mills. By the early 1900s, however, Niles was the site of companies including Ohio Galvanizing, Sykes Metal, the Niles Glass Works of the General Electric Company, and the Niles Iron and Steel Roofing Company. Between 1900 and 1920, the city&#x27;s population swelled from 7,468 to slightly over 13,000. The community&#x27;s efforts to rebuild its industry suffered a temporary setback in the 1910s. Niles was one of many cities affected by statewide floods that struck in the spring of 1913. On Easter Sunday, March 23, 1913, heavy rain throughout Ohio, combined with ice and snow that was still on the ground, precipitated massive flooding. Flooding of the Mahoning River left extensive damage and numerous casualties in Niles. Damage exceeded $3 million, and 428 people were confirmed dead.
Throughout much of the late 19th and 20th century, Niles was known to most Ohioans as the birthplace of William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States. McKinley was born in Niles on January 29, 1843. He attended Niles High School (and the city&#x27;s high school would eventually be renamed Niles McKinley High School, though McKinley eventually graduated from high school in Poland, Ohio). President McKinley&#x27;s assassination in 1901 shocked the nation and particularly saddened residents of northeastern Ohio. In 1915, Youngstown industrialist Joseph G. Butler, Jr., a childhood friend of President McKinley, campaigned for the construction of the National McKinley Birthplace Memorial in downtown Niles. The facility currently houses the community&#x27;s library as well as a small museum.

Niles&#x27; location in the Mahoning Valley, a center of steel production, ensured that the community would become a destination for immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe in the early 20th century. Dramatic demographic change fueled ethnic and religious tension throughout the northern United States following World War I, and Niles proved to be no exception to this trend. In the 1920s, regional chapters of the Ku Klux Klan targeted Niles because of its large Catholic population. The Klan marched through the center of Niles in May 1924, and attempted another march in June of the same year. When violence forced the Klan to cancel the second march, the event was rescheduled for November 1, 1924. The local mayor&#x27;s ultimate decision to issue the Klan a permit for the march outraged many of the community&#x27;s Italian- and Irish-American residents.

In response to the scheduled Klan march, an anti-Klan organization, the Knights of the Flaming Circle, pledged to hold their own parade of 10,000 participants on the same day. On October 29, the mayor&#x27;s house was bombed, due to his refusal to revoke the permit. Tensions escalated from this point on, and the city gained national attention due to the impending marches. Despite the city&#x27;s pleas for assistance from the militia, they were denied. The result was 18 hours of full-blown rioting. Control was brought to the town, requiring 10 days of martial law. Between the Klan and anti-Klan participants, 104 people were indicted.

Niles&#x27; economy was undermined in the 1970s, when the Mahoning Valley&#x27;s steel industry – already in decline – collapsed. Amid the economic challenges that followed, the community faced another natural catastrophe.

=== 1985 tornado ===

On May 31, 1985, the city of Niles was struck by an F5 tornado that had its origins just west of Newton Falls, where it destroyed much of that town. The tornado then moved through Lordstown and Warren, before wreaking havoc on Niles, where it flattened a roller skating rink and shopping mall. The tornado also leveled dozens of houses, ripped through the city&#x27;s historic Union Cemetery, injured many people, and took several lives. As it progressed toward Pennsylvania, the tornado never left the ground. In the Niles area alone, nine people were killed, and 250 were injured. Nearly 70 homes were leveled and another 65 to 70 were severely damaged. In the Mahoning and Shenango valleys a total of 25 people died and 500 people were injured, and there was $140 million in property damage. A large figure of a gorilla (an advertising tool for a now-defunct ceramic store) is all that remained standing in one district affected by the tornado. The tornado of 1985 took a path through Niles that was almost identical to that of a tornado that struck in 1947.

==Demographics==

Niles is known for its ethnic diversity, and the community hosts a large Italian-American community. The local center of Italian-American culture and tradition is Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church. The church&#x27;s annual celebration of the feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel during July is considered one of Ohio&#x27;s noteworthy Italian-American festivals.

<text>Vienna Center (, sometimes simply Vienna) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in central Vienna Township, Trumbull County, Ohio, United States. The population was 622 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area.

==History==
Vienna Township was established in the Connecticut Western Reserve. Under the direction of the Connecticut Land Company, this twenty-five-mile-square parcel, initially known as Township 4, Range 2, was surveyed in 1798. The Township&#x27;s original proprietors were Uriel Holmes, Jr., Ephraim Root, and Timothy Burr. The Connecticut Missionary Society sent 148 trained ministers to the Connecticut Western Reserve, served by the reverends Joseph Badger, Thomas Robbins, and Nathan Bailey Derrow. In 1805, Robbins established Vienna&#x27;s Congregational Church, which would adopt Presbyterianism in 1854, one of the earliest churches in the state. Connecticut surrendered its sovereignty of the Western Reserve in 1800, and the land was absorbed into the Northwest Territory and as part of Ohio when that state entered the Union in 1803.

On June 20, 1810, a township green was established in what would be called Vienna Center. Eight acres on the northwest corner of Vienna Center was purchased from proprietors Uriel Holmes and Ephraim Root by the Presbyterian Society (an ecclesiastical society formed for the purposes of non-theological business of the Vienna Presbyterian Church) for $20.00. Upon this green now stands Vienna Presbyterian Church, Vienna Methodist Church, the Copper Penny Masonic Lodge (built as the two-story Vienna School Number 1), the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, and the Bicentennial Gazebo. This parcel also contains Vienna Township Cemetery. One of the earliest buildings, constructed on the green in 1825, was used for church services and Township meetings and housed Vienna Academy, an early &quot;English School&quot; for boys. The building was moved in the early twentieth century to its current site on Youngstown-Kingsville Road north of Vienna Center. It serves as Vienna Township Hall.

Settlement in the Township and the Western Reserve was slow until after the War of 1812. Though primarily agricultural, Vienna Township was the home to a number of clock making factories established between 1812 and the 1830s, a frontier extension of one of Connecticut&#x27;s signal industries. Vienna&#x27;s clock makers, including brothers Lambert W. and Thomas Lewis, Phineas Deming, Joel J. Hummason, Jr., John C. McMaster, Ansel Merrell, and Abel Tyler, manufactured tall case and shelf wooden-work clocks, using water power supplied by the Township&#x27;s streams and creeks. 

An economic boom began in 1866, when the first coal mine was opened by businessman Ira B. Mackey, Jr. Vienna was inundated with men seeking work in some 20 mines opened over the next 20 years. The built environment of Vienna Center (also called Vienna Village) changed with the construction of 32 saloons, bar-rooms, and billiard parlors. Some Vienna residents responded by establishing temperance societies. Tensard Mackey (Ira B. Mackey&#x27;s brother) operated a temperance hotel on the northeast corner of Vienna Center; this building stood until 1966. Temperance reform nationwide was the work of women, and in 1880 Vienna&#x27;s temperance societies petitioned the state to allow women to vote on local issues.

Another outcome of Vienna&#x27;s coal mining was the creation of Ohio&#x27;s first mining safety law in 1874. Future State Inspector of Mines Andrew Roy was a member of a team appointed by the Ohio General Assembly to investigate and report on the working conditions of miners throughout the state. The team visited the Vienna Coal Company&#x27;s mine in August 1871. Roy included in his section of the report what he saw in Vienna.

The Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport, one of the last Works Progress Administration projects, and the Youngstown-Warren Air Reserve Station were constructed near the community in 1939 and the 1950s.

<text>Warren is a city in and the county seat of Trumbull County, Ohio, United States. Located along the Mahoning River, Warren lies approximately northwest of Youngstown and southeast of Cleveland. The population was 39,201 at the 2020 census. The historical county seat of the Connecticut Western Reserve, it is the third largest municipality in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area after Youngstown and Boardman, and anchors the northern part of that area.

==History==

Ephraim Quinby founded Warren in 1798, on of land that he purchased from the Connecticut Land Company, as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. Quinby named the town for the town&#x27;s surveyor, Moses Warren. The town was the county seat of the Western Reserve, then became the Trumbull County seat in 1801. In 1833, Warren contained county buildings, two printing offices, a bank, five mercantile stores, and about 600 inhabitants.

Warren had a population of nearly 1,600 people in 1846. In that same year, the town had five churches, twenty stores, three newspaper offices, one bank, one wool factory and two flourmills. In June 1846, a fire destroyed several buildings on one side of the town square, but residents soon replaced them with new stores and other businesses. Warren became an important center of trade for farmers living in the surrounding countryside during this period. Songwriter Stephen Foster, his wife Jane McDowell, and their daughter Marion lived briefly in Warren.

During the latter decades of the nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth century, Warren remained an important trading and manufacturing center. By 1888, four railroads connected the community with other parts of Ohio. In that same year, there were five newspaper offices, seven churches, three banks and numerous manufacturing firms in Warren. The businesses manufactured a wide variety of products including linseed oil, furniture, barrel staves, wool fabric, blinds, incandescent bulbs, automobiles and carriages; however, the leading companies were the Packard Electric Company and Packard Motor Car Company, both founded in the 1890s in Warren by brothers James Ward Packard and William Doud Packard. Warren was the first town in the U.S. to have an electric street illumination, provided by Packard Electric. Warren&#x27;s population was 5,973 people in 1890. Construction began on the Trumbull County Courthouse in downtown Warren on Thanksgiving Day, 1895.

Warren continued to grow in the twentieth century. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, steel production was a major industry in the county because of large deposits of coal and iron ore in surrounding counties. In recent years, many Warren residents have worked in local service and retail sales businesses. In 2000, Warren was Trumbull County&#x27;s most populated community, with 46,832 residents. Many examples of late 19th and early 20th century architectural styles still stand in downtown Warren, including the Trumbull County Courthouse, which contains one of the largest courtrooms in the state of Ohio, and the Trumbull County Carnegie Law Library; in addition to office buildings, banks, stores, and homes surrounding the Courthouse Square area.

John Ashbery mentions Warren in his poem &#x27;Pyrography&#x27;, first published in an exhibition catalogue in 1976 and included in his 1977 collection &quot;Houseboat Days&quot;. In a later interview, Ashbery said he had never visited the town.

Famous gangsters of the era like John Dillinger may have even visited the ballroom.

<text>Dennison is a village in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,709 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The confluence of coal and railroads drove the development of Dennison. It is located at the midpoint between Pittsburgh and Columbus -- from each. At the time, locomotives needed water every , so Dennison was a natural refilling location. The Dennison Coal Company had mines south of town.

In 1864, The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Railway decided to locate the country&#x27;s largest railroad shops and yards in Dennison. Dennison Land Company laid out the town of Dennison in 1865 and purchased land expressly for the town. The railyards spanned . Demand for passenger service led to construction of a station in 1873. Thousands moved to the area for jobs in the roundhouses, turntables and foundries. At its peak, 3,000 people worked in the railyards. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company eventually subsumed the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Railway.

The village incorporated in 1873, and was named for governor William Dennison.

During World War I, the Red Cross operated a canteen from a boxcar. Canteen volunteers prepared coffee and sandwiches for troops traveling through by train.

In 1922, a strike marked the end of the golden era of Dennison. During World War II, the Dennison Canteen operated from March 19, 1942, to April 8, 1946. Initially in a gas station on Center and Fifth Street, it moved to the depot restaurant and was dubbed &quot;Dreamsville&quot;.

The last passenger train service stopped in 1968. The last freight train stop in Dennison was in 1982. Freight trains still roll through, but they no longer stop in Dennison.

<text>Gnadenhutten ( , meaning &quot;Huts of Grace&quot; in German) is a village located on the Tuscarawas River in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 1,240 at the 2020 census. It is Ohio&#x27;s oldest existing settlement, being founded by Moravian Christians in 1772 and was the site of the Gnadenhutten massacre during the American Revolutionary War. It is part of the New Philadelphia–Dover micropolitan area.

==Etymology==
Gnadenhutten is derived from the German name Gnadenhütten (), meaning literally &quot;huts of grace&quot; or &quot;mercy huts&quot; and figuratively &quot;log tabernacle&quot;. &quot;Gnadenhutten&quot; was declared the &quot;most difficult to pronounce&quot; place name in the state of Ohio by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

== History ==

Gnadenhutten, originally Gnadenhütten, was founded in October 1772 as the second settlement of German Americans and Lenape Indians affiliated with the Moravian Church. Tribes of Christian Lenni Lenape people had settled at Schoenbrunn nearby, founded months earlier by missionary David Zeisberger. On July 4, 1773, a baby boy was born to the Roth family, becoming the first white child known to be born in the Ohio territory. This community, originally led by the Christian Mohican chieftain Joshua (who died August 1 of the following year), had grown to about 200 persons by 1775.

As pacifists, they remained neutral during the American Revolution and subsequent Revolutionary War. However, the British and their Indian Wyandot and Delaware allies suspected that members of the Christian Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrunn, and Salem communities had provided aid to American patriots. As a result, the British forced the Lenape tribespeople in the region to the Upper Sandusky area of the Ohio territory. While the British detained Rev. Zeisberger at Fort Detroit, they allowed roughly 150 Lenape to return to their old town to gather the harvest and supplies stored there. However, Pennsylvania militiamen, led by David Williamson, following the murder of American settlers by other Indian tribes a few weeks earlier, came to the resettled town in March 1782, and tricked the Indians into giving up their weapons. Ninety-six innocent Lenape men, women, and children spent the night in song and prayer knowing they would be slaughtered the following morning.

On March 8, 1782, the Pennsylvanians committed the Gnadenhutten massacre and burned the approximately 60 cabins in the town. Only two boys escaped; the incident led to distrust between Native Americans and American settlers, and reprisals against American patriots in Native American custody.

Although three 4,000 acre tracts were reserved for Indians as an &quot;act of indemnity&quot;, John Ettwein petitioned Congress in 1783 and the area was then opened to European American settlers. John Heckewelder from Pennsylvania built the first house in 1798, and Moravians remain in the town today. Few Native Americans chose to live there and they gave up title in 1823 after the Moravians had made many improvements.

Gnadenhutten was on a major wagon road crossing the Tuscarawas River. The first Ohio Canal was dug nearby in 1825-1830, providing access to markets as well as further immigrants via Cleveland. A railroad linked to the area in 1853, further improving market access and allowing industrial development. A flood in 1915 destroyed the canal, which was not rebuilt as other means of transportation had superseded it.

Gnadenhutten erected a monument to the martyrs of the March 8, 1782, massacre during the centennial of its founding, and in 1963 established a museum interpreting it and other aspects of the town&#x27;s history (including the results of 1970 excavations, and having rebuilt the Mission House and Cooper shop, and erected a mound containing the martyrs&#x27; graves). Various Native American and First Nations people gathered at the site in 1988 to dedicate a peace tree. The State of Ohio erected a memorial marker in 2003, calling the event a &quot;day of shame&quot;; it had erected another historical marker shortly before the town&#x27;s entrance in 1979.

The Moravians rebuilt their church in 1903 and dedicated it as a memorial to John Heckewelder. The village also has a Masonic Temple (built 1855 and rebuilt), Methodist church (built circa 1910), as well as a Church of Christ and Full Gospel Pentecostal Church on the outskirts. Its current library was erected in 1942.

<text>New Philadelphia is a city in and the county seat of Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The county&#x27;s largest city, New Philadelphia lies along the Tuscarawas River. The population was 17,677 at the 2020 census. It is a principal city in the New Philadelphia–Dover micropolitan area, approximately south of Cleveland.

In 1772, the Moravian Christians founded the community of Schoenbrunn in the area, which was the first settlement of the Northwest Territory. The Christian pacifist settlement was subsequently abandoned during the American Revolution. After the area was resettled in 1804, because of the presence of coal and clay, early industry in the city centered on mining interests and the manufacture of steel, canned goods, roofing tile, sewer pipe, bricks, vacuum cleaners, stovepipes, carriages, flour, brooms, and pressed, stamped, and enameled goods.

== History ==

The Moravian Church, under the leadership of David Zeisberger, founded Schoenbrunn (&quot;beautiful spring&quot;), also known as Welhik Tuppeek (&quot;the best spring&quot;), in 1772 as a mission to the Delaware Indians. Schönbrunn was two miles south-east of present-day New Philadelphia, Ohio. The settlement grew to include sixty dwellings and more than 300 inhabitants, both Munsee and Germans, who drew up Ohio&#x27;s first civil code and built its first Christian church and schoolhouse. Problems associated with the American Revolution prompted Schoenbrunn&#x27;s closing in 1777.

John Knisely, who was from Pennsylvania, wanted to settle in a location where game was more plentiful and was welcomed by the Christian Indians of Goshen; he returned to Ohio in 1804 with his family and 33 other pioneers, hiring surveyor John Wells to plot out the modern city of New Philadelphia in the same grid style as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 1833, New Philadelphia contained county buildings, a printing office, several stores, and five taverns.

<text>Stone Creek is a village in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 153 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Because of its distance from principal streams, early settlers did not arrive to the valley until 1827 when John Hawk, who is credited as the first settler arrived. Other settlers soon followed thanks to the construction of the Ohio and Erie Canal through Tuscarawas County. These settlers were mostly of Germans descent, some of whom came directly from Germany, while others were second or third generation from citizens from Pennsylvania. Although the canal did not go through Jefferson Township, it still opened up many opportunities to the region. It allowed shipping to eastern markets and increased the price of farm produce such as wheat. This helped to stimulate the settlement of the area, since it was close enough to canal shipping points.

In the early years of the settlement, a resident by the name of Philip Burrier hauled loads of stone to create a passage across the creek for horses and wagons to cross. The residents then referred to this creek as “Stone Creek.” Thanks to this newly given name to the creek, when a post office was established on the property of Michael Harmon in 1840, it was named Stone Creek.

The first formal attempt to establish a town was made in 1848 when Adam Sherrets platted a site at the junction of Dott&#x27;s Fork with Stone Creek. It ultimately failed, so the present town of Stone Creek was laid out in 1854 by Philip Leonhart and named Phillipsburg. This was later changed to Stone Creek. From here the town grew slowly until the construction of the Cleveland &amp; Marietta Railroad through the town in the 1870s. 

In 1904, village council members, Charlie Kughler and Fred Haas took the a train from the village to Akron to file incorporation papers for the village, only to discover that another Phillipsburg already existed in Ohio near Dayton. It was then they decided to name the village after the post office that had already been established there. 

The village at one time had its own school that served Jefferson Township. It was established as the result of several smaller school houses merging to form one central school one of which, the Angel Valley Schoolhouse still stands and has been preserved. The consolidated Stone Creek-Jefferson school building was erected in 1927. The school operated independently until 1965, when they were forced by the Ohio Department of Education to consolidated with a larger district, ultimately merging with the neighboring district, New Philadelphia City Schools. After the consolidation with the district, the Stone Creek school building housed an elementary school “Stone Creek Elementary,” as well as a steel and welding shop for the students of New Philadelphia High School who were bused out for their lab. The school was ultimately closed in 1974, with it being demolished on October 17, 1979.

The village still has its own volunteer fire department, which was officially established in 1949, although the building itself dates back further. Before this the town had a fire wagon that community members would use to fight fires.

<text>Sugarcreek is a village in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,373 at the 2020 census. It is known as &quot;The Little Switzerland of Ohio.&quot; Located in Ohio&#x27;s Amish Country, the village is part of a large regional tourism industry. In the center of town stands one of the world&#x27;s largest cuckoo clocks, which was previously featured on the cover of the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book in 1977.

==History==

Sugarcreek&#x27;s historical beginnings were rooted in cheese production. Swiss immigrants arrived in the early 1830s and used the milk from Amish dairy farms to produce their cheese. In the 1950s they created an annual Ohio Swiss Festival; the success of early festivals as an attraction for tourists resulted in local business leaders transforming the town into a Swiss village starting in 1965. By the early 1970s the first tourist-oriented businesses were opening, and the tourism industry in Sugarcreek was centered not only around the Amish but also around a steam engine passenger train operated by the Ohio Central Railroad which ran between Sugarcreek and Baltic until 2004. Since the train stopped running, tourism in Sugarcreek has decreased. Trollinger theorizes that unlike Walnut Creek and Berlin, which support a nostalgia that reassures tourists that what they are nostalgic for still exists in America and is therefore a nostalgia of hope, the Swiss theme of Sugarcreek inspires a nostalgia for something that is forever gone— that is, a historic period in which the United States was a European immigrant based white-majority country— and so does that not reassure many people.

Shanesville was founded in 1814 by Anthony Shane at the intersection of two Indian trails (currently Ohio State Routes 39 and 93). This village was surpassed in size and stature by Sugarcreek (then known as East Shanesville) when the railroads came in the mid-19th century. Shanesville was administratively merged with Sugarcreek in 1969, and took up the current name for the village.

==Geography==

<text>Zoar is a village in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, United States. The population was 172 at the 2020 census. The community was founded in 1817 by Radical Pietists as a utopian Christian community, which survived until 1898.

Much of the village&#x27;s early layout survives, as do many buildings from its utopian origins. Most of the community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as the Zoar Historic District, and it was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2016. Some of the historic buildings are now operated as museum properties.

==History==

Zoar was founded by Radical Pietist Christian dissenters from Germany called the Society of Separatists of Zoar in 1817. It was named after the Biblical village to which Lot and his family escaped from Sodom. It was a communal society: All property was communally owned, and the farms, shops, and factories were managed by regularly elected trustees. The society attained its greatest prosperity in the 1850s, when it owned over 10,000 acres of land and was worth approximately $1 million. Many German-style structures have been restored and are part of the Zoar Village State Memorial. There are presently ten restored buildings. According to the Ohio Historical Connection, Zoar is an island of Old-World charm in east-central Ohio.

These Radical Pietists, also known as Separatists, or Zoarites, emigrated from the kingdom of Württemberg in southwestern Germany due to religious oppression from the Lutheran church. Leading among their group were some natives of Rottenacker on the Danube. Having separated from the established church, they based their theology in part on the writings of Jakob Böhme. They did not practice baptism or confirmation and did not celebrate religious holidays except for the Sabbath. A central flower garden in Zoar is based on the Book of Revelation, with a towering tree (now cut down) in the middle representing Christ and other elements surrounding it representing other allegorical elements.

The leader of the society was named Joseph Bimeler (also known as Joseph Bäumler or Bäumeler, born 1778), a pipemaker as well as teacher from Ulm. His charismatic leadership carried the village through a number of crises. Bimeler led the society until his death, which occurred in 1853.

An early event critical to the success of the colony was the digging of the Ohio and Erie Canal. The Zoarites had purchased of land sight unseen and used loans to pay for it. The loans were to be paid off by 1830. The Society struggled for many years to determine what products and services they could produce in their village to pay off the loans. The state of Ohio required some of the Zoarite land to be used as a right of way and offered the Zoarites an opportunity to assist in digging the canals for money. The state gave them a choice of digging it themselves for pay or having the state pay others to dig the canal. The Zoarites then spent several years in the 1820s digging the canal and thus were able to pay off their loans on time with much money to spare.

Bimeler&#x27;s death on August 31, 1853, led to a slow decline in the cohesion of the village. By 1898, the village voted to disband the communal society, and the property was divided among the remaining residents.

==Flooding threat==
The future of the village is threatened because a Tuscarawas River levee that protects the village has been given the lowest safety rating by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The village sits at the base of the levee, which was built by the Corps in 1936 as part of its water management program in the region.

With the levee in failing condition, the Corps was evaluating three alternatives: 
* Repair the levee
* Purchase the village, tear it down, and let the area flood
* Relocate the village to higher ground.

The Zoar Village Government and the Zoar Community Association are working to preserve the village where it stands and have created the Save Historic Zoar Association.

Initial Corps estimates, as of mid-2012, put the cost of repairing the levee at about $130 million, slightly less than $1 million per resident. In June 2012 the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed Zoar on its annual list of &quot;America&#x27;s eleven most endangered historic places.&quot;

In November 2013 the Corps, following further review, reclassified the levee&#x27;s safety rating from 1 (lowest) to Dam Safety Action Classification 3, meaning the possibility of failure is moderate to high. An expedited full evaluation is to occur within a year. In so doing, the Corps also dropped the option of breaching the levee from the list of solutions being considered, and studied options for repairing the existing levee, thereby significantly reducing the likelihood that the village would have to be destroyed or relocated.

In 2023, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a $14 million project to repair the levee and save Zoar Village.

== Financing and economics ==
After fleeing from Germany, due to the financing of their emigration and the settling in Ohio, the settlers needed help. The Quakers in both Great Britain and Philadelphia were able to aid in their goals. The Quakers had much in common with them, like their similar ideas of pacifism and their practice of the Christian religion. In 1817, the settlers bought roughly 5,500 acres of land from Godfrey Haga. The Quakers loaned them money to support part of the purchase. Joseph Bimeler vowed to pay $15,000, the remaining balance of the purchase, off within 15 years. The following years of the society was not met with economic prosperity. In the early years of the village, community leaders required celibacy among their residents. The additional cost of bearing many children in a communal society was too large. In the 1830s, the Ohio and Erie Canal was being constructed. To accumulate money from the state, Zoarites constructed part of the Canal on their own, and received $21,000 from the state. During this period, blacksmithing and tin shops were flourishing in the village, as well as flour and wool mills. In 1853, after Joseph Bimeler&#x27;s passing, the village was worth around $5 million. Preceding Joseph Bimeler&#x27;s death, the village peaked. After 1853, the village began its decline. At its dissolution in 1898, there were 222 members of the community with an estimated worth of $3.5 million.

== Buildings ==
As construction of the village began, the buildings were subsequently numbered in the order that they were built. Many of the original buildings are still completely original.

=== Number One House ===

Originally built in 1835 to house the elders of the village, Joseph Bimeler and his family made this building their home.

=== Town Hall ===
The town hall for the Society was built in 1887. Since the Society disbanded in 1898, this building was actually one of the last ones to be constructed. Restoration of town hall took place in 2002 with help from private funds. The lower level is used as a governmental chamber and the two upper floors house artifacts that were commonly used throughout the village.

=== The Zoar Hotel ===
Built in 1833, the hotel is said to have been a home for anyone- rich or poor. President William McKinley had a favorite room here. He is said to have enjoyed the German cuisine and he favored staying here. It is currently only open on special occasions, unlike most other museum buildings. Renovations have been made on the outside of the hotel, but the inside is worn down and unsafe for regular use. The preservation committee, Zoar Community Association, is currently waiting on funding for inside renovation.

==History==
Magnetic Springs was platted in 1879 when underground springs were discovered there. The community earned its name from the mineral waters used for healing processes. Word spread across the country of these springs, and tourists began visiting from locations nationwide; even foreigners appeared occasionally. Hotel resorts sprang up, and the village boomed. Following the discovery of modern medicinal cures, including the vaccine for polio, the interest in natural healing remedies faded, and the city&#x27;s tourism industry collapsed. By the early 1980s, the hotel resorts had been torn down.

During the Prohibition era of the 1920s, the village was a local hotbed of bootlegging and gambling, although it faced vigorous opposition from the mayor, Mary McFadden. She also led bond raising campaigns for public services and a larger town hall, and to encourage full council meetings she cooked dinner for all the members.

<text>Marysville is a city in and the county seat of Union County, Ohio, United States, approximately northwest of Columbus. The population was 25,571 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Columbus metropolitan area.

Marysville&#x27;s longtime slogan is &quot;Where the Grass is Greener&quot;. In December 2008, the city was designated as a &quot;Preserve America Community&quot; by First Lady Laura Bush.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Marysville was originally part of Northwest Territory, and then became part of the Virginia Military District within that territory, and eventually became part of the state of Ohio. One of the original surveyors of the area was James Galloway, Jr., who first visited in 1805. Marysville was founded in 1819 by Samuel W. Cuthbertson, who named the town after his daughter Mary, along the small waterway of Mill Creek.

=== County seat designation ===

After the organization of the county by the Ohio Legislature, Marysville was designated as the seat of Union County. The first recorded meeting of the commissioners was in 1820. Between 1835 and 1840, a courthouse was constructed. Eventually, a new dedicated courthouse would be built in Marysville on January 27, 1883, which is also presently in use.

In 1849, a county infirmary was authorized. The first county jail was a log structure that sat on the south side of East Center street, in the rear of the courthouse. Eventually a new jail was authorized by the commissioners and built in the 1870s. In 1878 the county purchased a 10-ton safe for the treasury, that eventually was moved into courthouse.

The first county fair was held in 1847 in Marysville, in the public square. In 1852, the Agriculture Society moved the fair to the current location, on the north side of town.

=== Early development ===
Marysville was originally laid out in 1820. The first permanent settlement was made by Abraham Amrine, of Swiss descent, in 1817, two miles north of the city. Today the main road leading to the high school is named Amrine-Mill Rd.

In 1824, the first post office was established. At this time, there were only four families in the village. In 1828, Marysville&#x27;s first school was established in the east side of town using a log cabin as its building structure. By 1839, there were already three schools operating in the town. In 1843, the first high school was opened by Caroline Humphrey, and by 1850 there was a Board of Education making annual reports to the voters.

In 1837, the Ohio Gazetteer published that Marysville was a small post town consisting of a court house, a jail, forty-five dwelling houses, one tavern, three stores, one practicing physician, two attorneys and about 250 inhabitants. By 1846, Marysville had 360 inhabitants, three small dry goods stores, two churches (Presbyterian and Methodist), a private school, and a newspaper office.

Early Marysville businesses during this period included McClouds Drug Store on the south side of the square, the Cheap Cash Store, the American Hotel, the W.W. Woods store, and Hare and Hughes, a hat business located on the southwest corner of the square. Several locals ran personal unnamed businesses.

<text>Richwood is a village in Union County, Ohio, United States. The population was 2,222 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history, 1820–1860===
Union County was organized on January 10, 1820, from territory previously contained in Franklin, Madison, Logan and Delaware Counties. Claibourne Township was surveyed by Richard Claiborne in 1811. The first settler in Claiborne Township was Cyprian Lee, who with Henry Swartz took the contract to build the township&#x27;s first road in 1825. The wide road was cut from the southernmost to the northernmost lines of the township, the effort consisting of clearing underbrush and small trees, leaving &#x27;many obstacles in the shape of large timber.&#x27; This north to south road passed through what would become Richwood.

In 1832, two land grants in Union County were received by William Pelham and Charles Blagrove of Virginia. Pelham sold his land to Blagrove that same year who promptly gave his nieces, Catherine and Parthenia Blagrove of Washington, D.C., the two parcels. Richwood would later be laid out on Parthenia&#x27;s parcel. Blagrove put her legal affairs in the hands of Delaware attorney George Bomford, who sold the land to Philip Plummer.

Philip Plummer was originally from Mt. Vernon, but he had been impressed with Union County&#x27;s tree growth and rich soil. Once he had purchased Blagrove&#x27;s plat he returned with his brother Thomas, who was a surveyor. Together they found that the level ground and distance from Marysville, the county seat, would make that location desirable for a city. The town of Richwood was laid out August 8,9,10 1832 by Philip, his brother Thomas and Union County Surveyor Levi Phelps, who aided the project, and whose office recorded the first boundary lines for the new town.

When the surveying was finished Richwood was platted and declared open for settlement, the plat covering a total area of . The north-south and east-west roads were named Franklin (after Benjamin Franklin) and Ottaway (later renamed Ottawa), respectively, both to be wide. Four other streets were platted: Fulton and Clinton Streets going north-south, Blagrove and Bomford going east-west, each to be wide.

The first building in Richwood was a one-room log cabin occupied by John P. Brookins and his family. For many years, he was the only doctor in Richwood and served as Justice of the Peace and as Postmaster.

In 1834 Richwood got its first established business, a grocery store opened by Burdick &amp; Calloway. That same year, road work was completed, and all the roads going into the town were gravelled.

The Methodist Episcopal Church was formally organized on October 17, 1835, by Reverend William Frazell, who served as an itinerant minister.

Richwood was incorporated as a village in March 1835, and by 1840 twenty-five families were listed as living in Richwood. As of 1877, the town contained one newspaper, two banks, three churches, one brick school-house, and several stores and factories.

The town council met on June 1, 1890, and a man by the name of Lewis J. Kiggins brought up the subject, and asked the rest of the men if they liked Ohio City. The vote was taken and Ohio City became the new name.

In 1910, Ohio City was a very prosperous town. Being on the junction of several major railroads, its importance allowed it to sport three churches, one union school, two dry goods stores, two hardware stores, one clothing store, two millinery establishments, three hotels, three restaurants, one bakery, four saloons, two shoe shops, one tailor shop, one silversmith shop, one slack barrel factory, one lumber yard, two blacksmith shops, two elevators, one tile factory, one beet dump, two sawmills, one harness shop, one ice-making house, and three railroads all using the centrally located Union Depot.

==Education==
Ohio City has a public library, a branch of the Brumback Library.

==Arts and culture==
The annual &quot;Lambert Days&quot; festival (honoring John William Lambert) is held on the third full weekend in July. This festival has activities such as a car show, a whiffle ball tournament, softball, a parade, and a Texas hold &#x27;em tournament.

<text>Van Wert is a city in and the county seat of Van Wert County, Ohio, United States. It is located in northwestern Ohio approximately southwest of Toledo and southeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana. The population was 11,092 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Van Wert micropolitan area, which is included in the Lima–Van Wert–Wapakoneta combined statistical area.

Van Wert is named for Isaac Van Wart, one of the captors of Major John André in the American Revolutionary War. A center of peony cultivation, Van Wert has hosted the annual Van Wert Peony Festival on and off since 1902. Van Wert is home to the first county library in the United States, the Brumback Library.

==History==

Van Wert was surveyed in 1824 by Captain James Riley, who was contracted by the government to survey lands purchased from Native Americans under a treaty in 1818. It was incorporated as a town in 1848 and was chartered as a city in 1903.

The town is located in an area originally known as the Black Swamp. Early pioneers had to deal with swampy ground, mud, and malaria. They persevered, draining the swamp for agriculture and eventually reclaiming enough dry land to establish the town. Van Wert was the birthplace of aviation pioneer Walter Hinton and the famous baritone Charles W. Clark.

At one point, Van Wert was the only place in the world producing Liederkranz cheese. Beginning in 1926, this pungent dairy product was manufactured at the now-closed Borden plant. At the time of the closure, Liederkranz cheese was selling for $8 per pound. The people of Van Wert (400 of which called themselves &quot;Cheesemakers&quot;) contributed to the town of Vimoutiers, Orne, Lower Normandy, France with help in the costs of reconstruction and reparation of the town after it was mistakenly bombed by the US Air Force during World War II. They volunteered to pay for the replacement of Marie Harel&#x27;s statue in 1953. This is recorded by a plaque in the market square of Vimoutiers. Vimoutiers is a centre for local making of Camembert, Livarot and Pont-l&#x27;Évêque cheeses.

On November 10, 2002, an F4 tornado struck the town, killing two people. This was one of many tornado touchdowns during the 2002 Veterans Day Weekend tornado outbreak. Van Wert&#x27;s emergency warning system is credited with saving many lives after several cars were thrown into a movie theatre that had been packed with people just minutes earlier.

<doc id="129916" wikidata="Q1739270" url="?curid=129916" title="Churl">
<text>A churl (Old High German ), in its earliest Old English (Anglo-Saxon) meaning, was simply &quot;a man&quot; or more particularly a &quot;free man&quot;, but the word soon came to mean &quot;a non-servile peasant&quot;, still spelled , and denoting the lowest rank of freemen. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, it later came to mean the opposite of nobility and royalty, &quot;a common person&quot;. Says Chadwick:
This meaning held through the 15th century, but by then the word had taken on negative overtones, meaning &quot;a country person&quot; and then &quot;a low fellow&quot;. By the 19th century, a new and pejorative meaning arose, &quot;one inclined to uncivil or loutish behaviour&quot;—hence &quot;churlish&quot; (cf. the pejorative sense of the term &quot;boor&quot;, whose original meaning of &quot;country person&quot; or &quot;farmer&quot; is preserved in Dutch and Afrikaans and German , although the latter has its own pejorative connotations such as those prompting its use as the name for the chess piece known in English as a pawn; also the word villain—derived from Anglo-French and Old French, originally meaning &quot;farmhand&quot;—has gone through a similar process to reach its present meaning).

The of early medieval England lived in a largely free society, and one in which their fealty was principally to their king. Their low status is shown by their &quot;werġild&quot; (&quot;man-price&quot;), which, over a large part of England, was fixed at 200 shillings (one-sixth that of a &quot;theġn&quot;). Agriculture was largely community-based and communal in open-field systems. This freedom was eventually eroded by the increase in power of feudal lords and the manorial system. Some scholars argue, however, that anterior to the encroachment of the manorial system the &quot;ċeorles&quot; owed various services and rents to local lords and powers.

In the North Germanic (Scandinavian) languages, the word has the same root as &quot;churl&quot; and meant originally a &quot;free man&quot;. As &quot;housecarl&quot;, it came back to England. In German, is used to describe a somewhat rough and common man and is no longer in use as a synonym for a common soldier (&quot;die langen Kerls&quot; of King Frederick William I of Prussia). &quot;Rígsþula&quot;, a poem in the Poetic Edda, explains the social classes as originating from the three sons of Ríg: Thrall, Karl and Earl (, and ). This story has been interpreted in the context of the proposed trifunctional hypothesis of Proto-Indo-European society.

Cognates to the word are frequently found in place names, throughout the Anglophone world, in towns such as Carlton and Charlton, meaning &quot;the farmstead of the churls&quot;. Names such as Carl and Charles are derived from cognates of &quot;churl&quot; or &quot;ċeorle&quot;.

While the word &quot;churl&quot; went down in the social scale, the first name derived from the same etymological source (&quot;Karl&quot; in German, &quot;Charles&quot; in French and English, &quot;Carlos&quot; in Spanish, Karel in Dutch, etc.) remained prestigious enough to be used frequently by many European royal families - owing originally to the fame of Charlemagne, to which was added that of later illustrious kings and emperors of the same name. The Polish word for &quot;king&quot;, , is also derived from the same origin.

In her tragedy Ethwald (Part II), Joanna Baillie uses the spelling &quot;cairl&quot;, and in Act 2, Scene II, the characters, First Cairl, Second Cairl and Third Cairl are found searching amongst the dead upon a battle field. This play is set in Mercia.

==Current use==
In most Germanic languages this word never took on the English meaning of &quot;lowly peasant&quot; and retains its original meaning of &quot;fellow, guy&quot;; , archaic , , , (also borrowed into German), , and so on.

<doc id="129927" wikidata="Q998459" url="?curid=129927" title="Franklin, Ohio">
<text>Franklin is a city in Warren County, Ohio, United States, along the Great Miami River. The population was 11,690 at the 2020 census. The city lies about southwest of Dayton and northeast of Cincinnati. Ohio State Routes 73, 123 and 741 pass through Franklin, while Interstate 75 is routed to the east side of the city.

==History==

Franklin was founded by General William C. Schenck, in 1796. The settlement was named for Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was incorporated in 1814, and became a city in 1951. One of the first four post offices in Warren County was established in Franklin in 1805. The first postmaster was John N.C. Schenck, brother of General Schenck. The Franklin Post Office still stands (in a different location), and is one of four sites in Franklin listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the Mackinaw Historic District.

Construction of the Miami and Erie Canal occurred between 1825 and 1845. The canal followed the Great Miami River through Franklin, and the boat traffic led to new commerce. The town soon had a pork slaughterhouse, barrel making factory, sawmill, and whiskey distillery. Franklin&#x27;s first mayor, Dr. Absalom Death, was elected at a tavern meeting in 1837. Dr. Death went on to be director of a medical college in Cincinnati. In its history, two doctors in Franklin have been named &quot;Dr. Death&quot;.

By the 1850s, the Franklin area was noted for breeding racehorses. One chestnut-colored mare, &quot;Nightingale&quot;, sired by &quot;Mambrino&quot; and &quot;Wood&#x27;s Hambletonian&quot;, set a 3-mile harness racing record of 6:55½ in 1893. A railroad was completed with a depot in Franklin in 1872. The town continued to prosper, and by 1890, five paper mills were located in Franklin. The town&#x27;s economy suffered a setback in 1896, when Franklin&#x27;s only bank crashed. A longtime and trusted teller had embezzled vast amounts of money, affecting the fortunes of many individuals and businesses.

The town marshal of Franklin, George Basore, was shot and killed in 1906 while attempting to arrest an African American man, George White. When White was arrested, a crowd of 300 gathered outside the Franklin jail intent on lynching him. The sheriff and two deputies were able to remove White and take him to nearby Lebanon for his safety. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;The whole town of Franklin is wrought up over the affair. Colored people were chased out without being given time to explain&quot;. White died the following year in the electric chair.

In 1907, Franklin&#x27;s fire chief, B.H. Miller, walked into the police station and shot dead one of the prisoners who had allegedly had an affair with his wife a month earlier. The town was devastated by the Great Flood of March 1913, when the Great Miami River overflowed its banks.

Franklin opened what was considered the world&#x27;s first garbage-recycling plant in 1971. Designed and built by the Black Clawson Company, the plant recycled metals from solid waste, and used recovered paper fibers to make roofing materials.

In 1989, Ronald Peters, a café owner in Franklin, was alleged to be the principal bookmaker for baseball player Pete Rose.

In 2015, The Museum of Spiritual Art opened. In 2017, Franklin attracted national attention in the week following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the city removed an obscure Confederate marker honoring Robert E. Lee that had existed along the right-of-way of Dixie Highway. The marker had been dedicated in 1927 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in what was at that time a part of Franklin Township.

<text>Landen is a census-designated place (CDP) in Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States. The population was 6,995 at the 2020 census. It is located around Columbia Road and Montgomery Road in the southeastern part of the township. It surrounds Twenty Mile Stand and near Fosters.

Landen was named after Theodophilus James Landen, an early Ohio settler who owned the farmland surrounding Twenty Mile Stand. The man-made Landen Lake occupies the center of the residential area in the housing development. The formal place designation is &quot;Landen Farm Drainage Lake&quot;. The reduction in farming activity in the immediate area of the water has made it suitable for limited, slow pontoon boat recreation. It is now best described as a retention basin. The retention basin was dredged for improved flood protection with the completion in 2008 of a major dredging operation that removed 184,000 cubic yards of sediment from the lake.
