<text>Staten Island ( ) is the southernmost of the five boroughs of New York City, coextensive with Richmond County and situated at the southernmost point of New York. The borough is separated from the adjacent state of New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a population of 495,747 in the 2020 Census, Staten Island is the least populated New York City borough but the third largest in land area at ; it is also the least densely populated and most suburban borough in the city.

A home to the Lenape Native Americans, the island was settled by Dutch colonists in the 17th century. It was one of the 12 original counties of New York state. Staten Island was consolidated with New York City in 1898. It was formerly known as the Borough of Richmond until 1975, when its name was changed to Borough of Staten Island. Staten Island has sometimes been called &quot;the forgotten borough&quot; by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government and the media. It has also been referred to as the &quot;borough of parks&quot; due to its 12,300 acres of protected parkland and over 170 parks.

The North Shore—especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton—is the island&#x27;s most urban area. It contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul&#x27;s Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the FDR Boardwalk, the world&#x27;s fourth-longest boardwalk. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now very suburban. The West Shore along the protected waters of the &quot;kills&quot; (waterways) has the island&#x27;s fewest residents but the most industrial development.

Motor traffic can reach the borough from Brooklyn by the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and from New Jersey by the Outerbridge Crossing, Goethals Bridge and Bayonne Bridge. Staten Island has Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bus lines and an MTA rapid transit line, the Staten Island Railway, which runs from the ferry terminal at St. George to Tottenville. Staten Island is the only borough not connected to the New York City Subway system. The free Staten Island Ferry connects the borough to Manhattan across New York Harbor. It provides views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan.

==History==
===Indigenous Inhabitants / Native Americans===
As in much of North America, human habitation appeared on the island fairly rapidly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Archaeologists have recovered tool evidence of Clovis culture activity dating from about 14,000 years ago. This evidence was first discovered in 1917 in the Charleston section of the island. Various Clovis artifacts have been discovered since then, on property owned by Mobil Oil.

The island was probably abandoned later, possibly because of the extirpation of large mammals on the island. Evidence of the first permanent Native American settlements and agriculture are thought to date from about 5,000 years ago, although early archaic habitation evidence has been found in multiple locations on the island.

Rossville points are distinct arrowheads that define a Native American cultural period from the Archaic period to the Early Woodland period, dating from about 1500 to 100 BC. They are named for the Rossville section of Staten Island, where they were first found near the old Rossville Post Office building.
At the time of European contact, the island was inhabited by the Raritan band of the Unami division of the Lenape. In Lenape, one of the Algonquian languages, Staten Island was called , meaning &quot;as far as the place of the bad woods&quot;, or , meaning &quot;the bad woods&quot;. 
The name is spelled as in the deed to Lubbertus van Dincklage for the purchase of Staten Island, 1657. The area was part of the Lenape homeland known as Lenapehoking. The Lenape were later called the &quot;Delaware&quot; by the English colonists because they inhabited both shores of what the English named the Delaware River.

The island was laced with Native American foot trails, one of which followed the south side of the ridge near the course of present-day Richmond Road and Amboy Road. The Lenape did not live in fixed encampments but moved seasonally, using slash and burn agriculture. Shellfish was a staple of their diet, including the Eastern oyster (&quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;) abundant in the waterways throughout the present-day New York City region. Evidence of their habitation can still be seen in shell middens along the shore in the Tottenville section, where oyster shells larger than are sometimes found.

Burial Ridge, a Lenape burial ground on a bluff overlooking Raritan Bay in Tottenville, is the largest pre-European burial ground in New York City. Bodies have been reported unearthed at Burial Ridge from 1858 onward. After conducting independent research, which included unearthing bodies interred at the site, ethnologist and archaeologist George H. Pepper was contracted in 1895 to conduct paid archaeological research at Burial Ridge by the American Museum of Natural History. The burial ground today is unmarked and lies within Conference House Park.

===European settlement===
The first recorded European contact on the island was in 1524 by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano who sailed through The Narrows on the ship &quot;La Dauphine&quot; and anchored for one night.

The Dutch did not establish a permanent settlement on for many decades. Its name derived from the Staten Generaal, the parliament of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. From 1639 to 1655, Cornelis Melyn and David de Vries made three separate attempts to establish one there, but each time the settlement was destroyed in conflicts between the Dutch and the local tribe. In 1661, the first permanent Dutch settlement was established at (Dutch for &quot;Old Village&quot;) by a small group of Dutch, Walloon, and French Huguenot families, just south of the Narrows near South Beach. Many French Huguenots had gone to the Netherlands as refugees from the religious wars in France, suffering persecution for their Protestant faith, and some joined the emigration to New Netherland. At one point nearly a third of the residents of the Island spoke French. The last vestige of Oude Dorp is the name of the present-day neighborhood of Old Town adjacent to Old Town Road.

Staten Island was not spared the bloodshed that culminated in Kieft&#x27;s War. In the summer of 1641 and in 1642, Native American tribes laid waste to Old Town.

On July 10, 1657, the Native Americans signed a deed to Lubbertus van Dincklage, attorney of Henrick van der Capelle tho Ryssel, for the purchase of all indigenous lands on Staten Island. However, this deed was annulled when the Dutch purchasers failed to deliver the promised goods for the land a few months later.


===Richmond County===
At the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1667, the Dutch ceded New Netherland to England in the Treaty of Breda, and the Dutch , anglicized as &quot;Staten Island&quot;, became part of the new English colony of New York.

In 1670, the Native Americans ceded all claims to Staten Island to the English in a deed to Governor Francis Lovelace. In 1671, in order to encourage an expansion of the Dutch settlements, the English resurveyed (which became known as &#x27;Old Town&#x27;) and expanded the lots along the shore to the south. These lots were settled primarily by Dutch families and became known as (meaning &#x27;New Village&#x27;), which later became anglicized as New Dorp.

Captain Christopher Billopp, after years of distinguished service in the Royal Navy, came to America in 1674 along with the newly appointed royal governor of New York and the Jerseys Sir Edmund Andros, in charge of a company of infantry. The following year, he settled on Staten Island, where he was granted a patent for of land. According to one version of an oft-repeated but apocryphal tale, Captain Billopp&#x27;s seamanship secured Staten Island to New York, rather than to New Jersey: the island would belong to New York if the captain could circumnavigate it in one day, which he did. This story is most likely untrue, due to conflicting information on the time Christopher Billopp took to complete the race and whether he received a personal prize or not. Mayor Michael Bloomberg perpetuated the myth by referring to it at a news conference in Brooklyn on February 20, 2007. Reliable historical documentation of the event is extremely sparse, however, and most historians conclude that it is entirely apocryphal. In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; addressed the issue in a news article, which concluded that this event was heavily embellished over the years and almost certainly originated in local folklore. YouTuber CGP Grey addressed the story of the Staten Island race and its historical discrepancies in a 2019 video, in which he concluded that Gabriel Disosway, a local chronicler in Staten Island, was responsible for originating the legend in the mid-1800s.

In 1683, the colony of New York was divided into ten counties. As part of this process, Staten Island, as well as several minor neighboring islands, was designated as &quot;Richmond County&quot;. The name derives from the title of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, an illegitimate son of King Charles II.

In 1687 and 1688, the English divided the island into four administrative divisions based on natural features: the manorial estate of colonial governor Thomas Dongan in the northeastern hills known as the &quot;Lordship or Manor of Cassiltown&quot;, along with the North, South, and West divisions. These divisions later evolved into the four towns of Castleton, Northfield, Southfield, and Westfield. In 1698, the population was 727.

The government granted land patents in rectangular blocks of , with the most desirable lands along the coastline and inland waterways. By 1708, the entire island had been divided up in this fashion, creating 166 small farms and two large manorial estates, the Dongan estate and a parcel on the southwestern tip of the island belonging to Christopher Billopp.

The first county seat was established in New Dorp in what was called Stony Brook at the time. In 1729, the county seat was moved to the village of Richmond Town, located at the headwaters of the Fresh Kills near the center of the island. By 1771, the island&#x27;s population had grown to 2,847.

===18th century and the American Revolution===
Staten Islanders were solidly supportive of the Crown, and the island played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War. General George Washington once called Islanders &quot;our most inveterate enemies&quot;.

As support of independence spread throughout the colonies, residents of the island were so uninterested that no representatives were sent to the First Continental Congress, the only county in New York to not send anyone. This had economic repercussions in the months up through 1776, where New Jersey towns such as Elizabethport, Woodbridge, and Dover instituted boycotts on doing business with islanders.

On March 17, 1776, the British forces under Sir William Howe evacuated Boston and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia. From Halifax, Howe prepared to attack New York City, which then consisted entirely of the southern end of Manhattan Island. General George Washington led the entire Continental Army to New York City in anticipation of the British attack. Howe used the strategic location of Staten Island as a staging ground for the invasion.

Over 140 British ships arrived over the summer of 1776 and anchored off the shores of Staten Island at the entrance to New York Harbor. The British soldiers and Hessian mercenaries numbered about 30,000. Howe established his headquarters in New Dorp at the Rose and Crown Tavern, near the junction of present New Dorp Lane and Richmond Road. There the representatives of the British government reportedly received their first notification of the Declaration of Independence.

In August 1776, the British forces crossed the Narrows to Brooklyn and outflanked the American forces at the Battle of Long Island, resulting in the British control of the harbor and the capture of New York City shortly afterwards. Three weeks later, on September 11, 1776, Sir William&#x27;s brother, Lord Howe, received a delegation of Americans consisting of Benjamin Franklin, Edward Rutledge, and John Adams at the Conference House on the southwestern tip of the island on the former estate of Christopher Billopp. The Americans refused a peace offer from Howe in exchange for withdrawing the Declaration of Independence, and the conference ended without an agreement.
On August 22, 1777, the Battle of Staten Island occurred between the British forces and several companies of the 2nd Canadian Regiment fighting alongside other American companies. The battle was inconclusive, though both sides surrendered over a hundred troops as prisoners. The Americans finally withdrew.

In early 1780, while the Kill Van Kull was frozen over, Lord Stirling led an unsuccessful Patriot raid from New Jersey on the western shore of Staten Island. It was repulsed in part by troops led by British Commander Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings.

In June 1780, Wilhelm von Knyphausen, commander of Britain&#x27;s Hessian auxiliaries, led many raids and a full assault into New Jersey from Staten Island with the aim of defeating George Washington and the Continental Army. Although the raids were successful in the Newark and Elizabeth areas, the advance was halted at Connecticut Farms (Union) and the Battle of Springfield.

British forces remained on Staten Island for the remainder of the war. Most Patriots fled after the British occupation, and the sentiment of those who remained was predominantly Loyalist. Even so, the islanders found the demands of supporting the troops to be heavy. The British army kept headquarters in neighborhoods such as Bulls Head. Many buildings and churches were destroyed for their materials, and the military&#x27;s demand for resources resulted in an extensive deforestation by the end of the war. The British army again used the island as a staging ground for its final evacuation of New York City on December 5, 1783. After their departure, many Loyalist landowners, such as Christopher Billop, the family of Canadian historian Peter Fisher, John Dunn, who founded St. Andrews, New Brunswick, and Abraham Jones, fled to Canada, and their estates were subdivided and sold.

Staten Island was occupied by the British longer than any single part of the Thirteen Colonies.

===19th century===

On July 4, 1827, the end of slavery in New York state was celebrated at Swan Hotel, in the West Brighton neighborhood. Rooms at the hotel were reserved months in advance as local abolitionists, including prominent free blacks, prepared for the festivities. Speeches, pageants, picnics, and fireworks marked the celebration, which lasted for two days.

In the early 19th century, New Jersey and New York disputed the location of their maritime boundary. The original charters were of no help because they were worded ambiguously. New York argued that the eastern edge of New Jersey was located at the Hudson River&#x27;s shoreline during high tide, which would give New York control of all the docks and wharves on the Hudson River. New Jersey argued that the maritime boundary should be down the middle of the Hudson River and then continue out to the Atlantic Ocean, which would give New Jersey control of the docks and wharves as well as Staten Island. Vice President Martin Van Buren negotiated a compromise that established the maritime boundary in the middle of the Hudson River and gave Staten Island to New York. Ellis Island and Bedloe&#x27;s Island, both uninhabited at the time, also became controlled by New Jersey.

From 1800 to 1858, Staten Island was the location of the largest quarantine facility in the United States. Angry residents burned down the hospital compound in 1858 in a series of attacks known as the Staten Island Quarantine War.

In 1860, parts of Castleton and Southfield were made into a new town, Middletown. The Village of New Brighton in the town of Castleton was incorporated in 1866, and in 1872 the Village of New Brighton annexed all the remainder of the Town of Castleton and became coterminous with the town.

An 1887 movement to incorporate Staten Island as a city ended up resulting in nothing.

===Consolidation with New York City===
The towns of Staten Island were dissolved in 1898 with the consolidation of the City of Greater New York, as Richmond County became one of the five boroughs of the expanded city. Although consolidated into the City of Greater New York in 1898, the county sheriff of Staten Island maintained control of the jail system, unlike the other boroughs, which had gradually transferred control of the jails to the Department of Correction. The jail system was not transferred until January 1, 1942. Staten Island is the only borough without a New York City Department of Correction major detention center.

The construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, along with the other three major Staten Island bridges, created a new way for commuters and tourists to travel from New Jersey to Brooklyn, Manhattan, and areas farther east on Long Island. The network of highways running between the bridges has effectively carved up many of Staten Island&#x27;s old neighborhoods. The bridge opened many areas of the borough to residential and commercial development from the 1960s onward, especially in the central and southern parts of the borough, which had been largely undeveloped. Staten Island&#x27;s population doubled from 221,991 in 1960 to 443,728 in 2000. Nevertheless, Staten Island remained less developed than the rest of the city. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 1972 stated that despite the borough having 333,000 residents, parts of the island still maintained a bucolic atmosphere with woods and marshes.

Throughout the 1980s, a movement to secede from the city steadily grew in popularity, notably championed by longtime New York state senator and former Republican Party mayoral nominee John J. Marchi. The campaign reached its peak during the mayoral term of David Dinkins (1990–1993), after the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the New York City Board of Estimate, which had given equal representation to the five boroughs. Dinkins and the city government opposed a non-binding secession referendum, contending that the vote should not be permitted by the state unless the city issued a home rule message supporting it, which the city would not. Governor Mario Cuomo disagreed, and the vote went forward in 1993. Ultimately, 65% of Staten island residents voted to secede through the approval of a new city charter making Staten Island an independent city, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly.

In the 1980s, the United States Navy had a base on Staten Island called Naval Station New York. It had two sections: a Strategic Homeport in Stapleton and a larger section near Fort Wadsworth, where the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge enters the island. The base was closed in 1994 through the Base Realignment and Closure process because of its small size and the expense of basing personnel there.

Fresh Kills and its tributaries are part of the largest tidal wetland ecosystem in the region. Its creeks and wetlands have been designated a Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Opened along Fresh Kills as a &quot;temporary landfill&quot; in 1947, the Fresh Kills Landfill was a repository of trash for the city of New York. The landfill, once the world&#x27;s largest man-made structure, was closed in 2001, but it was briefly reopened for the debris from Ground Zero following the September 11 attacks in 2001. It is being converted into a park almost three times the size of Central Park and the largest park to be developed in New York City in over 100 years. Plans for the park include a bird-nesting island, public roads, boardwalks, soccer and baseball fields, bridle paths, and a 5,000-seat stadium. Today, freshwater and tidal wetlands, fields, birch thickets, and a coastal oak maritime forest, as well as areas dominated by non-native plant species, are all within the boundaries of Fresh Kills. 

==Geology==

During the Paleozoic Era, the tectonic plate containing the continent of Laurentia and the plate containing the continent of Gondwanaland were converging, the Iapetus Ocean that separated the two continents gradually closed, and the resulting collision between the plates formed the Appalachian Mountains. During the early stages of this mountain building known as the Taconic orogeny, a piece of ocean crust from the Iapetus Ocean broke off and became incorporated into the collision zone and now forms the oldest bedrock strata of Staten Island, the serpentinite.

This strata of the Lower Paleozoic (approximately 430 million years old) consists predominantly of the serpentine minerals, antigorite, chrysotile, and lizardite; it also contains asbestos and talc. At the end of the Paleozoic era (248 million years ago) all major continental masses were joined into the supercontinent of Pangaea.

The Palisades Sill has been designated a National Natural Landmark, being &quot;the best example of a thick diabase sill in the United States&quot;. It underlies a portion of northwest Staten Island, with a visible outcropping in Travis, off Travis Road in the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. This is the same formation that appears in New Jersey and upstate New York along the Hudson River in Palisades Interstate Park. The sill extends southward beyond the cliffs in Jersey City beneath the Upper New York Harbor and resurfaces on Staten Island. The Palisades sill date from the Early Jurassic period, 192 to 186 million years ago.

Staten Island has been at the southern terminus of various periods of glaciation. The most recent, the Wisconsin glaciation, ended approximately 12,000 years ago. The accumulated rock and sediment deposited at the terminus of the glacier is known as the terminal moraine present along the central portion of the island. The evidence of these glacial periods is visible in the remaining wooded areas of Staten Island in the form of glacial erratics and kettle ponds.

At the retreat of the ice sheet, Staten Island was connected by land to Long Island, as the Narrows had not yet formed. Geologists&#x27; reckonings of the course of the Hudson River have placed it alternatively through the present course of the Raritan River, south of the island, or through present-day Flushing Bay and Jamaica Bay.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Richmond County has a total area of , of which is land and (43%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in New York by land area and fourth-smallest by total area.

Although Staten Island is a borough of New York City, the island is geographically part of New Jersey. Staten Island is separated from Long Island by the Narrows and from mainland New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull. Staten Island is positioned at the center of New York Bight, a sharp bend in the shoreline between New Jersey and Long Island. The region is considered vulnerable to sea-level rise. On October 29, 2012, the island experienced severe damage and loss of life along with the destruction of many homes during Hurricane Sandy.

In addition to the main island, the borough and county also include several small uninhabited islands:
* The Isle of Meadows (at the mouth of Fresh Kills)
* Prall&#x27;s Island (in the Arthur Kill)
* Shooters Island (in Newark Bay; part of it is in New Jersey)
* Swinburne Island (in Lower New York Bay)
* Hoffman Island (in Lower New York Bay)

The highest point on the island, the summit of Todt Hill, elevation , is also the highest point in the five boroughs, as well as the highest point on the Atlantic coastal plain south of Great Blue Hill in Massachusetts and the highest point on the coast proper south of Maine&#x27;s Camden Hills. Ward&#x27;s Point in the neighborhood of Tottenville is the southernmost point in the state of New York.

Staten Island is the only borough in New York City that does not share a land border with another borough (Marble Hill in Manhattan is contiguous with the Bronx). The borough has a land border with Elizabeth and Bayonne, New Jersey, on uninhabited Shooters Island.

===Wildlife===
Staten Island is home to a large and diverse population of wildlife. Wildlife found on Staten Island include white-tailed deer (which have increased from a population of 24 in 2008 to 2,000 in 2017 due to a hunting ban and a lack of predators), as well as hundreds of species of birds including bald eagles, turkey, hawks, egrets and ring-necked pheasants. Staten Island is home to Atlantic horseshoe crabs, cottontail rabbits, opossums, raccoons, garter snakes, red-eared slider turtles, newts, spring peeper frogs, leopard frogs, fox, box turtles, skunks, northern snapping turtles and common snapping turtles. In 2014 a new species of frog, the Atlantic Coast Leopard Frog (&quot;Lithobates kauffeldi&quot;), was described from Staten Island.

===Parkland===
Staten Island includes thousands of acres of federal, state, and local park land, including the &quot;greenbelt&quot; and &quot;blue belt&quot; park systems and the Gateway National Recreation Area, in addition to hundreds of acres of private wooded areas. The National Park Service maintains full-time wildland firefighters to patrol Staten Island sites in wildfire brush trucks.

The parks on Staten Island are managed by various state, federal and local agencies.

Five sites are part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, managed by the U.S. National Park Service and patrolled by the United States Park Police:
*Great Kills Park
*Miller Field
*Fort Wadsworth
*Hoffman Island
*Swinburne Island

Two New York State parks are managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation:
*Mount Loretto Unique Area
*Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve
New York State Park Police officers patrol these parks and the surrounding streets.

 of State Forests, state wildlife management areas and Wetlands are managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation:
*Saint Francis Woodland
*Butler Manor Woods
*Arden Heights Woods
*Todt Hill Woods
*North Mount Loretto State Forest
*Lemon Creek Tidal Wetland Wildlife Management Area
*Blosers Wetland Wildlife Management Area
*Goethal Pond Wetland
*Bridge Creek Tidal Wetland
*Old Place Creek Tidal Wetland
*Oakwood Beach Wetland
*Sharrots Shoreline Natural Resource Area
*Sawmill Creek Wetland
The of NYS Department of Environmental Conservation land throughout the island are patrolled by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Police officers and one NYS DEC Forest Ranger, who has the dual task of law enforcement and fire suppression.

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation manages 156 parks, including:
*Conference House Park
*Willowbrook Park
*Graniteville Quarry Park
*Silver Lake Park
*Clove Lakes Park

The Fresh Kills Landfill was the world&#x27;s largest landfill before closing in 2001, although it was temporarily reopened that year to receive debris from the September 11 attacks. The landfill is being redeveloped as Freshkills Park, an area devoted to restoring habitat. The park will become New York City&#x27;s second largest public park when completed.

Average per capita income was $33,922, while median household income was $76,244. There are 181,199 housing units, with a 69.5% owner occupancy rate, the highest of the five boroughs, as well as a median value of $460,200. There are 166,150 households, with 2.82 persons per household.

At the 2010 Census, there were 468,730 people living in Staten Island, which is an increase of 5.6% since the 2000 Census.
Staten Island is the only New York City borough with a non-Hispanic White majority. According to the 2010 Census, 64.0% of the population was non-Hispanic White, down from 79% in 1990, 10.6% Black or African American, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.5% Asian, 0.2% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 2.6% of two or more races. 17.3% of Staten Island&#x27;s population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race).

The borough has the highest proportion of Italian Americans of any county in the United States. There is a significant Jewish community mainly in the Willowbrook area. Since the 2000 census, a large Russian community has been growing on Staten Island, particularly in the Rossville, South Beach, and Great Kills area. There is also a significant Polish community mainly in the South Beach and Midland Beach area and there is also a large Sri Lankan community on Staten Island, concentrated mainly on Victory Boulevard on the northeastern tip of Staten Island towards St. George. The Little Sri Lanka in the Tompkinsville neighborhood is one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka. The island houses more Liberians than anywhere outside Liberia, and has included three Liberian heads of state: David D. Kpormakpor, Ruth Perry, and George Weah. The borough is also home to a Chinanteco-speaking Indigenous Mexican American community.

Most of the borough&#x27;s African American and Hispanic residents live north of the Staten Island Expressway, or Interstate 278. In terms of religion, the borough&#x27;s population is largely Roman Catholic, peaking near 60% in the 2000 census. The Jewish community is slightly less numerous compared to other parts of the New York metropolitan area.

Per the 2009 American Community Survey, the median income for a household was $55,039, and the median income for a family was $64,333. Males had a median income of $50,081 versus $35,914 for females. The per capita income for the borough was $23,905. About 7.9% of families and 10.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those age 65 or over.

If each borough were ranked as a separate city, Staten Island would be the 44th most-populous in the United States.

===Languages===
, 70.39% (306,310) of Staten Island residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 10.02% (43,587) spoke Spanish, 3.14% (13,665) Russian, 3.11% (13,542) Italian, 2.39% (10,412) Chinese, 1.81% (7,867) other Indo-European languages, 1.38% (5,990) Arabic, 1.01% (4,390) Polish, 0.88% (3,812) Korean, 0.80% (3,500) Tagalog, 0.76% (3,308) other Asian languages, 0.62% (2,717) Urdu, 0.57% (2,479) other Indic languages, and African languages were spoken as a first language by 0.56% (2,458) of the population over the age of five.

==Government and politics==

===History===



















Since New York City&#x27;s consolidation in 1898, Staten Island has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a &quot;strong&quot; mayor-council system. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services on Staten Island.

The office of Borough president was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving the city&#x27;s budget and proposals for land use.

The Office of Borough President became one focal point for opinions over the Vietnam War when former intelligence agent and peace activist Ed Murphy ran for office in 1973, sponsored by the Staten Island Democratic Association. Murphy&#x27;s combat veteran status deflected traditional right-wing attacks on liberals, and the campaign facilitated the emergence of more liberal politics on Staten Island. In &quot;Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris&quot; (1989), the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court&#x27;s 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision.
Since 1990 the Borough president has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Staten Island&#x27;s Borough President is Vito Fossella, a Republican who was elected in November 2021. Fossella is the only Republican borough president in New York City.

===Politics===
Staten Island&#x27;s politics differ considerably from the rest of New York City. While the other four boroughs tend to be strongly Democratic, Staten Island is considered the most conservative, and the only one where Republicans usually do well. Although in 2005 44.7% of the borough&#x27;s registered voters were registered Democrats and 30.6% were registered Republicans, the Republican Party holds a majority of local public offices. Staten Island is the base of New York City&#x27;s Republican Party in citywide elections.

The main political divide in the borough is demarcated by the Staten Island Expressway; areas north of the Expressway tend to be more liberal while the south tends to be more conservative. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and law and order. Two out of Staten Island&#x27;s three New York City Council members are Republicans, including conservative commentator Joe Borelli.

In national elections, Staten Island is a Republican-leaning county. Staten Island has voted for a Democratic presidential nominee only four times since 1940: in 1964, 1996, 2000, and 2012. In the 2008 presidential election, Republican John McCain won 52% of the vote in the borough to Democrat Barack Obama&#x27;s 48%. In 2012, the borough flipped and was won by incumbent Democrat Barack Obama, who took 51% of the vote to Republican Mitt Romney&#x27;s 48%. This made the borough one of the few parts of the country where Barack Obama gained as compared to 2008. The Democratic Party&#x27;s gains on the island in the 2010s proved ephemeral. In 2016, Republican Donald Trump carried Staten Island by 15.1%, the largest margin of any presidential candidate since 1988. With 56.1% of the island-wide vote, Trump became the first-ever presidential candidate to receive over 100,000 votes out of Staten Island. The borough stayed Republican on election day 2020, delivering 56.9% and a record of more than 123,000 votes to President Donald Trump. In both elections, Staten Island was the only borough where Trump managed even 30 percent of the vote.

===Federal Representation===
As of 2023, Staten Island lies entirely within New York&#x27;s 11th congressional district, which also includes part of southwestern Brooklyn. It is currently represented by a Republican, Nicole Malliotakis, who was elected in 2020. The 11th district had been represented by Democrat Max Rose, until Malliotakis defeated him 53.1% to 46.8%.

===Local politics===
Staten Island representation in the state assembly has one Democrat and three Republicans. The 62nd, 63rd, and 64th districts are represented by Republicans Michael Reilly, Sam Pirozzolo, and Michael Tannousis. The 61st district has an elected Democrat, Charles Fall. Staten Island is split between two state Senate districts. Most of the island used to be represented by Republican John J. Marchi, the longest-serving legislator in state history; but is now represented by Republican Andrew Lanza; while the North Shore belongs to the district of Democrat Jessica Scarcella-Spanton. In 2018, Matthew Titone, a Democrat who at the time was a member of the New York State Assembly for the 61st District, was elected Surrogate Judge for Richmond County, which covers all of Staten Island. He was succeeded by Charles Fall, also a Democrat, and the first African American elected to the Assembly from Staten Island.

Until 2009, Staten Island was included with Brooklyn as part of New York State&#x27;s 2nd Judicial District. In that year, Staten Island secured Judicial Independence when a new law was signed, creating New York&#x27;s 13th Judicial District. Since 2009, Staten Island voters have had the opportunity to elect 5 Justices to the New York State Supreme Court.

Each of the city&#x27;s five counties (coterminous with each borough) has its own criminal court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. Michael McMahon, a Conservative Democrat, is the current District Attorney.

Staten Island has three City Council members, the smallest number among the five boroughs. As of 2023, the island&#x27;s city council delegation comprises two Republicans and one Democrat. The borough also has three administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents. In the 2009 election for city offices, Staten Island elected its first black official, Debi Rose, who defeated the incumbent Democrat in the North Shore city council seat in a primary and then went on to win the general election.

In New York City mayoral elections, Staten Island has traditionally been reliably Republican, having last voted Democratic for incumbent mayor Ed Koch in 1985. Staten Island&#x27;s high Republican turnout is considered one of the major factors that helped Rudy Giuliani win in 1993 against incumbent Democratic mayor David Dinkins, and also Michael Bloomberg in 2001 against Mark Green.

=== Secession from New York City ===
Secession from New York City has been a long-time hot-button issue on Staten Island. The &quot;Greater City&quot; exists as a result of actions of the New York State Legislature, and, as such, could be reduced in size by the same mechanism. A non-binding referendum was held in 1993 to consider whether it should be allowed to secede from the city. The New York City government and Mayor David Dinkins opposed the vote, contending that the referendum should not be permitted by the state unless the city issued a home rule message supporting it, which the city would not. Governor Mario Cuomo disagreed, and the vote went forward. Ultimately, 65% of Staten Island residents voted to secede through the approval of a new city charter making Staten Island an independent city, but implementation was blocked in the State Assembly.

The Staten Island secession movement was defused by the election of Rudy Giuliani as New York City mayor on the same ballot. He had campaigned on the promise that Staten Island&#x27;s grievances would be addressed. Giuliani&#x27;s plurality in his narrow victory over Dinkins was aided by overwhelming support from Staten Island. Two of the borough&#x27;s biggest demands were closing the Fresh Kills Landfill and making the Staten Island Ferry free, both of which were done. However, after the election of Bill de Blasio as Mayor in 2013 and the success of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom in 2016, interest in secession was revived. In 2019 and 2022, New York City councilman Joe Borelli announced his plan to introduce another set of bills to study the feasibility of secession.

== Tourism ==
In 2009, Borough president James Molinaro started a program to increase tourism on Staten Island. This program included a new website, a &quot;Staten Island Attractions&quot; video that is aired in both the Staten Island and the Manhattan Whitehall ferry terminals, as well as informational kiosks at the terminals, which supply printed information on Staten Island attractions, entertainment and restaurants.

Staten Island is known as the borough of parks because of its numerous parks. Some well known parks are Clove Lakes, Silver Lake, Greenbelt and High Rock. Paulo&#x27;s Peak (formerly Moses Mountain), a hill known for its view of the borough, is the location where Robert Moses wanted to build the Richmond Parkway before protests defeated this arrangement. It is now a key point of Staten Island for tourists.

==Culture==
===Local support for the arts===

Artists and musicians have been moving to Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore so they can be in close proximity to Manhattan while having an affordable space to live and work. Filmmakers, most of whom work independently, also play an important part in Staten Island&#x27;s art scene, which has been recognized by the local government. Staten Island Arts (formerly The Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island) is Staten Island&#x27;s local arts council and helps support local artists and cultural organizations with regrants, workshops, folklife and arts-in-education programs, and advocacy. Conceived by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation to introduce independent and international films to a broad and diverse audience, the Staten Island Film Festival (SIFF) held its first four-day festival in 2006.

=== Golf ===

Staten Island has four golf courses. La Tourette, Silver Lake, and South Shore are public, while Richmond County Country Club is the only private country club in New York City. The New York City Amateur is conducted annually at La Tourette Golf Course by the Staten Island Golf Association.

By some estimates, Staten Island has been the site of nearly a dozen golf courses. 
*Harbour Hills Golf Links near Brighton, Lafayette, and Prospect Avenue in New Brighton opened in 1878 and is said to have conducted the island&#x27;s first golf tournaments. In 1898, the club opened a new clubhouse opposite the Brighton Heights Inn along Castleton Avenue. In 1904, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac reported that the club had 250 members and had been officially incorporated in 1896. Today most of the property is known as Goodhue Park and Allison Pond Park.
*Clovena Club was in the vicinity of Clove Road and Victory Boulevard in 1897.
*Staten Island Cricket and Base Ball Club had a course in Livingston and was a Charter member of the Metropolitan Golf Association. Besides the &quot;baseball&quot; name, it is also seen in journals at the time as Staten Island Country Club and Staten Island Cricket Club. As with other clubs making the transition from cricket to golf, the organization completed planning for what would become the Fox Hills Golf Course by identifying the site and hiring an architect, but abandoned golf in 1899. 
*Fox Hills Golf Course was one of the island&#x27;s first true 18-hole courses. It opened in 1900 with over 200 members and had nearly 275 members by 1904. Fox Hills was semi-private, and attracted players from around the New York metropolitan area to its location in Clifton off Vanderbilt Avenue and Targee Street, where its clubhouse was one of the largest in the country. Prolific golf architect Tom Bendelow was selected to develop the course&#x27;s original layout. Fox Hills&#x27;s head professional, Scotsman Isaac Mackie, worked with Walter Travis in 1906 to revamp the golf course, and in 1928 Donald Ross made additional changes. Mackie played in at least 12 U.S. Opens from 1901 to 1921, and won the Eastern PGA Championship in 1908 at Fox Hills. From 1899 through 1926 the Staten Island Amateur was played annually at either Fox Hills or Richmond County Country Club. Like many private golf courses of that era, the Great Depression, as well as the growing number of public courses, contributed to the end of the club and Fox Hills closed in 1935.
*Tysen Manor Golf Course, which was located on site between Hylan Boulevard, Mill Road, New Dorp Lane, and Tysens Lane, was in existence from 1928 until 1936. The course was operated by Henry H. Nutt. Tavern on the Green, a restaurant that closed in 1976, was originally the golf course&#x27;s clubhouse, near the location of the current post office on Hylan Boulevard.
*Mayflower Country Club&#x27;s golf course, designed by Devereux Emmet with Alfred H. Tull, was built on a tract in Huguenot in 1928. The club had designs for sporting facilities that included an indoor swimming pool and tennis courts, but member funding dried up once the stock market crashed in 1929. Regardless, Frank B. Sterner &amp; Co. built the country club&#x27;s clubhouse for $200,000 in 1930, and the first annual club championship was conducted in September 1931. New York City took over the site in 1966 and opened South Shore Golf Course in 1967.
*Willowbrook State School Golf Course was a 9-hole layout on Forest Hill Road that opened in May 1945 and closed in the 1960s. The Metropolitan section of the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America (PGA) funded construction of the golf course at Halloran General Hospital in support of the U.S. Army and the war effort. Robert Trent Jones Sr. designed a layout that consisted of all par-3s on . Jones modeled the holes on what he thought were the great par-3s of the world and the unique course opened with complimentary reviews.

Bill Britton, a tournament winner on the PGA Tour, and Jim Albus, a multiple winner on the PGA Tour Champions, learned the game on Staten Island. Both won the prestigious Metropolitan Open. Albus was the head professional at La Tourette and a winner of the Senior Players Championship. Carolyn Cudone, raised on Staten Island, won a record five straight U.S. Senior Women&#x27;s Amateur championships between 1968 and 1972, the most wins in a row by an individual in any United States Golf Association (USGA) championship. Frank Esposito, who learned the game on Staten Island, won the 2014 PGA Tour Champions National Qualifying Tournament. Sean Kelly, a regular golfer at Silver Lake Golf Course, took medalist honors at both the First and Second Stage of the 2018 Web.com Tour Qualifying Tournament.

Frank Hannigan was the USGA Executive Director and a TV golf analyst for ABC. He wrote for the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; as a golf columnist and was influential in bringing the US Open to Shinnecock Hills and Bethpage State Park, and promoted the creation of the New York City Amateur. Staten Island native Joe Moresco was President of the Metropolitan section of the PGA in 1969 and 1970, was the Section&#x27;s Professional of the Year in 1971 and is a member of the PGA Metropolitan Section Hall of Fame, along with Jim Albus.

=== Ice hockey ===
The following National Hockey League (NHL) players were born on Staten Island: Nick Fotiu, Kevin Labanc, Zach Aston-Reese, Joe Gambardella.

=== Motor sports ===
From 1953 until 1972 stock car races were held weekly from May until October at a 1/5th-mile asphalt racetrack on Staten Island. The local dairy, owned by the Weissglass family, financed promoter Gabe Rispoli with $700 so he could make improvements to an existing sporting facility that became known as Weissglass Stadium.

There was a controversial plan by the International Speedway Corporation (ISC) to build an 82,000-seat race track on the island that would host National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) races by 2010. The ISC abandoned the plan in 2006 citing financial concerns, and sold the parcel in 2013.

=== Running ===
The New York City Marathon is a foot race run over a course through the five boroughs of New York City. The marathon starts each year on Staten Island.

The Ocean Breeze Track and Field Athletic Complex is a state-of-the-art indoor track and field facility in Ocean Breeze Park that is part of the South Beach section of Staten Island. On November 19, 2015, the complex became the first facility in the United States to be recognized as a certified International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) facility. A project under Mayor Bloomberg&#x27;s Design Excellence initiative, the athletic complex was designed as part of the PlaNYC 110-acre Ocean Breeze regional park. The project, launched in 2007, encountered several delays, including a four-month setback due to Hurricane Sandy that exposed the vulnerability of generators, transformers, and electronic control rooms all of which had to be raised to avoid storm-surge flooding.

=== Swimming ===
In 1961, a lifeguard became the first person to swim around Staten Island. In 2023, Leslie Hamilton became the first woman to swim around Staten Island, which she did by swimming 37 miles in 14.5 hours.

=== Tennis ===
Tennis is said to have made its United States debut on Staten Island. The first American National championship was played at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club (now known as the Staten Island Cricket Club) in September 1880. Tennis was introduced in Staten Island by Mary Ewing Outerbridge.

Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Duffield Wrenn four-time U.S. singles championship winner, and one of the first inductees in the International Tennis Hall of Fame was a tennis member at Richmond County Country Club. His brother George Wrenn and friend Arthur E. Foote were also members.

==Transportation==

===Bridges===
Staten Island is connected to New Jersey via three vehicular bridges and one railroad bridge. The Outerbridge Crossing to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, is at the southern end of New York State Route 440, and the Bayonne Bridge to Bayonne, New Jersey, is at the northern end of NY 440; both ends of NY 440 continue into New Jersey as Route 440. The Goethals Bridge, carrying Interstate 278, connects Elizabeth, New Jersey, onto the Staten Island Expressway. Just north of the Goethals, the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge carries freight between the northwest part of the island and Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Staten Island Expressway is connected to Brooklyn via the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which carries I-278. Pedestrian links to Staten Island are available via a footpath on the Bayonne and Goethals Bridges.

From 1964 to 1977, Staten Island contained the longest vertical lift, steel arch, and suspension bridges in the world: the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, Bayonne Bridge, and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, respectively. The Arthur Kill Bridge still holds the title for longest vertical lift bridge, while the Bayonne and Verrazzano bridges are now the 5th- and 14th-longest in their respective categories.

===Roads===

As of 2015, 82% of Staten Island households owned a car, the highest rate of any borough. Citywide, the rate was 45%. Unlike the other four boroughs, Staten Island has no large, numbered grid system for its roads. New Dorp&#x27;s grid has a few numbered streets, but they do not intersect with any numbered avenues. Some neighborhoods organize their street names alphabetically. In addition to the island&#x27;s highways (I-278, NY 440, Korean War Veterans Parkway), the borough&#x27;s neighborhoods are connected by a number of heavily trafficked roads including Hylan Boulevard, the longest street in New York City.

===Public transit===
As of 2021, public transportation on the island is limited to:
*New York City Department of Transportation (Staten Island Ferry)
*Hornblower Cruises (NYC Ferry – St. George route)
*Staten Island Railway service from St. George to Tottenville
*MTA Regional Bus Operations (local service on Staten Island, including some service to Brooklyn; and express service to Manhattan)

====Ferry====
The Staten Island Ferry is the only transportation directly from Staten Island to Manhattan, roughly a 25-minute trip. The St. George Terminal, first opened in 1886, was rebuilt in 1951 and again in the 2000s. The ferry has been fare-free since 1997. The Staten Island Ferry transports over 60,000 passengers per day. It runs 24/7 every 15 to 20 minutes during weekday rush hours and every 30 minutes at other times. The ferries and both of its terminals are patrolled by a combination of the New York City Department of Transportation, New York City Police Department, United States Coast Guard and private security contractors.

An NYC Ferry route operates between St. George Terminal and Manhattan&#x27;s West Side since August 2021, calling at Battery Park City/Vesey Street and terminating at Pier 79/Midtown West. This route is operated separately from the Staten Island Ferry and charges a fare.

====Trains====
The Staten Island Railway, currently the borough&#x27;s only passenger railroad, traverses the island 24/7 from its northeastern tip to its southwestern tip. The Staten Island Railway opened in 1860 and was owned and operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) until July 1, 1971, when the line was bought by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Staten Island Railway continued to have its own railway police, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police, until 2005 when the 25-officer police force was consolidated into the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department.

Staten Island is the only borough not served by the New York City Subway. A subway tunnel called the Staten Island Tunnel started construction in 1923, but was abandoned two years later; the completed portion lies dormant beneath Owl&#x27;s Head Park in Brooklyn. Today, express bus service is provided by NYC Transit throughout Staten Island to Lower Manhattan, Union Square, and Midtown Manhattan.

A right of way exists along the north shore of Staten Island. This North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway was built, owned, and operated by the B&amp;O, which used it for passenger service until 1953. It then became a B&amp;O freight line until the 1980s, when service was stopped. There have been proposals to revive the abandoned right-of-way for passenger service as a rail line or for use as bus rapid transit. There is also a proposal to build a West Shore Light Rail along New York State Route 440, running from the Staten Island Railway main line on the South Shore, to the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail in Bayonne, New Jersey. The South Beach Branch of the Staten Island Railway, which transported summer vacationers to South Beach, Staten Island, also ceased service in 1953.

====Buses====

MTA Regional Bus Operations provides local and limited bus service with over 30 lines throughout Staten Island. Most lines feed into the St. George Terminal in the northeastern corner of the borough. Three lines (the ) provide service over the Verrazzano Bridge to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The S79 SBS is the only Select Bus Service route in the borough. Beginning September 4, 2007, the MTA began offering bus service from Staten Island to Bayonne, New Jersey, over the Bayonne Bridge via the limited-stop bus, allowing passengers to connect to the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail&#x27;s 34th Street station, giving Staten Island residents a new route into Manhattan. Despite Staten Island&#x27;s proximity to New Jersey, the S89 is the only route directly into New Jersey from Staten Island via public transportation.

Express bus service to Manhattan (via the Verrazzano Bridge or Goethals Bridge) is also available for a $6.75 fare each way. The are the only express routes to run outside of weekday commuter hours.

===Freight rail===
Conrail Shared Assets Operations operates freight rail service for customers of CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway via the Travis Branch, with a intermodal on-dock rail facility on the West Shore of Staten Island, which connects to the National Rail System via the Arthur Kill Rail Bridge to New Jersey. In addition to the intermodal on-dock rail yard, the Conrail Staten Island Rail line also connects to the Sanitation Department&#x27;s waste transfer station. Conrail railroad police officers patrol and respond to emergencies along the freight line.

==Infrastructure==

===Hospitals===
Staten Island is the only borough without a hospital operated by New York City. The Richmond University Medical Center and the Staten Island University Hospital are privately operated.

===Jails===
Staten Island is the only borough without a New York City Department of Correction major detention center. The Department of Corrections only maintains court holding jails at the three court buildings on Staten Island for inmates attending court. The various police agencies on Staten Island maintain in-house holding jails for post arrest detention prior to transfer to a corrections jail in another borough.

The Staten Island county sheriff operated a jail system on Staten Island until 1942, when the Staten Island jail system was transferred from the county sheriff&#x27;s department to the New York City Department of Corrections and eventually closed. In 1976, the New York State Department of Correctional Services opened the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility of Staten Island, but the facility was closed in 2011.

==Nicknames==
Staten Island has acquired a number of nicknames over the decades, some connected to the notion that it is considered an afterthought by other New York City residents. The &quot;Forgotten Borough&quot; was first used nearly 100 years ago in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that quoted a real estate executive. The phrase was more used during the secession movement of the 1990s, and came into greater use in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

The island has also been referred to as the &quot;borough of parks&quot; due to its vast swaths of protected parkland and green spaces. The island has 12,300 acres of protected parkland and over 170 parks. The hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, which originates from Staten Island, coined the nickname &quot;Shaolin Land&quot; (later simply Shaolin) for Staten Island as part of their slang. Some have also taken to calling the island &quot;The Rock&quot;, a moniker more commonly associated with Alcatraz, with this nickname&#x27;s first appearance in print being a &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 2007.

==International relations==
Staten Island is twinned with Ulcinj, Montenegro.

<doc id="127063" wikidata="Q2210910" url="?curid=127063" title="Airmont, New York">
<text>Airmont is a village in the town of Ramapo, Rockland County, New York, United States, located north of the state of New Jersey, east of Suffern, south of Montebello, and west of Chestnut Ridge. The population was 10,166 at the 2020 census.

The village of Airmont, incorporated in 1991, is a consolidation of the hamlets of Tallman, Airmont and South Monsey. Joseph Berger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a 1997 article that Airmont was one of several Ramapo villages formed &quot;to preserve the sparse Better Homes and Garden ambiance that attracted them to Rockland County.&quot; In 2005, Peter Applebome of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Airmont was &quot;slapped around enough by the courts to be something other than a virginal player in any discrimination case&quot; since it ran into legal resistance to its development laws.

==History==
In April 1991, creation of the village of Airmont was allowed in the town. Airmont had 9,500 people, including around 250 Orthodox Jews and many non-Orthodox Jews. The founders of the town said that they intended for &quot;strong zoning&quot; to preserve the character of the community. William P. Barr, the United States Attorney General, and Otto G. Obermaier, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, filed a suit against Airmont and the town of Ramapo; Barr and Obermaier said that Airmont created a zoning plan intended to exclude Orthodox Jews from living in the village and &quot;that other individuals acting at the behest of the defendants have engaged in a pattern of harassment against Orthodox Jews in the village.&quot; The officials cited the Fair Housing Act as the relevant law. The plaintiffs said that, because many Orthodox do not travel by car on Saturdays, preventing the creation of a synagogue would exclude Orthodox from the community. The Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith supported the suit. The Spring Valley Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had opposed the creation of Airmont. As a result of the suit Airmont revised its zoning code to allow religious sites. Airmont&#x27;s zoning restricted synagogues to lots, which were too costly for most Orthodox congregations. A federal judge ruled that the code was discriminatory and ordered Airmont to revise the code; the legal case continued by 1997.

Around 2005, Congregation Mischknois Lavier Yakov proposed building a yeshiva and a boarding school with a 70-adult student dormitory (with provisions for their families, which could result in a population of several hundred individuals) on of land. Town residents opposed this, causing legal action including meetings and lawsuits. In 2005, the U.S. federal government filed a civil rights lawsuit accusing Airmont of discriminating on the basis of religion and violating the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) and the Fair Housing Act by banning boarding houses.

In 2011, Airmont and the federal government reached a settlement and Airmont agreed to amend its zoning code to allow Mischknois Lavier Yakov to build a school with student housing. The agreement included a $10,000 civil penalty against Airmont and marked the second time federal prosecutors had intervened in Airmont zoning affairs since its 1991 incorporation. In 2018 nothing has happened and the zoning has expired. The congregation complex will most likely never happen.

On December 2, 2020, the Department of Justice filed another lawsuit, alleging that there was religious discrimination through land use policies that violate previous court rulings and federal law.

In September 2021, the Republican deputy mayor of Airmont, Brian Downey, was arrested on multiple weapons charges after police discovered 16 assault weapons, 13 illegal silencers, and other guns and gun parts inside his home while executing a search warrant. Investigators also found a stash of fake IDs, including fake FBI credentials. In February 2023, Downey pled guilty to a federal gun charge as part of a plea deal; by pleading guilty to a felony, he automatically forfeited his position as deputy mayor under New York state law.

In October 2023, the Department of Justice settled its discrimination lawsuit with the village, over zoning of places of worship. Negotiation of the settlement was assisted by the fact that, since the lawsuit had been filed, control of the Village Board had passed to the local Hasidic community and its allies.

==History==

The name &quot;Blauvelt&quot;, of Dutch origin, is that of a prominent family that settled in the area in the 17th century. The etymology of the name probably comes from the coat of arms adopted by the first Blauvelt, Pieter Blauwveld, a prominent trader in the Netherlands. Literally, it means &quot;blue-field&quot;, or &quot;blue pasture fields&quot;, likely a reference to the blue and yellow shields hung on Blauwveld&#x27;s ships (a common 14th century Dutch method of identifying the owner). The first Blauvelt in America was a peasant farmer who cultivated tobacco on the estate of Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the first patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck near Albany, New York, in 1638.

In 1909, New York State purchased property in Blauvelt to create Camp Bluefields, a large rifle range used to train members of the New York National Guard prior to World War I. The property was later used by the YWCA, ROTC, Columbia University and the U.S. Army for various purposes before being abandoned following World War II. The land is today the site of Blauvelt State Park.

In 1972, Robert Salvia and Professor Dr. Paul Olson of the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, a research unit of Columbia University located on a campus in Palisades, New York, discovered several 200-million-year-old dinosaur tracks that were identified as being from the coelophysis. Some of these tracks were sent to the New York State Museum in Albany, New York for identification and preservation. The fossils date from the Triassic period and are claimed to be the only dinosaur tracks ever discovered in the state of New York.

The 914 Sound Studios was a musical recording studio in the 1970s. Several albums were recorded in Blauvelt, including the title track of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s album &quot;Born to Run&quot; in 1974.

===Historical markers===

The Jacob J. Blauvelt house and its four remaining acres of land had been in the Blauvelt family since the time it was built, in 1832, up until when it was acquired by the Historical Society of Rockland County in 1970. The Blauvelt family first arrived in America in 1638, and first arrived in Rockland County in 1683. Their genealogy today contains more than 26,000 names.
* Johannes J. Blauvelt - 514 Western Highway - Jacob A. Blauvelt and family, the first of seven generations of Blauvelts to live on this farm, occupied a log structure nearby early in the 18th century. Jacob&#x27;s son, Johannes J. Blauvelt, built the sandstone south wing of the home ca. 1755. The center section was added after the Revolutionary War, and the north wing ca. 1862. This house was used as an officers&#x27; club during World War II.
* Jacob J. Blauvelt (1757–1834) - 525 Western Highway
* Johannes Isaac Blauvelt - 820 Western Highway - Johannes (1743–1828) was a charter member of the Greenbush Church. His son David began Rockland County&#x27;s first tobacco farm and business there. Abraham M. Blauvelt (gunsmith) repaired guns and watches here and rented boats on the Hackensack River in the rear. The Blauvelt family occupied these premises for 135 years. The Dutch farmhouse is located on the northwest corner of the Tappen Patent and contains many original construction features.

* Blauvelt-Norris-Burr House - 608 Western Highway - The main section and south kitchen of this Dutch home were built ca. 1790-1800, the north addition ca. 1840, on land previously owned by David Bogert. The first known occupant was Garret I. Blauvelt. In 1853 the farm was acquired by John S. Norris, an architect and builder. In 1885 it was purchased by the Burr family who owned it for 56 years. The south chimney of the main section of the house differs from the north, in that it contains three fireplaces off a center chimney, suggesting it is the remnant of a previous building. In checking with the Historical Society, there are two maps of early Rockland County homesteads — the earlier one dated 1750. The Blauvelt-Norris-Burr House appears on that map suggesting it was built before 1750. Also, the house is larger than most in the area, and the construction of the upper floor suggests it is not as old as the bottom. Photographs from the later part of the 1800s show the addition of a front porch, which explains the unusually large section of clapboard between the stone foundation and roof. 

===Landmarks and places of interest===
* Greenbush Presbyterian Church - Western Highway - In October 1812, ten founders, nine of whom were Blauvelts, held their first organizational meeting for this new church. The first stone church was dedicated in 1824. It was destroyed by fire in 1835. A second church built on the old walls was dedicated in 1837. It burned in 1882. The present church, in the Gothic style, was dedicated in 1883, with the tower and bell erected in 1896. Many Blauvelts are buried in the cemetery

<text>The bugle is a simple signaling brass instrument with a wide conical bore. It normally has no valves or other pitch-altering devices, and is thus limited to its natural harmonic notes, and pitch is controlled entirely by varying the air and embouchure.

==History==

:&quot;See also Clarion&quot; and &quot;Natural trumpet&quot;

The English word &quot;bugle&quot; comes from a combination of words. From French, it reaches back to &quot;cor buglèr&quot; and &quot;bugleret&quot;, indicating a signaling horn made from a small cow&#x27;s horn. Going back further, it touches on Latin, &quot;buculus,&quot; meaning bullock. Old English also influences the modern word with &quot;bugle&quot;, meaning &quot;wild ox.&quot;

The name indicates an animal&#x27;s (cow&#x27;s) horn, which was the way horns were made in Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The modern bugle is made from metal tubing, and that technology has roots which date back to the Roman Empire, as well as to the Middle East during the Crusades, where Europeans re-discovered metal-tubed trumpets and brought them home.

Historically, horns were curved trumpets, conical, often made from ox or other animal horns, from shells, from hollowed ivory such as the olifant. There existed another tradition of trumpets made of straight metal tubes of brass or silver that went back in Europe as far as the Greeks (salpinx) and Romans (Roman tuba), and further back to the Etruscans, Assyrians and Egyptians (King Tut&#x27;s Trumpet). After the fall of Rome, when much of Europe was separated from the remaining Eastern Roman Empire, the straight, tubular sheet-metal trumpet disappeared and curved horns were Europe&#x27;s trumpet.

The sheet-metal tubular trumpet persisted in the Middle East and Central Asia as the nafir and karnay, and during the Reconquista and Crusades, Europeans began to build them again, having seen these instruments in their wars. The first made were the añafil in Spain and buisine in France and elsewhere. Then Europeans took a step that hadn&#x27;t been part of trumpet making since the Roman (buccina and cornu); they figured out how to bend tubes without ruining them and by the 1400s were experimenting with new instruments.

Whole lines of brass instruments were created, including initially examples like the clarion and the natural trumpet. These were bent-tube variations that shrunk the long tubes into a manageable size and controlled the way the instruments sounded. One of the variations was to create &quot;sickle shaped&quot; horn or &quot;hunting horns&quot; in the 15th century. By the 18th century, Germans had created a &quot;half moon&quot; shaped horn called the &quot;halbmondbläser&quot;, used by Jäger battalions. During the last quarter of the 18th century, or by 1800, the half-moon horn was bent further into a loop, possibly first by William Shaw (or his workshop) of London. The instrument was used militarily at that point as the &quot;bugle horn.&quot;

In 1758, the &quot;Halbmondbläser&quot; (half-moon) was used by light infantry from Hanover, and continued until after 1813. It was crescent-shaped (hence its name) and comfortably carried by a shoulder strap attached at the mouthpiece and bell. It first spread to England where as the &quot;bugle horn&quot; it was gradually accepted by the light dragoons (1764), the Grenadier Guards (1772), light artillery (1788) and light infantry.

18th-century cavalry did not normally use a standard bugle, but rather an early trumpet that might be mistaken for a bugle today, as it lacked keys or valves, but had a more gradual taper and a smaller bell, producing a sound more easily audible at close range but with less carrying power over distance. The earliest bugles were shaped in a coil – typically a double coil, but also a single or triple coil – similar to the modern horn, and were used to communicate during hunts and as announcing-instruments for coaches (somewhat akin to today&#x27;s automobile horn). Predecessors and relatives of the bugle included the post horn, the Pless horn (sometimes called the &quot;Prince Pless horn&quot;), the bugle horn, and the shofar, among others. The ancient Roman army used the buccina.

==Uses==

Pitch control is done by varying the player&#x27;s air and embouchure. Consequently, the bugle is limited to notes within the harmonic series. Scores for standard bugle calls use the five notes of the &quot;bugle scale&quot;.
The bugle is used mainly in the military, where the bugle call is used to indicate the daily routines of camp. Historically, the bugle was used in the cavalry to relay instructions from officers to soldiers during battle. They were used to assemble the leaders and to give marching orders to the camps.

The bugle is also used in Boy Scout troops and in the Boys&#x27; Brigade.

The Rifles, an infantry regiment in the British Army, has retained the bugle for ceremonial and symbolic purposes, as did other rifle regiments before it. When originally formed in 1800, the Rifle Corps were the first dedicated light infantry unit in the British Army and were allowed a number of unique accouterments that were believed to be better suited for skirmishing, such as their green jackets. Other infantry used drums when marching and had whistles to signal when skirmishing, but the Rifle Corps was a much larger body of men that would be expected to spread out over a large area under a single commander. As a result, the bugle was taken from cavalry traditions because signals could pass much further without the need for repeats. The buglers in each battalion are headed by the bugle major, a senior non-commissioned officer holding the rank of sergeant or above.

The bugle has also been used as a sign of peace in the case of a surrender.

In most military units, the bugle can be fitted with a small banner or tabard (occasionally gold fringed) with the arms of its reporting service branch or unit.

In military tradition, the Last Post or Taps is the bugle call that signifies the end of the day&#x27;s activities. It is also sounded at military funerals to indicate that the soldier has gone to his final rest and at commemorative services such as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and Remembrance Day in Canada
==Variations==
The cornet is sometimes erroneously considered a valved bugle, but the cornet was derived from more narrow-bored instruments, the French () and ().

Keyed bugles () were invented in the early 19th century. In England, a patent for one design was taken out by Joseph Halliday in 1811 and became known as the Kent bugle. This bugle established itself in military band music in Britain and America, and its popularity is indicated by the existence of many published method books and arrangements. It was in wide use until about 1850 by which time it had been largely replaced by the cornet. Richard Willis, appointed the first bandmaster of the United States Military Academy&#x27;s West Point Band in 1817, wrote and performed many works for the keyed bugle.

Since the mid 19th century, bugles have been made with piston valves.

<text> (; ) is a French daily afternoon newspaper. It is the main publication of Le Monde Group and reported an average circulation of 480,000 copies per issue in 2022, including 40,000 sold abroad. It has been available online since 1995, and it is often the only French newspaper easily obtainable in non-French-speaking countries. It should not be confused with the monthly publication &quot;&quot;, of which has 51% ownership but is editorially independent. is considered one of the French newspapers of record, along with &quot;Libération&quot; and . A Reuters Institute poll in 2021 found that is the most trusted French newspaper. 

The paper&#x27;s journalistic side has a collegial form of organization, in which most journalists are tenured, unionized, and financial stakeholders in the business. While shareholders appoint the company&#x27;s CEO, the editor is elected by &quot;Le Monde&quot;″s journalists to defend the newsroom&#x27;s independence. 

&quot;Le Monde&quot; has often broken major scandals, for instance, by directly implicating President François Mitterrand in the sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; in New Zealand. In contrast to other world newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was traditionally focused on offering analysis and opinion, as opposed to being a newspaper of record. It de-emphasized maximum coverage of the news in favor of thoughtful interpretation of current events. In recent years the paper has established a greater distinction between fact and opinion.

 was founded by Hubert Beuve-Méry at the request of Charles de Gaulle (as Chairman of the Provisional Government of the French Republic) on 19 December 1944, shortly after the Liberation of Paris from Nazism, and has published continuously since its first edition. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Vie-Le Monde Group expanded under editor Jean-Marie Colombani with a number of acquisitions; however, its profitability was not sufficient to cover the large debts it took on to fund this expansion, and it sought new investors in 2010 to keep the company from bankruptcy. In June 2010, French investors Matthieu Pigasse, Pierre Bergé, and Xavier Niel acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper.

== History ==

 was founded in 1944, at the request of General Charles de Gaulle, after the German army had been driven from Paris during World War II. The paper took over the headquarters and layout of , which had been the most important newspaper in France, but its reputation had suffered during the Occupation. Beuve-Méry reportedly demanded total editorial independence as the condition for his taking on the project. &quot;Le Monde&quot; began publishing a weekly digest edition in English on 23 April 1969.

In December 2006, on the 60th anniversary of its publishing début, moved into new headquarters in Boulevard Auguste-Blanqui, 13th arrondissement of Paris. The building—formerly the headquarters of Air France—was refashioned by Bouygues from the designs of Christian de Portzamparc. The building&#x27;s façade has an enormous fresco adorned by doves (drawn by Plantu) flying towards Victor Hugo, symbolising freedom of the press. In 2008, was found guilty of defamation for saying that Spanish football club FC Barcelona was connected to a doctor involved in steroid use. The Spanish court fined the newspaper nearly $450,000.

In 2014, Groupe Le Monde announced that would move into a new headquarters, also in the 13th arrondissement, around 2017, with space for 1,200 people. In April 2016, two reporters were denied visas to visit Algeria as part of the French Prime Minister press convoy to Algeria. The denial of visas to reporters caused some French media to boycott the event, including &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and &quot;France Inter&quot;. had previously published the names of Algerian officials directly involved with the Panama Papers scandal. Coverage of the scandal in included a front-page photo of President of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika. However, the paper clarified in its next edition that Bouteflika was not directly implicated, but maintained that his associates were. Bouteflika opened a libel suit against , which was later dropped after the newspaper apologised.

In June 2017, Le Monde was certified as an International Fact-Checking Network member of the Poynter Institute.。

In 2023, Le Monde banned fossil fuel advertising to tackle climate change.

&quot;&quot; is regarded as France&#x27;s leading newspaper of record. In November 2023, &quot;Le Monde&quot; joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

==Ownership==
In June 2010, investors Matthieu Pigasse, Pierre Bergé, and Xavier Niel acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper. In October 2018, staff learned that Pigasse had sold 49% of his stake in the company to Czech businessman Daniel Křetínský. &#x27;s Independency Group, a minority shareholder that aims to protect the paper&#x27;s editorial independence, had not been informed of the sale, and asked Pigasse and Křetínský to sign an &quot;approval agreement&quot; that would give the Independency Group the right to approve or reject any controlling shareholder. , they had not done so.

==Publication schedule==
 is published around midday, and the cover date on the masthead is the following day&#x27;s. For instance, the issue released at midday on 15 March shows 16 March on the masthead. It is available on newsstands in France on the day of release and received by mail subscribers on the masthead date. The Saturday issue is a double one, for Saturday and Sunday, thus the latest edition can be found on newsstands from Monday to Friday included, while subscribers will receive it from Tuesday to Saturday.

== LeMonde.fr ==
 was among the first French newspapers on the web, with its first web edition on 19 December 1995. It is among the 50 most visited websites in France. Starting in the 2000s allowed its subscribers to publish a blog on its website. These blogs were called the &quot;les blogs abonnées du Monde.fr&quot;. On 10 April 2019, announced that it would be closing its blog platform on 5 June 2019. Although the reasons for the closing of the blogs were unclear, it could be linked to the dominance of social networks like Facebook. launched an English language edition of its news website on 7 April 2022, featuring its articles translated from French.

== Social media presence ==
On January 20, 2025, &quot;Le Monde&quot; announced its withdrawal from the social network X (formerly Twitter), citing the &quot;intensification of activism&quot; by its owner Elon Musk and the &quot;growing toxicity of discussions&quot; on the platform. The editorial team emphasized that, although difficult, this decision aligns with their commitment to preserving editorial independence and avoiding contributing to an environment harmful to public debate.

== Politics ==
In 1981, backed the election of socialist François Mitterrand, partly on the grounds that the alternation of the political party in government would be beneficial to the democratic character of the state. The paper endorsed centre-right candidate Édouard Balladur in the 1995 French presidential election, and Ségolène Royal, the Socialist Party candidate, in the 2007 French presidential election.

== Reception ==

According to the Mitrokhin Archive investigators, (KGB codename VESTNIK, &quot;messenger&quot;) was the KGB&#x27;s key outlet for Soviet disinformation in the French media. The archive identified two senior journalists and several contributors who were used in the operations (see also the article on Russian influence operations in France). Michel Legris, a former journalist with the paper, wrote &quot;Le Monde tel qu&#x27;il est&quot; (&quot;Le Monde as it is&quot;) in 1976. According to him, the journal minimized the atrocities the Cambodian Khmer Rouge committed. In their 2003 book titled &quot;La Face cachée du Monde&quot; (&quot;The Hidden face of &quot;Le Monde&quot;&quot;), authors Pierre Péan and Philippe Cohen alleged that Colombani and then-editor Edwy Plenel had shown, amongst other things, partisan bias and had engaged in financial dealings that compromised the paper&#x27;s independence. It also accused the paper of dangerously damaging the authority of the French state by having revealed various political scandals (notably corruption scandals surrounding Jacques Chirac, the &quot;Irish of Vincennes&quot; affair, and the sinking of a Greenpeace boat, the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, by French intelligence under President François Mitterrand). This book remains controversial, but it attracted much attention and media coverage in France and worldwide at the time of its publication. Following a lawsuit, the authors and the publisher agreed in 2004 not to proceed with any reprinting.

<doc id="127072" wikidata="Q1415138" url="?curid=127072" title="Three Imaginary Boys">
<text>Three Imaginary Boys is the debut studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 8 May 1979 by Fiction Records, and reached number 44 on the UK Albums Chart. It was later released in the United States, Canada, and Australia with a different track listing as a compilation album titled &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;.

== Production and content ==
The record company decided which songs were put on the album and running order, as well as the cover artwork, without Robert Smith&#x27;s consent. For all Cure albums since, Smith has ensured that he is given complete creative control over the final product before it goes on sale. The &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; soundcheck, with vocals sung by Michael Dempsey, was not supposed to be on the album, and was removed for the American release. Smith has stated that &quot;songs like &#x27;Object&#x27; and &#x27;World War&#x27; and our cover of &#x27;Foxy Lady&#x27; were [producer] Chris Parry&#x27;s choice&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; was originally released on 8 May 1979 by record label Fiction.

The album was reissued on 29 November 2004 and featured a second disc of unreleased material, including songs recorded under the band name Easy Cure with Porl Thompson. It was originally supposed to be released in early 2004 along with the band&#x27;s next three studio albums (&quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Pornography&quot;), but was delayed multiple times before being released by itself at the end of 2004. As it featured a variety of old songs, it was the only Deluxe Edition by the band that did not include an alternate version of each song on the first disc. Some of the early booklets in the reissue had missing lyrics, which were made available on the Cure&#x27;s website in PDF form. All copies since contain the lyrics. A one-disc reissue was released on 5 September 2005, containing only the original album. It was also released in the standard jewel case rather than in a box. In some countries, the Deluxe Edition has become a collector&#x27;s item as production was phased out, being replaced by the more economic single-disc version.

== Reception ==
Despite Smith&#x27;s displeasure with the record, &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; was well received critically at the time of its release. &quot;Sounds&quot;″ Dave McCullough praised it in a 5-star review and noted: &quot;The Cure are going somewhere different on each track, the ideas are startling and disarming.&quot; McCullough noted the variety of the material and qualified &quot;Grinding Halt&quot; as a &quot;pop song that reminds you of the Isley Brothers or the Buzzcocks.&quot; Red Starr, writing in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, described the album as a &quot;brilliant, compelling debut.&quot; However, &quot;NME&quot;″s Paul Morley did not share the same point of view and wrote: &quot;Most of the time, it&#x27;s a voice catching its breath, a cautiously primitive riff guitar, toy drumming and a sprightly bass.&quot;

Chris True of AllMusic retrospectively called the album &quot;a very strong debut&quot; and a &quot;semi-detached bit of late-&#x27;70s English pop-punk&quot;. Nitsuh Abebe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; likened the album to a &quot;new wave Wire... [or] Joy Division&quot; and called it &quot;as original a record as anything else to spin off from the tail end of punk.&quot; He also called the album &quot;spiky post-punk.&quot; BBC Music critic Simon Morgan said &quot;Smith was forging his own take on the post-punk zeitgeist,&quot; while author Martin C. Strong said it &quot;remains among the Cure&#x27;s finest work,&quot; adding that &quot;their strangely accessible post-punk snippets lent an air of suppressed melancholy.&quot; The album was also described as &quot;a collection of melodic but slightly kooky power-pop&quot; by Chris Gerard of &quot;PopMatters&quot;.

==50th anniversary plans==
On 14 October 2024, Robert Smith announced plans for retiring in 2029 following the 50th anniversary of &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot;. “I’m 70 in 2029, and that’s the 50th anniversary of the first Cure album [&quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot;]. If I make it that far, that’s it. In the intervening time, I’d like to include playing concerts as part of the overall plan of what we’re going to do. I’ve loved it; the last 10 years of playing shows have been the best 10 years of being in the band. It pisses all over the other 30-odd years! It’s been great.”

==History==
Congers was settled in the late 17th century by Dutch, German and English settlers. It was known as Cedar Grove Corner and then Waldberg, which in German means &quot;forest mountain&quot;. It is named after New York State Senator Abraham Bogart Conger (1814 - 1887).

In the 19th century the Congers railroad station, three churches, a school, the firehouse and the Central and Globe hotels were built. The first floor of the then Globe hotel on the southeastern corner of Congers Road is presently the Last Chance Saloon. The Clarktown Dutch Reformed Church still stands at the corner of Congers Road and Kings Highway.

Kings Highway was the first major road in the county and for many years the only road from New York to Albany.

Nine structures in Congers have recognized historical markers dating back to the 18th century, including the DeBaum House on Kings Highway, the Smith House on Gilchrest Road and the Snedeker House, where the George Washington is believed to have spent a night in his role as commander-in-chief of Colonial forces during the American Revolution.

The Swartout estate, which was occupied by George Swartout, was part of a large tract of land confiscated by the government about 1777. It was purchased by General Jacobus Swartwout, who was a top ally of Washington, and member of a family who traced their residence in Rockland County to 1660.

Lake DeForest, a reservoir with a capacity of over 5 billion gallons, was built in 1955-1956. It is named after Henry L. Deforest, President of the Spring Valley Works and Supply Company.

Several roads are named after Union Civil War generals, including Grant, Burnside, Sheridan, Sherman, and Rosecrans avenues.

A memorial in honor of 1st Lieutenant Raymond B. Jauss is located at the park adjacent to the railroad crossing at the center of town. Jauss received a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in World War I, and was killed on July 15, 1918 near Crezancy, France. He was a graduate of Columbia University and his family had a summer home in Congers. Jauss was married to a childhood sweetheart - and fellow Congers resident - Harriet James; their wedding occurred two days before he sailed for Europe.

Congers had regular passenger train service along the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s West Shore Railroad from Weehawken, New Jersey (opposite Midtown Manhattan) north to Newburgh, Kingston and Albany until 1958. A shortened commuter service continued to West Haverstraw until 1959.

===St Paul&#x27;s Church===
Catholics in Congers initially attended St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Haverstraw. Rev. Thomas McGare of St. Peter&#x27;s built St Paul&#x27;s Church, Clarkstown&#x27;s first Catholic church, on Lake Road in the early 1890s. In 1901 Rev. John A. Nageleisen built mission stations in Rockland Lake, Bardonia, and New City.

===Gilchrest Road crossing accident===
==Education==
Congers has one public elementary school, Lakewood Elementary. Congers Elementary School was shut down in 2013 due to unsafe cracks in the structure. Today the building remains as a day care facility. Public school students from Congers attend Felix Festa Middle School in West Nyack and Clarkstown North High School in New City. Congers is also the home of Rockland Country Day School, which accepts students in grades PreK-12 and was founded in 1959.

==Sports==
The New York Raiders are a semi-professional rugby league football team that currently plays in the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) competition. They play their home games at Rockland Lake State Park, and are a team partner of the Canberra Raiders of Australia&#x27;s National Rugby League (NRL).

<text>Hillburn, originally called &quot;Woodburn&quot; and incorporated in 1893, is a village in the town of Ramapo, Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Suffern, east of Orange County, south of Viola, and west of Montebello. It is considered to be one of the more rural communities in Rockland County. The population was 930 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In addition to later European-American migrants, the area was settled early by descendants of Lenape and other remnant groups, who eventually intermarried with Afro-Dutch and other ethnicities after the Revolutionary War. These multiracial descendants were recognized in 1980 by the state as the Ramapough Mountain Indians; they also have centers of population in Mahwah and Ringwood, New Jersey, which were areas of frontier in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. For many years they lived by farming, hunting and fishing. They tended to marry within their community until the mid-twentieth century.

The village of Hillburn was founded in 1893; that year the first school in Hillburn was built on a plot of ground donated by J.B. Suffern.

===Thurgood Marshall===

In 1943, the attorney Thurgood Marshall won a disparity case regarding integration of the schools of Hillburn, 11 years before his landmark case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. He represented the village&#x27;s African-American parents. In 2010, the state legislature designated May 17 as Thurgood Marshall Day in honor of his work in civil rights. Mixed-race children who lived in the town of Ramapo attended the Brook School in Hillburn, a wood structure that did not have a library, indoor bathrooms or gymnasium. The Main School was reserved for white children and included a gymnasium, a library and indoor plumbing. It is now used as the headquarters of the Suffern Central School District. The Rockland African Diaspora Heritage Center in Pomona, New York, has an exhibit of artifacts and photographs loaned by a student who attended the Brook School. The student went on to college, and eventually taught English and history.

<doc id="127077" wikidata="Q5682743" url="?curid=127077" title="Hillcrest, Rockland County, New York">
<text>Hillcrest is a hamlet incorporated in 1893 and census-designated place, in the town of Ramapo, Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Spring Valley, east of Viola, south of New Square and New Hempstead, and west of New City. The population was 8,164 at the 2020 census.

It is a bedroom suburb of New York City, as many residents commute to employment in Manhattan (and, to a lesser extent, northern New Jersey) by bus (Red and Tan Lines), train (Metro-North Railroad) or automobile. It is primarily served by the Spring Valley post office.

==History==
In the early 1900s, Hillcrest became a summer retreat for working-class families from New York City; the families could access Hillcrest by train from New Jersey (after ferrying across to the western shore of the Hudson). In 1955, the Tappan Zee Bridge opened (connecting Tarrytown in Westchester County with Nyack in Rockland County), increasing traffic into the community and making access to New York City easier for the local population. Along with many other communities in the lower Hudson Valley, Hillcrest became a destination for White Flight from New York City in the 1950s through 1970s. Craig H. Long, the Town of Ramapo historian, said that many secular Jews were part of the first wave of settlers into Hillcrest after the opening of the Tappan Zee. In the 1960s, Hillcrest attracted Jews from the boroughs of Brooklyn and The Bronx in New York City; the Jewish people going to Hillcrest desired inexpensive starter homes, a short commute and a suburban atmosphere.

In the 1990s, the community attracted immigrants from Asia and the Caribbean, as well as new residents from Brooklyn and The Bronx; the newcomers moved to the community for the same reasons as the Jews did in previous decades. In the 1990s, the community lost a greater percentage of white people than any other place in New York. From 1980 to 2001, the community&#x27;s demographics changed from almost completely white to around one-fifth white. According to the 2000 Census, Hillcrest is a majority African-American community. David W. Chen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;perhaps one of the reasons Hillcrest has managed to evolve so significantly yet anonymously&quot; is the community&#x27;s hamlet status; he added that &quot;even within Ramapo, Hillcrest is often overlooked.&quot; Chen reported that many real estate agents and residents said that no one factor caused or contributed to the ethnic change. Many families moved because their children became adults and they wanted lower property tax rates or because they retired and moved to warmer climates. The significant exodus of Jews from Hillcrest in the 1990s resulted in the closure of many local businesses that had operated for more than thirty years, including kosher butcher shops, kosher delis and bakeries in Hillcrest and nearby communities such as Spring Valley and New City.

==History==
Rockland County was inhabited by the Munsee band of Lenape Native Americans, who were speakers of the Algonquian languages. Monsey Glen, a Native American encampment, is west of the intersection of State Route 59 and State Route 306. Numerous artifacts have been found there and some rock shelters are still visible. The Monsey railroad station, named from an alternate spelling of the Munsee Lenape, was built when the New York &amp; Erie Railroad passed through the glen in 1841.

In 1943, Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz purchased a property in Monsey with the intention to raise the education level of Torah teachers. Named Aish Dos (Pillar of Fire), the institute comprised two buildings on a 16-acre plot. In 1944 it was reconstituted as Beth Medrash Elyon, Monsey&#x27;s first Jewish institution.

In the 1950s, Monsey was a one stoplight town with a single yeshiva. In 1979, Rabbi Ezriel Tauber and a group of lay leaders purchased land in Monsey for the American campus of the Ohr Somayach Yeshiva.

By 1997, Monsey had 112 synagogues and 45 yeshivas.

Located in Monsey is the Houser-Conklin House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

=== Jewish community ===
Monsey is a major center of Orthodox Judaism in the United States, along with several other cities such as Kiryas Joel, Kaser, Spring Valley, and New Square. It is the largest center of Hasidic Judaism in the U.S. outside New York City, with approximately 5,400 households (4.2% of the world&#x27;s Hasidic population). The migration to Monsey began in the late 1940s when New York City&#x27;s Orthodox Jews were seeking affordable real estate for their quickly growing communities. These spaces offered the possibility of moving en masse and establishing enclaves where they could lead lives based on &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish religious law) without coming into regular conflict with non-Orthodox neighbors. This represented a major, distinct suburban demographic shift for these communities. Major Hasidic sects represented in Monsey include Satmar, Vizhnitz Monsey, Sanz and Belz, with the rebbes of Berditchev, Lizensk, Lizensk (Rokeah), Nikolsburg, Sambor Yerushalayim-Monsey, Sassov, Shinave, Spinka Monsey, Stanislov, and Vizhnitz Monsey sects residing in the community. Vizhnitz maintains a cemetery in Monsey.

On December 28, 2019, Monsey was the site of a mass stabbing in the home of a Hasidic rebbe of the Kosonyu sect who was hosting a Hanukkah party, leaving four injured and one dead.

==History==
===Early history===

Montebello far exceeds the formal boundaries of the incorporated village today. The rolling hills and fertile soil in the Ramapo Valley provided a quiet, unassuming way of life for the early pioneering families. A small collection of farms and mills dotted the countryside and were connected by dirt paths and rugged roadways. That was all about to change with the coming of the iron rails and the trains that would ride them. In neighboring Suffern, the Erie Railroad began operating in 1841, and with it, exposed the area to sights and sounds never imagined.

===Erie Railroad===
Suffern became an important and busy station on the mainline of the Erie Railroad. New Yorkers, in search of a cool, quiet retreat to relieve the stress of their urban lifestyles, filled the passenger trains bound in summer for the surrounding rural regions. Relatively isolated before the 1860s, Suffern served as a welcome mat for the upstate Erie traveler. Twenty trains a day, loaded with seasonal tourists, stopped at the impressive Victorian depot. Word soon spread among the travelers that &quot;romantic scenery, fascinating beauty and rich land&quot; could be found at the &quot;pleasant summer resort&quot;. Suffern played host to the traveling public, whether accepting the hospitality offered by the resort hotels and boarding houses or just switching trains. The list of guests, visitors, and part-time residents who were attracted to Suffern&#x27;s rural charm included the names of many families from New York&#x27;s affluent &quot;upper crust&quot;. Some came as seasonal vacationers, closing to rent an estate, while others bought the property from the abundant amount of undeveloped land. Picturesque rolling hills and vast wooded lands guarded by the Ramapo Mountains provided a rustic setting for the development of elegant country estates.

===Montebello Estate===
One such estate was that of wealthy New York financier Thomas Fortune Ryan. In August 1887, the Ryans purchased the former Groesbeck mansion, which was built in the 1860s. From the hilltop, the estate had a commanding view of the Ramapo Mountains. The Ryans called their estate &quot;Montebello&quot;. Within three years, they had the elegant frame dwelling torn down and replaced with a large brick and stone mansion at the cost of $600,000. The new summer home contained such amenities as a two-lane bowling alley, an electric elevator, a private chapel, greenhouse, 13 fireplaces, and in all, over 44 rooms. The estate comprises and has a working farm, not including the 5 smaller &quot;mansions&quot; the Ryans built for their sons in the area, some of which are still standing today.

Aside from a fashionable home on Fifth Avenue, the Ryans maintained homes in Washington, D.C., and Lovingston, Virginia, all reflecting the wealth of one of America&#x27;s most prosperous and devoutly religious Irish Catholic families. Thomas Fortune Ryan&#x27;s riches were in vast contrast with his humble beginnings in rural Nelson County, Virginia. Orphaned at age nine, Ryan would eventually become the tenth wealthiest man in the nation. After leaving his native state in 1868, he traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, and found a job in the dry goods business of John S. Barry, a highly successful entrepreneur. It was at this time that Ryan met Ida M. Barry, the boss&#x27;s daughter, whom he later married. Using his wife&#x27;s wealth as a foundation on which to build his own, Ryan launched his business career. After moving to New York, at age 23 became the youngest man ever to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. From there Ryan amassed millions in urban transit, railroads, tobacco, insurance, banking, rubber, diamonds, and even the Thompson submachine gun.

The Ryans were as generous to philanthropies as they were rich. It has been estimated that Mrs. Ryan gave $20 million to various charities and endowments across the country. Most of these were affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church; however, there were sizable donations to nonsectarian institutions as well. By 1905 it was reported that Mrs. Ryan&#x27;s munificence covered the building of &quot;at least one hundred new chapels, schools, churches, hospitals, homes for Sisters of Charity and homes for the aged and infirmed&quot;. Mrs. Ryan displayed a special fondness for her new neighbors by contributing equipment to the newly formed Suffern Fire Department. She also built a new church and established a girls&#x27; school and a seminary in Suffern, among other things. Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, she turned her attention to the health needs of the community and started Good Samaritan Hospital.

After Mrs. Ryan died in 1917, Ryan divided up the estate and in 1921 sold the main mansion to Edward Swann, New York City District Attorney. Several months later, Swann sold the property to the Archdiocese of New York, which used the mansion as a retreat site for St. Joseph&#x27;s College and Seminary. In 1944, Suffern resident Gustav Mayer purchased the mansion. However, his plans to develop the property, including possibly as a country club, never materialized, and the vacant mansion fell victim to vandals. Copper mining giant Phelps Dodge Corporation bought the dilapidated mansion in 1951 and used it as their corporate records headquarters for the next 31 years. After Phelps Dodge relocated, it sold the mansion for $1.6 million to Gary M. Goldberg, CEO of the investment/financial planning firm which bears his name. After a year of extensive renovation, Montebello became that financial firm&#x27;s headquarters as well as an office park.

== Education ==
The village of Montebello is located within the Suffern Central School District. Montebello Elementary School is located within village limits, and serves much of the village. Students in grades 6-8 and zoned to Suffern Middle School, and all high school students are zoned to Suffern High School.

Rockland Community College, part of the SUNY system, is located just outside village limits.

===Bayard Lane===
&quot;Turning off the Haverstraw Rd, almost opposite the house of Senator Royal S. Copeland, into a dirt avenue, one is faced by a waste-land of scrub oak and sassafras with a lonely shack near the entrance.&quot; This is how a visitor described the Bayard Lane community, a small &quot;Utopia&quot; homestead project, made up of a group of self-sufficient, self-sustaining colonists in 1936.

Beyond the initial appearance lay the successful homestead project, the brainchild of Ralph Borsodi, nationally known author, economist and philosopher. It was his vision to develop a domestic lifestyle that was productive, independent and economically practical for the New York City commuter. Borsodi, a wiry, shock-haired little man who wore horn-rimmed glasses and paid &quot;little attention to his clothes&quot;, began his new style of country living, later labeled as &quot;agrarianism for commuters&quot;, in 1919. He, along with his wife and two sons, moved from New York City and rented a small unimproved farmhouse near Suffern. While Borsodi commuted to work in the city, they began their initial family experiments. Within a 15-year period, he and his family, tested their theories and dreams of self-subsistence and economic freedom while enjoying the beauty of nature.

Authoring several books on economics, Borsodi&#x27;s work, &quot;This Ugly Civilization&quot;, published in 1929, brought him national attention. Four years later, his bestselling book, &quot;Flight from the City&quot;, appeared as the country was mired in the depths of the Great Depression. Firing the imagination of struggling families, many with low-paying inner city jobs and an aimless future, the book described a way to seek out a good agrarian lifestyle and graphically detailed his own family&#x27;s experiences and accomplishments at homesteading in Suffern. In 1935, Borsodi launched Bayard Lane, a small experimental cooperative community on a rolling unimproved tract of at the foot of the Ramapo Mountains.

The property was acquired by the Independence Foundation, a nonprofit cooperative and self-governing group of which Borsodi was a trustee. The other members were Samuel D. Dodge, Clarence E. Pickett, Dr. Harold Rugg, Beveridge C. Dunlop, W. Van Alan Clark, Mrs. Elizabeth Macdonald, Mrs. William Sargent Ladd and Dr. Warren Wilson. They divided the estate into homesteads occupied by individual families. The homes were owned individually, the land cooperatively. The Foundation indentured the land to the homeowner through a corporation representing them. Fourteen families who knew Borsodi or who had heard of his project were willing to try the experiment after those interested in the idea had been &quot;philosophically initiated the previous January&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported.

Ground was broken for the first house (Marquart residence, #14 Bayard Lane) on June 23, 1935. Using the Ernest Flagg method of construction, they built attractive, economical, sturdy homes of native fieldstone. Each house had all the modern conveniences of the day. It was said, they &quot;will be standing at least a hundred years after they are paid for.&quot; Homes could be constructed by various building craft guilds under a special arrangement with the Independence Foundation. A professional staff would provide architects, estimates, record keeping and construction. The benefits to the homeowners were considerable. They could do as much of the work themselves as they wished, calling in help whenever needed. The Foundation would also offer loan contracts. To prevent substandard, unattractive buildings, construction plans were reviewed by a committee.

The School of Living was literally and figuratively the centerpiece of Borsodi&#x27;s experiment in homesteading, headquartered at 21 Bayard Lane in 1938. Dedicated on Independence Day to the &quot;economic independence of the American people&quot;, the School of Living was to develop research and promote the Borsodi philosophy of balanced and healthy living in which the home and the land were productive instruments. The school taught the essentials of do-it-yourself agrarianism, including caning, poultry raising, animal husbandry, masonry, carpentry, and use of tools and household equipment.

Borsodi&#x27;s &quot;Bayard Lane Utopia&quot; appeared to be a great idea on paper, and initially it appeared to be successful and was prominently featured in a variety of national publications. A group near Ossining, New York, hoped to start a similar project (Stillwater, Ossining) with the help of the Independence Foundation, and made overtures to Borsodi. But as the United States entered the Second World War, the economy shifted and society began to change. A new wave of patriotism swept the country, leading Bayard Lane residents to distance themselves from Borsodi&#x27;s self-sufficient principles and cooperative living. Eventually, Borsodi resigned from the Foundation, and in time, many of the original families living in this small enclave moved away.

In 1992, two historical markers were erected along U.S. Route 202 to recount the legacy left by the nearly forgotten experimental community whose new style of country living received national attention in the 1930s, and gave hope and inspiration to struggling families of the Depression.

===Cobblestone Farm===
A notable landmark in the village of Montebello is Cobblestone Farm. The setting for this magnificent estate is an attractive of well-groomed land on Viola Road. It was once the home of White Laboratories founder and vice president Henry von L. Meyer, Sr.

In 1907, Meyer carefully chose from the abundant, rural Ramapo landscape, for the creation of an elegant county estate and working farm. Among the rolling hills, century-old trees, and beautiful mountain vistas, he carved &quot;one of the model showplaces in Rockland County&quot;, as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Part of this extensive property today is dotted with private homes as well as the site of Suffern High School. The farm&#x27;s centerpiece was a cobblestone barn/carriage house, built with the stones cleared from the fields, hence the name Cobblestone Farm. Handsome stone walls outlined the estate&#x27;s boundaries. Additional outbuildings were constructed to form an attractive ensemble of farm buildings, including a massive timberframe dairy barn with caretaker&#x27;s cottage. Several ponds were formed, and one-third of the acreage was put under cultivation. Thousands of vegetables and flowering plants were raised and donated to local charities and hospitals.

The estate&#x27;s owner was a descendant of an old Colonial family from Long Island. His cousin, George von L. Meyer, was Secretary of the Navy under President Theodore Roosevelt and served as an ambassador to several countries. Henry von L. Meyer was a prominent businessman, and after a number of years in the paper manufacturing business, he entered the drug manufacturing field and became vice president of Health Products Company in New York City. He later founded White Laboratories in Newark, New Jersey, which manufactured many nationally known drug products such as Feenamint, Aspergum and a number of cod liver oil concentrates.

After moving to the Suffern area, Mr. Meyer became connected locally with a number of leading business institutions. He was a chief stockholder in the Lafayette Theatre, the Ramapo Valley Independent newspaper, and the Ramapo Cider &amp; Vinegar Company, and was a vice president of the Suffern National Bank. Henry Meyer and his wife Laura Hard Meyer had two children, Henry von L. Meyer Jr. and Sarah Meyer. The family was well known for their philanthropic interest in the county. For many years they were involved in the State Charities Aid Association, the Rockland Volunteer Aid Society, and the Boy Scouts of America, and were founding members of the Rockland County Conservation Association.

Perhaps their greatest charity work was associated with the Rockland County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Ardent supporters of the society, the Meyers donated thousands of dollars annually and worked actively for the organization, including erecting a branch shelter at their farm to care for homeless animals.

===Indian Rock===

Indian Rock is a large glacial erratic boulder of granite gneiss, formed in the Proterozoic (Precambrian) era, 1.2 billion to 800 million years ago. It is estimated to weigh ~17,300 tons. The source area for the boulder was nearby in the Ramapo Mountains-Hudson Highlands; it is difficult to know for certain exactly where it was picked up by the glacier, but most likely not more than 5 to 10 kilometers from its current location. The boulder rests upon glacial outwash which in turn lies atop Triassic sedimentary red beds (sandstone and shale) of the Newark Basin (circa 145 million years old). The rock was carried to its current location by the internal flow of the continental ice sheet during the last glacial maximum, circa 21,000 years ago. The base of the continental glacier scoured the bedrock terrain across which it moved, thus plucking large and small blocks of rock from their position in the Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands. Indian Rock got as far as Rockland County before being liberated by the ice and deposited along with gravels shifted by glacial meltwater.

Although Indian Rock may appear to be several rocks piled together, it actually originated as a single boulder ( by by ). Weaknesses within the rock caused by foliation and naturally occurring fractures serve as avenues for moisture infiltration. With repeated freeze-thaw cycles, this moisture expands to exert forces up to 20,000 lbs/inch2 along the planes of weakness, thus wedging the rock apart. Glacial polish, striations and grooves commonly found on erratics of this size have for the most part been effaced by the normal process of decomposition called weathering.

When The Kakiat Indians were abandoning their ancestral hunting grounds in the early eighteenth century, they stopped at Indian Rock and laid their last offerings and partook in a final feast in the land of their birth and traveled westward for a brief period of time where they would be unmolested by the white man.

==Government==
The duties of the mayor are defined in the NYS Village Law and similar to those of a chief executive. The mayor has the power to provide for the enforcement of all local laws. The mayor presides over the meetings of the board of trustees. The mayor has the power to appoint all village employees and non-elected board and commission members, subject to the approval of the board of trustees. The mayor also executes all contracts in the name of the village.

The board of trustees has the power to manage all village property and finances. This power extends to setting tax rates and fee schedules that generate revenue for the village as well as authorizing expenditures for all municipal purposes. The board of trustees is also empowered to enact local laws for the safety, health, comfort and general welfare of the residents of the village and for the preservation and protection of public works such as roads, street lighting and public buildings.

Montebello is the first village in Rockland County to have a solar photovoltaic system to help power its village hall. It was also the first designated climate-smart community and the first Tree City USA in Rockland County. Montebello has the first certified local government for historic preservation in Rockland County.

The village has its own local justice court.

==Recreational facilities==

*Spook Rock Golf Course: Located on Spook Rock Road, the Spook Rock Golf Course, an 18-hole course, is ranked among the finest public courses in the country. It is situated on property that was originally the site of a Boys Scout camp.
*Spook Rock Pool
*Kathryn Gorman Ponds Park: Located in the Montebello Pines community and named for the first Mayor of the Village, this park has many ponds and walking trails. The village received a federal stimulus grant in 2010 to help pay for the development of the park.
*Warren E. Berbit Park: A natural park on Spook Rock Road which is maintained as open space. Named for the first Village Attorney, this park was originally part of the Fant Farm, but was dedicated to the Village to preserve the magnificent vista of the original farmland.
*Tot lot and 9/11 Memorial: The village has a playground facility on the Village Hall grounds, an outdoor gazebo, and a 9/11 Memorial Garden. In January 2011, the village received a steel relic from the World Trade Center to place in the Memorial Garden.
*Kakiat Park: Kakiat Park is a park adjacent to Harriman State Park. It is part of the Harris patent, one of the original land patents from the King of England. It is also known as Kakiat Farm, the home of the Blauvelt family who owned and farmed the land for over two hundred years growing apples, peaches and cherries. The park is the site of the Blauvelt mill, the foundation of which still remains. The National Recreation Association in 1961 recommended its purchase to the County Board of Supervisors. As a result, a formally appointed Park Commission was installed and the process of acquiring land for park purposes began. The property officially became county parkland in 1972.
Activities in the park include hiking (the Kakiat Trail starting from the parking area crosses through the park into Harriman State Park ending up in Dater Mountain County Park), horseback riding, picnicking, and scenic lookouts. An off-leash dog area is located near the parking lot. A log cabin constructed in 1922 stands as a mute reminder of the simple life of 100 years ago. A footbridge crosses the river, which is stocked annually with trout; a pavilion can be found near the river.

Numerous winter activities exist along with active wildlife and forestry conservation projects. Guided tours available by the Park Rangers. There is a diverse topography, from flat wetlands to rolling hills, to steep mountainside. The Mahwah River flows southwesterly the length of the park approximately . The Ramapo Fault runs through the park. Trees include willow, apple, poplar, white pine, hemlock, beech, maple, white ash, oaks, and dogwood.

<text>Nanuet is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Clarkstown, New York, United States. The third largest hamlet in Clarkstown, it is located north of Pearl River, south of New City, east of Spring Valley, and west of West Nyack. It is located midway between Manhattan and Bear Mountain, north and south of each respectively; and north of the New Jersey border. It has one of three Rockland County stations on New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line. The population of Nanuet was 17,882 at the 2010 census.

The opening of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87/287), the Tappan Zee Bridge, and the Palisades Interstate Parkway in the mid-1950s helped usher in decades of population growth and real estate development, including the construction of the Nanuet Mall and local shopping centers.

In 2011, CNN Money ranked Nanuet 76 on its annual 100 Best Places to Live list, citing its relatively inexpensive housing and the recreation and shopping opportunities in the area. Nanuet was also ranked 24th on CNN Money&#x27;s annual 100 Best Places to Live list in 2007.

==History==

The first name of the place was Clarkstown, a name it retained until 1856 when, at the suggestion of James De Clark, the present name was given by Munsee Chief (Nannawitt). Chief Nannawitt sold lands in North Jersey, signed the Wawayanda Patent and witnessed the Cheesecock Patent.

The Erie Railroad arrived in Rockland County in 1841 along its original main line to Piermont. The New Jersey and New York Railroad, the predecessor of the Pascack Valley Line, reached Nanuet in 1869.

==Geography==
Nanuet is located at (41.095296, -74.015622).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The topography is a result of the massive glaciation of the last ice age, and as such the soil is extremely rocky and the surface shows glacial erratic boulders. The glacial ice scraped off and carried with it rocks and minerals from as far north as Canada, depositing them in Nanuet in particular and southern New York in general. This is the hypothesized source of the manganese-rich parvo-mangano-edenite minerals, as well as the placer ore for gold panning within Nauraushaun Brook. There are fossil impressions of huge Precambrian Era jellyfish in the wooded, undeveloped regions. One prominent surface feature, a Hopewell Indian burial mound dating to 325 AD, is located near Nauraushaun Brook at the western edge of the Manhattan Woods Golf Club in West Nyack. Aerial views of this feature reveal it to have been built in the shape of a snake.

Lake Nanuet Park is a pool which is designed to look like a naturally occurring lake. The park which surrounds it offers residents a summer pool and recreational baseball/softball fields. Recent massive flooding and subsequent contamination closed the park for swimming until 2011.

<text>New City is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Clarkstown, Rockland County, New York, United States, part of the New York Metropolitan Area. A suburb of New York City, the hamlet is located north of the city at its closest point, Riverdale, Bronx. Within Rockland County, New City is located north of Bardonia, northeast of Nanuet, east of New Square and New Hempstead, south of Garnerville and the village of Haverstraw, and west of Congers (across Lake DeForest). New City&#x27;s population was 35,101 at the 2020 census, making it the 14th most populous CDP/hamlet in the state of New York.

New City is the county seat, seat of the town of Clarkstown and the location of the Clarkstown Police Department, Rockland County Sheriff&#x27;s office and corrections facility. The downtown area is one of the main business districts in the county. The ZIP code of New City is 10956.

==History==
Before the Revolutionary War, the land that would later become known as New City was inhabited mostly by Lenni Lenape American Indians. The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the area. Orange County was established in 1683 as one of the first 12 counties in Province of New York, which included present day Rockland County. In 1780, Major John André and Josh Hett Smith stopped at Coe&#x27;s Tavern, located on what is now the corner of New Hempstead Road and Route 45.

New City was formed in 1798, when Rockland County was incorporated as a separate county from the south-easternmost portion of Orange County. With the formation of a new county, there were needs for a new county seat. The central location of New City was a convenient location for a county seat, since travel in 1798 was difficult, and the existing main towns in the county were not centrally located. At the time, the Squadron Cavalry of New York City had a summer encampment of what is now the busy streets of Squadron Boulevard and Cavalry Drive, hence how these streets were named. The community got its name because the founding fathers envisioned a &quot;new&quot; city when forming the new county seat.

Other than county and town government, the early downtown area consisted mainly of small retail shops in what was mainly an agricultural area. There was also a county fairgrounds and racetrack located on the Route 304 and Congers Road intersection.

In 1918, Paramount Pictures founder Adolph Zukor moved to New City where he bought 300 acres of land from Lawrence Abraham which already had a large house, a swimming pool, and a 9-hole golf course on the property. Two years later, in 1920, Zukor bought 500 more acres from Abraham and built multiple additions including a night house, guest house, greenhouses, garages, and more. He also hired A.W. Tillinghast to build an 18-hole championship golf course on the property. The land is now currently known as Paramount Country Club. Zukor Park, located just south of the country club, is also named after the producer. Zukor&#x27;s property attracted a large number of artistic people to the area; including Maxwell Anderson, Henry Varnum Poor, Norman Lloyd, Kurt Weill, Martha MacGuffie, Lotte Lenya, John Houseman and more who all lived on South Mountain Road and formed an artist colony there.

Dutch Gardens, the oldest remaining park in the county, was built in 1934 by Italian artisans, known for its unique patterned brickwork. It was designed by West Nyack native Mary Mowbray-Clark. It was honored as the 1934 Garden of the Year by &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; Magazine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Located just south of the courthouse in the downtown area, it is still one of the most commonly visited parks in Rockland County today.

New City remained rural in character until the 1950s, when the idea of post-World War II suburbia, as well as the opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge and Palisades Interstate Parkway, made traveling between New York City and Rockland County faster, and easier. Many former New York City residents migrated to Rockland, which transformed New City from a quiet rural community to a busy populated suburb of New York City. Along with residential development, business development increased rapidly as well. The downtown area became home to many banks, retail, and real-estate companies; as well as restaurants, shops, a movie theater, bars, and many other forms of entertainment. Certain parts of the town, such as South Mountain Road and Lake Lucille, have been preserved, and remain quiet, wooded, historic old-wealth neighborhoods.

==Geography==
New City is accessible from major Rockland arteries providing rapid access to Bergen County, New Jersey, Westchester County, Manhattan, and the Bronx in New York City.

Neighborhoods include New City Condominiums and South Mountain Road.

* The Brick Church - 220 Brick Church Road - The church was founded by Dutch settlers in 1774 and was once known as the Reformed Church of West New Hempstead. Its present home was built in 1857 with bricks made from clay mined during the heyday of Haverstraw&#x27;s brick industry. The graves of Revolutionary War soldiers and some original settlers are found in its church yard. Its cemetery building once served as the town hall for Haverstraw and later for Ramapo. Due to overcrowding in the East Ramapo school district buildings in the 1960s, the district made use of the Brick Church school. Recently the church celebrated its 150th anniversary. (NRHP)

<doc id="127085" wikidata="Q2917479" url="?curid=127085" title="New Square, New York">
<text>New Square () is an all-Hasidic village in the town of Ramapo, Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Hillcrest, east of Viola, south of New Hempstead, and west of New City. As of the 2020 United States census, it had a population of 9,679. Its inhabitants are predominantly members of the Skverer Hasidic movement who seek to maintain a Hasidic lifestyle disconnected from the secular world. It is the poorest town (measured by median income) in New York, and the eighth poorest in the United States. It also has the highest poverty rate, at 64.4%.

== History ==
New Square is named after the Ukrainian town Skvyra, where the Skverer Hasidic group originated. The founders intended to name the settlement &quot;New Skvir&quot;, but a typist&#x27;s error anglicized the name. New Square was established in 1954, when the Zemach David Corporation, representing Skverer Grand Rabbi Yakov Yosef Twersky, purchased a dairy farm near Spring Valley, New York, in the town of Ramapo. At that time, most Skverer members lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. New Square&#x27;s founders had felt that the Hasidic community in Williamsburg was being &quot;threatened by assimilation&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; later described it. Construction began in 1956, and the first four families moved to New Square in December 1956. In 1958, the settlement had 68 houses.

The development of New Square was obstructed by Ramapo&#x27;s zoning regulations, which forbade the construction of multi-family houses and the use of basements for shops and stores. Multiple families sharing single-family houses said that they belonged to extended families, and businesses in private homes had to be secret. In 1959, the community asked for a building permit to expand its synagogue, located in the basement of a Cape Cod-style house. The Ramapo town attorney requested condemnation of the entire New Square community, claiming that it threatened sewage lines. In response, the community requested incorporation as a village, but Ramapo town officials refused to allow it. In 1961, a New York state court ruled in favor of New Square, and the village was incorporated in July of that year.

After incorporating, New Square set its own zoning and building codes, legalizing the existing houses, and the liens disappeared. Lots were sold, and new houses were built. The basement businesses could trade openly, and new businesses were founded, including a watch assembly plant and a cap manufacturer. Three knitting mills and a used car lot opened, but most men continued to go to work in New York City. A &quot;Kollel&quot; was opened in 1963. In 1968, Grand Rabbi Yakov Yosef Twersky died; he was succeeded as Grand Rabbi by his son David Twersky.

In New Square&#x27;s first mayoral election in 1961, Mates Friesel was chosen unopposed. Friesel was re-elected every two years until his death in 2015, thereby becoming one of the longest-serving mayors in the United States.

== Culture ==
The population of New Square is made up exclusively of Hasidic Jews, mostly from the Skverer Hasidic movement, who wish to maintain a Hasidic lifestyle while keeping outside influences to a minimum. The predominant language spoken in New Square is Yiddish.

Young people typically marry around 18 to 20 years of age. Girls finish high school at around age 17, and then marry. Custom dictates that women who marry men from other Hasidic communities leave New Square. Some women who left New Square settled in the Borough Park community in Brooklyn and the Monsey community in Ramapo, where the community is not as tightly knit. Men who marry women from outside of the community are encouraged to leave New Square. This is due to a shortage of space; thus, new housing is granted to couples of which both members are from the community.

In 2005, the community&#x27;s rabbinical court ruled that women should not drive cars. In a 2003 article, Lisa W. Foderaro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described New Square as &quot;extremely insular&quot;, and said that the community&#x27;s residents do not own televisions or radios.

==Economy==
Young women, prior to entering marriage, and before they have children, work as teachers, secretaries, and bookkeepers, or they work in the New Square shopping center as cashiers and clerks. Some of the women, after having children, work as bookkeepers in their homes. Young men work as teachers, bus drivers, deliverymen, and store clerks. Some work as computer programmers, or as craftsmen and entrepreneurs in the diamond industry. Many study in the &quot;kollel&quot;, a yeshiva for married men, and receive stipends to support their families.

In 1970, the village had the lowest per-capita income in New York State. In 1963, four persons received welfare due to illness. One dozen people received welfare in 1975. In 1992, the village administrator said that in 1975, about two thirds of the families received food stamps and Medicaid.

According to the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the village was $12,162, and the median income for a family was $12,208. Males had a median income of $21,696, versus $29,375 for females. The per capita income for the village was $5,237. About 67.0% of families and 72.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 77.3% of those under age 18 and 14.7% of those age 65 or over.

2007 and 2008 reports from the State of New York stated that 89.8% of the village consisted of low-income and moderate-income residents.

, New Square is by far the poorest town in New York, with a median annual household income of $21,773, which is nearly $5,000 below that of Kiryas Joel, the next poorest town in the state, and only about a third of the median income across the state as a whole.

Not only is it the poorest town in New York state, but New Square also has the highest poverty and SNAP (food stamps) recipiency rates of any town in the United States. Some 70.0% of New Square residents live in poverty, and 77.1% of area households rely on SNAP benefits to afford food. In comparison, 15.1% of Americans live below the poverty line, and 13.0% of households nationwide receive SNAP benefits.

The village had around one hundred births each year from 1971 to 1986. By that year, the village had 140 one-, two-, and three-family houses, a 45-unit low-rent apartment complex, 2,100 people, and 450 families, with an average of 7 to 8 children per family. During the late 1970s, the Town of Ramapo denied New Square&#x27;s attempt to annex land. Six years later, in March 1982, New Square gained the legal right to annex of land.

New Square&#x27;s population increased 77.5% between 1990 and 2000. In 2005, the village contained approximately 7,830 residents; 1,350 families, with 5.8 persons per family. Robert Zeliger of &quot;Rockland Magazine&quot; described New Square in 2007 as &quot;a densely packed haven where Hasidic residents live largely by their own customs and laws&quot;. In November 2008, a new water tower serving New Square and the hamlet of Hillcrest opened, increasing residents&#x27; water pressure.

About 58.0% of families and 58.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 60.9% of those under age 18 and 36.2% of those age 65 or over.

A 2007 report stated that each year, one half of the women between ages 18 and 25 gave birth.

==Government and infrastructure==
As of 1992, the Village of New Square has a mayor, a mayor&#x27;s assistant, a board of trustees, a village clerk, and a justice of the peace. The mayor&#x27;s assistant performs the bulk of administrative work. The justice of the peace mainly handles harassment cases perpetrated by outsiders within New Square.

The Hillcrest Fire Department (also known as the Moleston Fire District) provides fire protection services to New Square. In March 2007, the fire district met with Town of Ramapo supervisors, and proposed removing New Square from its fire district, after a February 7, 2007, fire that destroyed two buildings in New Square. Further hazards stem from the fact that the town has only one main access road (Washington Avenue), and the failure of some residents to yield to emergency vehicles, or to the crowd of people on the streets surrounding an incident. There also have been isolated cases of residents tampering with fire equipment while responders are on scene.

The fire department felt concern about a lack of fire protection in buildings in New Square. On March 29, 2007, Ramapo town officials met fire district officials and fire department chiefs. On April 4 of that year, the fire district announced that New Square would remain in the fire district. Christopher St. Lawrence, the Town of Ramapo supervisor, said that the town is considering a &quot;public safety loan program&quot; to help New Square residents install life safety devices such as smoke alarms and sprinkler systems.

In 1989, New Square funded their own health clinic, called Refuah Health Center. The New Square Cemetery is located on Bais Hachaim Way. The village has a Hatzalah ambulance service branch, part of the Rockland County chapter, and has a public safety department that patrols the village.

New Square is within the 97th Assembly District in the New York State Assembly, which is represented by John W. McGowan. New Square is within Senate District 38 in the New York State Senate, which is represented by William Weber Jr.

===Community norms===
There is a strong expectation that residents of New Square will conform to community norms; for example, by worshiping at the community&#x27;s synagogue and conforming to the Hasidic lifestyle. Generally, conformity by those who do not comply voluntarily is enforced by the powers of the , a council appointed by the rebbe, whose members control most community institutions. Those who have not conformed voluntarily have faced vigilante justice, as exemplified by the New Square arson attack and other incidents. The rebbe has denounced this practice, saying, &quot;The use of force and violence to make a point or settle an argument violates Skver&#x27;s most fundamental principles.&quot;

==Education==
Yeshiva Avir Yakov, a private school with its own locations and separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schooling, is the sole primary and secondary school in the community. It is statistically counted as Avir Yaakov Boys School (Yeshiva Avir Yakov Boys&#x27; School) and Avir Yaakov Girls School.

Although the town is within the East Ramapo Central School District, all children of New Square attend the local private Jewish pre-K-12 schools. The zoned public schools are Summit Park Elementary (Kindergarten-grade 3), Kakiat Elementary School (grades 4–6), Pomona Middle School (grades 7–8), and Ramapo High School (grades 9–12).

==Controversies==

=== Fraudulent grant controversy ===
Four Hasidic men from New Square—Benjamin Berger, Jacob Elbaum, David Goldstein, and Kalmen Stern—created a non-existent Jewish school and enrolled thousands of students, to receive US$30 million in education grants, subsidies, and loans from the U.S. federal government. Some of the money were used to enrich themselves, but also to benefit the community institutions. The fraud scheme in New Square was tied into larger schemes in other ultra-Orthodox communities in Brooklyn and across the country. The men were convicted in 1999. In October of that year, all four men received prison sentences ranging from 30 months to 78 months. Two other suspects who were indicted left the United States. The indictment drew sharp criticism in New Square. A statement by village representatives accused authorities of having a vendetta against New Square residents, and acting &quot;in a manner remindful of the Holocaust,&quot; during the investigations.

Hillary Clinton met with New Square-area Hasidic leaders as part of her Senate campaign. Michael Duffy and Karen Tumulty of &quot;Time&quot; Magazine said that &quot;as far as anyone knows, that was a campaign event only; no pardons were mentioned&quot;. Hillary Clinton attended another session with the men, who wanted to see the four Hasidic leaders released. After Hillary Clinton was voted in as a senator, during the morning of December 22, Twersky and an associate visited Bill Clinton in the White House Map Room in Washington, D.C., and asked him to pardon the four men. Hillary Clinton attended the meeting; she said that she did not participate in it and did not discuss the meeting with her husband.

On January 20, 2001, President Clinton commuted the sentences of the men; Berger&#x27;s sentence became two years, and the other men each had 30 months. Federal prosecutors investigated the pardons to see if they were made in exchange for political support. A 2001 &quot;ABC News&quot; article stated that some people wondered whether the pardons occurred as a kind of favor because the Village of New Square had voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton for her first senate term (1359 out of 1369 votes – in contrast to two other Hasidic communities nearby who voted overwhelmingly Republican) – or if the pardons occurred as part of a quid pro quo swap for votes. Hillary Clinton said that she was not involved in the pardons, and that her husband pardoned the men out of clemency. In 2002 the prosecutors closed the investigation with no action.

==Kiryas Square==
Due to population growth and a housing shortage in New Square, the Skver Hasidim had plans to expand to a new village named Kiryas Square in the hamlet of Spring Glen, New York. The property, the former Homowack Resort, was purchased by the Skver community in 2006. Dedication of the site was in August 2007. The New York State Department of Health cited the property which was used as a summer camp for girls for &quot;numerous, persistent, and serious violations&quot;, including inoperable fire alarms, pervasive mold, and water running over electrical boxes. The health department issued a mandatory order of evacuation. In addition to problems with the health department, some local residents have also voiced opposition to the building of a Hasidic village. The site was evacuated in August 2009, as a result of a judge&#x27;s deadline.

, a new location for the construction of a new Skverer village, also named Kiryas Skver, was found and construction has begun, with many Skver members from Boro Park already having purchased homes in the village.

<doc id="127087" wikidata="Q1816652" url="?curid=127087" title="Nyack, New York">
<text>Nyack () is a village primarily located in the town of Orangetown in Rockland County, New York, United States. Incorporated in 1872, a small western section of the village lies in Clarkstown. The population was 7,265 at the time of the 2020 census. It is a suburb of New York City approximately north of the Manhattan boundary on the west bank of the Hudson River, north of South Nyack, east of Central Nyack, south of Upper Nyack, and southeast of Valley Cottage.

==Setting==
Nyack is one of five southeastern Rockland County villages and hamlets that constitute &quot;The Nyacks&quot;:– Nyack, Central Nyack, South Nyack, Upper Nyack and West Nyack. Named after the Native Americans who resided there before European colonization, the village consists mostly of low-rise buildings on hilly terrain along the western shore of the Hudson River. Adjacent South Nyack is the western terminus of the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects to Tarrytown in Westchester County via U.S. Interstate 87, an important commuter route.

The village encompasses approximately , over 50% of which is water. It is located in the Nyack Public Schools district.

== History ==

Native American stone relics and oyster middenss found along the Hudson River shoreline indicate that present-day Nyack was a popular pre-Colonial fishing location. The first Europeans settled there in 1675, calling the general area &quot;Tappan&quot;.

Harman Douwenszen is believed to be the first white settler. He came to America as a toddler and grew up in Bergen, New Jersey, which became New Jersey after the British assumed control and divided New Netherland in 1664. A letter from 1687 is on file in the State Archives in Albany petitioning Governor Dongan to buy a strip of land in the west hills of Tappan (today Nyack), where he had lived for 12 years. His petition was granted, and he bought the land from the Native Americans. He called his farm New Orania (&quot;Oranje&quot; in Dutch). This section of Nyack became known as Orangetown in 1683. The Tappan Register of 1707 claimed it was pronounced Nay-ack. Nyack became part of Rockland County in 1798. Harman&#x27;s younger brother Theius changed the family name from Douwse (Frisian for first son) to Talma (Dutch for first son). His children became Talman and eventually Tallmans. The New Orania farm became the Tallman homestead, at the northeast corner of what is now Broadway and Tallman Place. The building was demolished in 1914.

Letter dated 31 August 1687 on file at New York State Archives at Albany:
The humble Peticon of Harman Dowse of Tappan Neare Ye River Side, Alias New Orania farm ... your peticonr is a farmer that hath nothing wot comes by his hard labour but by God&#x27;s Blessing out ye Produce and ye ground, and hath a family to provide for.
A plaque installed in 1938 on the north wall of the Key Bank building at South Broadway and Burd Street in Nyack reads:
The Tappan Indians, from time immemorial, occupied these lands fronting the river shore. Here, in summer they lived upon fish and oysters. In Algonkian dialect spoken by them they called this location NAY-ACK which means the fishing place. The first settlement of white people within the limits of the present Rockland County, New York, took place in 1675 when Harmen Dowesen (Tallman), a young Dutchman of Bergen, New Jersey relocated here.

The Tallmans erected a mill on a stream still known as Mill Brook. Abraham Lydecker purchased land from the Tallmans when there were only seven homes in Nyack in 1813. Nyack became an incorporated village in 1872, according to the same plaque on the Midland Trust Building.

Three major industries once thrived in Nyack: sandstone quarrying for New York City buildings (–1840); boat building—sloops, steamboats, then pleasure craft and World War I and World War II submarine chasers (ca. 1915–1948); and shoe manufacturing (ca. 1828–1900). 

Following the extension of the Northern Branch into the community in the mid-19th century, rapid growth ensued. As town government was no longer seen as an effective way to deal with the community&#x27;s needs, village incorporation was discussed. Fearing higher taxes, those in what would have become the northern part of Nyack village formed their own municipal corporation first, named Upper Nyack. Nyack village was incorporated, although without this northern portion. Residents in the southern part of Nyack village, however, soon became dissatisfied with the notion of paying taxes that more heavily benefited the rest of the village. After succeeding in dissolving Nyack&#x27;s corporation, the southern portion of the former village incorporated as the village of South Nyack. The area between Upper Nyack and South Nyack was reincorporated thereafter, again as Nyack.

The Nyack Rocklands were a minor league baseball team based in Nyack, New York. Unofficially nicknamed the &quot;Rockies&quot;, the Rocklands played as members of the Class D level North Atlantic League from 1946 to 1948 and were an affiliate of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1947.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nyack was known for its shipbuilding and was the commercial center of Rockland County. In the 19th century, a number of factories manufactured shoes. The Erie Railroad connected with Jersey City, New Jersey, where ferries took passengers to Chambers Street, New York City, until service was discontinued in 1966. With the completion of the Tappan Zee Bridge in December 1955, connecting South Nyack with Tarrytown in Westchester County, the population increased and Nyack&#x27;s commercial sector expanded.

In the 1980s, the village underwent a major urban revitalization project to commercialize the downtown area and to expand its economy. The Helen Hayes Theatre was built, and the downtown area became home to many new business establishments.

In 1991, the landmark court case &quot;Stambovsky v. Ackley&quot; ruled that a house at 1 LaVeta Place on the Hudson River was a legally haunted and that the owner (but not the real estate agent) was required to disclose that to prospective buyers. The owner, Helen Ackley, had earlier organized haunted house tours and was party to an article about it in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. After Ackley sold the house to another buyer, there were no subsequent reports of hauntings.

On August 10, 2010, Highland Hose Company No. 5, a two-story brick firehouse located at 288 Main Street, celebrated 100 years at the firehouse, which was built in 1910 – fifteen years after Highland Hose was founded. The company&#x27;s 1949 Ahrens-Fox fire engine was polished to bright, gleaming red and is still in use after more than 50 years.

===Frederick Douglass at Nyack===
On August 3rd, 1965, Frederick Douglass delivered a lecture on Abraham and Emancipation. Douglass advocated for black suffrage and equality, emphasizing the role of slavery in causing the Civil War. Frederick Douglass address the people of Nyack on September 23rd 1872 at Smithsonian Hall, which opened on April 2nd 1872

=== Rail ===

Nyack was formerly served by the Northern Branch of the Erie Railroad, with service to Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City. (The southern terminus was shifted to Hoboken in 1958, and the Erie Lackawanna operated the train after 1960.) Passenger service was discontinued in 1966, and the rail line has been converted into a walking path. As a result, Nyack no longer has direct passenger rail service. The nearest railroad stations with current passenger service are Tarrytown 8 miles away and Nanuet 5.8 miles away.

=== Bus ===
Nyack is served by the Lower Hudson Transit Link (known colloquially as Hudson Link), which connects Nyack with rail stations in Tarrytown and White Plains. The bus station is located adjacent to the municipal parking lot on Artopee Way. Nyack is also served by Rockland Coaches 9T buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and 9A buses to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal in New York City. The Rockland Coaches main bus stop is located at the intersection of South Broadway and Cedar Hill Avenue. A secondary stop is located at the intersection of Midland Avenue and Castle Heights Avenue. Local bus transit is provided by Transport of Rockland.

<text>Orangetown is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States, located in the southeastern part of the county. It is northwest of New York City, north of New Jersey, east of the town of Ramapo, south of the town of Clarkstown, and west of the Hudson River. The population was 48,655 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Orangetown was first settled around 1680. The first settlers were Dutch men who purchased a tract of land from the Tappan Indians in 1686; their patent of the same year called the place Orange, but it was also known as Orangetown and Tappan (after the first village). When the state&#x27;s first twelve counties were established in 1683, the territory that would become Orangetown lay within Orange County. It became part of Rockland County when that county was created in 1798.

Historical material from the Gazetteer of New York, 1860 &amp; 1861:

ORANGETOWN—was formed March 7, 1788, and was named from Orange co., of which it
then formed a part. It lies upon the Hudson, in the S. angle of the co. Its surface is broken by
abrupt and rocky hills in the E. ; but in the center and W. it spreads out into a rolling or moderately
hilly region. The Nyack Hills, extending along the river, are 300 to 500 feet high, with steep,
rocky declivities upon the E., but more gradual slopes upon the W. Their summits are rocky and
covered with a light growth of forest trees. Snake Hill, in the N.E. corner, upon the line of Clarks-
town, is one of the principal peaks. The principal stream is Hackensack River, flowing S. through
the W. part. Pascack Creek flows through the extreme W. angle, and Spar Kil is a tributary
of the Hudson. Near the N. line are several bog or peat meadows, generally well drained
and under cultivation. The red sandstone which crops out on the E. declivities of the hills, within
a few rods of the river, between Piermont and Nyack, is extensively quarried and exported for
building stone. The soil is a reddish, sandy loam intermixed with clay. Fruit growing and
furnishing milk for the New York market have become leading pursuits. Nyack, (p.v.,) upon
the Hudson, in the N.E. corner of the town, contains 5 churches, 5 shoe manufactories, a steam
tub and pail factory, the Rockland Female Institute, and a private academy. Pop. 1,458.
Piermont, (p.v.,) upon the Hudson, in the S. part, was incorp. May 21, 1850. It is the E.
terminus of the Piermont Branch of the N. Y. &amp; Erie R. R.,—the one over which the freight is
carried. Nearly the whole business of the place is connected with the R.R. establishment. A pier
1 mi. long has been built into the river, where the freight is transferred to and from the cars and
barges in the river. Upon each end of the pier are extensive offices for the transaction of the busi-
ness of the road. At this place the R.R. co. also have a large iron foundery and extensive repair
shops. Pop. 2,204. Tappantown, (p.v.,) near the N. J. line, contains 2 churches and 30
dwellings. This place was the scene of the trial of Andre, and for a time in 1780 was the head-
quarters of Gen. Washington. Rockland, (Palisades p.o.,) upon the Hudson, in the S. part
of the town, contains 3 churches and 40 dwellings. Orange Mills, Middletown, and
Blauveltville, (p. o.,) a station on the N. Y. &amp; E. R. R., are hamlets. The first settlement is
supposed to have been made by the Dutch, as early as 1680. The first church (Ref. Prot. D.) was
formed Oct. 24, 1694; and the first preacher was Rev. Guilllam Bartholf. The first church edifice
was erected in 1716. There are 16 churches in town.
The Orangetown Resolutions, a protest of the imposition of duties and the closing of the port of Boston by the British Parliament, were passed in Tappan on July 4, 1774, a precursor of the American Revolution.

<text>Pearl River is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Orangetown, Rockland County, New York, United States. It is east of Chestnut Ridge, south of Nanuet, west of Blauvelt, New York, and north of Montvale and Old Tappan, New Jersey. The population was 15,876 at the 2010 census.

Pearl River is north of midtown Manhattan and just north of the New Jersey border. It is the first (traveling north) of three New York stops on New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line.

== History ==
In 1696, Pearl River was part of a larger piece of land known as the Kakiat Patent that was granted to Daniel Honan and Michael Hawdon. In 1713, the land was split into north and south plots. After the Revolutionary War, the land was further divided and sold. Pearl River was a piece of land made up of woods and swamps originally called Muddy Creek.

In the early 1870s, the town was divided into five different parts: Middletown, Sickletown, Pascack, Muddy Brook, and Naurashaun.

There are conflicting accounts on how Muddy Creek came to be named Pearl River. According to some historians, a town resident named Ves Bogert found small pearls in mussels that thrived in Muddy Brook and, upon hearing this, the wife of John Demarest, the president of the New Jersey and New York Railroad, suggested the name &quot;Pearl River&quot; to him.

Another account is that the name change was made to make the station sound more appealing on railroad schedules. A third account is that Julius E. Braunsdorf wanted to enhance the hamlet&#x27;s business image by renaming it Pearl River. In any event, there is no body of water near the hamlet called Pearl River; the most significant stream is Muddy Brook.

Braunsdorf, an industrialist and German immigrant, purchased Muddy Creek in 1870. He donated a long strip of land through the center of his property to the New Jersey and New York Railroad to enable it to bring an extension of the line from Hillsdale, New Jersey north to Nanuet.

Braunsdorf was the &quot;Father of Pearl River&quot; and established Aetna Sewing Machine Company to produce his patented home sewing machine in 1872. Later that year the first post office was established in the hamlet and from then on it was known as Pearl River.

Braunsdorf invented and manufactured the carbon-arc light bulb in 1873, six years before Thomas Edison&#x27;s carbonized filament version. It was installed and used on ships in New York harbor for loading and unloading operations. He also designed generators, one of which powered the first incandescent electric lights, which he also invented, in the nation&#x27;s capital.

When Braunsdorf designed the street layout, the only existing streets were Pearl Street and Washington Avenue. He drew a wide main street through the middle of town and called it Central Avenue. Parallel to Central Avenue he drew Franklin, after his hero, Benjamin Franklin. To connect Washington, Central, and Franklin he drew three streets and named them William, John and Henry, after his sons.

Braunsdorf built:
* 1872 – The Aetna Sewing Machine Company, the largest factory in Pearl River, and ceded land to the railroad company so workers from New York City could get to his factory.
* 1872 – The Pearl River Post Office and became the first Postmaster.
* 1873 – Two brick train stations (passenger/freight) still in use today.
* The Pearl River Hotel
* Low-cost housing for the factory employees he attracted from Germany and Scandinavia.

In 1894, Talbot C. Dexter moved his Dexter Folder Company to Pearl River. On August 25, 1885, Dexter filed a patent for an automatic folding machine that changed the way newspapers, books, and magazines were folded and assembled. Between 1885 and 1913, Dexter filed many patents, some still in use today.

In 1907, Ernst J. Lederle, former New York City Health Commissioner, established the Lederle Antitoxin Laboratories in Pearl River. In 1930, it became Lederle Laboratories, a division of American Cyanamid. During World War II, Lederle was a major supplier of vaccines and blood plasma to the U.S. armed forces.

In 1931, Gottfried (Fred) Schmidt invented the automatic pinsetter. Brunswick was not interested in an automatic machine at the time. In 1937, AMF acquired the patent rights to this early machine—The “Sch-Bec-Roy”, which stood for Schmidt (inventor), Beckerle (bowling alley proprietor) and McElroy (blueprint designer).

In 1955, Pearl River was the setting for &quot;Norby&quot;, an NBC situation comedy that aired from January to April of that year and was one of the first regular television series filmed in color. It starred David Wayne as a small-town banker who lived and worked in Pearl River, where the 13 episodes of the series were filmed.

In 2011, CNNMoney.com ranked Pearl River 78th on its annual &quot;100 Best Places to Live&quot; list.

Lederle Laboratories (which became Wyeth) was founded in 1907 on a Pearl River farm by Ernst J. Lederle. The site grew to encompass and 40 buildings, and employ 4,000 workers. After Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009, the number of employees at the site was greatly reduced, and most of the campus was sold in the mid-2010s. Streets and a pond on the campus are named after scientists and inventors:

<doc id="127091" wikidata="Q3452405" url="?curid=127091" title="Piermont, New York">
<text>Piermont is a village incorporated in 1847 in Rockland County, New York, United States. Piermont is in the town of Orangetown, located north of the hamlet of Palisades, east of Sparkill, and south of Grand View-on-Hudson, on the west bank of the Hudson River. The population was 2,517 at the 2020 census. Woody Allen set &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1984) in Piermont.

The village&#x27;s name, in earlier years known as Tappan Landing, was given by Dr. Eleazar Lord, author, educator, deacon of the First Protestant Dutch Church and first president of the Erie Railroad. It was derived by combining a local natural feature – Tallman Mountain – and the most prominent man-made feature of the village – the long Erie Railroad pier.

==History==
Sparkill Creek cuts through the north end of the Hudson Palisades, providing easy access to the fertile valley of the unnavigable upper Hackensack River. &quot;Tappan Landing,&quot; &quot;Tappan Slote&quot;, or &quot;Taulman Landing,&quot; as the little port on the Hudson River was called, thus became the original port for southern Orange County. The valley in the Palisades created by the creek also provided an obvious route for the Erie Railroad&#x27;s first-built line (now known as the Piermont Branch), which originated at Suffern, New York, to reach eastward to the Hudson (with water connection to New York City). The railroad built a long pier into the river near the creek in 1839 as its principal terminal. The pier and the nearby mountains suggested a new name for the community, which was incorporated as a village in 1850. During World War II the pier was the ferry terminal to which troops from Camp Shanks marched in order to be transported to New York Port of Embarkation piers for transfer to overseas transports bound for the European Theater. A memorial plaque notes that history at the pier.

Late in the 20th century, Piermont became a modest tourist attraction for day-trippers from New York City, particularly those bicycling on Bike Route 9.

===Recent Developments===
==Proposed CBM Zoning Controversy==
In 2024 the village government led by Bruce Tucker became embroiled in controversy around a proposed three-story residential building in downtown. Village residents vehemently objected to the modern boxy architecture as wholly inconsistent with the village&#x27;s historic character and aesthetics. The legality of the village&#x27;s Board of Trustees&#x27; amendment to its zoning code to facilitate the proposed development was openly challenged by the Rockland County Planning Department. Village residents also raised concerns about increased traffic, parking issues, and the site having previously served as a gas station with underground storage tanks.

Village residents and neighbors flocked to social media to express their concerns, including the establishment of Preserve Piermont on Facebook and a blog entitled Unhand Piermont! which together focus not only on the unsuitability of the proposed project but allege wrongdoing by village officials.

Dennis Hardy, former Mayor of Piermont from 1997 to 2001, noted &quot;There was little public input. The village stubbed its nose at the county by ignoring the county planning office.&quot; Hardy also called the project was &quot;totally out of character with downtown Main Street.&quot;

Resignations related to this controversy included Piermont Planning Board Chair Daniel Spitzer (brother of former Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer) and Piermont Trustee Nathan Mitchell. 

In response to a lawsuit filed by village residents, on October 11, 2024 Rockland County Supreme Court Justice Hal Greenwald declared the law which created the Piermont Central Business Multi-Use (CBM) Zoning District “null, void and jurisdictionally invalid.” The ruling was based on the failure, under Rockland County General Municipal Law, for the Village of Piermont to have referred the law creating the new zoning district to the County Planning Department for final approval.

==Piermont Pier Imminent Collapse==
In November 2024 the concrete end of the historical Piermont Pier was closed off as it was deemed to be structurally deficient and at risk of imminent collapse. Mayor Bruce Tucker noted &quot;We are going to need some major money here...if anyone has any money, we&#x27;d love to talk to them.&quot;

===Piermont Station===
The Piermont Branch was not the only Erie rail line that served the village. Piermont Railroad Station, located on Ash Street, is a Victorian Stick style structure built in 1873 which served as Piermont&#x27;s stop for the former Erie Railroad Northern Branch north–south line, which went from Nyack, New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey. Service on the Northern Branch stopped running through Piermont in 1966. The branch was abandoned in the 1970s as a result of railroad consolidation.

The exterior of the building was renovated to its original architecture and French gray, light-green and oxide-red color scheme in 2006 by the Piermont Historical Society. They replaced the roof and installed a new cupola. The train station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

===Piermont Fire Department===
Piermont Fire Department, Rockland County department 13, is an all-volunteer fire department, providing fire, EMS, and water rescue services, and is located on Main Street. Piermont is one of the few districts in Rockland County having a Dive Rescue team, providing water rescue services from the Tappan Zee Bridge to the Palisades.

===Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge===
The Piermont hand-cranked drawbridge, also known as the Sparkill Creek Drawbridge, was originally built in 1880 by the King Iron Bridge Company, a company from Cleveland, Ohio, that constructed more than 10,000 bridges over six decades. The hand-cranked drawbridge is used as a pedestrian walkway providing a link to Tallman Mountain State Park. This bridge is the only hand-cranked drawbridge in Rockland County and perhaps in the United States. Back in the day, fishermen on sloops heading up and down the creek got out of their vessel, cranked up the drawbridge, sailed across, got out of their vessel and cranked down the drawbridge for vehicular traffic. The whole bridge was dismantled piece by piece, sent off-site for restoration and restored to its original state after a complete forensic analysis. Allan King Sloan, the great-great-grandson of the company&#x27;s founder, provided some of the information that is on the historical marker nearby and attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 2009.

==Notable people==
* Alfred Bristol, a 100-year-old World War II veteran of Piermont who served his country in a segregated Army unit, was a recipient of the Rockland County Buffalo Soldier Award. The award, presented since 1993, is named after the Black 10th Cavalry Regiment that was stationed near the railroad construction camps of the Kansas Frontier in 1867. Regiment members were nicknamed “Buffalo Soldiers” by the Plains Indians, based on their exceptional and fearsome fighting reputation. They were never defeated during 23 years of service in the Indian Wars, from 1867 to 1890. Bristol enlisted in the segregated New York Army National Guard in 1931. He belonged to the “Harlem Hellfighters,” the nickname for the 369th Infantry Regiment, which was later reorganized into the 369th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Gun Battalion and was sent to the Pacific during World War II. It participated in the 10th Army Division&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Okinawa, a Japanese stronghold, in 1945. Upon completing Officer Candidate School, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, a rarity for Blacks at the time. Bristol and his wife, Carolyn, who married in 1941, moved to Shanks Village in Orangeburg after World War II where Bristol organized meetings, dances, parades and the 25-cent &quot;“Shanks Carpool”&quot; to and from New York City. Bristol played a role in the creation of Tappan Public Library and from 1963 to 1995 served as a trustee and president of the library&#x27;s board. In 1967, he organized the Art for the Mountain auction to help save Clausland Mountain from development, with the 550-acre site later becoming a county park.
* Grady Anderson of Nanuet, a Vietnam-era Army veteran and the 1996 award recipient, stated &quot;“The purpose was to honor African-American unsung heroes in Rockland County who served in the military and, like their predecessors, experienced the wrath of racism, and were successful in their fields and for giving back to the community,”&quot; Anderson said. 
*Thomas Pomplin - Pomplin, an African-American resident of Orangetown and a dedicated member of the Piermont Fire Department, died on August 5, 1854, while responding to a fire in Nyack.

<text>Ramapo is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States. It was originally formed as New Hampstead, in 1791, and became Ramapo in 1828. It shares its name with the Ramapo River. As of the 2020 census, Ramapo had a total population of 148,919, making it the most populous town in New York outside of Long Island. If all towns in New York were cities, Ramapo would be the 12th-largest city in the state of New York.

The town&#x27;s name, recorded variously as &quot;Ramopuck&quot;, &quot;Ramapock&quot;, or &quot;Ramapough&quot;, is of Lenape origin, meaning either &quot;sweet water&quot; or &quot;slanting rocks&quot;. Early maps referred to Ramapo as Ramepog (1695), Ramepogh (1711), and Ramapog (1775).

The town is located south of Haverstraw and west of Clarkstown and Orangetown.

== History ==

The present-day town was originally inhabited by the Munsee, a band of the Lenape nation. Their descendants now live on Stag Hill in Mahwah, New Jersey, where they form the New Jersey-recognized Ramapo Lenape Nation.

During the American Revolutionary War, Commander-in-Chief George Washington is said to have climbed the Ramapo Torne (near Sloatsburg) with a telescope to watch the July 24, 1777, sailing of the British fleet off Sandy Hook in New Jersey. General Washington and his troops set up an encampment in Suffern, in the west of Ramapo, due to its strategic location near a local mountain pass. In this encampment were two French soldiers, Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. The encampment was on the path to Yorktown, Virginia, where the final battle of the American Revolution took place.

The Town of New Hampstead was formed from part of the Town of Haverstraw in 1791, eight years after the end of the Revolution; the name was changed to Hempstead in 1797, and to Ramapo in 1828.

The first railroad line across Rockland County was built in 1841 and ran from Piermont to Ramapo. By 1851, the line was extended to Lake Erie, and was considered an engineering marvel.

Ramapo Iron Works, located near present-day State Route 17 at the base of Terse Mountain, was a producer of first cut nails made in America, wood screws, cotton cloth, and spring steel in the first half of the 19th century. Its founder, Jeremiah H. Pierson, was influential in building the Nyack Turnpike and the New York &amp; Erie Railroad across the county. A cotton mill is still standing on the east side of the road.

In 1916, what would become State Route 59, which reached from Nyack to Spring Valley in 1915, was extended to Suffern and Hillburn.

Ramapo was one of the first cities to use Adequate Public Facilities acts to tier growth and infrastructure together. The 1971 court case &quot;Golden v. Planning Board of Ramapo&quot; is the basis for the subsequent expansion of growth management practices, including the use of development impact fees.

In 2006 &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Ramapo as the 49th best place in the United States and the best place in New York State to live. Arts and leisure, business, housing, low crime rates and open spaces/parkland determined the town&#x27;s ranking. In the category of park space, percentage of land set aside for gardens and parks, the town finished first. Ramapo received the highest rating and one of the best in the country for its open spaces and parkland.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.11%, is water.

The southern town line is the border of New Jersey, and the western town line is the border of Orange County. The break in the Ramapo Mountains at Suffern formed by the Ramapo River causes the town to be the site of the New York State Thruway and I-287, New York State Route 17, and a railroad line. The Palisades Interstate Parkway runs through the northeastern corner of the town, with an exit at the Haverstraw town line on the northern border.

Torne Mountain (; shown on topographic maps as &quot;High Torne&quot;), in Harriman State Park, overlooks the Ramapo Pass and remnants of the once-thriving Ramapo Iron Works. During the American Revolution, the Torne served as a lookout for British ship movements on the Hudson. Legend tells that Gen. George Washington lost his watch on the mountain, and it may still be heard ticking up there in a crevice of rock.

The highest point in Ramapo is Squirrel Swamp Mountain near the northern border of the town, with an elevation of .

==Landmarks==

The New Hope Church is a historic Reformed Christian church in Monsey, established in 1824. The congregation continues to meet every Sunday in their building dedicated in 1869.

In August 1887, the Ryan family purchased the former Groesbeck mansion, which was built in the 1860s. The estate was called &quot;Montebello&quot; (which gave its name to the village in which it now lies). It now lies across from Suffern Middle School, which was built in 1942, nearly 80 years after the estate.

Torne Brook Farm, on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in the town.

==Recreation==
The Joseph T. St. Lawrence Community, Health, and Sports Complex (aka &quot;Torne Valley Recreation Center &amp; Fields&quot;) was dedicated and opened on November 19, 2006. The facility features a turf multi-purpose field with stands to accommodate 1800 spectators, a separate climate-controlled dome, a 60 x 40 yard, and a turf practice area. It also features three multi-purpose indoor courts, a running track, cardio equipment, weight training machines, two racquetball courts, a computer room, and a dance/aerobic studio. Sports include football, lacrosse, soccer, baseball, and field hockey, as well as year-round sports programs that were not previously available to Ramapo residents. Although the residents of Ramapo have the exclusive right to join the Joseph T. St. Lawrence Community and Health Center, paid memberships are available to others.

The Ramapo Amateur Basketball Association (RABA) offers youth leagues for those 7–15 years old and adult leagues (18+). The Joseph T. St. Lawrence Center also hosts adult racquetball leagues.

The New York Boulders are a professional baseball team based just outside the village of Pomona and a member of the Frontier League. Christopher St. Lawrence pushed through the financing of the park even after residents voted it down. A state audit found that taxpayers could be liable for up to $60 million for Provident Bank Park in Ramapo.

==Government==
Ramapo is run by a town supervisor, until May 19, 2017, Christopher St. Lawrence. In April 2016, federal prosecutors indicted St. Lawrence and a former town official, N. Aaron Troodler, on 22 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy. The fraud related to a number of projects such as a minor league baseball stadium and condominium development, falsified accounting entries made to sell Town bonds to investors, and misappropriating funds from the town&#x27;s special tax districts (such as its ambulance fund) to use in its general fund. Troodler pleaded guilty to a number of the fraud charges on March 7, 2017. Jury selection for St. Lawrence&#x27;s trial began on April 18, 2017. St. Lawrence was convicted on May 19, 2017, of 20 felony charges. Following the conviction, Ramapo Deputy Supervisor Yitzchok Ullman announced that St. Lawrence is disqualified from serving as supervisor.

On November 7, 2017, Democrat Michael Specht was elected to become Ramapo&#x27;s next town supervisor. Specht was sworn in on January 1, 2018.

Ramapo is represented in the United States House of Representatives by Mike Lawler. In state government it is represented by Senator Bill Weber, and assembly members Aron Wieder and Kenneth P. Zebrowski.

==Education==

===Colleges===
Rockland Community College, a public two-year community college run by SUNY, is located in the CDP of Viola, about 4 miles (6 km) east of Suffern.

The Sunbridge Institute in Chestnut Ridge is a Waldorf-based adult learning center that specializes in training teachers. It offers Masters degrees in education in collaboration with the State University of New York (SUNY).

===Public schools===
The town is served by two school districts. The western part of the town (Suffern, Montebello, Airmont, Sloatsburg. Hillburn) is primarily served by the Suffern Central School District, and the eastern part of the town (Spring Valley, Monsey, Pomona, Chestnut Ridge, New Hempstead) by the East Ramapo Central School District.

===Suffern Central School District===

The western half of Ramapo is served by the Suffern Central School District. Up until August 2017, the district was known as Ramapo Central, but the district and community sought a name change to avoid continuing confusing with East Ramapo Central School District. The name change was approved by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The district operates five elementary schools that go from grades K-5, Cherry Lane, Montebello, R.P. Connor, Sloatsburg, and Viola; one middle school that goes from grades 6–8, Suffern Middle School; and one high school, Suffern High School. Both the middle and high schools&#x27; mascots are mountain lions, known colloquially as &quot;mounties.&quot; Cherry Lane Elementary was awarded with a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence award from the U.S. Department of Education in 2013, and is one of four schools within the district to receive the New York State High Performing Reward School award by the New York State Department of Education in 2014. The other three schools include Montebello Elementary, Sloatsburg Elementary, and Suffern High School.

===East Ramapo Central Central School District===

The eastern half of Ramapo is served by the East Ramapo Central School District. The district operates four elementary schools that go from grades 1–3, Grandview, Summit Park, Fleetwood, and Margetts; and five elementaries that go from grades 4–6, Lime Kiln, Kakiat, Hempstead, Eldorado, and Elmwood; totaling nine elementary schools. It also operates two middle schools that go from grades 7–8, Pomona and Chestnut Ridge; and two high schools, Ramapo and Spring Valley. Spring Valley High&#x27;s mascot is a tiger, and Ramapo High&#x27;s is a griffin.

As of 2022, the district&#x27;s public schools educate some 9,500 children, while about 30,000 children who live in the district and attend private schools, mostly yeshivas that serve a growing Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish community.

In 2005 the Orthodox Jewish population of the district received majority control of the school board. This new board began reducing the budget and lowering taxes. The communities using the public schools opposed these actions. In July 2010 the School Board of the East Ramapo Central School District voted to sell Hillcrest Elementary School — closed due to budget cuts — to the Hasidic Jewish Congregation Yeshiva Avir Yakov of New Square.

In 2010, the school board also voted to sell Merrill L. Colton Elementary School to Monsey-based Bais Malka Congregation and the Hebrew Academy for Special Children, a Brooklyn-based religious school for children with special needs. Transactions involving the two buildings were the focus of an ongoing state attorney general&#x27;s investigation. Separately, hundreds of parent plaintiffs have also challenged them as part of their federal lawsuit against the district. The sale was finalized in 2014.

On June 30, 2011, former president of the East Ramapo Central School District Nathan Rothschild pleaded guilty to a mail fraud scheme which had been an attempt to eliminate his own private debt. The scheme involved selling public land to his creditors, then buying the land back at a higher price. He engaged in these activities as Fire Commissioner in Monsey. Questions arose as to whether the attempt to sell Hillcrest Elementary School was engineered for similar pursuits, as the sale of the 12-acre public school campus was engineered during his time in office as the school board president at East Ramapo Central School District.

In 2022, New York State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli announced that East Ramapo Central was the most &quot;fiscally stressed&quot; public school district in the state.

===Private schools===
Most private schools in Ramapo are Orthodox Jewish and Hasidic Jewish &quot;yeshivas&quot;, as almost half of the town&#x27;s population is Jewish. Most yeshivas are located in the eastern part of the town. Some include Yeshiva Avnei Shlomo, Yeshiva Ohr Reuven, Yeshiva Darchei Noam, and Bais Yaakov Chofetz Chaim.

The sole Roman Catholic private school in the town is St. Joseph&#x27;s School; Sacred Heart School closed in 2020. In addition, some Catholic county residents send their high school-aged sons to Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, New Jersey.

There are four non-religious private schools in Ramapo: the Goddard School, the Skill Building Center, the Green Meadow Waldorf School, and the Rockland County Learning Center.

==Sister cities==
In recognition of Ramapo&#x27;s substantial cultural diversity, former Town Supervisor Herbert Reisman, along with many volunteers from the various communities in Ramapo, started the twinning program. This program is made up of committees that raise funds and organize trips to Ramapo&#x27;s twin towns around the world, providing local high school students the opportunity to experience life in other countries.

There are currently seven active twinning committees in Ramapo:
* African Twinning Committee (Ghana)
* Chinese Twinning Committee (China)
* Indian Twinning Committee (India)
* Irish Twinning Committee (Doneraile, Ireland)
* Israeli Twinning Committee (Beit Shemesh, Israel)
* Italian Twinning Committee (Andretta, Italy)
* Philippine-American Twinning Committee (Makati, the Philippines)

<text>Sloatsburg is a village in the town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York, United States. Located east of Orange County, it is at the southern entrance to Harriman State Park. The population was 3,036 at the 2020 census. The village is named after Stephen Sloat, an early European landowner.

==History==
The land that would become the village of Sloatsburg was part of the hunting grounds of the Minsi band of the Leni Lenape Indians, whose people occupied much of the mid-Atlantic area at the time of European encounter. The area was the site of a major Indian path through the Ramapo Mountains. The path was later improved as the New York to Albany road and, in 1800, the Orange Turnpike. It remains an important thoroughfare today as the New York State Thruway, New York State Route 17 and the Norfolk Southern Railway line run along its route.

Wynant Van Gelder, an ethnic Dutch colonist, purchased the area from the Minsi in 1738. In 1747, he gave it to his father-in-law, Isaac Van Deusen. When his daughter Marritge Van Deusen married Stephen Sloat, Isaac gave the couple the land in 1763. They built a stone house on the property and operated a tavern, which was a regular stop on the New York-to-Albany stage route. During the American Revolution, the Sloat House was headquarters for American troops stationed in the Ramapo Pass. The house is a private residence, listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Rockland County, New York (NRHP). There he established Sloat&#x27;s Tavern, which became a regular stop on the New York to Albany stage route.

Sloatsburg, originally &quot;Pothat&quot;, was named after the Sloat family. During the American Revolutionary War, the stage route became an important military route and the Ramapo pass an important strategic point, occupied by American troops throughout the war. George Washington traveled through the area several times and stayed in Sloat&#x27;s Tavern at least once, on June 6, 1779.

After the war, the Sloats added a tannery and a cotton mill. One of the sons, Jacob Sloat, was a gifted mechanic. He opened a mill in 1815 for making cotton cloth, importing cotton from the South. He successfully turned to making exclusively cotton twine after patenting a process for dressing it in 1840. At peak, he produced around of twine per week. The family operated the mill until the Civil War, when it close temporarily for lack of cotton. It was one of numerous mills near New York City that produced cotton textiles; in 1860 half the exports from New York were cotton products. The mill ceased operations in 1878, after the South developed its own textile mills.

In the early 19th century, Abram Dater built an iron forge on the Ramapo River, and a grist mill and a saw mill soon followed. Between 1836 and 1841, the Erie Railroad built a line through Sloatsburg, resulting in a major increase in the population and prosperity of the village. After the Civil War, the village prospered until the great flood of 1903 destroyed most of the factories in the town. First built close to the river for its water power, many were never rebuilt.

During Prohibition, Sloatsburg&#x27;s rural setting and proximity to New York City made it an attractive location for stills and bootlegging; the gangsters running the operations also occasionally used the local woods to dispose of bodies of those killed in the course of business. In 1929, with a population of 1,559, Sloatsburg was incorporated as a village, with David Henion elected as the first mayor.

The rise of the automobile early in the 20th century had a profound impact on the area. Prior to construction of the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Parkway in the 1950s, Sloatsburg was cut in half by automobile traffic, which could back up for miles in the 1940s and 1950s on the Orange Turnpike. Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1952, the backup extended for .

<text>South Nyack is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Orangetown in Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Grand View-on-Hudson, northeast of Orangeburg, east of Blauvelt State Park, south of Nyack and west of the Hudson River. The hamlet is the western terminus of the Tappan Zee Bridge. Its population was 3,510 at the 2010 census. The hamlet was formerly incorporated as a village from 1878 until 2022.

==History==
Following the extension of the Northern Branch of The New Jersey Railroad into the area in the mid-19th century, rapid growth ensued. Town government no longer being seen as an effective means of dealing with the area&#x27;s needs, village incorporation was discussed. Fearing higher taxes, those in what would have become the northern part of Nyack village formed their own municipal corporation first, named Upper Nyack. Nyack village still incorporated, although without this northern portion. Residents in the southern part of Nyack village, however, soon became dissatisfied with the notion of paying taxes that more heavily benefitted the rest of the village. After succeeding in dissolving Nyack&#x27;s corporation, the southern portion of the former village incorporated as the village of South Nyack. The area between Upper Nyack and South Nyack was reincorporated thereafter, again as Nyack.

On December 17, 2020 residents voted 508-292 to dissolve the village in favor of becoming an unincorporated area within the town of Orangetown. The dissolution vote did not take immediate effect, and the village continued to exist until March 31, 2022, after which it became a hamlet within the Town of Orangetown.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the hamlet has a total area of , of which is land and , or 63.31%, is water. South Nyack is located adjacent to the Hudson River.

The Nyack Ice House, formerly located at 90 Clinton Avenue, which opened in 1881, producing and delivering blocks of ice to homes, restaurants, bars and stores, was demolished on April 2 and 3, 2008. During the 19th century, the Nyack Ice House was the only ice plant between Englewood, New Jersey and Newburgh, New York. When sold in 1921, production of coal and later oil began at the site and the name changed to &quot;Nyack Ice and Coal Co.&quot; In 1965, the business also sold milk and was operated under the original name. Recently, the company sold mostly to ice carvers and supermarkets and supplied the ice for magician David Blaine&#x27;s stunt in 2000 when he suspended himself in a block of ice over Times Square.

Orangetown Fire Company No. 1, located at 90 Depot Place, was founded in 1834 and was Rockland County&#x27;s first fire company. Today it is one of eight components of the Nyack Fire Department.

The company still holds in its possession its first apparatus, which dates back to 1749 and survived a fire in the firehouse some years ago. The Orangetown Fire Company No. 1 also serves Upper Nyack and Nyack.

<text>Spring Valley is a village in the town of Ramapo and Clarkstown in Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Chestnut Ridge, east of Airmont and Monsey, south of Hillcrest, and west of Nanuet. The population was 33,066 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous community in both Clarkstown and Rockland County, after New City.

Spring Valley spans the border of two towns, occupying an eastern portion of the town of Ramapo and a small western portion of the town of Clarkstown. The village is next to the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and is served by a New Jersey Transit train station at the terminus of the Pascack Valley Line.

Spring Valley is north of Manhattan and north of the New Jersey border.

==History==
Before the opening of the railroad, there were no homes in Spring Valley.

In 1842, the New York &amp; Erie Railroad called this part of the territory &quot;Pascack&quot;, after a stream by the same name. The residents of the area decided to call the place Spring Valley – one certain large spring in the Valley Pond being responsible for the name. Before naming the territory Spring Valley, it was called Scotland, named after their homeland, by Scotsmen who had settled in the area.

In 1885, E. P. Lespenasse, of Spring Valley, walked from Haverstraw, New York to Washington, D.C. to settle an election bet. He carried a live pig and a rooster on his month-long journey. Lespenasse sold over 600 copies of picture post cards of himself and the animals he carried before the start of his walk and along the way as souvenirs and to support his journey.
In 1914, President Theodore Roosevelt, visited Spring Valley to discuss the political issues of the day, speaking at Lyceum.

On July 21, 1919, the Valley Theatre was first opened.

In 1923, the Edwin Gould Foundation was incorporated. The Lakeside School for Girls and the Kingsland Industrial Schools for Boys opened on South Main street.

In 1929, Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the principal speaker at the Fourth of July celebration in Spring Valley.

In 1948, President Harry S. Truman stopped at Spring Valley while touring the country in the last whistle-stop campaign by train.

Around World War II, Spring Valley had summer resorts that had many New York City Jewish people as customers. After World War II large resorts in the Catskill Mountains and other areas began to attract Jews instead, leaving the Spring Valley hotels empty. William Casey, Rockland County historian, said that many Hasidic groups began to settle during this period.

The final steam locomotives on the Erie Railroad were commuter engines that ran between Jersey City and Spring Valley. Steam last operated on the Erie on March 17, 1954, when the fires were dropped on K-1 class Pacific locomotive No. 2530.

In 2007, Spring Valley Mayor George Darden was elected vice president of the World Conference of Mayors during the organization&#x27;s 23rd annual mayors&#x27; conference held in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The organization includes mayors from the National Conference of Black Mayors and the Union of African Villages, whose goal is to foster constructive relationships among mayors around the world.

Revitalization measures are currently underway in the downtown area of the village, including a mass demolition of abandoned buildings on Main Street and the construction of new mixed-use commercial/residential buildings in its place.

For over 50 years, Spring Valley was the site of a military parts distributor, Sarafan Auto Supply, which supplied military parts all around the world. This third-generation business became part of the community; as business expanded, it grew to take up a large portion of the industrial section of the downtown area. Recently the business moved out of Spring Valley, but the lot which it occupied still has many of the original buildings built by Jacob Sarafan in the early 1900s.

===Corruption in Spring Valley===
*On August 4, 2014, Mayor Demeza Delhomme was locked up in the county jail after a state Supreme Court justice found him in contempt of a court order to open the village&#x27;s civic center to host its summer camp.
*In 2015 the former mayor of Spring Valley, Noramie Jasmin, was convicted in federal court in the Southern District of New York of taking kickbacks to push through a community center and catering hall. She was also convicted of extortion and wire fraud and for selling her vote for $5,000 and a 50-percent ownership stake in the building. She served out a four-year prison term at Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West Virginia.
*In June 2015 former Spring Valley deputy mayor Joseph Desmaret was sentenced to three years in federal prison for his part in a corruption scheme involving a proposal to build a village-owned catering hall on Route 45 in Spring Valley.
*In November 2017 Spring Valley trustee Vilair Fonvil was found guilty of corruption charges that accused him of stealing $11,000 from a summer camp program, which ended his career as a village official.

<text>Suffern is a village that was incorporated in 1796 in the town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York. Located adjacent to the town of Mahwah, New Jersey, Suffern is located 31 miles northwest of Manhattan. As of the 2020 census, Suffern&#x27;s population was 11,402.

==History==
&quot;The Point of the Mountains&quot; or &quot;Sidman&#x27;s Clove&quot; were names used before the American Revolution to designate the present village of Suffern. The area originally was inhabited by the Ramapough, a tribe of Munsee, who were a division of the Lenape tribe. Upon Sidman&#x27;s death, this land passed into the hands of his son-in-law, John Smith, who sold it to John Suffern.

The village of Suffern was founded in 1796. John Suffern, first Rockland County judge, 1798–1806, settled near the base of the Ramapo Mountains in 1773, and called the place New Antrim, after his home in County Antrim, Ireland. His French Huguenot ancestors had settled there after fleeing religious persecution in France. New Antrim&#x27;s location was considered strategically important in the Revolutionary War because it was at an important crossroads near Ramapo Pass. General George Washington and other important military leaders used John Suffern&#x27;s home as headquarters when they were in the area.

This history has been recognized in the town. Suffern is a stop on the Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail, under the auspices of the National Park Service. This trail commemorates the route followed by General Washington and the French Comte de Rochambeau as they traveled to the siege of Yorktown, Virginia, which led to victory for the United States in gaining independence.
Rochambeau made encampment with his 5,000 soldiers in Suffern on August 25, 1781, on his way to Yorktown, and again on September 13, 1782, as he retraced his steps to New York. A historical marker on the Washington Avenue side of the Lafayette Theatre identifies this site of &quot;Rochambeau&#x27;s Encampment 1781–1782&quot;. The National Park Service has installed a wayside panel near the gazebo in Suffern to commemorate Rochambeau&#x27;s encampment in Suffern. At the time of the encampment, this site was directly across the road from village founder John Suffern&#x27;s home and tavern where the Count de Rochambeau stayed. Based on an 1860 painting of John Suffern&#x27;s home that showed the well in the side yard, his home would have been in at the area of Licata Insurance. The well is in the basement of the furniture store.

During the war, General General Washington and his regiment made camp in the village several times. Lafayette Avenue, the main street of Suffern, is named in honor of Revolutionary War hero Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, better known as the Marquis de Lafayette.

Other guests who took advantage of Suffern&#x27;s hospitality included Lieutenant Colonel Aaron Burr, who later became the third Vice President of the United States; General George Clinton, who became the first (and longest-serving) elected Governor of New York, as well as the fourth Vice President of the United States (under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison); and Alexander Hamilton, first United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington.

From Suffern to Monroe was a main route of travel through the western Hudson Highlands. The main road was the Albany Post Road, one of the oldest roads in the state, which served as the stagecoach line between Albany and New York City . Once the Hudson River froze in winter, the Post Road was heavily traveled as an alternate. The of road through Ramapo Pass was later developed as the Orange Turnpike (now known as Route 17). Tolls were collected from 1800 until 1886 to maintain and improve the road. The New York State Thruway now runs through the pass. The south entrance to the town was garrisoned during the Revolution, with General Washington ordering as many as 400 soldiers to be stationed there at all times.

The first railroad line across Rockland County, the Erie Railroad, was built in 1841 and ran from Piermont to Ramapo. By 1851, the line was extended to Lake Erie, and was considered an engineering marvel. The tracks are now owned by the Norfolk Southern line. In consideration for the right-of-way given it by Judge Edward Suffern, son of founder John, to lay track across his of land, the Erie Railroad named their depot &quot;Suffern&#x27;s Station.&quot; The village became known as Suffern, not New Antrim, as it had been called by John Suffern.

In 1897, Avon Products, known then as California Perfume Company, built a laboratory in Suffern. By 1971 the lab had been expanded into the Avon Suffern Research and Development facility. In late 2005, construction was finished on a state-of-the art, facility that would become Avon&#x27;s global hub for research and development. The new building was constructed on the same site as their previous R&amp;D facility, which was demolished for site parking.

In 2023, Avon was sold to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to be used for research and development laboratories.

In 1916, what would become New York State Route 59, which reached from Nyack to Spring Valley in 1915, was extended to Suffern and the Ramapo hamlet.

In 1924, the Lafayette Theatre, named for the Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette, opened its doors.

In 1972, the Salvation Army&#x27;s College for Officer Training was moved to a site in Suffern. This took over the former School of the Holy Child, a Catholic school for girls.

<text>Tappan ( ) is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of Orangetown, New York, United States. It is located northwest of Alpine, New Jersey, north of Northvale, New Jersey and Rockleigh, New Jersey, northeast of Old Tappan, New Jersey, east/southeast of Nauraushaun and Pearl River, south of Orangeburg, southwest of Sparkill, and west of Palisades; Tappan shares a border with each. The population was 6,673, according to the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history===
The Tappan tribe were a Lenape people who inhabited the region radiating from the Hudson Palisades and the New York – New Jersey Highlands at the time of European colonization in the 17th century. &quot;Tappan&quot; is derived from the Lenape word &quot;tuphanne&quot; thought to mean &quot;cold water.&quot;

The first Orange County courthouse was built in 1691 in Tappan, though by 1737, sessions alternated between Tappan and Goshen. The first school house in Rockland County was built in 1711 in Tappan. It was used as a school until 1860. There would not be another school in the county until late in the 18th century.

===American Revolution===
The Orangetown Resolutions were adopted in 1774 at the home of Yoast Mabie. The Dutch colonial house was built by his brother Casparus Mabie in Tappan. When Great Britain imposed duties on the colonies and closed the port of Boston, local inhabitants passed resolutions calling for a boycott of British imports and exports on Monday, July 4, 1774, two years to the day before the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed.

British Major John André, who conspired with Benedict Arnold to allow the takeover of West Point by the British, was captured in 1780 in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines with the plans of the fort&#x27;s fortifications. Major André was brought to Tappan, confined at Caspurus Mabie&#x27;s home, known as &quot;Mabie&#x27;s Inn,&quot; and brought to trial at the Reformed Church of Tappan; he was found guilty of espionage, hanged, and buried nearby.

Strickland, Major André&#x27;s executioner, who was confined at the camp in Tappan as a dangerous Tory during André&#x27;s trial, was granted liberty for accepting the duty of hangman and returned to his home in the Ramapo Valley or Smith&#x27;s Cove. Joshua Hett Smith, accused of conspiring with Major André, was also brought to trial at the Reformed Church of Tappan. The trial lasted four weeks and ended in Smith&#x27;s acquittal.

General George Washington, who in 1789 became the first president of the United States, used the 1700 DeWint House, Rockland County&#x27;s oldest existing structure, as his headquarters four times between 1780 and 1783, and dined at Mabie&#x27;s Inn during the American Revolution. Today the house known as Mabie&#x27;s Inn is a restaurant operating as The Old 76 House.

<text>Upper Nyack is a village incorporated in 1872 in the town of Clarkstown, Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of the village of Nyack, east of Valley Cottage, south of Rockland Lake State Park, and west of the Hudson River. The population was 2,063 at the 2010 census.

Upper Nyack has a Village Hall and a village law court, located in the same building on North Broadway. Upper Nyack is also home to the Empire Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, established in 1863, one of eight fire companies in the Nyack Joint Fire District.

==History==
Upper Nyack was incorporated in 1872. Two hundred years prior, Claus Jansen Purarent of Bergen Township (now Jersey City) received a patent from Governor Phillip Carteret for of land north of Tappan. Jansen sold to Dowe Harmensen Tallman, and the rest was inherited by his son Cornelius Clausen, who assumed the surname of Kuyper (Cooper). Kuyper was an outstanding public servant in the County of Orange. The first Upper Nyacker also commanded the first company of militia in the county. He died in 1731 and is buried in the Upper Nyack Burial Grounds.

Following the extension of the Northern Railroad of New Jersey into the area in the mid-19th century, rapid growth ensued. Town government no longer being seen as an effective means of dealing with the needs of Nyack proper, village incorporation was discussed. Fearing higher taxes, those in what would have become the northern part of Nyack village formed their own municipal corporation first, named Upper Nyack. Nyack village still incorporated, too, although without this northern portion.

In 1909, the village was known locally as &quot;Goosetown&quot;, probably due to a Colonel Vose, who lived on Highmount Avenue and kept geese which he drove daily down to the river, thus giving the thought that Upper Nyack was full of/for the birds. The slogan &quot;Goosetown against the world&quot; was adopted in 1909 due to a local dispute. During the celebration of Upper Nyack&#x27;s Centennial in 1972, Upper Nyackers proudly displayed bumper stickers again with the words &quot;GOOSETOWN AGAINST THE WORLD&quot;.

* The Josephine Hudson House belonged to the first woman to work in the Knickerbocker Ice Company.
* The Knickerbocker Ice Company was established in 1831. Rockland Lake was known to have had the cleanest and purest ice in the area. Knickerbocker&#x27;s Ice House No. 3, located at Rockland Lake, could store more than 40,000 tons of ice harvested from the lake. The wooden storehouse&#x27;s walls were insulated with sawdust to keep the ice blocks frozen until they were shipped in the summer. By 1834, the company owned a dozen steamboats and 75 ice barges, and employed about 3,000 to ship ice countrywide. The stored ice was placed on inclined railroad cars, transported down the mountainside, placed on barges on the Hudson River and shipped to New York City. So much ice was shipped that Rockland Lake became known as the &quot;Icehouse of New York City&quot;. Knickerbocker burned down in 1926. Knickerbocker&#x27;s Ice House No. 3 is currently a Clarkstown town historic site. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage recently pledged to help preserve the remaining walls.

==History==

===Alms House===

The Alms House (or County Poor House) was established in 1837, at Viola (then known as Mechanicsville) in the town of Ramapo, for the poor and destitute (debtors). It was located west of New City. Rockland County had purchased the parsonage farm of the Kakiat (West New Hempstead) Dutch Reformed Church (also known as the Brick Church) for use as an alms house. There the county originally built a wooden frame house to serve the poor. The inmates contributed to their upkeep by tending the farm. In 1883, a brick building was constructed. The facility included a school for the children. In 1957, the Alms House was moved to Building &quot;C&quot; at the Pomona Health Center in Summit Park, and the property would become the site of Rockland Community College. The Alms House was renamed the Rockland County Infirmary and Home. In 1977, it was removed to Building &quot;A&quot;. It has been renamed the Summit Park Nursing Care Center. 
The old brick Alms House building remains as an administration building (Daniel T. Brucker Hall), used by Rockland Community College. The farm lands are the campus. The Poor Cemetery (Potter&#x27;s Field) remains on the RCC campus, along with the original Gary Onderdonk Veterans&#x27; Cemetery.

The area was originally called &quot;Ball&#x27;s Town&quot; and &quot;Ballton.&quot; The town was formed in 1785 while still in Albany County. The original owners of the town were the Mcdonald brothers. Rev. Eliphalet Ball from Bedford, New York bought the area of land from them and called it Ball&#x27;s Town. Ball also paid the brothers 1 barrel of rum for the right to name the town after himself. Over time the name was shortened to Ballston.

Early settlers in this area feared attacks from Mohawks, who already inhabited the region and who resented the establishment of European buildings on their sacred grounds. One of Ballston&#x27;s historic sites is Indian Rock, a large boulder where Mohawk tribesmen reputedly took white captives (children, in some cases) to torture and kill them.

Ballston Lake, a narrow, -long lake with an unknown maximum depth in the south of the region, was called &quot;Shanantaha&quot; or &quot;Sha-nen-da-ho-ra&quot; by natives. It was known to early white settlers as Long Lake. The lake was part of the Mohawk River during the glacial age and archeological digs have unearthed artifacts indicating settlement around the lake as early as 3,500 BCE.

For a long time the depth of Ballston Lake was not determined, due to the multiple caves that prevented divers from going to the bottom. There has been an artifact found that is dated 2000 B.C.

<text>Ballston Spa is a village and the county seat of Saratoga County, New York, United States, located southwest of Saratoga Springs. It is part of the Capital Region. The population of the village, named after Rev. Eliphalet Ball, a Congregationalist clergyman and an early settler, was 5,111 at the 2020 census. Ballston Spa lies on the border of two towns, situated partly in the Town of Ballston and partly in the Town of Milton. The Ballston Spa School District encompassing most of the combined towns of Milton, Malta, and Ballston is often referred to locally as ‘Ballston Spa’ with the village proper being referred to as ‘The Village’ or &#x27;Town&#x27;.

==History==
The village was first settled in 1771. In 1787, Benajah Douglas, grandfather of 1860 presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas, built the first tavern and hotel at Ballston Spa. It was located near the natural spring.

In 1803, Ballston Spa&#x27;s Sans Souci Hotel, at the time the largest hotel in the United States, was built by Nicholas Low. Presidents, Vice Presidents, Senators and Governors stayed there, as well as many wealthy private citizens. Ballston Spa was incorporated as a village in 1807.

At different times, the village was served by four railroads: the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Ballston Terminal Railroad, the Schenectady Railway Company, and the Hudson Valley Railway.

The village was famous for its mineral water spring used for healing in sanatoria, including the Hawthorne and Lithia springs.

The effervescent water, tonic, and cathartic from this city is also known as Ballston Spa. The liquid contains common salt and carbonates of magnesium and calcium.

===Movies, Music and Books===
Portions of the novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; were written by James Fenimore Cooper in the present day Brookside Museum and inspired by the local landscape.

Buster Red, a Depression era folk singer, wrote in his song &quot;When I Go Out&quot; details about his trip through Pennsylvania and New York. According to the song it was in Ballston Spa that he was ultimately found out for some crime or deception, before moving on to Saratoga. 

The village was the model for the village of North Bath, NY, the setting for the 1993 best-selling novel and 1994 movie, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;. The book&#x27;s author, Richard Russo, is a native of nearby Gloversville. It was also the location of the fictional &quot;Elspeth Hatch&quot; murder trial defended by Clarence Darrow set in 1897 in the book titled &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; by author Caleb Carr.

Several scenes in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;The Way We Were&quot; were filmed on Ballston Spa&#x27;s Front Street. Scenes from &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; (1998) were also filmed in the village.

Ballston Spa was also mentioned in the 1963 novel The Tulip Tree by Howard Rigsby.

<text>Clifton Park is a suburban town in Saratoga County, New York, United States. It is the largest municipality in the county, with a 2020 population of 38,029, according to the 2020 census. As such, it is the largest municipality in New York state east of Syracuse and north of Schenectady. The town&#x27;s name is derived from an early land patent. The town is in the southern part of Saratoga County, approximately north of Albany, northeast of Schenectady, and south of Saratoga Springs.

==History==
The Indigenous Mohawks and Mohicans referred to the area as &quot;Canastigione&quot;, meaning corn flats. The first settlements in what is now Clifton Park were established in the 17th century. The town or area was named in 1707 by Nanning Harmansen. At that time, Nanning Harmansen sent letters to Lord Cornbury requesting letters of Patent for Land he bought from the Indigenous Americans. He also stated in this correspondence that he wanted the patent to be known by &quot;Your name of Cliftons Park&quot;, and the patent was named the Clifton Park Patent. The Iroqouis name for the Clifton Park Patent was Shenendehowa (meaning &quot;Great Plains&quot;) which is where the school district gets its name.

The area along the Mohawk River was popular for ferries across the waterbed, with Eldert Vischer opening the crossing known as Vischer Ferry in 1783. To the northwest, Edward Rexford established Rexford Flats, a small community on the riverbank at the northern end of what became NY 146B.

In 1828, the town of Clifton Park was created as &quot;Clifton&quot; from the town of Halfmoon, but was renamed Clifton Park a year later. It was the last town created in Saratoga County. The town originally consisted of farmland with a small village of homes, churches and businesses on what is now U.S. Route 9, but saw a large demographic change when Interstate 87 was built through the town in 1961.

The Grooms Tavern Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The Mohawk Valley Grange Hall was added in 2012.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (3.29%) is water.

The town&#x27;s southern boundary is defined by the Mohawk River and is the border between Saratoga County and Schenectady and Albany counties.

Interstate 87 (the &quot;Adirondack Northway&quot;) and U.S. Route 9 pass through the eastern part of the town. New York State Route 146 is an east–west highway through most of the center of Clifton Park until it takes a 90 degree turn southward, passing east of the hamlet of Rexford and then crossing the Rexford bridge into the Town of Niskayuna in Schenectady County.

<text>Edinburg is a town in northwestern Saratoga County, New York, United States. It is located in the Adirondack Park. The Batchellerville Bridge crosses Great Sacandaga Lake, connecting parts of the town on either shore.

==Etymology==

The town is named after the city of Edinburgh in Scotland. It was originally spelled as &quot;Edinburgh&quot; but renamed to Edinburg in 1808.

== History ==
Edinburg is located within the Adirondack Park on the shores of Great Sacandaga Lake in northwestern Saratoga County.
The first recorded European settlers arrived in the Sacandaga River Valley area via Fish House in 1787. Abijah Stark came with his family from Coleraine, Massachusetts and settled north of Fish House near the Providence town line. They were followed shortly by the Andersons, West Cotts, Randall and Bass families.

Many of the first settlers moved to the valley during the Revolutionary War. The cheap land and occasions for a better work-life made it a suitable place for settlement. 
Settlement on the west side of the river near Beecher&#x27;s Hollow started in the early 1790s with the Sumner, Barker, Deming, and Partridge families. Batchellerville on the east side started in the late 1790s and early 1800s with the Noyes, Gordon, Batcheller and DeGolia families.
The town was originally part of the Town of Providence, but the area quickly grew. In 1801, the settlers decided that the town was big enough for a name of its own, and was named Northfield at an informal meeting held on March 13, 1801. In 1808, it was renamed Edinburgh because another Northfield was discovered in New York.

The first town meeting took place on April 7, 1801. During this meeting, several laws were established, including raising $50.00 to support the town&#x27;s poor and allowing hogs to roam freely. In a town meeting held in 1802, it was decided that hogs could still roam freely but must wear a sturdy collar called a &quot;yoak&quot;. Additionally, male hogs over two months old were not allowed to roam freely from May 1 to December 25. If a male hog was found roaming during this period, the owner had to pay $1.00 or forfeit the hog.

Ram sheep were also restricted from running at large from September until November. By March 1824 fence viewers were paid $.75 per day.

In February 1825, there was a special meeting, and it was voted unanimously that &quot;we do not wish to comply with the Acts of the Legislature for the erection of a county poor house.&quot;
Farming, logging and manufacturing were the three largest industries. Batchellerville became a manufacturing community, having several large woodenware mills. The area on the west side of the river tended to be more farming-oriented, although some manufacturing was done in Beecher&#x27;s Hollow and Tennantville. These two areas had large saw and woodenware mills.

The town was divided into several communities, most of which had their own school and often a cemetery as well. Some of these besides Beecher&#x27;s Hollow and Batchellerville were: Tennantville, Edinburgh Hill, Clarkville, Sand Hill, Cold Brook, Anderson, and Partridge Districts. Industry prospered until early in the 1880s when several fires destroyed many of the mills and about one-third of the population moved elsewhere to seek jobs.
In the early 1920s, the town lost more of its population in response to the construction of a dam that would flood the valley.

On March 27, 1930, the gates on the Conklingville Dam were closed and by 1931 the valley and surrounding communities on the banks of the river were displaced as the Sacandaga Reservoir was created.
Located in northwestern part of Saratoga County, Edinburg has one of the few covered bridges left in New York State, the only one left in the county. Today the shores of the reservoir, renamed The Great Sacandaga Lake in the 1960&#x27;s, are dotted with hundreds of seasonal homes. Two farms remain from the original buildings. Logging and tourism are the major industries.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (10.45%) is water.

The town is divided by the Great Sacandaga Lake and is linked by the Batchellerville Bridge carrying County Road 98 across the lake. The western town line is the border of Fulton County.&lt;br&gt;

<text>Mechanicville is a city in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 5,163 at the 2020 census, a small decrease from 5,196 in 2010. It is the smallest city by area in the state. The name is derived from the occupations of early residents.

The city is located on the eastern border of Saratoga County and is north of Albany, the state capital. Mechanicville borders the towns of Stillwater (of which it was once a part) and Halfmoon in the county, and the town of Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County.

==History==

The first listing of a settlement on Tenandeho Creek (Anthony Kill) is in 1721. At that time, Cornelius Van Buren had a sawmill at the mouth of the creek where it emptied into the Hudson River.
The first documented occurrence of the name &quot;Mechanicville&quot; dates back to 1829. The name comes from the early settlers, who were independent mastercraftsmen such as millers, carpenters, or butchers, whose professions were commonly known as the &quot;mechanical arts&quot; at the time.

About 35 years later, small flour mills were already established. When the Champlain Canal reached the settlement in 1823, and especially when the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad laid a track through the area in 1835, Mechanicville became an important commerce interchange.

The community became an incorporated village in 1859, when it had about 1000 inhabitants. It grew rapidly as textile mills, factories, and a linen thread company came to Mechanicville.

The first conspicuous casualty of the American Civil War, Elmer E. Ellsworth, was buried in Mechanicville in 1861. His grave is located in the Hudson View Cemetery and is identifiable with a large eagle on top of his memorial.

In 1878, additional railways came to the village, and it became an important center of papermaking.

In 1898, Robert Newton King built a hydroelectric power plant on the Hudson River. The Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant is now the oldest continuously operating hydroelectric plant in the United States and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

By 1900, Mechanicville was a major transfer yard and car repair center for the railways. In the 1920s, Mechanicville had a population of nearly 10,000.

In both the 1900 and 1910 censuses, Mechanicville was enumerated with the town of Half Moon, just to the south of Stillwater.

Mechanicville became a city in 1915. By 1932, it became the terminal of the first experimental high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) scheme in the U.S.: the HVDC Mechanicville–Schenectady line.

With the decline of the railroads, Mechanicville suffered. The largest paper mill in the world, which Mechanicville had hosted since 1904, ceased operations in 1971, and the once thriving industrial city is today a quiet residential city, with most inhabitants working in Albany, Schenectady, and other nearby communities.
On November 1, 2001, Mechanicville was featured on the &quot;Daily Show&quot; with then-rising comedian Steve Carell. The Mechanicville Hydroelectric Plant and Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth Monument and Grave are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Mechanicville-Stillwater tornado===

On May 31, 1998, a large tornado tore through Mechanicville and the adjacent town of Stillwater. It was spawned by a series of severe storms in the late afternoon, causing major damage to the town&#x27;s old industrial section located on US Route 4 and NY-32, along the Hudson River. One of the two historic smokestacks (visible from two miles away) was knocked down by the tornado. In 2005, the other smokestack and the conjoined building were bulldozed. Houses on the Viall Avenue hill sections of Mechanicville and Stillwater were completely destroyed. The tornado was rated F3 on the Fujita scale (winds estimated at 200 MPH).

===Rail yard===
In January 2012, a new intermodal and automotive terminal opened on the site of a former Boston and Maine rail yard. The new rail yard was built by Pan Am Southern, a joint venture between Pan Am Railways and Norfolk Southern.

The $40 million facility Is also used for &quot;filet-toupee&quot; operations, converting double stack container trains from the west to single stack by removing the top layer of containers. This allows the rest of the train to proceed east along track that lacks double stack clearance, particularly the 4 mile Hoosac Tunnel. The removed containers are trucked to local destinations. &quot;Toupee&quot; refers to the reverse process, where a single stack train coming from the east has additional containers placed on top for the rest of its trip.
Some 300 trucks a day visit the site. The automotive terminal opened in 2014.

==Geography==
Mechanicville is located at (42.903922, -73.690458).

<text>Round Lake is a village in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,245 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from a circular lake adjacent to the village. In 1975, the Round Lake Historic District, which encompasses the village, was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The Village of Round Lake is in the Town of Malta.

== History ==
The village began in 1867 as a summer camp meeting locale for groups of Methodists. At first, visitors lived in tents, while visiting ministers could rent space in the second story of the meeting&#x27;s passenger station. By 1868 more permanent structures including cottages, a two-story trustees office and bookstore, and a market appeared. The village was owned and governed by the &quot;Round Lake Association&quot;. By 1881 lectures patterned after Chautauqua Institution were being conducted. In 1887 George West constructed the &quot;George West Museum of Art and Archaeology&quot; to enhance the cultural offerings.

Among the noted Methodist residents was Rev. Strong, creator of the tome Strong&#x27;s Bible concordance until his death.

The 1980-pipe Ferris Tracker organ, originally built in 1847 for Calvary Episcopal Church in New York City, was moved to the Round Lake Auditorium in 1888 and is considered to be the oldest and largest three-manual organ in existence. The organ is still used for musical programs today.

By mid 20th century, declining interest in the cultural activities of the Round Lake Association led to its demise in the 1960s. The museum was dismantled in 1965. After the association was dissolved, the village was incorporated in 1969 to take its place.

The Round Lake Hose Company was founded in 1886 as the M.B. Sherman Hose Company, with a Constitution that required active members have ‘good moral character’ and live within a mile of the community. The first firehouse was situated on Troy Avenue near the intersection of Burlington Avenue. A two-wheeled cart carried two sizes of hose, which were rolled up on a wheel axle and had a long pole with enough handles for seven men to pull it along if necessary. Another two wheeled cart, with a bell mounted on the axle, would proceed ahead of the hoses to sound a warning. The modern Round Lake Hose Company operates two fire stations, housing a total of eleven pieces of apparatus. The membership consists of 65 volunteer men and women who continue to respond to emergencies in the village as well as within the town of Malta and town of Ballston. Additionally, a 1926 Childs fire truck which was purchased from the village of Ballston Spa in 1945 is maintained as a unique parade piece representing their history.

<text>Saratoga is a town in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 5,808 at the 2020 census. It is also the commonly used, but not official, name for the neighboring and much more populous city, Saratoga Springs. The major village in the town of Saratoga is Schuylerville, which is often, but not officially, called Old Saratoga. Saratoga contains a second village, named Victory.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; is a corruption of a Mohawk word. It was the name of Indian hunting grounds located along both sides of the Hudson River. According to the town&#x27;s history, it derives from , meaning &quot;the hillside country of the quiet river&quot;.

Saratoga is located on the eastern border of the county and is located east of Saratoga Springs, and is bordered by Saratoga Lake and the Hudson River.

The town sends students to Saratoga Springs City School District, Schuylerville Central School District, and Stillwater Central School District.

== History ==
The name may derive from the Iroquoian &quot;se-rach-ta-gue&quot; or &quot;sa-ra-ta-ke&quot;, which the early Dutch settlers rendered as &quot;Sarachtoge&quot;. A second early version of the name is, &quot;Saraghtogo&quot; but the origin remains unproven and thus uncertain.

The location was first settled at the end of the 17th century as &quot;Fort Saratoga&quot;. Saratoga soon became contested land between British and French colonial forces, and the village of Saratoga (now Schuylerville) was destroyed by the French in 1745 during King George&#x27;s War.

Saratoga was originally a district of Albany County stretching from north of the Mohawk River to Northumberland, including lands for six miles on both sides of the Hudson River. In 1775, the three districts were Ballstown, Halfmoon, and Saratoga.

It is best known as the location that British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates at the end of the Battles of Saratoga on October 17, 1777, often cited as the turning point for the United States during the American Revolution. The two battles took place in the town of Stillwater to the south, but the final 10 days of encampment and the actual surrender ceremony took place in Saratoga (Schuylerville).

In 1788, an act was passed organizing towns in place of districts and Stillwater was created from the Saratoga District, making four towns in what would become Saratoga County. These four mother towns were subdivided into the present 19 towns. The original town of Saratoga included the modern-day towns of Easton, Northumberland, Moreau, Wilton, portions of Greenfield and Corinth, and the city of Saratoga Springs. The first loss of territory was in 1789 to the town of Easton (now in Washington County). In 1798, the towns of Corinth, Greenfield, Northumberland, Moreau, and Wilton split from the town of Saratoga. In 1805, a narrow strip in the southwestern part of Saratoga was annexed to the town of Malta. In 1819, the town of Saratoga Springs was formed from the rest of the western part of the town of Saratoga. Later, this would become the city of Saratoga Springs.

The Saratoga Race Course, in the adjoining city of Saratoga Springs, is the oldest operating horse-racing course in the US.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and (5.22%) are water.

The town line is formed by the Hudson River and is the border of Washington County. Fish Creek, a tributary of the Hudson, is the outflow of Saratoga Lake.

==Transportation==

U.S. Route 4 (Turning Point Trail) follows the Hudson River along the eastern part of the town. New York State Route 29 (General Philip Schuyler Commemorative Highway) is an east–west highway, intersecting US-4 at Schuylerville. New York State Route 32 is a north–south highway, partly conjoined with US-4 near Schuylerville.

<text>Saratoga Springs is a city in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 28,491 at the 2020 census. The name reflects the presence of mineral springs in the area, which has made Saratoga a popular resort destination for over 200 years. It is home to the Saratoga Race Course, a thoroughbred horse racing track operated by the New York Racing Assocation, and Saratoga Performing Arts Center, a music and dance venue. The city&#x27;s official slogan is &quot;Health, History, and Horses&quot;.

==History==
The Mohawk Indigenous people used the area that is now Saratoga Springs as prime hunting ground, and some thought of the mineral springs as a gift from Manitou.

The British built Fort Saratoga in 1691 on the west bank of the Hudson River. During the early part of the 1700s, settlers from Europe began to develop the area. Shortly thereafter, British colonists settled the current village of Schuylerville approximately one mile south; it was known as Saratoga until 1831.

In 1767, William Johnson, a colonial British officer who was a hero of the French and Indian War, was brought by Native American friends to the spring to treat his war wounds. (In 1756, Johnson had been appointed British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northeast region due to his success in building alliances with the Mohawk and other Iroquois nations. He had learned the language and created many trading relationships. He achieved great wealth from trading and landholdings, and was knighted for his service to the Crown with the Iroquois.)

The first permanent European-American settler built a dwelling in the area &quot;circa&quot; 1776. The springs attracted tourists, and Gideon Putnam built the first hotel for travelers. Putnam also laid out the roads and donated land for use as public spaces.

The Battles of Saratoga, the turning point of the Revolutionary War, did not take place in Saratoga Springs. Rather, the battlefield is to the southeast, in the Town of Stillwater. A museum dedicated to the two battles sits on the former battlefields. The British encampment before the surrender at Saratoga took place east of the city, in Schuylerville, where several historical markers delineate points of interest. The surrender of the sword of battle took place where Fort Saratoga had been, south of Schuylerville.

Saratoga Springs was established as a settlement in 1819 from a western portion of the Town of Saratoga. Its principal community was incorporated as a village in 1826, and the entire region became a city in 1915. Tourism was greatly aided by the 1832 arrival of the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad, which brought thousands of travelers to the famous mineral springs. Resort hotels developed to accommodate them. Patronage of the railroad increased after the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company assumed control in 1870 and began running the Empire State Express directly between New York City and the resort.

In the 19th century, doctor Simon Baruch encouraged the development of European-style spas in the United States as centers for health. Due to the presence of mineral waters Saratoga Springs was developed as a spa, generating the development of several hotels, including the United States Hotel and the Grand Union Hotel. The latter was, in its day, the largest hotel in the world.

In 1863, Saratoga Race Course opened, moving to its current location the following year. Horse racing and its associated betting increased tourism at a time when horse racing was a popular national spectator sport. In addition, the Saratoga Springs area was known for its gambling, which after the first years of the 20th century was illegal, but still widespread. Most gambling facilities were located on Saratoga Lake, on the southeast side of the city.

By 1870, it was considered a top upscale resort relying on natural mineral springs, horse racing, gambling, and luxury hotels. World War II imposed travel restrictions which impacted the tourist industry. During the 1950s, the state and city closed the gambling houses in a crackdown on illegal gambling. The closing and demolition in the 1950s of some hotels, including the Grand Union and the United States hurt tourism. 

The city became more accessible with the completion of the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87), which allowed visitors easier access from the north and south. In addition, cultural resources such as classical and popular music and dance, flourished.

===Mineral springs===
The mineral springs occur along the east side of the Saratoga Fault which allows water trapped in subsurface shale layers to reach the surface. The fault displacement can be seen on the east side of Broadway with the best view of the fault at the High Rock Park cliff. 

The Mohawk Indigenous peoples who inhabited this area used the springs for several hundred years before the arrival of European settlers. Later drilling technology was employed by settlers to tap into the spring sources, and by 1900, 203 springs were flowing, some of which were tapped for carbon dioxide extraction, as well as mineral water. This proved to be unsustainable, and by 1908, New York State passed restrictions on use to allow the aquifer to recharge. As of 2019, there are only 17 productive springs. 

Toward the end of the 19th century, excessive pumping for commercial bottling was threatening to deplete the springs. In 1911, the New York State Reservation, now the Spa State Park, was created to protect the springs, and the Lincoln and Roosevelt bath houses were built. Currently, visitors can soak in the mineral waters at the historic Roosevelt Bath house, which also provides spa treatments.

The water from the springs is high in mineral contents, inclucing iron, magnesium, calcium, lithium, iodine, chromium, sodium, zinc, barium, and with 9 of the springs reporting radium content.

Believed by generations to have healing powers, springs can be found in multiple places around the town. However, scientists dispute any medicinal properties from consuming the water due to the high levels of sodium and radium in some of the spring sources. 

Most of the springs are covered by small pavilions and marked by plaques. Others are less conspicuous, sometimes just a spigot in a rock. The springs are famous for their varied and distinct tastes: some are clear freshwater, others are saltier, and some taste strongly of a certain mineral such as sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride. There is a sulfurous odor, but mineral analysis of the water consistently shows almost no presence of dissolved sulfur. The sulfur is in the form of the gas hydrogen sulfide, which degasses from the water very quickly. Visitors are welcome to bottle the spring water for personal consumption.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.17%) is water.

The Adirondack Northway of New York (Interstate 87) and US Route 9 pass alongside and through the city, respectively. New York State Route 29, New York State Route 50, New York State Route 9N, and New York State Route 9P lead into Saratoga Springs. NY 9N has its southern terminus and NY 9P has its northern terminus in the city. US 9 and NY 50 overlap in the city, joined briefly by NY 29.

<text>Schuylerville () is a village in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The village is located in the northeastern part of the Town of Saratoga, east of Saratoga Springs. It is part of the Capital Region of New York. The Village of Victory is adjacent to Schuylerville to the southwest and the Hudson River forms the village&#x27;s eastern border. The population was 1,370 at the 2020 census. The village was incorporated in 1831 and is named after the Schuyler family, a prominent family of Dutch descent in colonial America.

Schuylerville was the site of the surrender of the British Army under General John Burgoyne, following the Battles of Saratoga (1777) in the nearby town of Stillwater. Schuylerville contains several historic buildings, including the General Schuyler House, part of the Saratoga National Historical Park, and Old Saratoga Reformed Church. The schools of the Schuylerville Central School District are located in the village, as are the offices of the Town of Saratoga. The village is served by a public library, Fort Hardy Park, a visitor center, Schuyler Hose Company volunteer fire department and several churches. Village government consists of a mayor and four trustees.

Nearby cultural attractions include the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Race Course, Saratoga National Historical Park and Glens Falls Civic Center. Skidmore College, SUNY Empire State College and Adirondack Community College are also nearby.

==History==

Inhabited by Native Americans as late as 820 A.D., the region was eventually settled by Dutch settlers from Albany in 1691, who called the region Fort Saratoga. These settlers included the influential Schuyler family. Conflicts occurred among the French, Mohawk, Mohican, Dutch, and English peoples. The peace of 1763 between France and England resulted in this area being available for settlement. Homes and mills were built by European Americans, including General Phillip Schuyler&#x27;s flax mill in 1767 (the first of its kind in the American colonies).

The community that developed near the fort was originally called &quot;Saratoga&quot;, but was partly destroyed by the French and their Native allies in 1745 during King George&#x27;s War. The Old Saratoga Reformed Church was organized in 1770. It was used as a hospital during the Revolutionary War.

===Revolutionary War===
In 1777, the British Army under General Burgoyne crossed the Hudson River, one-half mile north of Schuylerville (known then as Saratoga) on their campaign from Canada to Albany in an attempt to end the American Revolution by splitting the colonies in two. The British marched south approximately nine miles to Bemis Heights, near present-day Stillwater, where American troops engaged them in the two Battles of Saratoga, the first on September 19 and the second on October 7, 1777. The British advance was stopped by the American forces, and the British retreated back northward to an encampment along Fish Creek, just outside the village. The Saratoga Battle Monument in the Village of Victory is located near the site of the British encampment.

American forces blocked further British retreat and surrounded the encampment. With winter approaching and no hope of escape, the British were forced to surrender. On October 17, 1777, General Burgoyne surrendered his army to American General Horatio Gates, marking the turning point of the American Revolution. The British laid down their arms in what is now Fort Hardy Park in the Village of Schuylerville. The American victory at Saratoga was enough to convince France to throw their support to the American cause, and Spain eventually followed France&#x27;s lead.

===Historic sites===

The Schuyler House, the Bullard Block, Old Saratoga Reformed Church, and St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Marshall House is listed as a significant Revolutionary War historic site and is the sole surviving building from the time of the Battles of Saratoga. Situated next to the towering Saratoga Monument, the Prospect Hill Cemetery opened in 1865.

The Marshall House lies one mile north of the village center on US Highway 4 and NY Highway 32. It was made famous by the publication of Baroness Frederika Riedesel&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Journals relating to the War of the American Revolution and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga.&quot;

This house was built in 1770–1773. During the closing days of the Battles of Saratoga, Baroness Riedesel with her three infant daughters sheltered there, together with the wives of British army officers and wounded personnel. Her account of the travails of those around her, her keen insight into the personalities of the principal officers of both the British and American armies, and her devotion to her husband in peril have led some commentators to name her as the first woman war correspondent.

The Marshall House was bombarded by the Americans, who assumed it to be an enemy headquarters. Within are conserved cannonballs and other reminders of the ordeal suffered by those who took refuge there. The stone cellar, made famous by the baroness, is largely unchanged. The Marshall House is the sole remaining witness building to the Battles of Saratoga. The owners welcome visitors by appointment.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (10.34%) is water.

The village is on the west bank of the Hudson River, which defines the county line of Washington County.

U.S. Route 4 and NY Route 29 intersect in the community. NY Route 32 is conjoined with US-4 in the village.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, 1,386 people, 593 households, and 356 families were residing in the village. The population density was . The 663 housing units averaged 1,254.5 per square mile (484.3/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 96.4% White, 1.2% African American, 0.9% from other races, and 0.9% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 3.3% of the population.

Of the 593 households, 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.8% were married couples living together, 16.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40% were not families. About 32.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31, and the average family size was 2.91.

In the village, the population was distributed as 25.1% under the age of 20, 22.7% from 20 to 34, 22.2% from 35 to 49, 16.6% from 50 to 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.1 years.

According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey Five-year Estimates, the median income for a household in the village was $55,284, and the median income for a family was $67,768. Males had a median income of $50,625 versus $32,629 for females. The per capita income for the village was $24,157. About 7.8% of families and 12% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.4% of those under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.

In the March 25, 1990, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writer James Howard Kunstler published a piece entitled &quot;Schuylerville Stands Still&quot;. He portrayed Schuylerville as an example of rural &quot;rot and disrepair&quot;, citing unemployment, broken sidewalks, and dented cans at Mini Mart, a local mini market. Residents reacted negatively to his feature. Kunstler also used Schuylerville as an example of a town in decline in a chapter titled &quot;The loss of community&quot; in his 1993 book, &quot;The Geography of Nowhere&quot;.

==Environmental concerns==
Since the late 20th century, much debate has arisen about dredging the Hudson River in the area bordering the east side of the Village of Schuylerville. The General Electric (GE) transformer plant dumped PCBs upstream in Hudson Falls from 1947 to 1977. GE and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have come to an agreement in which GE is responsible for dredging a stretch of the river. The first part of the dredging will end in Schuylerville.

In a press release from the EPA dated February 8, 2007, the EPA announced that the dredging would not start until 2009 because of various project complications. The debate over dredging the Hudson River created tension within the community from the mid- to late 1990s to about 2003. The debate was heated for some time, with some residents skeptical as to whether dredging will make the problem better or worse. This is said to be the largest Superfund project in the United States.
