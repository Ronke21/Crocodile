<text>Bayville (sometimes also referred to as Pine Island) is a village located in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 6,669 at the 2010 census.

The Incorporated Village of Bayville is located on the Long Island Sound facing Greenwich, Connecticut.

== History ==
Bayville incorporated as a village in 1919 during the incorporated village movement which allowed many larger estate owners on Long Island to establish political and security control over their domains.

Like many other Long Island communities, Bayville was first occupied by the Matinecock Indians and was known as Oak Neck and Pine Island. In 1658, Oyster Bay resident Daniel Whitehead purchased the land from the tribes. By 1745, the land was split among 23 men, who mainly grew asparagus. In 1859, Oak Neck was renamed Bayville and the first Methodist church was constructed west of what is now Merritt Lane. Multiple estates were built in the surrounding areas, and in 1898 a drawbridge was built, connecting Bayville and Mill Neck.

In 1909, the Bayville Casino opened for business, attracting beachgoers, and in 1919, Winslow S. Pierce, who owned the Dunstable Estate in town, was elected the first mayor of the Village of Bayville. The Dunstable Estate was sold to Harrison Williams and renamed &quot;Oak Point&quot;. When the Arlington Hotel, Bayville Casino, and Ritzmore Estate burned to the ground, it prompted the creation of the Bayville Fire Department. Bayville was put on the front page of many newspapers in 1927 when the rum rummer William T. Bell ran ashore at the Oak Point estate. Things were a little slow for a while, but after World War II, the community began to boom. A new church, post office, and school were built in the span of three years, and from 1950 to 1960, the population doubled.

The Bayville Bridge, one of two entrances into the village, opened in 1938 and is a major landmark and tourist attraction; it is the fourth bridge at that location.

The village celebrated its centennial in 2019.

== History ==
The village was founded by Helen Marsh of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 1907, planning to build a model community, Marsh purchased of Floral Park gladiola fields. The first Bellerose home was completed, under Marsh&#x27;s supervision, in 1910. Marsh persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to place a station in the new village, and she named the station Bellerose. Though it has been suggested that she named the station for the Rose farm, south of the railroad, and her daughter Belle, she said that she simply found the name &quot;euphonious&quot;. A vote of the homeowners made the name official in 1917.

Bellerose incorporated itself as a village in 1924 in order to gain and maintain home rule.

<text>Bethpage (formerly known as Central Park) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 16,658 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==

The name &quot;Bethpage&quot; comes from the Quaker Thomas Powell, who named the area after the Biblical town Bethphage, which was between Jericho and Jerusalem in the Holy Land. Present-day Bethpage was part of the 1695 Bethpage Purchase. An early name for the northern section of present-day Bethpage was &quot;Bedelltown&quot;,
a name that appeared on maps at least as late as 1906.

On maps just before the arrival of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), the name &quot;Bethpage&quot; appears for a community now included in both the post office district and school district of the adjacent community of Farmingdale. In 1841, train service began to Farmingdale station, near a new settlement less than a mile eastward from what had previously appeared on maps as &quot;Bethpage&quot;. Schedules at that time do not mention Bethpage as a stop, but have a notation &quot;late Bethpage&quot;. On an 1855 map, The location identified as &quot;Bethpage&quot; has shifted slightly southward to include a nearby area now called Plainedge.

Between 1851 and 1854, the LIRR initiated a stop within present-day Bethpage at a station then called &quot;Jerusalem Station&quot;, and on January 29, 1857, a local post office opened, also named &quot;Jerusalem Station&quot;. LIRR schedules listed the station also as simply &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. Residents succeeded in changing the name of the post office to &quot;Central Park&quot;, effective March 1, 1867 (respelled as &quot;Centralpark&quot; from 1895 to 1899). The Central Park Fire Company was organized in April 1910, and incorporated in May 1911. In May 1923 the Central Park Water District was created.

Following the 1932 opening of nearby Bethpage State Park, the name of the local post office was changed to Bethpage on October 1, 1936. The LIRR station was also renamed Bethpage station. The name &quot;Bethpage&quot; was, however, already in use by an adjacent community, which resisted suggestions of a merger and instead renamed itself Old Bethpage. The change from Central Park to Bethpage was one of the last complete name changes of Nassau County&#x27;s post offices.

From 1936 until 1994, Bethpage was home to the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, which made, among other things, the F-14 Tomcat, the Navy version of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) for Moon landings, and for this reason Bethpage is mentioned in the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Grumman was made famous by the performance of its F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft and its successor the F6F Hellcat, which shot down 5,223 enemy aircraft, more than any other naval aircraft. In 1994, Grumman was purchased by Northrop and formed Northrop Grumman. Although no longer headquartered in Bethpage, the company still retains operations there.

The Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Bethpage (NWIRP) started operations in 1942, west of the Grumman site.

In August 2015, a small airplane with engine trouble failed to reach Farmingdale airport, and was redirected to &quot;Bethpage Airport&quot; by the air traffic controller. However, the pilot could not find that airport because it was closed and had buildings on it, and the plane crashed on LIRR tracks.

===Swedetown Village===

In the early 1900s, Bethpage (then called Central Park) was home to a small village of early Scandinavian immigrants, whose area was north of Cherry Avenue, east of Stewart Avenue, and west of today&#x27;s Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway. A Scandinavian-American Club of North Central Park formed in 1924, called Central Park North Civic Association, whose social activities and project fundraising helped improve roads, street lighting, water service, and postal service. After officially disbanding in 1959, the clubhouse, located on Stewart Avenue, became Saint Isidoro’s Greek Orthodox Church.

In August 2021, Town of Oyster Bay Supervisor Joseph Saladino, with the help of Central Park Historical Society, helped unveil a historical marker celebrating the Scandinavian immigrants, located on the corner of Flamingo Lane and Caffrey Avenue.

===Superfund site===
Bethpage&#x27;s history as a space and aviation center has left heavy metals, toxic waste, and radioactive byproducts dumped into the surrounding ground and leeching into the water. Bethpage as of 2012 has been declared a class 2 Superfund site. The rate of cancers and birth defects in Bethpage is statistically well above the national average, which many attribute to the polluted soil and ground water. Bethpage residents have taken action by filing a $500 million lawsuit against Grumman.

<text>Brookville is a village located within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 2,939 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The geographic Village of Brookville was formed in two stages. When the village was incorporated in 1931, it consisted of a long, narrow tract of land that was centered along Cedar Swamp Road (NY 107). In the 1950s, the northern portion of the unincorporated area then known as Wheatley Hills was annexed and incorporated into the village, approximately doubling the village&#x27;s area to its present .

When the Town of Oyster Bay purchased what is now Brookville from the Matinecocks in the mid-17th century, the area was known as Suco&#x27;s Wigwam. Most pioneers were English, many of them Quakers. They were soon joined by Dutch settlers from western Long Island, who called the surrounding area Wolver Hollow, apparently because wolves gathered at spring-fed Shoo Brook to drink. For most of the 19th century, the village was called Tappentown after a prominent family. Brookville became the preferred name after the Civil War and was used on 1873 maps.

Brookville&#x27;s two centuries as a farm and woodland backwater changed quickly in the early 20th century as wealthy New Yorkers built lavish mansions in the area. By the mid-1920s, there were 22 estates, part of the emergence of Nassau&#x27;s North Shore Gold Coast. One was Broadhollow, the spread of attorney-banker-diplomat Winthrop W. Aldrich, which had a 40-room manor house. The second owner of Broadhollow was Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., who at one point was president of the Belmont and Pimlico racetracks. Marjorie Merriweather Post, daughter of cereal creator Charles William Post, and her husband Edward Francis Hutton, the famous financier, built a lavish 70-room mansion on called Hillwood.

In 1931, estate owners banded together to win village incorporation to head off what they saw as undesirable residential and commercial development in other parts of Nassau County. The first Mayor was W. Deering Howe. In 1947, the Post estate was sold to Long Island University for its C. W. Post campus. The campus is noted as the home of the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. Also in Brookville is the DeSeversky Conference Center of the New York Institute of Technology. The center was formerly Templeton, mansion of socialite and businessman Winston Guest. Templeton was later used as one of the settings for the Dudley Moore film &quot;Arthur&quot;.

The Chapelle de St. Martin de Sayssuel, also known as the St. Joan of Arc Chapel where Joan of Arc prayed prior to engaging the English, was moved from France to Brookville in the early 20th century. It was acquired by Gertrude Hill Gavin, daughter of James J. Hill, the American railroad magnate. The chapel was dismantled stone by stone and imported from France to her Brookville estate in 1926. The chapel is now located at Marquette University in Wisconsin.

The Brookville Reformed Church, one of the oldest existing church congregations in the country, calls Brookville its home. The Brookville Church was founded by 17th century Dutch settlers.

The James Preserve is a nature preserve in Old Brookville and is the only tract of land showing the natural appearance of the village before development. Although it is in Old Brookville, it is connected to Greenvale.

In 2009, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; dubbed Brookville the wealthiest town in America.

<text>Carle Place (also known historically as Frog Hollow and Mineola Park) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The CDP&#x27;s population was 5,005 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1946, developer William J. Levitt bought 19 acres of land near the Carle Place train station for an experiment. His crews brought pre-cut lumber to the site and rapidly assembled 600 low-cost houses, offering affordable suburban living with an easy commute into offices in New York City. Within five years, returning veterans and their families swelled the population by 500 percent. It transformed Carle Place, and served as the prototype for Levittown, the larger development which Levitt began the following year only a few miles away.

The hamlet is named for Silas Carle, or (more specifically) the Carle House – a 32-room house built by Carle in Westbury in the 1800s. It was commonly known as the &quot;Carle Place&quot;, and the surrounding area later took the name.

The area was also known as Mineola Park between &quot;circa&quot; 1895 and 1915, after an unsuccessful real estate development of the same name within the hamlet. The name was reverted to Carle Place in 1915, and there was only one further attempt to change it, which took place in 1951 after Levitt &amp; Sons purchased and developed much of the area consisting of the unsuccessful development. The proposal failed, as the majority of residents preferred keeping the name, and no attempts to change it have taken place since.

Another historic name for the area is Frog Hollow, which is still used colloquially and is the source of the Carle Place Union Free School District&#x27;s mascot.

==Geography==

The villages bordering Carle Place are Mineola, Garden City, and Westbury. Carle Place also borders the part of Uniondale formerly known as East Garden City, an unincorporated area of the Town of Hempstead.

Carle Place&#x27;s southern border runs along Old Country Road, while its eastern border runs along Carle Road.

<text>Cedarhurst is a village in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 7,374 as of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Cedarhurst is located in the region of Long Island&#x27;s South Shore known as the Five Towns.

==History==
The village was incorporated in 1910. It is part of the &quot;Five Towns,&quot; together with the village of Lawrence and the hamlets of Woodmere and Inwood, and &quot;The Hewletts,&quot; which consist of the villages of Hewlett Bay Park, Hewlett Harbor and Hewlett Neck and the hamlet of Hewlett, along with Woodsburgh.

Cedarhurst&#x27;s early name was Ocean Point. Rail service arrived in 1869 which led people to the area, especially to the Rockaway Hunting Club, built in Cedarhurst in 1878. A post office was established in 1884, and Ocean Point was renamed Cedarhurst, partly at the request of the Hunt Club. The name Cedarhurst is in reference to a grove of trees that once stood at the post office.

For many years, Central Avenue, the area&#x27;s main business district, was considered the Rodeo Drive of Long Island, offering upscale shops and boutiques to discriminating shoppers from around the area. With the growth of the local Orthodox Jewish community, many stores and restaurants now cater to the needs of this community. As observant Jews do not shop on the Jewish Sabbath, many of the street&#x27;s businesses are closed on Saturday, reducing the foot traffic for those stores that remain open on Saturdays.

On November 22, 2019, a fire broke out at the Cedarhurst Shoppes, which affected five businesses of various types and significantly damaged them.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2), all land.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.35% of the population.

There were 2,289 households, out of which 31.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.1% were married couples living together, 9.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.5% were non-families. 24.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

About 4.3% of families and 5.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.3% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.

Over the past 20 years significant numbers of Orthodox Jewish families have moved into Cedarhurst supporting synagogues and other Jewish organizations. Italian-Americans (15.3%), Russian Americans (10.5%), Polish-Americans (9.7%) and Irish-Americans (6.9%) also make up a large percentage of the Five Towns community.

<doc id="126688" wikidata="Q719602" url="?curid=126688" title="Prevalence">
<text>In epidemiology, prevalence is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seatbelt use) at a specific time. It is derived by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied and is usually expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. Prevalence is most often used in questionnaire studies.

==Difference between prevalence and incidence==
Prevalence is the number of disease cases &quot;present &quot;in a particular population at a given time, whereas incidence is the number of new cases that &quot;develop &quot;during a specified time period. Prevalence answers &quot;How many people have this disease right now?&quot; or &quot;How many people have had this disease during this time period?&quot;. Incidence answers &quot;How many people acquired the disease [during a specified time period]?&quot;. However, mathematically, prevalence is proportional to the product of the incidence and the average duration of the disease. In particular, when the prevalence is low (&lt;10%), the relationship can be expressed as:

:formula_1

Caution must be practiced as this relationship is only applicable when the following two conditions are met: 1) prevalence is low and 2) the duration is constant (or an average can be taken). A general formulation requires differential equations.

==Examples and utility==
In science, &quot;prevalence&quot; describes a proportion (typically expressed as a percentage). For example, the prevalence of obesity among American adults in 2001 was estimated by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at approximately 20.9%.

Prevalence is a term that means being widespread and it is distinct from incidence. Prevalence is a measurement of &quot;all&quot; individuals affected by the disease at a particular time, whereas incidence is a measurement of the number of &quot;new&quot; individuals who contract a disease during a particular period of time. Prevalence is a useful parameter when talking about long-lasting diseases, such as HIV, but incidence is more useful when talking about diseases of short duration, such as chickenpox. 

==Uses==

===Lifetime prevalence===
Lifetime prevalence (LTP) is the proportion of individuals in a population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment) have experienced a &quot;case&quot; (e.g., a disease, a traumatic event, or, a behavior, such as committing a crime). Often, a 12-month prevalence (or some other type of &quot;period prevalence&quot;) is provided in conjunction with lifetime prevalence. &quot;Point prevalence&quot; is the prevalence of disorder at a specific point in time (a month or less). &quot;Lifetime morbid risk&quot; is &quot;the proportion of a population that might become afflicted with a given disease at any point in their lifetime.&quot;

===Period prevalence===
Period prevalence is the proportion of the population with a given disease or condition over a specific period of time. It could describe how many people in a population had a cold over the cold season in 2006, for example. It is expressed as a percentage of the population and can be described by the following formula:

Period prevalence (proportion) = Number of cases that existed in a given period ÷ Number of people in the population during this period

The relationship between incidence (rate), point prevalence (ratio) and period prevalence (ratio) is easily explained via an analogy with photography. Point prevalence is akin to a flashlit photograph: what is happening at this instant frozen in time. Period prevalence is analogous to a long exposure (seconds, rather than an instant) photograph: the number of events recorded in the photo whilst the camera shutter was open. In a movie each frame records an instant (point prevalence); by looking from frame to frame one notices new events (incident events) and can relate the number of such events to a period (number of frames); see incidence rate.

===Point prevalence===
Point prevalence is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition at a particular time, such as a particular date. It is like a snapshot of the disease in time. It can be used for statistics on the occurrence of chronic diseases. This is in contrast to period prevalence which is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition over a specific period of time, say a season, or a year. Point prevalence can be described by the formula: Prevalence = Number of existing cases on a specific date ÷ Number of people in the population on this date 

==Limitations==
It can be said that a very small error applied over a very large number of individuals (that is, those who are &quot;not affected&quot; by the condition in the general population during their lifetime; for example, over 95%) produces a relevant, non-negligible number of subjects who are incorrectly classified as having the condition or any other condition which is the object of a survey study: these subjects are the so-called false positives; such reasoning applies to the &#x27;false positive&#x27; but not the &#x27;false negative&#x27; problem where we have an error applied over a relatively very small number of individuals to begin with (that is, those who are &quot;affected&quot; by the condition in the general population; for example, less than 5%). Hence, a very high percentage of subjects who seem to have a history of a disorder at interview are false positives for such a medical condition and apparently never developed a fully clinical syndrome.

A different but related problem in evaluating the public health significance of psychiatric conditions has been highlighted by Robert Spitzer of Columbia University: fulfillment of diagnostic criteria and the resulting diagnosis do not necessarily imply need for treatment.

A well-known statistical problem arises when ascertaining rates for disorders and conditions with a relatively low population prevalence or base rate. Even assuming that lay interview diagnoses are highly accurate in terms of sensitivity and specificity and their corresponding area under the ROC curve (that is, AUC, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), a condition with a relatively low prevalence or base-rate is bound to yield high false positive rates, which exceed false negative rates; in such a circumstance a limited positive predictive value, PPV, yields high false positive rates even in presence of a specificity which is very close to 100%.

<doc id="126689" wikidata="Q3477048" url="?curid=126689" title="East Garden City, New York">
<text>East Garden City (also known as the Nassau Hub) is a hamlet and former census-designated place (CDP) under Uniondale in the northeast part of the Town of Hempstead, in the central part of Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States, along the Hempstead/North Hempstead town line. The population was 6,208 at the 2010 census, when it was still listed as a CDP.

The hamlet is mostly a commercial and industrial area, and it also includes Nassau Community College – along with a portion of Hofstra University&#x27;s north campus.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of , all land.

Beginning on its northern border and proceeding clockwise, East Garden City was bordered on the north by Carle Place and the Village of Westbury in the Town of North Hempstead (the Hempstead/North Hempstead town line); on the east by East Meadow; on the south by Uniondale and the Village of Hempstead; and, on the west by the Villages of Hempstead and Garden City.

East Garden City was one of many areas on Long Island where none of the places in the community have the hamlet name as part of their mailing address: places in East Garden City have either a &quot;Garden City, NY 11530&quot;, a &quot;Westbury, NY 11590&quot;, a &quot;Uniondale, NY 11553&quot; or a &quot;Hempstead, NY 11550&quot; mailing address.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 6,208 people living in the then-CDP. There were 1,341 housing units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 67.3% Non-Hispanic White, 16.7% African American, 0.1% Native American, 4.4% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 9.0% Hispanic, and 3.0% from two or more races.

== Controversy &amp; absorption ==
In 2015, there were disputes between Uniondale and East Garden City about the latter&#x27;s existence.

According to the Long Island Press, &quot;They [civic leaders from Uniondale] argue that planners and developers concocted the name to distance prime real estate north of Hempstead Turnpike from the racially diverse neighborhood on the south side. Lawmakers back Uniondale’s cause, but wiping East Garden City off the map is easier said than done. At stake is what to call the heart of the area also known as the Nassau Hub—home to almost half the county’s economic activity and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.&quot;

Newsday later notes, &quot;In May [2015], the controversy led to a meeting involving then-Town Supervisor Kate Murray, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) and federal census officials, who, while agreeing to drop the name, indicated it might take 18 months to become official.&quot;

<doc id="126690" wikidata="Q3449095" url="?curid=126690" title="East Hills, New York">
<text>East Hills is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. The population was 7,284 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of East Hills is located primarily within the Town of North Hempstead, spare for a small section of its northeastern corner located within the Town of Oyster Bay.

== History ==

=== Before the village ===
In 1643, John Carman and Robert Fordham sailed across the Long Island Sound from Stamford, Connecticut and purchased the land that is now occupied by the Towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead from the Native Americans. This land included what is now East Hills.

For a long time, much of what now is East Hills was home to a few wealthy families. In 1898, Clarence and Katherine Mackay settled in present-day East Hills and would eventually commission Stanford White to design their mansion, Harbor Hill. In 1924, the Prince of Wales, who later abdicated the throne of England to marry Mrs. Simpson, was entertained at the Mackay estate. Aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh rested at the Mackay estate in 1927 after returning to the United States following his historic solo flight to Paris, France.

=== Village of East Hills (1931 – present) ===
The Village of East Hills was incorporated on June 24, 1931, and its first election was held a couple weeks later on July 8 in barns at the Mackay estate. Reasons for incorporating included the desire by many locals to be excluded from paying taxes for sanitary sewer systems, highways, etc., the desire to not be part of the Roslyn Sewer District and to keep businesses out, and to maintain local control through municipal home rule powers. Many of the proposals opposed by the locals were proposed when Roslyn first wanted to incorporate, as early plans called for that village&#x27;s proposed boundaries to include what would become East Hills. As such, the residents decided to incorporate East Hills as a separate village.

Mr. Willets was elected as Mayor and John Mackay, Stephen Willets, Ellen A. Hennessy, and Catherine Hechler were elected as the Village Trustees. Charles Hechler, the husband of Mrs. Hechler, was appointed as the Village Clerk.

The name of East Hills was chosen based on its geography and location. The &quot;East&quot; reflects the village&#x27;s geographic location adjacent to and east of Roslyn, and the &quot;Hills&quot; reflects the hilly geography of the village.

The post-war era ushered in a huge population boom and suburbanization throughout the United States, which led to the construction of many new developments in the Village of East Hills. One of these developments, Strathmore, was developed by Levitt &amp; Sons in the late 1940s. Another large-scale development built during this time, the Country Estates subdivision, was developed by Country Estates, Incorporated over Clarence Mackay&#x27;s former estate. Prior to building the Country Estates in East Hills, the firm developed the Flower Hill Country Estates development in nearby Flower Hill. A third notable development, Norgate, was developed by Gustav A. Mezger and the Homeguard Realty Corporation.

Additionally, in order for the Roslyn Union Free School District to adequately serve the influx of families, the Moore &amp; Hutchins-designed East Hills Elementary School was opened between the Canterbury Woods and Fairfield Park developments in 1953.

On Labor Day 2006, the Park at East Hills opened on the land previously occupied by the Roslyn Air National Guard Station. It has a pool, nature walks, senior facilities, and tennis, pickleball, and basketball courts. The construction of the park was financed through the sale of bonds; carrying and operating costs are paid through taxes.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The village gained territory from the adjacent Incorporated Village of Brookville between the 1960 census and the 1970 census; this small area is the portion of the village within the Town of Oyster Bay.

The portions of the village on Harbor Hill, the former site of Clarence Mackay&#x27;s eponymous estate, are among the highest areas in Nassau County and on Long Island, as a whole.

Additionally, the Harbor Hill Moraine is named for this hill, due to it being one of the terminal moraine&#x27;s most prominent and well-known topographic and geographical features.

==Demographics==
=== 2010 census ===
As of the census of 2010, there were 6,955 people residing in the village. The racial makeup of the village was 89.85% White, 0.95% African American, 7.40% Asian, 0.49% from other races, and 1.31% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.24% of the population.

<text>East Meadow is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 36,856 at the time of the 2024 census.

Many residents commute to Manhattan, which is away.

==History==
In 1655, two surveyors for Hempstead reported that the &quot;east meadow&quot; would be suitable for grazing. The area quickly became a grazing area for cattle and later, in the 18th century, for sheep. The sheep of the East Meadow area provided the country with more than 50% of the United States&#x27; wool needs during that time.

During the American Revolutionary War, East Meadow was occupied by British forces when they discovered the vast amounts of livestock herded there, and remained under their control until the end of the war. Two large farms existed in what is now East Meadow: the Barnum farm (Barnum Woods), and the Carman farm. It is rumored that President George Washington spent a night on the Barnum estate during a trip across Long Island in 1790. A toll booth was operated near the Carman homestead on the Hempstead Turnpike.

Another early settlement was located near what is now the intersection of East Meadow Avenue (formerly called Newbridge Avenue; not to be confused with nearby Newbridge Road) and Prospect Avenue.

The community was home to many Gilded Era estates. The old Hoeffner homestead is now the site of Veterans Memorial park, and East Meadow&#x27;s Post Office. The Barnum estate was rented by the Hoeffner family in 1914. Part of the old Barnum farm is now the site of Barnum Woods Elementary School, and the main road that passes by the school, Merrick Avenue, was originally called Barnum Avenue. The Oliver and Alva Belmont (formerly Alva Vanderbilt) estate of Brookholt once stretched across several hundred acres on both sides of Front Street to the west of Merrick Avenue, and for a short while, included the Brookholt School of Agriculture for Women.

Carman Avenue is home to East Meadow High School, the Nassau County Correctional Facility, and the Nassau University Medical Center – the tallest inhabitable building in Nassau County.

East Meadow&#x27;s name is derived from being the meadow of Hempstead Plains east of the Meadow Brook (originally a brook, now replaced by a parkway of the same name).

East Meadow was chosen to host eight cricket matches of the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup in June 2024.

East Meadow is generally flat, and according to the United States Geological Survey and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the elevation ranges from near its southwestern edge, to along Hempstead Turnpike to the north.

Almost no actual meadow remains in East Meadow or the Hempstead Plains, due to the post-WWII development boom and later, unchecked suburban sprawl.

<text>East Rockaway is a village in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 9,818 at the 2010 census.

The Incorporated Village of East Rockaway is at the edge of Rockaway Peninsula Proper in the town of Hempstead, adjacent to Hewlett Harbor, Hewlett, Rockville Centre, Lynbrook, and Oceanside.

The Waverly Park neighborhood, near the Hewlett-East Rockaway Jewish Center and along the border with Hewlett, has a sizable Jewish community.

==History==
Originally named Near Rockaway, the village began as a shipping and trading center for the South Shore of Long Island. The village&#x27;s location was desirable for ships because of its deep channels inland. Eventually a grist mill was built on the Mill River by Joseph Haviland through a land grant in 1688. The Haviland-Davison Grist Mill, located in Memorial Park, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Later, an oven was purchased to make bread for the surrounding population. The village prospered in shipping and milling over the years, even after several sales of the land.

The village&#x27;s name was changed in 1869 to East Rockaway.

The village was incorporated in 1900, and Floyd Johnson was president.

<text>East Williston is an incorporated village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 2,645 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Most of the farmland was owned by the Willis family in the 1800s. To avoid being confused with the Willis areas of upstate New York, this area was known as East Williston. The original borders of the area known as East Williston stretched west towards Queens to Herricks Road, north to I.U. Willets Road, south to the Village of Mineola, and east to Bacon Road in Old Westbury.

The coming of the railroad in 1865 stimulated manufacturing in East Williston. The industries that grew as a result of the new train station included brick making, windmill making and carriage making. Henry M. Willis designed and built the popular East Williston Runabout Roadcart. This carriage had two wheels and two seats. Its soft suspension allowed comfortable travel over the rough roads of the time. There was also a feature which allowed the body to be locked to the axle, allowing the carriage to be used on the racetrack. Over 1,000 East Williston Runabout Roadcarts were built by Oakley and Griffin (who purchased the business from Willis in 1889).

The major east-west route, Hillside Avenue (NY 25B), was formerly called East Williston Avenue, since it connected Queens with East Williston.The East Williston Union Free School District was founded in 1955. In 1985, the residential and commercial core of East Williston collectively known as the East Williston Village Historic District was designated a national historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Although originally called Williston, the name of the area was changed to East Williston in 1879, when locals requested the United States Postal Service to open a local post office. Since there was already a community with a post office in Upstate New York using the name, locals added the word &quot;East&quot; to their community&#x27;s name; the name East Williston was in use for both this village and what is now the adjacent village of Williston Park.

In 1926, this eastern half of East Williston incorporated as a village. Its western half, Williston Park, incorporated separately that same year; the two halves became separate villages due to each having very different characteristics.

<text>Elmont is an unincorporated hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in northwestern Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, United States, along its border with the borough of Queens in New York City. The population was 35,265 as of the 2020 census.

The hamlet is famous for Belmont Park which hosts the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the prestigious Triple Crown of thoroughbred racing. Elmont is also home to UBS Arena, home of the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders.

Elmont has tried incorporating itself as a village multiple times, but has been unable to successfully do so.

==History==
In 1650, Christopher and Thomas Foster purchased a large plot of land. The Fosters&#x27; land was controlled by Dutch settlers. The Fosters intended to raise cattle and sheep on their newly settled land, the Hempstead Plains of Long Island. They named this place &quot;Foster&#x27;s Meadow&quot;—a name which would remain for the next 200 years of the village&#x27;s history.

By the mid-17th century, descendants of Sephardic Jews were settling on the Hempstead Plains for agriculture. Control of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam shifted to England in 1664. This marked the first gradual cultural shift in Foster&#x27;s Meadow with the establishment of a community of predominantly English Protestant farmers, and their families. In 1683, Long Island was divided into three counties, Kings, Queens, and Suffolk County. Under this new structure, Foster&#x27;s Meadow was originally part of Queens County. During 1790 George Washington passed through the town while touring to the east on Long Island. The current boundaries of Elmont were decided upon in 1898; at this point, Nassau County was created, leading to conflict over land, and monies owed as a result of Elmont&#x27;s boundary shift from Queens.

It was during the mid-19th century that Foster&#x27;s Meadow experienced its second cultural shift. There was an influx of Roman Catholic and Ashkenazi Jewish farmers from Brooklyn and Middle Village to the west. These ethnic groups were largely of German and Italian descent, practicing both Roman Catholicism and Judaism.

Indeed, the Catholic population in Foster&#x27;s Meadow grew to an extent. The Church of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ was built in 1852, during the Wittelsbach Dynasty. The Roman Catholic Church was re-dedicated as Saint Boniface Roman Catholic Parish, in honor of the Patron Saint of Germany, in 1857. The Parish provided a focal point for the gradual development of a Catholic population base. Rev. Peter Hartraub was the founding pastor, and was appointed the first resident pastor of Foster&#x27;s Meadow in 1858. Rev. Peter Hartraub built a new rectory and, in 1887, a new school with four classrooms on the first floor and an auditorium on the second. The Dominican Sisters were invited to teach in the Catholic School, and they built a convent on parish land donated to them.

The community underwent its next political reshuffling in 1882, being subdivided into districts with unique names and boundaries (including Alden Manor and Locustwood); it was at this time that Foster&#x27;s Meadow was renamed Elmont. In 1902, a syndicate headed by August Belmont Jr. and former Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney sought land on Long Island to build the most elaborate racetrack in America, one modeled after the great race courses of Europe. They found what they were looking for on the border of Queens County and Nassau County. Belmont Racetrack, was arguably the most significant milestone in the development of modern-day Elmont. Originally known as Foster&#x27;s Meadow, the 650 acres of land included Oaklands, a turreted Tudor-Gothic mansion owned by William de Forest Manice, which was to serve as the track&#x27;s Turf and Field Club until 1956.

With the opening of Belmont Park in 1905, Elmont reached a turning point in its history. The farms were sold, and subdivided for houses. Most of the new homes were owned by people, who worked at Belmont Racetrack. Many businesses were formed on Hempstead Turnpike, to support the blooming suburban location. By 1915, the Racetrack was opened to the public, attracting both visitors and migrant workers to the area. Housing developments, and businesses grew in the area surrounding the racetrack to meet the needs of these workers; this process of development to meet the workers&#x27; needs continued in successive waves, ultimately representing a shift in Elmont from rural farmland to suburbia.

In 1910, Belmont Racetrack hosted the first air race ever in the United States of America. Wilbur and Orville Wright staged an international aerial competition at Belmont Park that drew 150 000 spectators. The race ran from Belmont Park to the Statue of Liberty, and back to Belmont Park.

In 1918, the United States Postal Service delivered their first inter-city Air Mail Service between New York City and Washington, D.C. Belmont Park was designated as the delivery terminal for New York.

Belmont Park was the site of &quot;War Relief Day&quot; in 1940 to benefit the American Red Cross and in 1943 hosted &quot;Back the Attack&quot; Day, wherein fans had to buy a war bond to gain admission to the track. Total receipts that day were between $25 million and $30 million.

After the Second World War, Elmont hosted widespread development of attractive suburban tract homes. Many of these homes were constructed with a brick-veneer ground story in variations of the Cape Cod style, particularly around Dutch Broadway. On Hempstead Turnpike, older smaller shingled homes cluster near Belmont Park.

In 2017, New York State&#x27;s Development Corporation (Empire State Development) issued a Request for Proposals for a part of the Belmont Park Property to redevelop land on the property that would enhance the Park and surrounding communities. The two bidders for the site were New York City FC and the New York Islanders. On December 19, 2017, various news reports surfaced, indicating that the state of New York had selected the Islanders&#x27; bid. On December 20, 2017, a news conference was held confirming those reports and a deal had been secured. Speakers included NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. The result was construction of UBS Arena to become the new home arena for the Islanders. The arena opened in fall 2021.

=== Failed incorporation attempts ===
Elmont has made many attempts over the years to incorporate itself as a village. It first attempted incorporating in 1931 but was unable to do so. The same thing happened again in 1940 and again in 1949. By then, the Nassau County charter had changed (it was amended in 1938) so as to mandate that any new village incorporated after 1938 adhere to Nassau County&#x27;s zoning laws.

<text>Farmingdale is an incorporated village on Long Island within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population was 8,466 at the time of the 2020 Census.

The Lenox Hills neighborhood is adjacent to Bethpage State Park and the rest of the town is within a fifteen-minute drive of the park. It is also approximately 37 mi (59 km) southeast of Midtown Manhattan and can be reached via the Ronkonkoma Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The Long Island Expressway and Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway are the best way to reach Farmingdale from the city and the mainland.

== History ==

The first European settler in the area was Thomas Powell, who arrived in 1687. On October 18, 1695, he purchased a tract of land from three Native American tribes. This is known as the Bethpage Purchase and includes what is now Farmingdale – in addition to Bethpage, Melville, North Massapequa, Old Bethpage, Plainedge, and Plainview. One of two houses he erected in the area (built c. 1738) still stands on Merritts Road in Farmingdale.

In the 1830s, anticipating construction of the Long Island Rail Road, land developer Ambrose George purchased a large tract of land between a community then known as &quot;Bethpage,&quot; now &quot;Old Bethpage,&quot; and an area in Suffolk County known as &quot;Hardscrabble&quot;.
He built a general store in the western part of this property which he named &quot;Farmingdale&quot;. When the LIRR started service to the area in October 1841,
it used the name &quot;Farmingdale&quot; for its latest stop, here, on the line it was building to Greenport. Stagecoaches took people from the Farmingdale station to Islip, Babylon, Patchogue, Oyster Bay South, and West Neck (Huntington area).
In 1886 a fire department was organized, and in 1904, Farmingdale incorporated as a village.

The Lenox Hills Country Club, an 18-hole private golf course designed by Devereux Emmet, was developed north of the community in 1923 and was owned and operated by Benjamin F. Yoakum. This golf course was purchased by the State of New York, was greatly expanded, and then re-opened as Bethpage State Park in 1932, with much of the golf design work carried out by golf architect A.W. Tillinghast, later inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The original 1920s era Lenox Hills subdivision and later adjacent subdivisions, located between the Bethpage State Park golf courses and the Long Island Railroad trackage, encompassing rolling hills and a wide boulevard, are known as the more upscale part of Farmingdale Village. Later, Farmingdale became a locus for the aircraft industry, notably Republic Aviation Company.
In 1899, Mile-a-Minute Murphy rode a bicycle along the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Central Branch through the Farmingdale area at a mile a minute. For many years, the town celebrated its birth with the annual Hardscrabble Fair, with music, food and games. It was normally held in May.

=== Usage of name ===
Farmingdale is also associated with several unincorporated areas outside the village limits, including South Farmingdale (also in the Town of Oyster Bay), and East Farmingdale (in the Town of Babylon, within Suffolk County). Many nearby places not within the village limits have &quot;Farmingdale&quot; as their postal address and the same 11735 ZIP code. Residents of East Farmingdale must use &quot;Farmingdale&quot; as their mailing address, while residents of South Farmingdale can use either &quot;Farmingdale&quot; or &quot;South Farmingdale&quot;. Bethpage State Park, which is mostly in Old Bethpage, also has a &quot;Farmingdale&quot; mailing address. Farmingdale Union Free School District (UFSD 22) includes parts of both Nassau County and Suffolk County and the southernmost part of Bethpage State Park, where the clubhouse is located. A road sign on Main Street in the south-east section of South Farmingdale (and over from the Village of Farmingdale) welcomes travelers to Farmingdale. Farmingdale is also the name of the local Farmingdale Water District and Farmingdale Fire District, both of which also include areas outside the boundaries of the Village of Farmingdale. Farmingdale State College and Republic Airport are in East Farmingdale, both with Farmingdale mailing addresses.

<text>Floral Park is an incorporated village in Nassau County, Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 16,172 at the 2020 census.

Floral Park is at the western border of Nassau County, mainly in the Town of Hempstead, while the section north of Jericho Turnpike (NY 25) is within the Town of North Hempstead. The area was formerly known as East Hinsdale.

The neighborhood of Floral Park in the New York City borough of Queens is adjacent to but not part of the village.

==History==
The area that is now Floral Park once marked the western edge of the great Hempstead Plains, and by some reports was initially known as Plainfield. Farms and tiny villages dominated the area through the 1870s when the development of the Long Island Rail Road Hempstead Branch and Jericho Turnpike cut through the area. Hinsdale had more than two dozen flower farms after the Civil War. The present-day village of Floral Park was once called East Hinsdale.

In 1874, John Lewis Childs arrived in the area to work for C.L. Allen as a seed seller. After building his own seed and bulb business and starting America&#x27;s first seed catalog business, Childs bought a great deal of land in the area. To promote his own business and the local horticultural industry, Childs named the local streets after flowers and renamed the area Floral Park. The expansion of the Floral Park Post Office and nearby village businesses are attributed solely to the success of Childs&#x27; business.

When the local Post Office took the name Floral Park, the Long Island Rail Road followed suit by changing the name of the East Hinsdale station to Floral Park in 1888. Formerly part of Queens, Floral Park became part of the new county of Nassau in 1899, and it was incorporated as a village in 1908. Childs served as its first president starting that year.

In 1903, the village boasted more than of Childs&#x27; flower beds. The massive volume of his mail order business grew the local post office to such an extent that it drew comparisons with the post offices of Chicago, Baltimore, and Boston.

<text>Flower Hill is a village in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The eastern half is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. Western and northern parts are more closely associated with Manhasset and Port Washington. The population was 4,794 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Incorporated Village of Flower Hill is located entirely within the Town of North Hempstead, and has been recognized as a Tree City USA since 2013.

==History==

=== Before the village (pre-colonization – 1930) ===
The location of Flower Hill was originally inhabited by Matinecock Native Americans. In the 17th century, Dutch and English colonists began to settle the area.

This era saw members of prominent colonial families settled in the area, including members of the Hewlett family (the family after whom Hewlett, New York, and Hewlett Lane in Flower Hill are named). Members of the family settled in the area during this time, and constructed the former Hewlett Homestead circa 1713.

During this time, the area consisted of many farms, and was in an ideal location for them, as the goods produced in the area would be brought down to either Manhasset Bay in Manhasset or Port Washington, or to Hempstead Harbor in Roslyn for shipment to destinations in New York City and beyond.

At this time, the heart of Flower Hill was located where modern-day Port Washington Boulevard, Bonnie Heights Road, and Country Club Drive intersect. This area included a blacksmith, general store, tavern, a village well, and a cemetery, in addition to a small number of homes.

&quot;Circa&quot; 1900, Carlos Munson – the heir to the Munson Steamship Company – and his wife, Mabel, settled in Flower Hill. Carlos and Mabel Munson were unhappy to be living near so many intoxicated locals found in this area, which prompted Mabel asking Carlos to do something to get rid of them. Carlos responded by purchasing the land, despite having no need for it. To further eliminate this issue, the Munsons gave some of this land to the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary.

In the early decades of the 20th century, the New York &amp; North Shore Traction Company operated a trolley line connecting Mineola, Roslyn, and Port Washington – as well as one connecting Flushing and Roslyn – through the village, utilizing Northern Boulevard, Middle Neck Road, and Port Washington Boulevard.

The two lines intersected at a junction located at the intersection of Middle Neck Road and Northern Boulevard. This was also the site of the company&#x27;s former Roslyn trolley yard and a substation; it was located at the northwestern corner of the intersection.

Additionally, a trolley siding existed in Flower Hill on the east side of Port Washington Boulevard, near its intersection with modern-day Farmview Road.

=== Push for incorporation (1930 – 1931) ===
The push for Flower Hill&#x27;s incorporation first started in 1930, when word was spread that Port Washington was planning to incorporate itself as a city. Upon hearing these rumors, residents of Flower Hill feared that the Flower Hill area would be placed within the boundaries of the proposed City of Greater Port Washington if those plans were ultimately to be approved. As a result, the residents of Flower Hill saw a need to incorporate the locality as a village, in order to prevent the area from becoming part of the rumored city.

After two unsuccessful attempts to hold a hearing on Flower Hill&#x27;s incorporation as a village, residents tried for a third time in April 1931, and were successful. With the approval of the application for a hearing, a vote to decide whether or not Flower Hill should incorporate itself was set for April 27 of that year; the vote would be held in Carlos Munson&#x27;s real estate office.

During the vote on April 27, the residents of Flower Hill voted unanimously in favor of incorporating Flower Hill as a village, and the Incorporated Village of Flower Hill was ultimately born.

=== Village of Flower Hill (1931 – present) ===
In May 1931, a few weeks after the birth of the village, its certificate of incorporation was signed. Carlos Munson was originally selected to serve as its first Mayor but turned down the position, which was subsequently given to Arthur G. Elvin. When founded, the population of Flower Hill was 288. The first village meeting took place in Carlos Munson&#x27;s real estate office; Village Hall now occupies this parcel of land.

In the mid-1930s, the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary would establish St. Francis Hospital as a cardiac sanatorium for children, on the land given to them by Carlos Munson. The first children arrived at this facility on February 8, 1937.

Flower Hill started to see new housing developments be built in the coming years. One of the notable developments built during this time is a large part of the Flower Hill Estates subdivision, which was built by Walter Uhl. Uhl began to build many of these first homes in the vicinity of Country Club Drive, located in the Port Washington section of the village, and adjacent to the North Hempstead Country Club. Uhl built many of these homes in the colonial style, to ensure that they would fit in with existing buildings and surroundings. Some of these homes were also built with reused wood from barns in their ceilings. During the subdivision&#x27;s construction process in 1939, an old Spanish &quot;piece-of-eight&quot; was unearthed by a construction worker. The coin, dating back to 1793, was presented by Uhl to the Port Washington Library.

In the years and decades following the Second World War, Flower Hill continued to be suburbanized, and many new developments were built as a result. Many of these new developments were built over former estates (such as the Chanticlare at Flower Hill subdivision, which was built over the former estate of Jesse Ricks), farms (such as the Hewlett Farm subdivision, which was built over portions of the former Hewlett Homestead), and even former sand mines (such as certain parts of the Wildwood at Flower Hill development, built on land once owned by the Colonial Sand &amp; Stone Company). A notable housing development built during this time is Flower Hill Country Estates, which was developed by Country Estates, Incorporated. The firm also built the Country Estates subdivision of nearby East Hills around the same time, over Clarence Mackay&#x27;s former estate.

In 1946, Marjorie Church Logan (wife of William John Logan) was murdered in her home on Bonnie Heights Road – and her daughter, Marjory Jeanne, was shot and raped. The suspect, Ward Beecher Caraway, was a butler and chauffeur at another estate in Flower Hill, and was ultimately sentenced to death for the crimes.

In 1948, Flower Hill Village Hall was constructed. It was designed by Roslyn-based architect Henry W. Johanson, and is located where Carlos Munson&#x27;s real estate office had previously stood; it opened in 1949.

The construction of so many new housing developments and homes in the village – and the subsequent influx of children – prompted the Roslyn Union Free School District to construct the Roslyn–Flower Hill Elementary School, to better serve the needs of the section of area of Flower Hill zoned for Roslyn&#x27;s schools, as well as to resolve overcrowding at the district&#x27;s other schools; this was one of several schools constructed in the district during this era. Built and opened in the early 1950s and sandwiched between the Wildwood and Broadridge developments, the Roslyn–Flower Hill Elementary School served the community until September 1980, when it was closed due to the declining enrollment numbers following the end of the baby-boom era. The former school&#x27;s property was later subdivided to become the Mashady Estates subdivision in the 1980s, and now consists of multiple single-family homes; it was developed by the N &amp; H Development Corporation.
Between 2012 and 2016, Elaine Phillips served as the mayor of Flower Hill. She served in this capacity until being elected to the New York State Senate in November 2016. The Phillips Administration oversaw the rehabilitation and modernization of the village-owned Flower Hill Park, which included the installation of a state-of-the-art playground for children.

On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy made landfall, and caused widespread damage throughout the New York metropolitan area. The entirety of the Village of Flower Hill lost power as a result of this storm. Due to communication errors from the Long Island Power Authority, some residents were without power for two unusually cold weeks. Village officials kept Village Hall open despite the fact that telephone lines and the heating system were initially down. Village officials also as regularly reached out to LIPA and local residents, and assisted in removing downed trees. Some officials even checked in on every senior living alone in the village, also offering them free transportation to and from shelters and ensuring that they were stocked with food. When the generators for Village Hall started to run, village officials started offering residents with heat, power, and even coffee at the building. There were no storm-related fatalities in Flower Hill, and only one home was lost within the village, when its generator caught fire.

In response to all of the trees lost in Flower Hill due to Hurricane Sandy, the village created a tree planting program, through which residents can receive a free tree for their property, given that the tree is planted in the village&#x27;s right-of-way. This program helped the village become recognized as a Tree City USA.

Robert McNamara became Mayor in 2016, succeeding Senator Phillips. A notable accomplishment of the McNamara Administration was the initiation of the process of village&#x27;s takeover of Middle Neck Road (former CR D55) – which connects Northern and Port Washington Boulevards – from Nassau County, which had been a goal of the village&#x27;s for several years, given the poor upkeep from the Nassau County Department of Public Works. In the deal, the Nassau County would repair the road and repave the road, and would then sell it to the Village of Flower Hill for $1. In the past, the Village of Flower Hill also purchased the Flower Hill Park and the Flower Hill section of Stonytown Road from Nassau County.

McNamara&#x27;s administration also implemented a construction impact fee for large construction projects.

Mayor McNamara, who long-suffered from health complications, died on April 15, 2020. Deputy Mayor Brian Herrington assumed the duties of Mayor, in light of McNamara&#x27;s passing.

On August 4, 2020, Hurricane Isaias struck the New York metropolitan area as a strong tropical storm, causing widespread power outages and damage across the region. Many trees in Flower Hill were uprooted, and much of the village lost power. Due to communication errors from PSEG Long Island, many delays took place in restoring power to the entirety of the village, resulting in some residents being without power for more than a week. Village officials designated Village Hall as a cooling center and phone charging center for residents that were without power, following COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.The 2020 mayoral election was supposed to take place on March 18, 2020 – but was postponed first until April 28 and then again until September, due to an order signed by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo as a result of COVID-19. The election ultimately took place on Tuesday, September 15, 2020. The election, which was highly contested, saw then-Trustee Kate Hirsch challenging incumbent Mayor Brian Herrington. Herrington was ultimately re-elected by Flower Hill voters to serve a full term, defeating Hirsch; Herrington received 596 votes, and Hirsch received 233.

On February 23, 2021, the Arbor Day Foundation designated Flower Hill as a Tree City USA for the seventh consecutive year.

In early 2022, ownership of Middle Neck Road was officially transferred to the Village from Nassau County.

In 2023, the Village of Flower Hill created a gallery at Village Hall, known as the Flower Hill Village Historical Gallery. The gallery covers the history of Flower Hill and the surrounding areas.

<text>Franklin Square is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 30,903 at the time of the 2020 census.

The area was originally known as Trimming Square and then as Washington Square after President George Washington.

== History ==
What is now Franklin Square was near the center of the Hempstead Plains, and used as grazing land, and later farmland, by the first white settlers. The southern portion included oak and dogwood forests.

In late 1643, Robert Fordham and John Carman made a treaty with members of the Massapequak, Mericoke, Matinecock and Rockaway tribes to buy roughly 100 square miles upon which they intended to start a new settlement. They purchased this tract, including much of what are now the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead.

In 1790, George Washington passed through the town while touring Long Island. He wrote in his diary that the area was &quot;entirely treeless except for a few scraggly fruit trees.&quot; Walt Whitman spent three months in the spring of 1840 as the schoolmaster of the Trimming Square school district, in the area where Franklin Square, Garden City South and West Hempstead intersect.

In 1852, one Louis Schroeher built a hotel near a tollgate (by what is now Arden Boulevard) of the Hempstead-Jamaica Turnpike (toll road). The hotel attracted an increasing number of visitors and immigrants (the latter often German) from New York City to the formerly rural hamlet.

Population grew steadily until the sudden intensified surge of suburbanization into post-World War II Long Island reached the community. By 1952, the farms were all gone, replaced by newly-built houses full of emigrants from nearby New York City.

===Etymology===
It is rumored that the original name for the area, Trimming Square, reflected the fact that farms once dominated the area&#x27;s landscape (as was common for areas all across the Hempstead Plains), and because many sheep were brought to the area by local farmers for separation during the latter parts of the 18th Century. The Trimming Square name was used between the early 19th Century and 1851, when the name was changed to Washington Square after George Washington.

The name of the community was again changed in the 1870s when locals made strides to establish a local U.S. post office. The United States Postal Service would not use the name Washington Square, as they felt that there were too many other places within New York which had Washington in their names. This led to locals again changing the name, and they ultimately chose the name Franklin Square. It is rumored that the name is in honor of Benjamin Franklin.
=== Failed incorporation attempt ===
In February 1929, locals tried incorporating their community as the Incorporated Village of Franklin Square. However, the plans were scrapped that April when the Town of Hempstead denied the petition, due to the fact that too few residents were in favor of incorporation.

==Arts and culture==
=== Landmarks ===
Franklin Square was the home of the Franklin National Bank, once the nation&#x27;s 20th largest bank. Under the leadership of Arthur T. Roth, the Franklin National Bank introduced many banking innovations, such as the bank credit card, the drive up teller window (1950), junior savings accounts (1947), and a no-smoking policy on banking floors (1958). Today, the building is a Chase bank.

On October 8, 1974, the Franklin National Bank was declared insolvent due to mismanagement and fraud, involving losses in foreign currency speculation and poor loan policies. This caused massive losses for its stockholders, resulted in jail and disgrace for its management; Italian financier and CEO Michele Sindona was poisoned in his cell in 1986, while serving a life-sentence for his part in this affair. It was at the time the largest bank failure in the history of the country, and forced US banking policymakers to reexamine and reassess regulation of international banking.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

=== Community organizations ===
There is an active Chamber of Commerce and a historical society. The Community League of Garden City South, Inc. Is the first New York State Incorporated Civic of Long Island, established in 1929.

It is their honor to act on behalf of the people to maintain and preserve the quality of life within the district.

<text>Freeport is a village in the town of Hempstead, in Nassau County, on the South Shore of Long Island, in New York state, United States. The population was 43,713 at the 2010 census, making it the second largest village in New York by population.

A settlement since the 1640s, it was once an oystering community and later a resort popular with the New York City theater community. It is now primarily a bedroom suburb but retains a modest commercial waterfront and some light industry.

== History ==

===Pre-colonial settlement===
Before people of European ancestry came to the area, the land was part of the territory of the Meroke Indians. Written records of the community go back to the 1640s. The village now known as Freeport was part of an area called &quot;the Great South Woods&quot; during colonial times. In the mid-17th century, the area was renamed Raynor South, and ultimately Raynortown, after a herdsman named Edward Raynor, who had moved to the area from Hempstead in 1659, cleared land, and built a cabin.

===19th century: development===
In 1853, residents voted to rename the village Freeport, adopting a variant of a nickname used by ship captains during colonial times because they were not charged customs duties to land their cargo.

After the Civil War, Freeport became a center for commercial oystering. This trade began to decline as early as the beginning of the 20th century because of changing salinity and increased pollution in Great South Bay. Nonetheless, even as of the early 21st century Freeport and nearby Point Lookout have the largest concentration of commercial fishing activity anywhere near New York City.

From 1868, Freeport was served by the Southside Railroad, which was a major boon to development. The most prominent figure in this boom was developer John J. Randall; among his other contributions to the shape of Freeport today were several canals, including the Woodcleft Canal, one side of which is now the site of the &quot;Nautical Mile&quot;. Randall, who opposed all of Freeport&#x27;s being laid out in a grid, put up a Victorian house virtually overnight on a triangular plot at the corner of Lena Avenue and Wilson Place to spite the grid designers. The Freeport Spite House still is standing and occupied.

In January 1873, before Nassau County had split off from Queens, the Queens County treasurer set up an office at Freeport. The village residents voted to incorporate the village on October 18, 1892. At that time, it had a population of 1,821. In 1898, Freeport established a municipal electric utility, which still operates today, giving the village lower electricity rates than those in surrounding communities. It is one of two municipally owned electric systems in Nassau County; the other is in Rockville Centre. Public street lighting was begun in 1907, and a public fire alarm system was adopted in 1910.

===1900–1939: expansion===

In the years after incorporation, Freeport was a tourist and sportsman&#x27;s destination for its boating and fishing.

From 1902 into the late 1920s, the New York and Long Island Traction Corporation ran trolleys through Freeport to Jamaica, Hempstead, and Brooklyn. These trolleys went down Main Street in Freeport, connecting to a ferry at Scott&#x27;s Hotel near Ray Street. In later years these ferries departed from Ellison&#x27;s dock on Little Swift Creek, served by separate trolleys operated by the Great South Bay Ferry Company. The ferries took people to Point Lookout, about three miles (5 km) south of Freeport, where there is an ocean beach. For a few years after 1913, the short-lived Freeport Railroad Company ran a trolley nicknamed &quot;the Fishermen&#x27;s Delight&quot; along Grove Street (now Guy Lombardo Avenue) from Sunrise Highway to the waterfront. Also in this era, in 1910 Arthur and Albert Heinrich flew the first American-made, American-powered monoplane, built in their Merrick Road airplane factory (see also &quot;Heinrich Pursuit&quot;). WGBB, founded in 1924, became Long Island&#x27;s first 24-hour radio station.
In the late 19th century, Freeport was the summer resort of wealthy politicians, publishers, and so forth. At the time, travel from Freeport to New York City required a journey of several hours on a coal-powered train, or an even more arduous automobile trip on the single-lane Merrick Road.

According to Elinor Smith, the arrival of Diamond Jim Brady and Lillian Russell around the start of the 20th century marked the beginning of what by 1914 would become an unofficial theatrical artists&#x27; colony, especially of vaudeville performers. Freeport&#x27;s population was largest in the summer season, during which most of the theaters of the time were closed and performers left for cooler climes. Some had year-round family homes in Freeport. Leo Carrillo and Victor Moore were early arrivals, later joined by Fannie Brice, Trixie Friganza, Sophie Tucker, Harry Ruby, Fred Stone, Helen Broderick, Moran and Mack, Will Rogers, Bert Kalmar, Richard Whiting, Harry von Tilzer, Rae Samuels, Belle Baker, Grace Hayes, Pat Rooney, Duffy and Sweeney, the Four Mortons, McKay and Ardine, and Eva Tanguay. Buster Keaton, W. C. Fields, and many other theatrical performers who did not own homes there were also frequent visitors.
Several of Freeport&#x27;s actors gathered together as the Long Island Good Hearted Thespian Society (LIGHTS), with a clubhouse facing onto Great South Bay. LIGHTS presented summer shows in Freeport from the mid-1910s to the mid-1920s. LIGHTS also sponsored a summertime &quot;Christmas Parade&quot;, featuring clowns, acrobats, and once even some borrowed elephants. It was held at this unlikely time of year because the theater people were all working during the real Christmas season. A Coney Island–style amusement park called Playland Park thrived from the early 1920s until the early 1930s but was destroyed by a fire on June 28, 1931.

With the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan on Long Island in the 1920s many villages in Nassau and Suffolk counties were the focal point of Klan activity. According to a story in &quot;Newsday&quot; detailing the history of Long Island,often, respected clergymen and public officials openly supported the Klan and attended its rallies. On Sept. 20, 1924, for instance, the Klan drew 30,000 spectators to a parade through Freeport – with the village police chief, John M. Hartman, leading a procession of 2,000 robed men... the founding of one of Long Island&#x27;s first klaverns, in Freeport, was memorialized on Sept. 8, 1922, in the Daily Review, which carried a banner headline about the meeting at Mechanics Hall on Railroad Avenue. About 150 new members were greeted by seven robed Klansmen.

===1940–present: recent history===
By 1937, Freeport&#x27;s population exceeded 20,000, and it was the largest village in Nassau County. After World War II the village became a bedroom community for New York City. The separation between the two eras was marked by a fire that destroyed the Shorecrest Hotel (originally the Crystal Lake Hotel) on January 14, 1958. During the 1950s local merchants resisted building any shopping malls in the village and subsequently suffered a great loss of business when large malls were built in communities in the central part of Long Island.

The landscape of Freeport underwent further change with a significant increase in apartment building construction. When such buildings went up in just two years in the early 1960s, the Village passed a moratorium on multi-unit residential construction.

While never a major boatbuilding center, Freeport can boast some notable figures in that field. Fred and Mirto Scopinich operated their boatyard in Freeport from just after World War I until they moved it to East Quogue in the late 1960s. Their Freeport Point Shipyard built boats for the United States Coast Guard, but also for Prohibition-era rumrunners. From 1937 to 1945 the shipyard built small boats for the United States Navy and British Royal Navy. The marina and dealership operated by Al Grover in 1950 remains in Freeport and in his family. Grover&#x27;s company built fishing skiffs from the 1970s until about 1990. One of these, a 26-footer, carried Grover and his sons from Nova Scotia to Portugal in 1985, the first-ever crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by a boat powered by an outboard motor. Columbian Bronze operated in Freeport from its 1901 founding until it closed shop in 1988. Among this company&#x27;s achievements was the propeller for the , an operational nuclear-powered submarine and the first vessel to complete a submerged transit across the North Pole.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of .

The village is bisected by east–west New York State Route 27 (Sunrise Highway). The Meadowbrook State Parkway defines its eastern boundary.

The south part of the village is penetrated by several canals that allow access to the Atlantic Ocean by means of passage through salt marshes. The oldest canal is the late 19th-century Woodcleft Canal. Freeport has extensive small-boat facilities and a resident fishing fleet, as well as charter and open water fishing boats.

==Infrastructure==

=== Transportation ===

==== Road ====
Merrick Road and Sunrise Highway both run roughly east-west through the village. Additionally, the Meadowbrook State Parkway forms much of Freeport&#x27;s eastern border with Merrick. The Southern State Parkway runs east-west about a mile north of Freeport&#x27;s northern border with Roosevelt.

Additionally, Freeport would have been the southern terminus of the never-built Freeport–Roslyn Expressway. This short-lived proposal in the early 1950s was killed largely by community opposition.

==== Rail ====
Freeport is served by the Freeport station on the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Babylon Branch.

==== Bus ====
Freeport serves as a hub for several Nassau Inter-County Express bus routes:
* n4/n4x: Freeport – Jamaica
* n19: Freeport – Sunrise Mall
* n40/41: Freeport – Mineola
* n43: Freeport – Roosevelt Field Mall
* n88: Freeport – Jones Beach (Summer Service Only)

==== Water ====
The Village of Freeport owns and maintains its own water system. Freeport&#x27;s water system serves the entire village with water.

== Arts and culture ==

Freeport is a Long Island hot spot during the summer season in New York. A popular festival occurs on Freeport&#x27;s Nautical Mile (the west side of Woodcleft Canal) the first weekend in June each year, which attracts many people from across Long Island and New York City. The Nautical Mile is a strip along the water that features well-known seafood restaurants, crab shacks, bars, eclectic little boutiques, fresh fish markets, as well as party cruise ships and casino boats that float atop the canals. People line up for the boat rides and eat at restaurants that feature seating on the water&#x27;s edge and servings of mussels, oysters, crabs, and steamed clams (&quot;steamers&quot;) accompanied by pitchers of beer. An 18-hole miniature golf course is popular among families. The Sea Breeze waterfront park—which includes a transient marina, boardwalk, rest rooms and benches—opened in 2009 at the foot of the Nautical Mile. It has proven to be a very popular spot to sit and watch the marine traffic and natural scenery. This is in addition to an existing scenic pier.

Freeport has an ethnically and racially diverse population. There is one housing project, named after Nassau County&#x27;s first black judge, Moxie Rigby. Freeport&#x27;s Hispanic community is made up of Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Colombians and other Latin American countries. Among the many Latin-American-themed businesses are several grocery stores or &quot;bodegas&quot; and restaurants along Merrick Road and Main Street that serve Caribbean, Central American, Dominican, and South American cuisines.

Freeport, along with neighboring Merrick, is also the gateway to Jones Beach, one of the largest state beaches in New York. One famous area is the Town of Hempstead Marina, where people from all over Long Island dock their boats. Freeport is a 45-minute ride by the Long Island Rail Road to Manhattan, making the trip an easy commute to New York City.

From 1974 to 1986, Freeport was one of the few Long Island towns to hold a sizeable open-air market area, known as the Freeport Mall. The heart of the Main Street business area was closed to vehicular traffic and reconfigured for pedestrians only. The experiment was not a success. The W. T. Grant store that was supposed to anchor the mall closed, along with the rest of that chain, shortly after the mall opened. The mall area became shabby and disused, and many businesses failed. The mall was dismantled and returned to through traffic with regular parking on each side of the street.

===Architecture===

Just north of the high school and the railroad tracks is the ruin of the former Brooklyn Waterworks, described by Christopher Gray of the &quot;New York Times&quot; as looking like an &quot;ancient, war-damaged abbey.&quot; Designed by architect Frank Freeman and opened in 1891 to serve the City of Brooklyn (later made a borough of New York City), it was fully active until 1929 with a capacity of 54 million gallons a day, and remained in standby for emergency use until 1977, when the pumps and other machinery were removed. See Ridgewood Reservoir. An unsuccessful 1989 plan would have turned the building into condos. Currently, the parcel is the subject of litigation and ongoing investigations by various agencies. Long Island Traditions also describes the sites of notable architecture in Freeport&#x27;s history, such as bay men&#x27;s homes and commercial fishing establishments, some of which are still existing, as well as the still-existing Fiore&#x27;s Fish Market and Two Cousins, which are located in historic waterfront buildings, built by the owners, so they could negotiate directly with the baymen as they pulled into dock.

Long Island Traditions also describes and provides a photograph of the no-longer existing Woodcleft Hotel and important boatyards, about which the site writes:

&quot;In Freeport the Maresca boatyard stands on the site of what is now the Long Island Marine Education Center owned by the Village of Freeport. Founded in the 1920s by Phillip Maresca, they built both recreational and commercial boats. Their customers included Guy Lombardo and party boat captains. The business was taken over by Everett Maresca, who died in 1995. The original building remains relatively intact, consisting of a large concrete block structure. Further down on Woodcleft Canal stands the former Scopinich Boatyard, now part of Shelter Point Marine services. The structure is obscured by corrugated metal siding but elements of its original frame structure remain. The yard was founded by Fred Scopinich, a Greek immigrant in the early 1900s. His grandson Fred moved the yard to East Quogue. The Freeport yard specialized in building commercial fishing boats including trawlers, government boats for the Coast Guard, rum running boats, as well as sailboats and garveys for local baymen. Finally the original Grover boatyard, founded by Al Grover, stands on Woodcleft Avenue a short distance from the Maresca yard. A modest frame building, approximately 20 people worked there. Today the yard is located north of the Nautical Mile on South Main street, run by Grover&#x27;s sons. Their yard consists of modern corrugated structures used primarily for maintenance and storage.&quot;

===Libraries===
The Freeport Memorial Library, which is the library serving the Freeport Library District, is the main library in Freeport. The Baldwin and Roosevelt Library Districts serve some of the northernmost portions of the village.

===Schools===
Freeport Public Schools (FPS) operates the community&#x27;s public schools.

For the 2009–10 school year, there were 6,257 students enrolled in Freeport&#x27;s public schools. The children of Freeport, in grades 1–4, attend four magnet elementary schools, each with a different specialty: Archer Street (Microsociety and Multimedia), Leo F. Giblyn (School of International Cultures), Bayview Avenue (School of Arts and Sciences), and New Visions (School of Exploration &amp; Discovery). In grades 5 and 6, all public school children attend Caroline G. Atkinson School on the north side of the town. Seventh and 8th graders attend John W. Dodd Middle School. The Middle School is built on the property that housed the older Freeport High School, but not on exactly the same site. The old high school served for some years as the junior high; then the new junior high was built on what was previously parking lot and playground, and the old building was torn down. In 2017, The school remodeled, with an added track and field. A Catholic school, the De La Salle School, is run by the Christian Brothers and accepts boys from grades 5–8.

Children in grades 9–12 attend Freeport High School, which borders the town of Baldwin and sits beside the Milburn duck pond, which is fed by a creek, several hundred yards of which was diverted underground when the high school was built. Freeport High School&#x27;s mascot is the Red Devil, and its colors are red and white. The school has track-and-field facilities. One unique feature of the school&#x27;s curriculum is a science research program run in cooperation with Stony Brook University. The school offers numerous advanced placement courses and was a pioneer in distance learning at the high school level. Roughly 87 percent of the high school&#x27;s graduates go on to some form of higher education. A community night school for teenagers had 236 students as of 1999.

As early as 1886, Freeport&#x27;s schools began the then-unusual policy of providing their students with free textbooks. In 1893, the newly incorporated village constructed a ten-room brick schoolhouse. Also in the late 19th century, the community was among the first Long Island communities to establish an &quot;academic department&quot;, offering classes beyond the elementary school level.

Freeport saw its share of the social, political, and racial turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The 1969–70 school year saw three high school principals in the village&#x27;s only high school, succeeded in August 1970 by William McElroy, formerly the junior high school principal, who came to the position &quot;in the midst of racial tension and a constantly-polarizing student body&quot;; McElroy backed such initiatives as a student advisory committee to the Board of Education and, in his own words, &quot;made [him]self available to any civic-minded group&quot; that wished to discuss with him the situation in the school. By May 1972, he could claim success, of a sort. &quot;Formerly, a fight between a black and a white student would automatically become racial; now a fight is just a fight—between two students.&quot;

The Freeport High School newspaper, &quot;Flashings&quot;, founded 1920, is believed to be the oldest high school paper on Long Island. It has won numerous awards over several decades. From 1969 until 1999, it operated under &quot;free press&quot; guidelines unusual for a high school newspaper, with an active role for the students in picking their own faculty adviser and with ultimate editorial control firmly in the hands of students. Throughout that time, Ira Schildkraut functioned as faculty adviser. In 1999, the school administration removed Schildkraut from that role and attempted to establish themselves as censors. That last decision was turned back by the school board after it drew attention from, among others, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the Student Press Law Center. However, the dispute&#x27;s resolution did reduce the student journalists&#x27; role in selecting their own faculty adviser and increased the faculty adviser&#x27;s editorial authority relative to the student journalists&#x27;.

From about 1970 to 1973, the town and Freeport High School achieved recognition because of the performance of its math team (&quot;The Mathletes&quot;) in regional inter-school math competitions and performance on advanced mathematics tests, including the International Mathematical Olympiad and those from the Mathematical Association of America (MAA).

In addition, in about 1970, Freeport High School became one of the few schools in the country then to have a general purpose computer on the premises dedicated to student use and teaching programming, an IBM 1620 donated by IBM. The 1620 was later replaced by remote access to a DEC System 10 then, later, an on-site PDP-11/40 running the RSTS/E time sharing system, also dedicated to the students. Much credit for the team and computers goes to FHS math teachers and to the Freeport School District&#x27;s head of Mathematics, Joseph Holbrook.

In June 2008, 16 people were arrested after violence erupted in the high school.

In a 2010 &quot;Newsday&quot; story regarding Long Island eighth-grader scores on Regents Exams, which have traditionally been given to students in ninth grade and up, Freeport was ranked in the highest tier.

===Sports and recreation===
In the early 1930s, Freeport was the playing field for the Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York, a semi-pro baseball team which took their name from the caps worn by Pullman porters. For a few years after that, the NFL&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers football team, which, like their baseball namesakes, played at Ebbets Field, using the stadium as a midweek training site. The site is now a Warehouse BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club.

From 1931 until the early 1980s, Freeport was home to Freeport Speedway, originally Freeport Municipal Stadium. Seating about 10,000, the stadium originally hosted &quot;midget&quot; auto races; after World War II it switched to stock car racing and eventually demolition derbies.

Freeport is home to the Freeport Recreation Center, which features an enclosed, year-round ice skating rink; an indoor pool; an outdoor Olympic-size pool; an outdoor diving tank; an outdoor children&#x27;s pool; handball courts; sauna; steam room; fully equipped workout gyms; basketball courts; and snack bars serving hot and cold foods. The &quot;Rec Center&quot; also offers evening adult classes and hosts a pre-school program, camp programs, and a senior center.

<text>A Bernal sphere is a type of space settlement intended as a long-term home for permanent residents, first proposed in 1929 by John Desmond Bernal.

Bernal&#x27;s original proposal described a hollow non-rotating spherical shell in diameter, with a target population of 20,000 to 30,000 people. The Bernal sphere would be filled with air.

==O&#x27;Neill versions==
===Island One===

In a series of studies held at Stanford University in 1975 and 1976 with the purpose of speculating on designs for future space colonies, Dr. Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill proposed &quot;Island One,&quot; a modified Bernal sphere with a diameter of only rotating at 1.9 RPM to produce a full Earth artificial gravity at the sphere&#x27;s equator. The result would be an interior landscape that would resemble a large valley running all the way around the equator of the sphere. &quot;Island One&quot; would be capable of providing living and recreation space for a population of approximately 10,000 people, with a &quot;Crystal Palace&quot; habitat (consisting of several rings attached to the sphere at each pole) used for agriculture. Sunlight was to be provided to the interior of the sphere using external mirrors to direct it in through large windows near the poles. The form of a sphere was chosen for its optimum ability to contain air pressure and its optimum mass-efficiency at providing radiation shielding.

===Island Two===
O&#x27;Neill envisioned the next generation of space habitat as a larger version of &quot;Island One&quot;. &quot;Island Two&quot; would be approximately 1800 meters in diameter, yielding an equatorial circumference of nearly six and a half kilometers (four miles). The size was driven by economics; the habitat was to be small enough to allow for efficient transportation within the habitat and large enough to support an efficient industrial base.

==In popular culture==
* The video game &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; features a fictional Bernal sphere space colony called &quot;ARK&quot;. In this colony, Doctor Eggman&#x27;s grandfather (The Professor Gerald Robotnik) created Shadow the Hedgehog to cure his granddaughter Maria&#x27;s illness, but the Guardians Units of Nations (G.U.N.) considered Shadow as a threat, so they shut down the space colony and neutralized everyone who knew about Shadow, including Maria, who died trying to protect him. A mistranslation in the English dub of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; has Tails incorrectly refer to the ARK as a &quot;Bernoulli spherical space colony&quot;.
* In the setting of the anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;, space colonies are based on underdeveloped technology, and only small-sized colonies, such as the Bernal sphere-shaped &quot;Quanqiu&quot; located in Lagrange 3, make an appearance.
* In the anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ,&quot; the space colony Moon Moon is a Bernal sphere.
* The video game &quot;Mass Effect&quot; features a fictional Bernal sphere space colony &quot;Gagarin Station,&quot; named after Yuri Gagarin.

<text>Pattern recognition is the task of assigning a class to an observation based on patterns extracted from data. While similar, pattern recognition (PR) is not to be confused with pattern machines (PM) which may possess (PR) capabilities but their primary function is to distinguish and create emergent patterns. PR has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power.

Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled &quot;training&quot; data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of &quot;classes&quot; (for example, determine whether a given email is &quot;spam&quot;). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.

Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform &quot;most likely&quot; matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to &quot;pattern matching&quot; algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.

==Overview==
A modern definition of pattern recognition is:
Pattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. &quot;Supervised learning&quot; assumes that a set of training data (the training set) has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. A learning procedure then generates a model that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of &quot;simple&quot;, in accordance with Occam&#x27;s Razor, discussed below). Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances. A combination of the two that has been explored is semi-supervised learning, which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). In cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all.

Sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. The unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as &quot;clustering&quot;, based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into clusters based on some inherent similarity measure (e.g. the distance between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional vector space), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. In some fields, the terminology is different. In community ecology, the term &quot;classification&quot; is used to refer to what is commonly known as &quot;clustering&quot;.

The piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an &quot;instance&quot;. The instance is formally described by a vector of features, which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate multidimensional space, and methods for manipulating vectors in vector spaces can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the dot product or the angle between two vectors. Features typically are either categorical (also known as nominal, i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;, or a blood type of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; or &quot;O&quot;), ordinal (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., &quot;large&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;small&quot;), integer-valued (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together, and this is also the case for integer-valued and real-valued data. Many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be &quot;discretized&quot; into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).

===Probabilistic classifiers===

Many common pattern recognition algorithms are &quot;probabilistic&quot; in nature, in that they use statistical inference to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a &quot;best&quot; label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a probability of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the &quot;N&quot;-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of &quot;N&quot;, instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of classification), &quot;N&quot; may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:
*They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in probability theory. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)
*Correspondingly, they can &quot;abstain&quot; when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.
*Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of &quot;error propagation&quot;.

===Number of important feature variables===
Feature selection algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to feature selection which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given. The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an optimization problem where given a total of formula_1 features the powerset consisting of all formula_2 subsets of features need to be explored. The Branch-and-Bound algorithm does reduce this complexity but is intractable for medium to large values of the number of available features formula_1

Techniques to transform the raw feature vectors (feature extraction) are sometimes used prior to application of the pattern-matching algorithm. Feature extraction algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA). The distinction between feature selection and feature extraction is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.

==Problem statement==
The problem of pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function formula_4 (the &quot;ground truth&quot;) that maps input instances formula_5 to output labels formula_6, along with training data formula_7 assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function formula_8 that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping formula_9. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then formula_10 is some representation of an email and formula_11 is either &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;non-spam&quot;). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, &quot;approximates as closely as possible&quot; needs to be defined rigorously. In decision theory, this is defined by specifying a loss function or cost function that assigns a specific value to &quot;loss&quot; resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the expected loss, with the expectation taken over the probability distribution of formula_12. In practice, neither the distribution of formula_12 nor the ground truth function formula_4 are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of formula_12 and hand-labeling them using the correct value of formula_16 (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of classification, the simple zero-one loss function is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the error rate on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function formula_8 labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the correctness) on a &quot;typical&quot; test set.

For a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form
:formula_18
where the feature vector input is formula_19, and the function &quot;f&quot; is typically parameterized by some parameters formula_20. In a discriminative approach to the problem, &quot;f&quot; is estimated directly. In a generative approach, however, the inverse probability formula_21 is instead estimated and combined with the prior probability formula_22 using Bayes&#x27; rule, as follows:
:formula_23

When the labels are continuously distributed (e.g., in regression analysis), the denominator involves integration rather than summation:

:formula_24

The value of formula_25 is typically learned using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest error-rate) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines maximum likelihood estimation with a regularization procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a Bayesian context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a prior probability formula_26 on different values of formula_25. Mathematically:

:formula_28

where formula_29 is the value used for formula_25 in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and formula_31, the posterior probability of formula_25, is given by

:formula_33

In the Bayesian approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector formula_34, the probability of a given label for a new instance formula_19 is computed by integrating over all possible values of formula_25, weighted according to the posterior probability:

:formula_37

===Frequentist or Bayesian approach to pattern recognition===
The first pattern classifier – the linear discriminant presented by Fisher – was developed in the frequentist tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the covariance matrix. Also the probability of each class formula_22 is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of &#x27;Bayes rule&#x27; in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.

Bayesian statistics has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the &#x27;a priori&#x27; and the &#x27;a posteriori&#x27; knowledge. Later Kant defined his distinction between what is a priori known – before observation – and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities formula_22 can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations – using e.g., the Beta- (conjugate prior) and Dirichlet-distributions. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.

Probabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach.

==Uses==

Within medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. CAD describes a procedure that supports the doctor&#x27;s interpretations and findings. Other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, classification of text into several categories (e.g., spam or non-spam email messages), the automatic recognition of handwriting on postal envelopes, automatic recognition of images of human faces, or handwriting image extraction from medical forms. The last two examples form the subtopic image analysis of pattern recognition that deals with digital images as input to pattern recognition systems.

Optical character recognition is an example of the application of a pattern classifier. The method of signing one&#x27;s name was captured with stylus and overlay starting in 1990. The strokes, speed, relative min, relative max, acceleration and pressure is used to uniquely identify and confirm identity. Banks were first offered this technology, but were content to collect from the FDIC for any bank fraud and did not want to inconvenience customers.

Pattern recognition has many real-world applications in image processing. Some examples include:
* identification and authentication: e.g., license plate recognition, fingerprint analysis, face detection/verification, and voice-based authentication.
* medical diagnosis: e.g., screening for cervical cancer (Papnet), breast tumors or heart sounds;
* defense: various navigation and guidance systems, target recognition systems, shape recognition technology etc.
* mobility: advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicle technology, etc.

In psychology, pattern recognition is used to make sense of and identify objects, and is closely related to perception. This explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful. Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways. The first concerns template matching and the second concerns feature detection. A template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long-term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified. Feature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification. One observation is a capital E having three horizontal lines and one vertical line.

==Algorithms==
Algorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output, on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised, and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature. Statistical algorithms can further be categorized as generative or discriminative.

<text>Glen Cove is a city in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, New York, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 28,365 at the time of the 2020 census. 

Of Nassau County&#x27;s five municipalities, Glen Cove is one of two that are cities, rather than towns – the other being Long Beach.

Glen Cove was considered part of the affluent, early 20th-century Gold Coast of Long Island, as the properties located along the area&#x27;s waterfront were initially developed as large country estates by wealthy entrepreneurs and businessmen (such as J.P. Morgan, Phipps, Pratt, and Prybil). 

Historically, with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, Glen Cove blossomed in the areas of manufacturing, agriculture and local retail, all of which were operated and staffed by a diverse workforce. The local opportunities—for potential business owners, entrepreneurs, and those seeking employment—attracted numerous immigrants from Europe, largely from Ireland, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Since the 20th century, Glen Cove has also become the home for new waves of immigrants seeking opportunities from Central and South America, as well as parts of Asia. 

==History==
Ancient cultures of indigenous peoples had lived in the area for thousands of years. At the time of European contact, bands of the Lenape (Delaware) nation inhabited western Long Island and the areas along today&#x27;s New York Harbor and adjacent New Jersey, as well as further south down the coast, through present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, and along the Delaware River. They spoke an Algonquian language. By 1600, however, the band inhabiting this local area was called the Matinecock (Metoac), after their location.

Glen Cove was used as a port by the English, and for those coming and going further inland to New England. On May 24, 1668, Joseph Carpenter of Warwick, Rhode Island, purchased about of land to the northwest of the Town of Oyster Bay from the Matinecock. Later that year, he admitted four male residents of Oyster Bay as co-partners in the project—the brothers Nathaniel, Daniel, and Robert Coles along with Nicholas Simkins. The five young men named the settlement &#x27;Musketa Cove Plantation&#x27;, &quot;musketa&quot; meaning &quot;place of rushes&quot; in the Lenape language.

===19th century===
In the 1830s, steamboats started regular service on Long Island Sound, between New York City and Musketa Cove, arriving at a point still called The Landing. As the Lenape word &quot;Musketa&quot; was incorrectly associated with the English word &quot;mosquito&quot;, in 1834, residents changed the name officially to Glen Cove; this was said to be taken from a misheard suggestion of &quot;Glencoe&quot; (referring to Glencoe, Scotland or Glencoe, Nova Scotia).

Glen Cove added to its population as workers arrived for jobs at the Duryea Corn Starch factory, which operated until 1900. The name Duryea was suggested as a name to replace Mosquito Cove; however, it was later rejected.

By 1850, Glen Cove had become a popular summer resort for New York City residents. The Long Island Rail Road was extended to Glen Cove in 1867, providing quicker, more frequent services to New York City. The availability of the train, and the town&#x27;s location on Long Island Sound, made it attractive to year-round residents, thus the population increased.

The vistas afforded from Long Island Sound of the town&#x27;s rolling hills attracted late 19th-century wealthy industrial barons, including Charles Pratt and his sons, Charles Anderson Dana as well as J.P. Morgan, and F.W. Woolworth. They built large, private estates along the island&#x27;s North Shore. This expanse of settled wealth was part of what became known in the 1920s as the Gold Coast of Nassau County. Part of the Morgan property was donated to the city, and it is now operated as Morgan Park and Beach.

===20th century===
On January 1, 1918, Glen Cove became an independent city, separating from the Town of Oyster Bay, after 250 years. The incorporation was driven by a desire for its tax revenues to be used locally, rather than distributed throughout Oyster Bay. Glen Cove, at the time, was an especially wealthy part of the town, but the town&#x27;s provisions for Glen Cove&#x27;s police service and roads were seen as &quot;inadequate&quot;, given the amount of taxes levied. It was unusual in that Glen Cove was incorporated as a city without ever having been an incorporated village.

Prior to the mid-20th century, most of the mansions were expanded for uses beyond simply residential. Winfield Hall, the former estate of F.W. Woolworth, is privately-owned.

Altogether, five Pratt families owned a total of about in the area. John Teele Pratt&#x27;s estate (The Manor, designed by Charles A. Platt) is operated as the Glen Cove Mansion Hotel and Conference Center.

The Braes, the country estate of Herbert L. Pratt, was purchased by the Webb Institute in 1945. After renovation, it opened the facility in 1947 as an established specialty college for naval architecture and engineering.

George DuPont Pratt&#x27;s estate, Killenworth, was purchased by the Soviet Union in 1951, for use by its United Nations (UN) delegation. The Russians have used it for decades, both to house visitors and as a weekend retreat for its UN staff. In 1960, while visiting New York for UN meetings, Nikita Khrushchev (former premier of the Soviet Union) and Fidel Castro (then president of Cuba), both stayed at Killenworth.

Like many other suburbs, Glen Cove grew rapidly in population after World War II when new residential developments were completed on former pastureland and farms. Many new residents, at the time, were the second- or third-generation children of Eastern and Southern European immigrants, relocating from their family homes in Queens or Brooklyn. Many African Americans were direct descendants of slaves from the colonial period, as colonists had imported West African slaves for domestic work and farm labor; still others were descendants of migrants from the South who had moved to New York City and the surrounding areas during the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century.

Since the late 20th century, immigrants to the city have been prominently Latin American and East and South Asian. A Sikh gurdwara established in Glen Cove draws members from the ethnic Indian population in the area.

<doc id="126711" wikidata="Q1378786" url="?curid=126711" title="Great Neck, New York">
<text>Great Neck is a region contained primarily within Nassau County, New York, on Long Island, which covers a peninsula on the North Shore and includes nine villages, among them Great Neck, Great Neck Estates, Great Neck Plaza, Kings Point, and Russell Gardens, and a number of unincorporated areas, as well as an area south of the peninsula near Lake Success and the border territory of Queens. The incorporated village of Great Neck had a population of 9,989 at the 2010 census, while the larger Great Neck area comprises a residential community of some 40,000 people in nine villages and hamlets in the town of North Hempstead, of which Great Neck is the northwestern quadrant. Great Neck has five ZIP Codes (11020–11024), which are united by a park district, a library district, and a school district. 

The hamlets are census-designated places that consolidate various unincorporated areas. They are statistical entities and are not recognized locally. However, there are locally recognized neighborhoods within the hamlet areas, such as Harbor Hills, Saddle Rock Estates, University Gardens, and Manhasset. The Manhasset neighborhood (in ZIP Code 11030) is not considered part of Great Neck. The part of the Hamlet of Manhasset that is considered part of Great Neck includes the Great Neck Manor neighborhood. Great Neck Gardens is featured on many maps as a name of one such hamlet, even as the name is seldom used by local residents.

== History ==

===Pre-colonization and colonization===

Before the Dutch and English settlers arrived on the peninsula of Great Neck in the 17th century, the Mattinecock Native Americans originally inhabited the shorelines of the peninsula. It was not until 1681 when the European settlers held the first town meeting. The Mattinecock or Metoac used Long Island Sound as a way to both fish and trade with others.

They referred to present-day Great Neck as Menhaden-Ock. It is speculated that they chose this name because of the large amount of fish in the area. With the arrival of the European settlers on the peninsula in the 1640s, Menhaden-Ock evolved into Madnan&#x27;s Neck. By 1670, Madnan&#x27;s Neck had further evolved into the current name Great Neck. Local legend has it that the name &quot;Madnan&#x27;s Neck&quot; is named after Anne (or Nan) Hutchinson. It is said that Anne Hutchinson tried to take over what is considered present-day Kings Point upon her arrival to the peninsula. However, Anne Hutchinson could not actually procure a land grant or deed for the land that she desired. Her temper supposedly earned her the nickname Mad Nan.
On November 18, 1643, the Hempstead Plains, which included the peninsula of Great Neck, was sold to the Reverend Robert Fordham and John Carman. In the beginning, the Mattinecock Indians and the European settlers cooperated and coexisted very well together. The Mattinecock would teach the settlers their knowledge of the land in exchange for new technology from the settlers. The settlers even started using the Indian currency of wampum. However, this peaceful coexistence would not last forever, and the relationship between the Mattinecock and the settlers quickly began to deteriorate. Settlers often began complaining of unfriendly Mattinecock behavior, claiming that the natives would damage their homes and hurt their cattle. On November 18, 1659, the settlers passed a law that forced the natives to pay damages for white property that they had damaged. The problem between the settlers and the Mattinecock natives over land and property kept growing and finally came to a head in 1684. A commission of settlers had been elected and given the power to appease the Mattinecock and their leader Tackapousha. Tackapousha was eventually paid off, and received 120 pounds sterling for his land. Tackapousha eventually died, and his body still rests at the Lakeville AME Zion Church&#x27;s cemetery on Community Drive, across the street from North Shore University Hospital. The Lakeville AME Zion Church is one of the oldest churches in New York State.
The very first European to look upon the Long Island peninsula of Great Neck was Captain Adrian Block of the Great Dutch West India Company in 1614, when his men were stranded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, because their ship &quot;Tiger&quot; sank shortly after its landing. The captain and his men then built a ship called the &quot;Onrust&quot; out of timber and salvaged parts from &quot;Tiger&quot;. When the sailors set sail again, they sailed around Long Island, mapping it as they passed. Later, the Reverend Robert Fordham and John Carman first came to Great Neck from New Haven by use of Long Island Sound. During this trip, the deal with Chief Tackapousha was reached. One year later, on November 16 William Kieft granted a special land patent for the territory, and permission for the community&#x27;s incorporation. William Kieft was the director general of New Netherland, and the patent that he granted gave the people of the peninsula the right to religious self-determination. The new community&#x27;s political independence was so great that only town officials who were in any way elected by the Dutch government or its magistrates, first nominated by a town meeting.
The Dutch controlled Long Island from 1642 to 1664. Under Dutch rule, constables, local officers, nominated magistrates, and overseers were elected by town meetings and passed legislation. On December 21, 1656, Peter Stuyvesant, who was the director general of New Netherland after William Kieft, appointed the first two magistrates of Hempstead. These two men were John Seaman and Richard Guildersleeve. The local government of Madnan&#x27;s Neck at the time was extremely active in passing new laws. A liquor tax was imposed, and half of that tax paid for the town&#x27;s supply of ammunition, with the other half going to education. A religious code of ethics was also published by the local government, which included conduct on holidays for the entire town. There were also punishments for poor conduct, which included fines, corporal punishment, and banishment. The first reported instance of sexual misconduct in the peninsula&#x27;s history was recorded on October 3, 1659, against Henry Linnington. After the threat of being banished, Linnington was ultimately allowed to stay, on the condition that he reformed his behavior.
Around this time, the boundaries of Madnan&#x27;s Neck and Hempstead grew increasingly apart. As the population of Madnan&#x27;s Neck grew, independence from Hempstead became increasingly realistic. In 1672, Robert Jackson, a well-known man in the community of Madnan&#x27;s Neck, beat out Simon Seryon in the election for constable of Hempstead by a count of 39 to 31. However, Seryon was still declared the victor, due to governmental corruption and back door bribery. Incensed by the fixed election and obviously staged result, residents of Madnan&#x27;s Neck petitioned the governor for separation, but their request was denied. Finally, on June 9, 1687, the order went out from the government of the New Netherland that Madnan&#x27;s Neck be &quot;separate, hereafter from Hempstead&quot;. The town was then given its own marshal, and its own constable. The first constable of Madnan&#x27;s Neck was a man named Edward Hare, who helped aid in the movement for Madnan&#x27;s Neck&#x27;s independence. Over time, Madnan&#x27;s Neck grew increasingly politically independent. Throughout the next few years, Madnan&#x27;s Neck depended even less on Hempstead. Few communities of Madnan&#x27;s Neck&#x27;s size had their own highway, grist mill, minister, constable, and marshal, yet Madnan&#x27;s Neck, emerged from Hempstead as a fully functioning town.

===After settlement===
During the late 19th century, Great Neck was the rail head of the New York and Flushing Railroad, and began the process of converting from a farm village into a commuter town.

In the 1920s, Great Neck—in particular the Village of Kings Point—provided a backdrop to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. It was thinly disguised as &quot;West Egg,&quot; in counterpoint to Manor Haven/Sands Point, which was the inspiration for the more posh &quot;East Egg&quot; (the next peninsula over on Long Island Sound), Great Neck symbolized the decadence of the Roaring Twenties as it extended out from New York City to then-remote suburbs. &quot;The Great Gatsby&#x27;s&quot; themes and characters reflected the real-world transformation that Great Neck was experiencing at the time, as show-business personalities like Eddie Cantor, Sid Caesar, and the Marx Brothers bought homes in the hamlet and eventually established it as a haven for Jewish Americans formerly of Brooklyn and the Bronx.


In 1943, the United States Merchant Marine Academy was founded at the former location of Walter P. Chrysler&#x27;s palatial estate in Kings Point, as the only higher education institution in Great Neck. The end of World War II saw a tremendous migration of Ashkenazi Jews from the cramped quarters to the burgeoning suburb. They founded many synagogues and community groups and pushed for stringent educational policies in the town&#x27;s public schools; it is portrayed in Jay Cantor&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Great Neck,&quot; with recently installed residents of all stripes trying to secure the brightest futures for their children. During the construction of the current headquarters of the United Nations from 1947 through 1952, the United Nations was temporarily headquartered at the Sperry Corporation facility in the Great Neck community of Lake Success due to its proximity to Manhattan. Eleanor Roosevelt headed the UN Commission on Human Rights at this location.

During the 1960s, many residents frequented the local pool and ice-skating complex, Parkwood, after which its patronage dramatically increased following years of decline as homeowners built their own in-ground pools. After the September 11 attacks, the ice-skating rink was renamed in honor of Andrew Stergiopoulos, a local resident who was killed in the attack. It was extensively renovated in 2007 and 2008.

Beginning in the 1980s, an influx of Persian Jews who left their country fleeing persecution from the 1979 Islamic Revolution settled in Great Neck. Beginning in the late 1990s a number of East Asians, predominantly Chinese and Korean, have been moving into the area. The high quality public school education is a key attractor for many of those moving in (the GNPS school district has been ranked by Niche as a #1 public school district in New York in previous years and some of its schools have received Blue Ribbons).

== List of communities ==
Great Neck consists of 9 incorporated villages and 6 unincorporated hamlets: 
* Village of Great Neck
* Great Neck Estates
* Great Neck Plaza
* Kensington
* Kings Point
* Lake Success
* Russell Gardens
* Saddle Rock
* Thomaston
* Great Neck Gardens
* Harbor Hills
* Saddle Rock Estates
* University Gardens
The westernmost portion of the Hamlet of Manhasset lies between the villages of Thomaston and Lake Success and has Great Neck postal codes (1102x).

==Transportation==
Great Neck is a 30 to 40-minute commute from Manhattan&#x27;s Penn Station on the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road via the Great Neck station. Some peak LIRR trains terminate at the station. Nassau Inter-County Express connects the villages to the train station and offers service to several destinations in Nassau County and Queens from the station, while the southern part of the Great Neck area can also directly access the Q46 New York City Bus on Union Turnpike at the border with Glen Oaks and the Q12 bus on Northern Boulevard at the border with Little Neck.

==Emergency services==
The Village of Great Neck is protected by the Nassau County Police Department&#x27;s Sixth Precinct, as is the rest of Great Neck except for the villages of Great Neck Estates, Kings Point, Kensington and Lake Success. Those villages have their own police departments, which are reinforced by the NCPD during any criminal activity, event, or other incident that falls outside the realm of &quot;routine.&quot;

Great Neck is served by three all-volunteer fire departments. The Great Neck Alert Fire Company was founded in 1901. The Great Neck Vigilant Fire Company was founded in 1904. Company 3 of the Manhasset-Lakeville Fire Department was founded in 1912, and Company 4 of the M-LFD was founded in 1926. Alert covers the northern part of the peninsula, including the Village of Great Neck, providing fire and heavy rescue response. Alert responds to certain medical emergencies with its heavy rescue truck and provides care before the arrival of an ambulance. Vigilant serves the middle portion of Great Neck with fire and heavy rescue response. The Vigilant Fire Company also provides emergency ambulance services to both its own territory and Alert&#x27;s. M-LFD Co. 3 and 4 serve the southern part of Great Neck, including the villages of Thomaston and Lake Success. These two companies offer fire and rescue services. The M-LFD Ambulance Unit operates two ambulances out of Co. 3&#x27;s firehouse. In addition, the Nassau County Police Emergency Ambulance Bureau also provides EMS service to the Manhasset-Lakeville fire district.

==Parks and recreation==
The Parkwood Pool and skating rink complex, the Village Green and sections of Kings Point Park are managed by the Great Neck Park District. The Park District serves all Great Neck except the villages of Saddle Rock, Great Neck Estates, and Lake Success, and the neighborhoods (not hamlets) of Harbor Hills and University Gardens. Areas not served by the Great Neck Park District have their own facilities for their residents, run by the villages or civic associations. Parkwood can also provide tennis lessons and skating lessons. During the summer it is a part of the Great Neck day camp program, where young campers use the swimming pool facilities.

==Economy==
Great Neck has consistently been recognized as one of the most affluent towns both regionally and nationally.

==Culture and tourism==
Great Neck serves primarily as a &quot;bedroom&quot; community for New York City. As such, it contains few &quot;touristy&quot; attractions. Notable exceptions include:
* Saddle Rock Grist Mill, a historical grain-mill powered by tides; known to have been in operation as early as the 18th century.
* United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point
* Steppingstone Park, formerly part of the Walter P. Chrysler estate in Kings Point. Offers summer concerts every Saturday night.
* Kings Point Park
* Great Neck Arts Center
* Great Neck Plaza Shopping District
* Great Neck Plaza Promenade Nights – Several summer nights in Great Neck&#x27;s downtown area, streets are closed off and local restaurants bring seating outdoors for a festive evening of dining, live music, and entertainment.
* &quot;Handful of Keys&quot;, a trompe l&#x27;oeil (fool the eye) mural painted by William Cochran located in Great Neck Plaza.
* F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s House was loosely referred to in his novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. &quot;West Egg&quot; referred to Kings Point, a prosperous neighborhood in the northern part of Great Neck, once known for its prevalence of &quot;new money.&quot;

==Education==

Great Neck Library is the public library system serving the community of Great Neck. There are four branches, located throughout the Great Neck peninsula: Main, Station, Parkville, and Lakeville.

The Great Neck Union Free School District is the school district of most of Great Neck. It also includes parts of unincorporated New Hyde Park and Manhasset Hills. A small part of eastern Great Neck around Northern Boulevard is part of the Manhasset Union Free School District, whose students attend Manhasset High School. About 6,200 students, grades K-12, attend the Great Neck Public Schools. There are three high schools: Great Neck North, Great Neck South, and Village (a small alternative high school). There is a district-wide alternative high school program, SEAL Academy (Supportive Environment for All Learners). There are also two middle schools and four elementary schools. Students have diverse backgrounds; they come from more than 40 countries and represent a broad socioeconomic range.

== &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; ==
In the 1920s, F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in Great Neck, at 6 Gateway Drive in Great Neck Estates, which is probably Great Neck&#x27;s greatest claim to fame. It was a modest house, not dissimilar to that of Nick Carraway, the protagonist of his novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. It is said that Fitzgerald modeled West Egg, the fictional town in which Nick lived, next to the mansion of Jay Gatsby, after Great Neck (specifically Kings Point), for its epitome of &quot;nouveau riche&quot; gaudiness, atmosphere, and lifestyle. He modeled East Egg, the town where Daisy and Tom lived, after Great Neck&#x27;s eastern neighbor Sands Point, which is part of Port Washington.

==History==

The Village of Great Neck Plaza was incorporated on May 3, 1930.

In 1866, the New York and Flushing Railroad extended their main line into Great Neck through a subsidiary called the North Shore Railroad, thus transforming it from a farming community into a commuter town. The NY&amp;F was consolidated into the Flushing and North Side Railroad in 1869, only to be merged into the Flushing, North Shore, and Central Railroad in 1874 and leased in 1876 by the LIRR. Throughout much of the late 19th century, Great Neck was the terminus of what is today the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The village was incorporated in 1930, even as the station that led to its existence was being reconstructed.

<text>Harbor Hills is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located on the Great Neck Peninsula within the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 562 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
In 1956, the Town of North Hempstead approved the construction of the community&#x27;s swimming pool and its bathhouses, and approved of the creation of the Harbor Hills Park District, which was created specifically for the community&#x27;s new park complex project. The contract was awarded to Great Neck-based Schumacher &amp; Forelle, which bid $169,500 (1956 USD) for the pool&#x27;s construction, and promised to do the work in 110 days. The project was paid for by the hamlet&#x27;s roughly 175 residents.

The community&#x27;s pool would be reconstructed between 1986 and 1989, and again was paid for by the hamlet&#x27;s residents. This controversial project led to a lawsuit filed by residents over the payments and unexpected rises in taxes, which the Harbor Hills Civic Association charged were due to North Hempstead overpaying, expanding the project, and failing to properly communicate with or notify the locals.

<text>Hicksville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The CDP&#x27;s population was 43,869 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Hamlet namesake Valentine Hicks was the son-in-law of abolitionist and Quaker preacher Elias Hicks, and eventual president of the Long Island Rail Road. He bought land in the village in 1834 and turned it into a station stop on the LIRR in 1837. Hicksville was founded accidentally when a financial depression brought the LIRR to a stop at Broadway, Hicksville. The station slowly grew and though it started as a train station, it turned into a hotel then a real estate deal, even becoming a depot for produce, particularly cucumbers for a Heinz Company plant. After a blight destroyed the cucumber crops, the farmers grew potatoes. It turned into a bustling New York City suburb in the building boom following World War II.

=== Failed incorporation attempt ===
In 1953, Hicksville attempted to incorporate itself as the Incorporated Village of Hicksville. Many residents felt that by incorporating as a village, the community would be run more effectively than by the Town of Oyster Bay. A petition had been signed with 6,242 signatures from residents in favor of the plan.

However, these plans were unsuccessful, and Hicksville remains an unincorporated area of the Town of Oyster Bay to this day, as of 2023.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and 0.15% is water.

=== Climate ===
The climate is borderline between hot-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfa&quot;) and humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and the local hardiness zone is 7a. Average monthly temperatures in the village center range from 31.9 °F in January to 74.7 °F in July.

==Economy==

Metalab Equipment Company, a division of Norbute Corp, made laboratory furniture and cabinetry. Alsy Manufacturing manufactured electric lamps and lampshades from 1975 through 1991.

The Rubber Company of America (RUCO) built a manufacturing site in 1945. RUCO Polymer Corp. (Hooker Chemical Company) manufactured plastics, latex, and esters. Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) owned and operated this site from 1966 to 1982. The site was purchased by Sybron Corporation, then in 2000, the Bayer Corporation (Bayer MaterialScience) purchased the Hooker Ruco facility and in 2002 decided to close the facility. The facility was a freight customer of the Long Island Rail Road and New York and Atlantic Railway, served by a spur track off the Main Line next to the grade crossing at New South Road. The site was used for the production of polyester from 1982 until 2002. The LIRR removed the switch during track work sometime after the closure and demolition of the buildings on the property. The property remains fenced-off and vacant currently.

The presence of a major LIRR hub means that Hicksville developed as a major bedroom community of New York City. The LIRR has a team yard on West John Street, just east of Charlotte Avenue, served by the New York and Atlantic Railway, for off-line freight customers receiving or shipping cargo by rail to anywhere in the North American rail network.

Hicksville&#x27;s North Broadway, positioned in the center of Nassau County, developed into a significant retail center. North Broadway was home to the Mid-Island Shopping Plaza (now known as Broadway Mall), a 156,000-square-foot Sears department store and auto center (which closed in 2018) and various other restaurants and retail stores.

Hicksville is home to a number of South Asian grocery stores, clothing shops and restaurants, due to its large proportion of immigrants from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

<doc id="126727" wikidata="Q3476971" url="?curid=126727" title="Inwood, New York">
<text>Inwood is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 11,340 at the time of the 2020 census. It is considered part of Long Island&#x27;s Five Towns area and is located within the Town of Hempstead.

== History ==
Inwood was first settled in 1600s. Like many other nearby communities, the area was known as Near Rockaway. A meeting was held by the Town of Hempstead on January 16, 1663, and during that meeting, the name of what is now Inwood was changed to North West Point (also spelled as Northwest Point), named after its geographic position in relation to the more central part of Far Rockaway, which it was then part of. It became the first area which was once known as Near Rockaway to be given its own name. Its original settlers were Jamaica Bay fishermen, generally lawless and troublesome to other Rockaway residents. Soon after the American Civil War, the area in 1871 became known as Westville. The Westville designation was used as the name of the community until residents petitioned for the United States Postal Service to establish a post office in the community. The post office refused as a Westville already existed in Upstate New York. This led locals to change the community&#x27;s name to Inwood in December 1888. This name received the most votes; the other proposed names included Bayhead, Springhaven, Radwayton, Elco, Raway, Pike&#x27;s Peak, and Custer. By changing the community&#x27;s name, the locals were able to get a post office for Inwood, which ultimately opened on February 25, 1889.

Inwood&#x27;s first post office closed after roughly 30 years of operation (&quot;circa&quot; 1920), and it was not until 1949 that a new post office would open in the community – although an unsuccessful, earlier attempt to reopen it was made in 1932.

The first true road in the area, the Inwood end of Lord Avenue, was built when the neighboring village of Lawrence was developed.

When the first post office in the village was established on February 25, 1889, the name of the village was changed to Inwood; a post office named Westville already existed in New York State. By the time of World War I, a large part of Inwood&#x27;s population was of Italian and Albanian extraction.

Inwood is home to the famous Inwood Country Club, which was the site of the 1921 PGA Championship – in addition to the 1923 U.S. Open.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and – or 20.19% – is water.

Inwood&#x27;s northernmost and westernmost boundaries border Queens in the City of New York, and it is located across Head of the Bay from John F. Kennedy international Airport.

<doc id="126729" wikidata="Q3476975" url="?curid=126729" title="Jericho, New York">
<text>Jericho is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States, approximately 29 miles (47 km) east of Midtown Manhattan. The population was 14,808 at the time of the 2020 census.

The area is served by the Jericho Union Free and the Syosset Central School Districts, the boundaries of which differ somewhat from those of the hamlet. The boundaries of the Jericho Post Office vary from both the hamlet and the school district boundaries, including a portion of Jericho in the Westbury ZIP code and a portion of Syosset in the Jericho ZIP code.

==History==
Located in the Town of Oyster Bay, Jericho was part of the Robert Williams Plantation in 1648. The English families who settled in Jericho were, or soon became, Quakers, members of the Society of Friends. Many fled from persecution in England and in the New England Colonies. They sought a peaceful existence as farmers. The name of the area was changed in 1692 from Lusum to Jericho after the town in the Middle East near the Jordan River mentioned in the Bible as part of the Promised Land.

Elias Hicks married Jemima Seaman in 1771 and moved to her family&#x27;s farm in Jericho, where he soon became a noted preacher of Quaker doctrine. All the Quakers suffered during the British occupation of Long Island in the Revolutionary War. The practice was to quarter troops in homes of residents, who had to provide room and board for them. The Quakers continued to protest the entire concept of war itself. After the war, peace returned to Jericho, and the neat farms and businesses began to prosper. A Friends Meeting house was built in 1788 in Jericho that is still used in the 21st century. A Quaker school was built in 1793, the Charity Society of Jericho and Westbury in 1794, and slavery was abolished in 1817, with Hicks&#x27; help.
A post office was established in 1802, a cider mill in the mid-19th century, the first public elementary school in 1905, known as the Cedar Swamp School. Improvements to infrastructure were made with the founding of the Jericho Water District in 1923. As the population increased, a Volunteer Fire Department established in 1938, and a new elementary school was built in 1953 (Robert Seaman School). The population kept increasing until the last elementary schools in Jericho were built, the George A. Jackson Elementary School in 1957, the now closed Robert Williams School in 1961 and the Cantiague School in 1963. 

After World War II, in the 1950s Phebe Underhill Seaman sold a large piece of her land to real estate developers. This property was developed for new suburban housing. The water tower was erected in 1952. In 1958 the NY Department of Transportation demolished &quot;Old Jericho&quot; to widen Broadway, Routes 106/107, and to put in a cloverleaf access to Jericho Turnpike. New grade schools and a high school were added to the community along with a shopping center, a new post office, new fire department and a public library. 

Also in Jericho is the New York Community Bank Theatre, originally established in 1956 as the Westbury Music Fair. The main entrance to SUNY Old Westbury is located in Jericho.

=== Underground Railroad ===
The building now known as One North was built in 1789 as the home for the prominent Quaker and abolitionist Valentine Hicks, his wife Abigail, and their children. Hicks&#x27; father-in-law Elias Hicks &quot;had been the spark that helped convince Quakers and other like-minded people after the Revolutionary War that all men were created equal—including people of color who were enslaved&quot;. Valentine Hicks was also an Underground Railroad station master; in his home—a key way station—a removable panel behind an upstairs linen closet (that is still there today) concealed a staircase to the attic where Hicks hid runaways until the coast was clear. The Town of Oyster Bay designated the site as a historic town landmark in 2012. In 2015 there was a lot of outrage over the preservation of this historic site. Partial demolition of the Maine Maid Inn took place without the approval of the Oyster Bay landmark commission, which outraged many preservationists. 

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

There is another community known as Jericho in New York, located in the extreme Northeast corner of the state, in the Town of Altona, County of Clinton. It lies primarily along the Rand Hill Road.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Jericho lies in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa). As such, summers are usually hot and humid with occasional thunderstorms, winters are usually cool with snow and rain, and the spring and fall typically feature mild weather.

The average monthly temperatures in the hamlet range from 30.9 °F in January to 74.7 °F in July. The local hardiness zone is 7a.

=== Greater Jericho area ===
Jericho consists of 3 villages and 1 unincorporated hamlet

* Jericho
* Brookville
* Upper Brookville
* Old Brookville

Note: Old Brookville also part of the greater Glen Cove Area.

The Incorporated Village of Kensington is in the Town of North Hempstead and is on the Great Neck Peninsula.

==History==
On November 7, 1921, by a unanimous vote of the residents, Kensington incorporated as a village. The first village elections for officers and trustees were held on November 28, 1921, and Byron Eldred was elected unanimously as its first Mayor. The village was named after London’s Kensington Gardens, and the entrance gates at the main entrance to the village were based on Kensington Garden&#x27;s gates.

Many of Kensington&#x27;s mayors have served for substantially long terms. Notable are Mayor Seymour Cohen, Mayor Steven Randall and Mayor Bonnie Golub. The mayor also serves as Commissioner of Police. The Village of Kensington was initially established as an enclave of homes of famous celebrities.

The waterfront park was deeded to the Kensington Association in August 1915. This included a 500-foot sand beach on Manhasset Bay, miniature lakes, a boat dock, tennis courts, and one of the largest fresh water swimming pools in the United States.

In order to maintain the residential character of the community, a restrictive covenant was written to keep business and industry out. Furthermore, a membership corporation called the Kensington Association was initiated to take care of maintenance and police protection.

Kensington was recognized as one of the safest places to live in the U.S. and remains that way to this day.

It was a modest house, not dissimilar to that of Nick, the protagonist of his novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

He modeled East Egg, the town where Daisy and Tom lived, after Great Neck&#x27;s eastern neighbor Sands Point, which is part of Port Washington.

<text>Lawrence is a village in Nassau County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the village population was 6,483.

The Village of Lawrence is in the southwestern corner of the Town of Hempstead, adjoining the border with the New York City borough of Queens to the west and near the Atlantic Ocean to the south. Lawrence is one of the &quot;Five Towns&quot;, which consist of the villages of Lawrence and Cedarhurst, the hamlets (unincorporated areas) of Woodmere and Inwood, and &quot;The Hewletts&quot;, which is made up of the hamlet of Hewlett together with the villages of Hewlett Bay Park, Hewlett Harbor and Hewlett Neck, along with Woodsburgh.

== Old Lawrence ==
Old Lawrence, or Back Lawrence, is a part of the Village of Lawrence, comprising many large homes, mansions, beach side villas and former plantations with very large property, a few dating back to the time of the American Revolution. This area, like Hewlett is unique because its rural affluence is similar in character to the more well known Gold Coast of the North Shore instead of being more urbanized like the rest of the South Shore of Nassau County. An interesting pre-Revolutionary home on Long Island, Rock Hall, was home to two prominent families, the Martins and Hewletts, and is now an active museum.

Beginning in 1869, a railroad line was completed which originated in New York City and ran through the part of Long Island now called The Five Towns. Part of the land in that area was acquired by three brothers with the surname &quot;Lawrence,&quot; which is who the Village was eventually named after. During the second half of the 19th century, it was a main vacation spot for the wealthy families until the 1890s. A series of hurricanes and nor&#x27;easters altered the coastline considerably and destroyed a large beachfront hotel. Lawrence could no longer boast direct access to the sands along the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, Lawrence began to become a suburb, a village with schools, public facilities, better roads and a large town area that expanded into what it is now today.

In 1897, Lawrence incorporated as a village. This enabled it to gain local control of zoning.

Lawrence, or most notably Old Lawrence, was formerly home to a large upper class of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant families who lived there since the time of the American Revolution. From the 1940s to 1980s, it became a center of Reform and Conservative Jewish life that included the largest Reform synagogue on Long Island (Temple Israel). Many noteworthy residents grew up in Lawrence during this period.

In the late 1980s, it saw a large migration of Modern Orthodox Jews. The Orthodox Jewish communities are close to the more Haredi nearby center of Far Rockaway which has more yeshivas for the children and younger members as well as a variety of kosher restaurants and communal organizations. Central Avenue in Lawrence (and its continuation in Cedarhurst) has a large and growing number of kosher restaurants and other business catering to the Orthodox community.

<text>Levittown is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York. It is a suburb of New York City, located halfway between the villages of Hempstead and Farmingdale. The CDP had a total population of 51,758 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the most populous unincorporated CDP in Nassau County and the second most populous CDP on Long Island, behind Brentwood.

Levittown gets its name from its builder, the firm of Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc. founded by Abraham Levitt on August 2, 1929, which built the district as a planned community for returning World War II veterans between 1947 and 1951. Sons William and Alfred served as the company&#x27;s president and chief architect and planner, respectively. Levittown was the first truly mass-produced suburb and is widely regarded as the archetype for postwar suburbs throughout the country. William Levitt, who assumed control of Levitt &amp; Sons in 1954, is considered the father of modern suburbia in the United States.

There have been multiple proposals in the past to incorporate Levittown either as a village or as the third city in Nassau County.

== History ==

=== Overview ===

The building firm, Levitt &amp; Sons, headed by Abraham Levitt and his two sons, William and Alfred, built four planned communities called &quot;Levittown&quot;, in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey (now Willingboro Township), and Puerto Rico; the Levittown in New York was the first. Additionally, Levitt &amp; Sons&#x27; designs are featured prominently in the older portion of Buffalo Grove, Illinois; Vernon Hills, Illinois; the Belair section of Bowie, Maryland; and the Greenbriar section of Fairfax, Virginia.

The Levitt firm began before World War II, as a builder of custom homes in upper middle-class communities on Long Island. During the war, however, the home building industry languished under a general embargo on private use of scarce raw materials. William &quot;Bill&quot; Levitt served in the Navy in the Seabees – the service&#x27;s construction battalions – and developed expertise in the mass-produced building of military housing using uniform and interchangeable parts. He was insistent that a postwar building boom would require similar mass-produced housing, and was able to purchase options on large swaths of onion and potato fields in undeveloped sections of Long Island.

Returning to the firm after war&#x27;s end, Bill Levitt persuaded his father and brother to embrace the utilitarian system of construction he had learned in the Navy. With his brother, Alfred, who was an architect, he designed a small one-floor house with an unfinished &quot;expansion attic&quot; that could be rapidly constructed and as rapidly rented to returning GIs and their young families. Levitt &amp; Sons built the community with an eye towards speed, efficiency, and cost-effective construction; these methods led to a production rate of 30 houses a day by July 1948.
They used pre-cut lumber and nails shipped from their own factories in Blue Lake, California, and built on concrete slabs, as they had done in a previous planned community in Norfolk, Virginia. This necessitated negotiating a change in the building code which, prior to the building of this community, did not permit concrete slabs. Given the urgent need for housing in the region, the town agreed. Levitt &amp; Sons also controversially utilized non-union contractors in the project, a move which provoked picket lines. On the other hand, they paid their workers well and offered multiple incentives that allowed them to earn extra money, so that they often could earn twice as much a week as elsewhere. The company also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers. The building of every house was reduced to 26 steps, with sub-contractors responsible for each step. His mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed Levitt to sell them, with kitchens fully stocked with modern appliances, and a television in the living room, for as little as $8,000 each (equal to $ today), which, with the G.I. Bill and federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400 (equal to $ today).

The planned 2,000 home rental community was quickly successful, with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reporting that half of the properties had been rented within two days of the community being announced on May 7, 1947. As demand continued, exceeding availability, the Levitts expanded their project with 4,000 more homes, as well as community services, including schools and postal delivery. With the full implementation of federal government supports for housing, administered under the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Levitt firm switched from rental to sale of their houses, offering ownership on a 30-year mortgage with no down payment and monthly costs the same as rental. The resulting surge in demand pressed the firm to further expand its development, which changed its name from Island Trees to Levittown shortly thereafter.

Levittown was designed to provide a large amount of housing at a time when there was a high demand for affordable family homes. This suburban development would become a symbol of the &quot;American Dream&quot; as it allowed thousands of families to become home owners. 

==== Unsuccessful incorporation proposals ====
In 1952, Carl Sigman, who was running as the Democratic candidate for County Executive, stated that he felt it would be wise for Levittown to incorporate itself as a city. If successful, the never-realized Incorporated City of Levittown would have been the third city to incorporate within Nassau County, joining Glen Cove and Long Beach.

Previously, locals had proposed incorporating their hamlet as a village.

===Discriminatory practices===
As well as a symbol of the American Dream, Levittown would also become a symbol of racial segregation in the United States, due to Clause 25 of the standard lease agreement signed by the first residents of Levittown, who had an option to buy their homes. This &quot;restrictive covenant&quot; stated in capital letters and bold type that the house could not &quot;be used or occupied by any person other than members of the Caucasian race.&quot;

Such discriminatory housing standards were consistent with government policies of the time. The Federal Housing Administration allowed developers to justify segregation within public housing. The FHA offered mortgages only to non-mixed developments, which discouraged developers from creating racially integrated housing. Before the sale of Levittown homes began, the sales agents were aware that no applications from black families would be accepted. As a result, American veterans who wished to purchase a home in Levittown were unable to do so if they were black.

William Levitt attempted to justify their decision to only sell homes to white families by saying that it was in the best interest for business. He claimed their actions were not discriminatory but intended to maintain the value of their properties. The company explained that it was not possible to reduce racial segregation while they were attempting to reduce the housing shortage. Levitt said &quot;As a Jew, I have no room in my heart for racial prejudice. But the plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities. This attitude may be wrong morally, and someday it may change. I hope it will.&quot; The Levitts explained that they would open up applications to blacks after they had sold as many homes to white people as possible. They believed that potential white buyers would not want to buy a house in Levittown if they were aware they would have black neighbors.

An opposition group was formed, the Committee to End Discrimination in Levittown, to protest the restricted sale of Levittown homes, and to push for an integrated community. In 1948 the United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, declared that property deeds stipulating racial segregation were &quot;unenforceable as law and contrary to public policy&quot;. Only well after the 1954 racial integration decisions, including &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, was Levittown racially integrated, and even as late as the 1990 census, only a tiny fraction of the community was non-white. Starting primarily in the 2010s, Levittown&#x27;s demographics have been shifting as it has been attracting middle-class South Asian and Hispanic residents to the community.

===Spread of the planned community===
While the Levitts are generally credited with designing a postwar &quot;planned community,&quot; with common public amenities such as swimming pools and community centers, they were quick to release these high-maintenance, low-profit elements to the surrounding towns; the development sprawled across municipal boundaries, causing legal and administrative difficulties and requiring major initiatives within those existing municipalities to provide for and fund schools, sewage and water systems, and other infrastructure elements.

In 1949, Levitt and Sons changed focus, unveiling a new plan which it termed a &quot;ranch&quot; house. Larger, , and more modern, these homes were only offered for sale, with a planned price of $7,990 (equal to $ today). The ranch homes were similar to the rental properties in that they were built on concrete slabs, included an expandable attic but no garage, and were heated with hot-water radiant heating pipes. Five models were offered that were effectively identical with differences in details such as exterior color and window placement. Again, demand was high, requiring that the purchasing process be streamlined as the assembly process had been, reaching the point that a buyer could walk through the process of selecting a house through contracting for its purchase in three minutes. This ranch model was altered in 1950 to include a carport and a built-in television. In 1951, a partially finished attic was added to the design.

Levittown proved successful. By 1951, it and surrounding regions included 17,447 homes constructed by Levitt &amp; Sons.

On November 9, 2007, Levitt &amp; Sons of Fort Lauderdale became the nation&#x27;s largest builder to file for bankruptcy as the housing market boom of the early 21st century continued to crumble.

=== Timeline ===
*February 12, 1664: Jerusalem Purchase between John Seaman and Takapausha of the Massapequan Indians whereupon the English were granted rights to settle in on lands that now comprise southern and easternmost Levittown (south of Hempstead Tpke.), northern and eastern Wantagh, and most of Seaford. As Seaman established his farm, Cherrywood, two years later, near the current location of Salk Middle School and MacArthur High School, he was the first European to live in what&#x27;s now Levittown. This is the start of the use of the word &quot;Jerusalem&quot; to describe the aforementioned areas.
* March 22, 1747: Land deed between the Seaman and Weeks families first to mention the Island of Trees endowing the general area of northern Levittown with the name &quot;Island Trees&quot;.
* March 1, 1837: Rail service arrives at Hicksville under the supervision of Valentine Hicks. The ensuing influx of German immigrant farmers and artisans opens the future Levittown area up to potato farming and other forms of development.
* February 11, 1907: William Levitt born to Abraham Levitt and Pauline Biederman Levitt in Brooklyn.
* May 21, 1947: Local governing board approves of the construction of a community that would become Levittown.
* October 1, 1947: Levittown&#x27;s official beginning as a suburban entity with the first three hundred families – beginning with the Bladykas family – moving into their brand-new Levitt &amp; Sons homes.
* January 1, 1948: The Jerusalem/Island Trees area is officially named &quot;Levittown&quot;.

== Place in American culture ==

As the first and one of the largest mass-produced suburbs, Levittown quickly became a symbol of postwar suburbia. Although Levittown provided affordable houses in what many residents felt to be a congenial community, critics decried its homogeneity and blandness. Today, &quot;Levittown&quot; is used as a term to describe overly sanitized suburbs consisting largely of identical housing. Similarly, places have earned names like &quot;Levittown-of-X&quot; or &quot;Levittown-on-the-X&quot; as seen in Long Island&#x27;s Bayville &quot;Levittown on the Sound&quot; and Fire Island&#x27;s Dunewood &quot;Levittown on the Bay.&quot; Oddly enough, although Levittown is remembered largely for its homogeneity, the majority of houses in Levittown have by now been so thoroughly expanded and modified by their owners that their original architectural form can be somewhat difficult to see; however, with diligent observation, several original examples can still be seen today. Levittown continues to hold a reputation of being an affordable, family-centered community.

Levittown has become so ingrained in American culture that the Smithsonian Institution in Washington has expressed interest in displaying an entire Levittown house. Bill Yeingst, a historian with Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History Domestic Life Division, said &quot;An original ranch model would be ideal. We would like someone to donate their Levittown house, or we would like to find a donor to provide the funds so that we could secure a Levittown house.&quot; He noted that &quot;The stories played out in suburban Levittown are the stories of America. They are stories important to everyone.&quot; Although &quot;None of this is set in concrete,&quot; according to Yeingst, &quot;the Levittown house would be dismantled at the site, transported to Washington and reconstructed. Then it would be exhibited along with other innovations in American home life.&quot;

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 6.9 square miles (17.8 km2), all land. It does not conform to the U.S. Postal Service boundaries nor to the extent of the development built by Levitt &amp; Sons; it also includes areas built by other developers.

Levittown, New York, is an unincorporated area in Nassau County, New York. It can be defined in three overlapping but non-conforming ways. The most common use is Levittown as defined by the United States Postal Service&#x27;s Zip Code 11756. Another definition is the extent of the Levitt &amp; Sons development built from 1947 to 1951. A third is the Census Designated Place (CDP) called Levittown as defined by the United States Census Bureau.

The United States Postal Service ZIP code called Levittown, New York, is 11756 and what is most commonly used to mean Levittown, New York. It does not include all the houses built in this area by Levitt &amp; Sons and it does include houses built by other developers. The actual Levitt built development sprawls over three other postal zones, Wantagh NY (11793) and Westbury, NY (11590) in the Town of Hempstead, and Hicksville, NY (11801) in the Town of Oyster Bay.

=== Climate ===
Levittown has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) and average monthly temperatures in the central CDP in the vicinity of Hempstead Turnpike (NY 24) and Jerusalem Avenue range from in January to in July. The hardiness zone is borderline between 7a and 7b, meaning that the average annual absolute minimum temperature is approximately .

== Education ==
Levittown is served primarily by two public school districts, the Island Trees Union Free School District with approximately 2,574 students and the Levittown Union Free School District with approximately 7,380 students. A small portion of the northwest corner of the hamlet is served by the East Meadow Union Free School District.
The Island Trees Union Free School District serves northeastern Levittown, and portions of Bethpage, Seaford and Plainedge. The district hosts Island Trees High School, Island Trees Memorial Middle School, Michael F. Stokes Elementary School, and J. Fred Sparke Elementary School.

In 1982, Island Trees gained national attention from the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Board of Education v. Pico&quot;. The case determined that students&#x27; first amendment rights were violated when the school board removed several books it found objectionable from the high school&#x27;s library.

The Levittown Union Free School District, which also serves North Wantagh and the northern portion of Seaford, has two high schools: Division Avenue and General Douglas MacArthur, one career and technical institute: Gerald R. Claps Career &amp; Technical Center, two middle schools: Wisdom Lane and Jonas Salk, and six elementary schools: Abbey Lane, East Broadway, Gardiners Avenue, Lee Road, Northside, and Summit Lane. The Levittown School District dates back to the 19th century, originally called the Jerusalem School District of the Town of Hempstead.

Private schools include the Maria Montessori School, The Progressive School of Long Island, and the South Shore Christian Elementary and Secondary School located in the former Geneva M Gallow Elementary School building. Vocational schools available are the Brittany Beauty School, Hunter Business School, and the New York Chiropractic College.

A review in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;We don&#x27;t typically quibble with Leo Tolstoy, but are unhappy families really so different? Or are they rather like the endless rows of postwar homes that William Levitt built on Long Island?&quot; In July 2009 a to-scale reproduction of an original Levitt house was constructed at the Theatre at Saint Clement&#x27;s in New York City for a revival of the play. The set was designed by Michele Spadaro. Steven McElroy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an article in the Sunday Arts and Leisure section, &quot;That Family Room?

<text>Lido Beach is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, United States. Located on the Long Beach Barrier Island, it is a suburb of the City of Long Beach, and is in the immediate metropolitan area. The population was 2,719 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Lido Beach was developed by William H. Reynolds, in the early 1900s. The 39-year-old former state senator and real estate developer had already developed four Brooklyn neighborhoods (Bedford-Stuyvesant, Borough Park, Bensonhurst, and South Brownsville), as well as Coney Island&#x27;s Dreamland, the world&#x27;s largest amusement park. Reynolds also owned a theater and produced plays.

Beginning in 1906, he gathered investors and acquired the oceanfront from private owners and the rest of Long Beach island from the Town of Hempstead. He planned to build a boardwalk, homes, and hotels, and dredged Reynolds Channel to create the Long Beach, New York resort area. The dredging made the island more accessible to leisure boating.

The Lido Beach community was named after Venice Lido in Italy; &quot;lido&quot; means beach in Italian. In 1929, after Reynolds was defeated for re-election as the Long Beach mayor, he turned his attention to the unincorporated area just east of the city and constructed the Moorish-style Lido Beach Hotel.

<text>Locust Valley is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 3,406 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The rolling hills of the North Shore of Long Island were laid down as terminal moraines by the receding glaciers of the last ice age roughly 10,000 years ago. The Algonquian tribe that settled the area, spanning from Flushing to Setauket, called the area &quot;hilly ground&quot; or Matinecock and as a result the Algonquian Indians who settled there became known as the Matinecock Indians.

In 1667, Captain John Underhill negotiated with the Matinecock Indians to purchase land for a settlement that he and his fellow colonists would call Buckram. The town name lasted for nearly 200 years, until in 1856 the name was changed to Locust Valley based on the number of locust trees located in the area.

On April 19, 1869, the Long Island Rail Road opened the extension of the Glen Cove line, via a single track to Locust Valley, making it the terminus of the line until the railroad was extended to its current terminus in Oyster Bay in 1889.

With the arrival of the Long Island Rail Road, a commercial center developed and thrived around the Locust Valley station and the nearby intersection of Forest Ave/Buckram Road and Birch Hill Road. As the North Shore of Long Island grew into the Gold Coast in the early 20th century, the commercial center grew to serve the great estates that were being established in the surrounding communities of Bayville, Centre Island, Lattingtown, Mill Neck, Matinecock, Muttontown and The Brookvilles.

By 1927, the wealthy Harrison Williams had established himself at his Delano &amp; Aldrich designed estate &quot;Oak Point&quot; at Bayville, on nearby Pine Island. Weekend guests (which several times included Scott Fitzgerald, the Prince of Wales, Cecil Beaton &amp; Winston Churchill) arriving at the Locust Valley Station were often fetched in one of his fleet of Rolls-Royce motorcars which would stop in the hamlet for last-moment provisions. At that time, Williams, a Wall Street tycoon, was considered the wealthiest American, and John Kenneth Galbraith wrote, in his book about the great depression, of Williams&#x27; pyramiding of utilities holding companies, &quot;If there must be madness something may be said for having it on a heroic scale&quot;.

In the 1940s and 50s, Locust Valley was the country home of Robert A. Lovett, a partner (with Prescott Bush) in Brown Brothers Harriman Bank on Wall Street and a former United States Secretary of Defense; Elizabeth Shoumatoff, renowned portrait painter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and other local luminaries; and finally, Leonard Hall, The National Chairman of the Republican Party. The hamlet was also a regular stop for rest and relaxation for Edward VIII and Cole Porter.

As the commercial center, with the railroad station for the surrounding Gold Coast communities, the geographically small Locust Valley became the name of reference for all surrounding areas between Glen Cove and Oyster Bay. This larger community, which now constitutes the Locust Valley School service area, was associated with the upper-class accent prevalent on the great estates: &quot;Locust Valley Lockjaw.&quot; While the accent is not heard as much as it once was, Locust Valley remains a social center for upper-class New Yorkers. Many are members of the exclusive clubs in the area: Piping Rock Club, The Creek, Beaver Dam and the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club.

Figures ranging from the Duke of Windsor to Franklin D. Roosevelt have spent considerable time in Locust Valley.

The Locust Valley Central School System is a K–12 public system which serves a large geographic area covering the Incorporated Villages of Lattingtown, Matinecock, Bayville, portions of Mill Neck, Muttontown, Brookville, and unincorporated Locust Valley. There are four school campuses which include Ann MacArthur Primary, Locust Valley Intermediate, Bayville Primary &amp; Intermediate, and a shared Middle School-Upper School at Lattingtown.
In May 2012, three major national publications, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, ranked the high schools in the United States. All of these identified Locust Valley High School as being one of the best high schools in the country. The rankings are as follows: &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Locust Valley High School #2 on Long Island; #6 in New York State; and #55 in the nation. &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Locust Valley High School #4 on Long Island; #20 in New York State; and #99 in the United States. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked Locust Valley High School #5 on Long Island; #11 in New York State; and #144 in the United States. 
Each publication uses different criteria in the selection process. The following are many of the college-readiness indicators that are used: graduation rates, college acceptance rates, the number of International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) tests taken per student, the average score on IB and AP tests; student achievement levels; SAT scores; and State assessments.

In 2004, LVCSD began offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB). In 2006, it had the first graduating class with IB Diploma recipients. In 2008, after an extensive national search the District appointed its current Superintendent Dr. Anna Hunderfund beginning July 1. Based on reported 2009-2010 IB/AP test participation data, Locust Valley High School is ranked 55th nationally, 10th in the northeast, and second on Long Island (behind Jericho) Magazine May 2012&quot;.This ranking being out of some 27,000 public high schools nationally.

In 2011, John Benstock, a music teacher with the Locust Valley School District since 2000, was arrested and in 2013 he pled guilty to inappropriate contact with students at two Locust Valley elementary schools, after being charged with four counts of sex abuse and 10 counts of endangerment. The School District sued Benstock under a &quot;faithless servant&quot; theory, to claw back all compensation Benstock had earned during the period of time in which he allegedly engaged in criminal conduct.

The high school newspaper &quot;The Spectrum&quot; has won the Columbia Scholastic Press Association&#x27;s and the Empire State Scholastic Press Association&#x27;s Gold Award for excellence in student journalism. Each year the school awards the Patrick J. Goostrey Award to the graduating senior most outstanding in American history and student leadership.

<text>Long Beach is an oceanfront city in Nassau County, New York, United States. It takes up a central section of the Long Beach Barrier Island, which is the westernmost of the outer barrier islands off Long Island&#x27;s South Shore. As of the 2020 Census, the city&#x27;s population was 35,029. 

The City of Long Beach was incorporated in 1922, and is nicknamed &quot;The City by the Sea&quot; (the Latin form, &quot;Civitas ad mare&quot;, is the city&#x27;s motto). The Long Beach Barrier Island is surrounded by Reynolds Channel to the north, east and west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

In 2022, Long Beach was named one of the best East Coast towns for a summer getaway by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine.

==History==
=== Pre-settlement ===
The city of Long Beach&#x27;s first inhabitants were the Algonquian-speaking Lenape, who sold the area to English colonists in 1643. From that time, while the barrier island was used by baymen and farmers for fishing and harvesting salt hay, no one lived there year-round for more than two centuries. The bark &quot;Mexico&quot;, carrying Irish immigrants to New York, ran ashore on New Year&#x27;s Day.

Austin Corbin, a builder from Brooklyn, was the first to attempt to develop the island as a resort. He formed a partnership with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to finance the New York and Long Beach Railroad Co., which laid track from Lynbrook to Long Beach in 1880. That same year, Corbin opened Long Beach Hotel, a row of 27 cottages along a strip of beach, which he claimed was the world&#x27;s largest hotel. In its first season, the railroad brought 300,000 visitors to Long Island. By the next spring, tracks had been laid the length of the island, but they were removed in 1894 after repeated washouts from winter storms.


===20th century===
In 1906, William H. Reynolds, a 39-year-old real estate developer and former state senator, became involved in the area. Reynolds had already developed four Brooklyn neighborhoods (Bedford–Stuyvesant, Borough Park, Bensonhurst, and South Brownsville), as well as Coney Island&#x27;s Dreamland, the world&#x27;s largest amusement park at the time. Reynolds also owned a theatre and produced plays.

He gathered investors, and acquired the oceanfront from private owners and the rest of the island from the Town of Hempstead in 1907; he planned to build a boardwalk, homes, and hotels. Reynolds had a herd of elephants marched in from Dreamland, ostensibly to help build the Long Beach Boardwalk; he had created an effective publicity stunt. Dredges created a channel wide on the north side of the island to provide access by large steamboats and seaplanes to transport more visitors; the new waterway was named Reynolds Channel. To ensure that Long Beach lived up to his billing it &quot;The Riviera of the East&quot;, he required each building to be constructed in an &quot;eclectic Mediterranean style&quot;, with white stucco walls and red-clay tile roofs. He built a theatre called Castles by the Sea, with the largest dance floor in the world, for dancers Vernon and Irene Castle.

After Reynolds&#x27; corporation went bankrupt in 1918, the restrictions were lifted. The new town attracted wealthy business people and entertainers from New York and Hollywood.

On July 29, 1907, a fire broke out at the Long Beach Hotel and burned it to the ground. Of the 800 guests, eight were injured by jumping from windows, and one woman died. The fire was blamed on defective electric wiring. A church, several cottages, and the bathing pavilion were also destroyed. Trunks belonging to the guests, which had been piled on the sand to form &quot;dressing rooms&quot;, were looted by thieves. A dozen waiters and others were apprehended by the police, who recovered $20,000 worth of jewelry and other stolen property.

The community became an incorporated village in 1913 and a city in 1922.

In 1923, the prohibition agents known simply as Izzy and Moe raided the Nassau Hotel and arrested three men for bootlegging. In 1930, five Long Beach Police officers were charged with offering a bribe to a United States Coast Guard officer to allow liquor to be landed. The police had another problem a year later in the summer of 1931, when a beachcomber found the body of a young woman named Starr Faithfull, who had drowned. She had left behind a suicide note, but others believed she had been murdered, and the circumstances of her death were never resolved. Corruption became rampant in Long Beach by then; in 1922, the state Legislature designated Long Beach a city, and William H. Reynolds was elected the first mayor. Soon afterward, Reynolds was indicted on charges of misappropriating funds. When he was found guilty, the clock in the tower at city hall was stopped in protest. When a judge released Reynolds from jail later that year on appeal, almost the entire population turned out to greet him, and the clock was turned back on.

On November 15, 1939, Mayor Louis F. Edwards was fatally shot by a police officer in front of his home. Officer Alvin Dooley, a member of the police motorcycle squad and the mayor&#x27;s own security detail, killed Edwards after losing his bid for PBA president to a candidate the mayor supported. Jackson Boulevard was later renamed Edwards Boulevard in honor of the late mayor. After the murder, the city residents passed legislation to adopt a city manager system, which still exists to this day. The city manager is hired by and reports to the City Council.

In the 1940s, José Ferrer, Zero Mostel, Mae West, and other famous actors performed at local theaters. John Barrymore, Humphrey Bogart, Clara Bow, James Cagney, Cab Calloway, Jack Dempsey, Lillian Roth, Rudolph Valentino, and Florenz Ziegfeld lived in Long Beach for decades.

By the 1940s and 1950s, with the advent of cheap air travel attracting tourists to more distant places, and air-conditioning to provide year-round comfort, Long Beach had become primarily a bedroom community for commuters to New York City. It still attracted many summer visitors into the 1970s. The rundown boardwalk hotels were used for temporary housing for welfare recipients and the elderly until a scandal around 1970 led to many of the homes losing their licenses. At that time, government agencies were also &quot;warehousing&quot; in such hotels many patients released from larger mental hospitals. They were supposed to be cared for in small-scale community centers. The boardwalk had a small amusement park at the foot of Edwards Boulevard until the 1980s. In the late 1960s, the boardwalk and amusement park area was a magnet for youth from around Long Island, until a police crackdown on drug trafficking ended that. A few businesses remained on the boardwalk, attracting bicyclists, joggers, walkers, and people-watchers.

Beginning in the 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, Long Beach began an urban renewal, with new housing, new businesses, and other improvements. Today, the city is again a popular bedroom community, for people working in New York who want the quiet beach atmosphere. With summer come local youths and college students and young adults who rent bungalows on the West End; they frequent the local bars and clubs along West Beech Street. Just behind the boardwalk near the center of the city, however, vacant lots now occupy several blocks that once housed hotels, bathhouses, and the amusement park. Because attempts to attract development (including, at one time, Atlantic City-style casinos) to this potential &quot;superblock&quot; have not yet borne fruit, the lots constitute the city&#x27;s largest portion of unused land.

===21st century===
On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck Long Beach. As a result of flooding, hundreds of vehicles were destroyed and houses suffered various levels of damage. The estimated cost of all the damage was over $250 million. The city was without power and running water for two weeks after the storm. The boardwalk was also destroyed during the storm. The city began rebuilding the boardwalk with grants from FEMA and the State of New York. The first two-block section of the new Long Beach boardwalk reopened on July 26, 2013, and the entire boardwalk opened on October 25, 2013. The final costs of rebuilding the boardwalk were $44 million, of which ca. $39 million were FEMA grants and the final $4.4 million were reimbursed by the state.

The city is less than wide from ocean to bay and about long. The city is divided into the West End, home to many small bungalow and some large houses, and the East End. West of New York Avenue, the barrier island is less than wide and West Beech Street is the main east/west commercial street.

East of New York Avenue, the island is wider between the bay and ocean and is home to larger more expansive family houses.
